"AGRIS:US201600013603";"Mapping and spatial characterization of Argentine High Andean peatbogs";"";"Peatbogs are the most productive and biodiversity rich ecosystems of high dry Puna region, and provide essential ecosystems services to local inhabitants. Despite their ecological and economic importance, the geographic patterns and distribution of peatbogs as well the dynamic of this system are barely known. In this work we (1) identified and mapped subtropical Argentine High Andean peatbogs based in a supervised classification of Landsat images, and a posteriori spatial processing to define functional units; (2) used such classification to characterize the whole Argentina Puna region (14.3 million hectares) in terms of their geographic patterns of peatbogs; and (3) characterized the region’s sub-watersheds according to their peatbogs density and geographic characteristics. The post-process map reports a total area of peatbogs of 94427.55 ha (0.66 % of total study area) with 10,428 polygons. The majority of peatbogs are small or median (i.e., 21.8 % of total area included <10 ha, while 24.5 % of total area are peatbogs from 10 to 50 ha), but only two peatbogs with >10,000 ha represent 18 % of total area. Peatbogs density is spatially heterogeneous, with much higher density in the north and central east of the study area. Sub-watershed can be grouped into six main groups according to the percentage of peatbogs cover, mean size of peatbogs and altitude. The combination of basic information, such as map of peatbogs cover with spatial patterns characterization, is a priority input for the conservation planning of this extensive and valuable ecosystem, and to ongoing land use planning initiatives.";"Izquierdo, Andrea E.

"AGRIS:US201600088882";"Effects of seasonal variation and land cover on riparian denitrification along a mid-sized river";"";"Urban areas contribute disproportional nitrogen (N) loads to downstream aquatic ecosystems resulting in potential hypoxic ‘dead’ zones. Riparian areas along streams and rivers reduce inorganic N concentrations through denitrification, an anaerobic microbial process. Our study objective was to investigate the denitrification potential of riparian areas with differing land cover composition along the Licking River in Kentucky, USA – a tributary of the Ohio River. For one year we collected monthly samples from four sites along a 60 km reach of the Licking River. We experienced substantial drought conditions in the first half of our study period followed by record precipitation and flooding in the second half of our study period. Land cover surrounding the sample sites was classified into distinct classes hypothesized to contribute to N loads. We found flooding increased denitrification potential, water nitrate concentration, and soil organic matter, while drought conditions increased soil ammonium concentrations. Our site with the greatest impervious surface had the highest denitrification potential, and soil and water ammonium concentrations. However, we determined that denitrification potential was mostly driven by soil organic matter content and only slightly by soil nitrate among all study sites. Our data demonstrate that riparian zones of mid-sized rivers in urban areas can be integral in removing excess N during flood events and can do so year-round provided sufficient N and carbon resources are present.";"Hopfensperger, Kristine N.

"AGRIS:US201600088881";"Influence of catchment land cover on stoichiometry and stable isotope compositions of basal resources and macroinvertebrate consumers in headwater streams";"";"Anthropogenic land use affects aquatic landscapes. For example, landscape-level conversion to urban or agricultural land can heavily influence nutrient cycles in headwater streams via increased nutrient loading and altered hydrologic patterns. Recent studies in headwater streams have found that the stoichiometry and stable isotope compositions of basal resources and consumers can vary as a result of landscape-level change. To this end, we examined the stoichiometry and stable isotope compositions (δ ¹³C and δ ¹⁵N) of headwater stream flora and fauna in 16 streams located within forested, agricultural, urban, and mixed (urban, forested, and agricultural) catchments. Our results suggest basal resource stoichiometry varied across streams, with leaf litter being the most variable basal resource. Macroinvertebrate consumers maintained stoichiometric homeostasis across stream groups, but consumer stoichiometry differed across families. Values of δ ¹³C did not vary across stream groups for basal resources; however, consumer δ ¹³C did. Although δ ¹⁵N did not differ among basal resources across stream groups, macroinvertebrate consumer δ ¹⁵N differed because of the interaction between stream group and family. Our results show catchment land cover did not predictably alter the stoichiometry or stable isotope compositions of basal resources or consumers in headwater streams. The quality of basal resources in headwater streams could differ across catchments with varying land cover, but it is evident that differences in stoichiometry of basal resources did not lead to differences in stoichiometry of consumers in our study. Given the variability of stable isotope compositions, additional effort should be made to improve our understanding of the landscape factors that might influence isotopic data.";"Milanovich, Joseph R.

"AGRIS:US201600191241";"Assessing ecological integrity: A multi-scale structural and functional approach using Structural Equation Modeling";"";"Facing increasing levels of ecosystem degradation, scientists and practitioners aim to preserve ecological integrity â to maintain structures and functions expected of ecosystems in a region. This requires an understanding of the relationship between structural components and functional integrity. In this paper we focused on the study forests of the Credit River Watershed (Southern Ontario, Canada). For this ecosystem we consider one of the major contributors to functional integrity: habitat functions which are defined as the capacity of the ecosystem to provide refuge and reproduction habitat to wild species of plants and animals. We define these âhabitat functionsâ as a latent variable in Structural Equation Modeling, which allows us to examine its relationship with a number of candidate indicators. We first determined two community-level structural indicators to represent the latent variable: native plant cover and forest bird abundance. We then found underlying causal relationships between multi-scale structural components of the ecosystem and the provision of habitat functions. Three variables at the local scale explain native plant cover â soil nitrogen, soil organic matter, and soil pH. A significant landscape-level variable, patch area, explained native plant cover. Percent natural land cover in a 500m radius explained forest bird abundance. From a theoretical point of view, this modeling technique allows us to explore complex and simultaneous interactions between structures and functions of ecosystems. As for its practical applications, it can be used to improve ecological integrity monitoring programs by contributing to the selection of meaningful indicators.";"Capmourteres, Virginia

Would the set include a cornfield? A forest? A backyard? Combining principles of landscape ecology and computer science, we identified a small set of âexemplar landscapesâ, representing distinct LU/LC pattern types of the conterminous US. We first partitioned the 1992 US National Land Cover Dataset into 193 705 landscapes, and quantified patterns with standard measures of LU/LC composition and configuration. Using the values to estimate similarity of LU/LC patterns between landscapes, we applied an algorithm developed to find representatives in large sets. In the resulting 17âmember set of exemplar landscapes, patterns created and managed by human activity are by far the most evident features. This set of representatives summarizes the nation's LU/LC, demonstrating the degree to which humanâinfluenced patterns dominate: aggregations of rectangular fields, farmlands within cleared forests, shrublands/pasture, and suburbs. The algorithm's selection of an exemplar for each group may have other ecological applications when an objectively determined subset of representative items is needed.";"Cardille, Jeffrey A

Understanding how microbial communities respond to changes in vegetation is critical for improving predictions of how land‐cover change affects belowground carbon storage and nutrient availability. We measured intra‐ and interannual variability in soil and forest litter microbial community composition and activity via phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity across a well‐replicated, long‐term chronosequence of secondary forests growing on abandoned pastures in the wet subtropical forest life zone of Puerto Rico. Microbial community PLFA structure differed between young secondary forests and older secondary and primary forests, following successional shifts in tree species composition. These successional patterns held across seasons, but the microbial groups driving these patterns differed over time. Microbial community composition from the forest litter differed greatly from those in the soil, but did not show the same successional trends. Extracellular enzyme activity did not differ with forest succession, but varied by season with greater rates of potential activity in the dry seasons. We found few robust significant relationships among microbial community parameters and soil pH, moisture, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations. Observed inter‐ and intrannual variability in microbial community structure and activity reveal the importance of a multiple, temporal sampling strategy when investigating microbial community dynamics with land‐use change. Successional control over microbial composition with forest recovery suggests strong links between above and belowground communities.";"Smith, A. Peyton

A rapidly increasing pace of logging compels us to ask why tribal communities prefer logging to conservation. In the absence of feasible development opportunities, remote communities become quickly enthusiastic about conservation projects, but once an area is opened up to logging few such projects survive. Direct payments to forest owners to cover the costs of missed opportunities for economic development are advocated here to make conservation competitive. A conservation royalty scheme would deliver a higher proportion of the conservation funds to the resource owners than the management-intensive community development projects currently favored. Such an approach requires a profound cultural change within conservation organizations from a 'development aid' approach to one more oriented toward business.";"Novotny, Vojtech";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"land rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301886132";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00658.x";"";"";"";"546-549"

"AGRIS:US201500209094";"Probability maps of landslide reactivation derived from tree-ring records: Pra Bellon landslide, southern French Alps";"";"Probability maps of landslide reactivation are presented for the Pra Bellon landslide located in the southern French Alps based on results obtained with dendrogeomorphic analysis. Spatiotemporal patterns of past landslide activity was derived from tree-ring series of 403 disturbed mountain pine trees growing in the landslide body. In total, 704 growth disturbances were identified in the samples indicating 22 reactivation phases of the landslide body between 1910 and 2011. The mean return period was 4.5years. Given the spatiotemporal completeness of the reconstruction, probabilities of landslide reactivation were computed and illustrated using a Poisson distribution model and for 5, 20, 50, and 100years. Probability of landslide reactivation is highest in the central part of the landslide body and increases from 0.13 for a 5-year period to 0.94 for a 100-year period. Conversely, probabilities of reactivation are lower at its margins. The proposed method differs from conventional approaches based on statistical analyses or physical modeling that have demonstrated to have limitations in the prediction of spatiotemporal reactivation of landslides. Our approach is, in contrast, based on extensive data on past landslides and therefore allowed determination of quantitative probability maps of reactivation derived directly from the frequency of past events. This approach is considered a valuable tool for land managers in charge of protecting and forecasting people and their assets from the negative effects of landslides as well as for those responsible for land use planning and management. It demonstrates the reliability of dendrogeomorphic mapping that should be used systematically in forested shallow landslides.";"Lopez Saez, Jérôme

"AGRIS:US2016222248";"Agricultural Land Fragmentation and Land Consolidation Rationality";"";"Adopted about one year after the 1989 Revolution, Land Law (Law 18/1991) represented the starting point of land reform in Romania. As a result of this law implementation, at the beginning of the year 2000 the private sector owned 84% of total agricultural land: 82% of arable land, 74% of land under vineyards, 67% of land under orchards and 87% of land under meadows and pastures.  Besides the benefic social and economic effects, the mutations produced represent a distortion source in the rural area, determining the following, among others: a) crisis of ownership relations - a main aspect of this being the confusion concerning the ownership rights. The prolongation of clearing up these rights represents a major obstacle to a good operation of land market, to agricultural land consolidation implicitly; b) managerialcrisis, manifested by the lack of competitive behaviour, which gives an increased importance to the production function, to the detriment of commercial function; this results in the increased share of small-sized subsistence farms (households), lack of strategic orientations, etc; c) land market crisis - occurred in the context of the lack of legal and institutional framework concerning the land market operation (credits in advantageous conditions for buying land through the banking system or by establishing specialised banks, solving up the problems in connection to using land as collateral for obtaining credits, mortgage credit stimulation); d) crisis of agricultural economic efficiency - mainly generated by land property excessive fragmentation, large area (about 55%) owned by old persons or by persons not having their domicile in the rural area, lack of main production factors combination, limited circulation of land capital, lack of an adequate legal and institutional framework, etc.An analysis of the concrete, social and economic situation of land fragmentation and of agricultural land consolidation opportunity was conducted in the commune Balaciu; this commune is located in the plain area, with a population of 3540 inhabitants and a total area of 8462 ha.In order to identify the rural social actors which can favour land consolidation by their structure, behaviour and functionality, the following typology of rural households has been used as methodology: agriculturalhouseholds (consisting of persons working only in agriculture); pluriactive households (consisting of persons involved in both agricultural and non-agricultural activities); non-active households (consisting of non-active persons); non-agricultural households (only persons working in other non-agricultural activities).The survey revealed that the main entities which can become the social actors of rural/agricultural modernisation, of land consolidation implicitly are the pluriactive and non-agricultural households.In order to consolidate the agricultural land, there is an obvious and imperative need to conceive a well articulated and coherent framework of support measures, understood and treated as a complex of economic, social, legal and technical measures, aiming at rural community development.";"Rusu, Marioara";"";"";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"ROU";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016222248";"http://purl.umn.edu/6999";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201600197269";"Variation in the local population dynamics of the shortâlived Opuntia macrorhiza (Cactaceae)";"";"Spatiotemporal variation in demographic rates can have profound effects for population persistence, especially for dispersalâlimited species living in fragmented landscapes. Longâterm studies of plants in such habitats help with understanding the impacts of fragmentation on population persistence but such studies are rare. In this work, we reanalyzed demographic data from seven years of the shortâlived cactus Opuntia macrorhiza var. macrorhiza at five plots in Boulder, Colorado. Previous work combining data from all years and all plots predicted a stable population (deterministic logÎ» â 0). This approach assumed that all five plots were part of a single population. Since the plots were located in a suburbanâagricultural interface separated by highways, grazing lands, and other barriers, and O. macrorhiza is likely dispersal limited, we analyzed the dynamics of each plot separately using stochastic matrix models assuming each plot represented a separate population. We found that the stochastic population growth rate logÎ»S varied widely between populations (logÎ»S = 0.1497, 0.0774, â0.0230, â0.2576, â0.4989). The three populations with the highest growth rates were located close together in space, while the two most isolated populations had the lowest growth rates suggesting that dispersal between populations is critical for the population viability of O. macrorhiza. With one exception, both our prospective (stochastic elasticity) and retrospective (stochastic life table response experiments) analysis suggested that means of stasis and growth, especially of smaller plants, were most important for population growth rate. This is surprising because recruitment is typically the most important vital rate in a shortâlived species such as O. macrorhiza. We found that elasticity to the variance was mostly negligible, suggesting that O. macrorhiza populations are buffered against large temporal variation. Finally, singleâyear elasticities to means of transitions to the smallest stage (mostly due to reproduction) and growth differed considerably from their longâterm elasticities. It is important to be aware of this difference when using models to predict the effect of manipulating plant vital rates within the time frame of typical plant demographic studies.";"Haridas, C. V.

"AGRIS:US201500125538";"Renewable energy in Kenya: Resource potential and status of exploitation";"";"This paper presents an assessment of renewable energy resource potential and the current status of exploitation in Kenya. As an importer of petroleum fuels, Kenya spends a substantial amount of foreign reserves to import oil. The oil import bill in 2008 consumed 55% of the country's foreign exchange earnings from exports. On the other hand, there is a high dependence on wood biomass energy, leading to an imbalance in its supply and demand. This has exerted considerable pressure on the remaining forest and vegetation stocks, thereby accelerating the processes of land degradation. Moreover, despite the abundance of potential and a strong growth in demand for electricity, the country faces constraints in satisfying electricity demand. At the national level, only 18% of the households have access to grid electricity. The access is much lower in rural areas where only 4% of the households have grid electricity. Kenya has a liberalized energy sector and has made significant progress in the recent past in formulation of renewable energy policies. What is more, Kenya's electricity power mix is among the most sustainable in the world, with 80% of electricity coming from renewable sources. However, a substantial proportion of renewable energy resources are unexploited. Of the potential renewable sources, Kenya has harnessed only about 30% of its hydropower sources, approximately 4% of the potential geothermal resources and much smaller proportions of proven wind and solar power potentials. Furthermore, a large potential exists for the development of biomass based energy such as biogas, biodiesel and power generation form baggasse. The strong growth in energy demand provides excellent opportunities for private investors to invest in renewable energy power generation.";"Kiplagat, J.K.

"AGRIS:US201500205421";"Optimizing landfill site selection by using land classification maps";"";"Municipal solid waste disposal is a major environmental concern throughout the world. Proper landfill siting involves many environmental, economic, technical, and sociocultural challenges. In this study, a new quantitative method for landfill siting that reduces the number of evaluation criteria, simplifies siting procedures, and enhances the utility of available land evaluation maps was proposed. The method is demonstrated by selecting a suitable landfill site near the city of Marvdasht in Iran. The approach involves two separate stages. First, necessary criteria for preliminary landfill siting using four constraints and eight factors were obtained from a land classification map initially prepared for irrigation purposes. Thereafter, the criteria were standardized using a rating approach and then weighted to obtain a suitability map for landfill siting, with ratings in a 0–1 domain and divided into five suitability classes. Results were almost identical to those obtained with a more traditional environmental landfill siting approach. Because of far fewer evaluation criteria, the proposed weighting method was much easier to implement while producing a more convincing database for landfill siting. The classification map also considered land productivity. In the second stage, the six best alternative sites were evaluated for final landfill siting using four additional criteria. Sensitivity analyses were furthermore conducted to assess the stability of the obtained ranking. Results indicate that the method provides a precise siting procedure that should convince all pertinent stakeholders.";"Eskandari, M.

"AGRIS:US201300935695";"decision tool for allocating the waters of the Jordan River basin between all riparian parties";"";"Shared water resources are strong sources of conflict in the Jordan River basin shared by Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon. The control and allocation of water has been explicitly made a part of the ongoing peace negotiations. This article calls for the application of international water law in the resolution of water disputes in the negotiating process. The challenging task for negotiators is to translate water law principles into operating rules and procedures for the equitable apportionment of waters from shared water resources. The negotiators need a decision tool based upon objective criteria or standards to reach equitable entitlements to shared water resources by all parties. This paper introduces a multi-criteria decision tool as a possible approach to the problem of allocating the waters of the Jordan River between all riparian parties. The prime principle of the criteria is equitable allocation factors identified by water law. A general mathematical model was derived in which the proportional entitlements of the Jordan River basin waters were determined to the five riparians. It is hoped that, water negotiators review this approach.";"Mimi, Z.A.

The aim is to generate relevant, accurate and timely data that would enhance the quality of decisions and actions in an attempt to ensure the survival, expansion and the sustainability of urban agricultural land use. A geospatial information system approach was adopted in the mapping and assessment of urban agricultural land use change in the study area Topographic map of Jos-Bukuru urban at the scale of 1:50000, Landsat TM image of 1986 and 2002 with spatial resolution of 30m, among others. Data conversion, digitizing, editing, analysis was carried out using ILWIS 3.2 and Arc-View 3.2 software. The study reveals among others that agricultural land use increased substantially between 1961 and 1986. However, between 1986 and 2002, about 63% of agricultural land was lost. Out of this, about 68% was lost to urban development. The percentage increase in urban in urban expansion was 3.5% from 1961 to 1986 and 3.8% from 1986 to 2002. While the percentage in urban agricultural land use between 1986 and 2002 was 3.9%. Overall, while urban spatial expansion is increasing agricultural land use is decreasing. The study recommends among others that urban agricultural land use should be made a legitimate in urban expansion planning; specific agricultural practices should be zoned to specific locations within the city; and, that urban farming should be incorporated into the poverty alleviation programme of the Federal government";"Omomoh, E.

Examples are the Conservation Reserve Program (US) and Environmental Stewardship Scheme (UK). An important limitation of these auctions as implemented to date is that there is no explicit consideration of the spatial pattern of participation in the evaluation of bids. In this study we present the structure of a simple auction – the Agglomeration Vickrey Auction that implements a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. The auction is designed to attain conservation goals through specific spatial patterns of land management while minimizing the total budgetary cost. We present the theoretical structure of the AVA and provide simple numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the mechanism.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

As a result, the management of wildfires and fire effects on public lands will continue to be a major land management priority for the foreseeable future. Following fire suppression, the first land management process to occur on burned public lands is the rapid assessment and emergency treatment recommendations provided by the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team. These teams of specialists follow a dynamic protocol to make post-fire treatment decisions based on the best available information using a range of landscape assessment, predictive modeling, and informational tools in combination with their collective professional expertise. Because the mission of a BAER team is to assess burned landscape and determine if stabilization treatments are needed to protect valued resources from the immediate fire effects, the evaluation of treatment success generally does not include important longer term ecological effects of these treatments or the fates of the materials applied over the burned landscape. New tools and techniques that have been designed or modified for BAER team use are presented in conjunction with current post-fire treatment effectiveness monitoring and research. In addition, a case is made to monitor longer term treatment effects on recovering ecosystems and to make these findings available to BAER teams.";"Robichaud, Peter R.

Although various conservation methods are widely utilized to reduce soil erosion and to sustain agricultural production, the cost‐effectiveness and selection of these methods are less known. Using our survey and ecological data, this study evaluated four soil and water conservation methods in Changting County, Southeast China. The results show that the disparity of conservation costs is much larger than that of ecological benefits. Planting fruit trees is a kind of conservation through primarily economic development. Closing hillsides for afforestation is most cost‐effective, followed by forest fertilizing, and planting trees and grass. Our findings suggest that comparatively lower cost conservation methods, for example closing hillsides for afforestation, should be considered in priority if initial ecological conditions can meet the requirements of the method.

"AGRIS:US201600029179";"Winter Bird Habitat Use in a Heterogeneous Tallgrass Prairie";"";"In the Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma, U.S.A., grazing land is managed predominantly to promote homogeneous grassland structure. This potentially limits the diversity of habitats for grassland obligate songbirds with narrow habitat preferences during the breeding season, prompting ecologists and conservationists to call for managing rangelands for increased heterogeneity. The Flint Hills also hosts multiple species of conservation concern during winter, but avian habitat requirements are less well known during this period and seldom considered in management recommendations. We investigated the influence of vegetation structure on occurrence of songbirds overwintering at The Nature Conservancy's Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma, where fire and grazing are used to increase structural and compositional heterogeneity. During the winters of 2008–2009 and 2009–2010, we used an area-search method to survey 149, 1 ha plots distributed among patches that represented a wide gradient in vegetation structure and 1–3 growing seasons since fire. We modeled occurrence of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) with a combination of fine-scale vegetation (e.g., litter depth in sampling plots), landscape-scale factors (e.g., distance to utility poles), and time since fire. Vegetation height was the most consistent predictor for three species, with Le Conte's Sparrow and Sedge Wren associated with tall structure and Smith's Longspur associated with shorter structure. Occurrence of Smith's Longspur was too low to adequately model effects of burn age, but fine-scale vegetation structure used by Le Conte's Sparrow and Sedge Wren was available in plots irrespective of time since fire. A variety of management techniques for creating habitat heterogeneity have the potential to promote grassland songbird diversity during winter, but further study is needed.";"Monroe, Adrian P

The process is managed by the Northern Territory government agency responsible for water planning, the Department of Natural Resources, Environment, The Arts and Sport, in partnership with the Tiwi Land Council, the principal representative body for Tiwi Islanders on matters of land and water management and governance. Participatory planning methods (‘tools’) were developed to facilitate community participation in Tiwi water planning. The tools, selected for their potential to generate involvement in the planning process needed both to incorporate Indigenous knowledge of water use and management and raise awareness in the Indigenous community of Western science and water resources management. In consultation with the water planner and Tiwi Land Council officers, the researchers selected four main tools to develop, trial and evaluate. Results demonstrate that the tools provided mechanisms which acknowledge traditional management systems, improve community engagement, and build confidence in the water planning process. The researchers found that participatory planning approaches supported Tiwi natural resource management institutions both in determining appropriate institutional arrangements and clarifying roles and responsibilities in the Islands’ Water Management Strategy.";"Hoverman, Suzanne

This study investigates how the actual provision of cultural services is distributed across the landscape according to spatially varying relationships. The final aim was to analyse how landscape settings are associated to people's preferences and perceptions related to cultural ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. We demonstrated a spatially explicit method based on geo-tagged images from popular social media to assess revealed preferences. A spatially weighted regression showed that specific variables correspond to prominent drivers of cultural ecosystem services at the local scale. The results of this explanatory approach can be used to integrate the cultural service dimension into land planning by taking into account specific benefiting areas and by setting priorities on the ecosystems and landscape characteristics which affect the service supply. We finally concluded that the use of crowdsourced data allows identifying spatial patterns of cultural ecosystem service preferences and their association with landscape settings.";"Tenerelli, Patrizia

We use a county‐level dataset for the state of Paraná, Brazil, from 2003 to 2007, with 1,995 observations. The panel data structure allows us to control for fixed effects, such as the formalisation of land titles and land concentration, which might be correlated with the intensity of invasions. An instrumental variable fixed effects model was estimated to avoid other sources of bias. Our main finding is that land invasions are associated with lower long‐term crop production and a higher percentage of annual crops, which could accelerate land degradation, and undermine environmental sustainability.";"Orellano, Veronica

An integrated approach utilizing geographic information system and remote sensing was used to analyze land use/land cover change, spatiotemporal patterns of land fragmentation and variation of ESV over the period of 1995–2010. The results show that the areal extent of built-up land increased by 3.72 times, whereas loss of the cropland, forest, and fallow land accounted for 18.52, 34.80, and 28.94 % of the new built-up land, respectively. As observed, in-filling of the major traffic road networks and axis-based expansion of built-up land occurred. Outward expansion of the built-up land, in particular, indicated that human encroachment into surrounding natural and semi-natural ecosystems leading to decreased total ecosystem service functions of the study area. As a whole, significant change in key landscape, especially a net decrease in forest, and remarkable socioeconomic development should be responsible for an overall decline in 36.29 % of total ESV during the recently rapid urbanization process. Therefore, sustainable development policies should address the decline of ESV.";"Qi, Zhi-Fang

First, a parameter sensitivity analysis was performed to assess how changes in the model parameters affect runoff and nutrient export. Next, the model was calibrated and validated using measured runoff and nutrient concentration data. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (E NS) values of the yearly runoff were 0.87 and 0.69 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. For storms runoff events, the E NS values were 0.93 for the calibration period and 0.47 for the validation period. Antecedent precipitation and soil moisture conditions can affect the simulation accuracy of storm event flow. The E NS values for the total nitrogen (TN) export were 0.58 for the calibration period and 0.51 for the validation period. In addition, the correlation coefficients between the observed and simulated TN concentrations were 0.84 for the calibration period and 0.74 for the validation period. For phosphorus export, the E NS values were 0.89 for the calibration period and 0.88 for the validation period. In addition, the correlation coefficients between the observed and simulated orthophosphate concentrations were 0.96 and 0.94 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. The nutrient simulation results are generally satisfactory even though the parameter-lumped HSPF model cannot represent the effects of the spatial pattern of land cover on nutrient export. The model parameters obtained in this study could serve as reference values for applying the model to similar regions. In addition, HSPF can properly describe the characteristics of water quantity and quality processes in this area. After adjustment, calibration, and validation of the parameters, the HSPF model is suitable for hydrological and water-quality simulations in watershed planning and management and for designing best management practices.";"Li, Zhaofu

"AGRIS:US201400107207";"Spectral mixture analysis for bi-sensor wetland mapping using Landsat TM and Terra MODIS data";"";"Spatial and temporal resolution is essential for understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics and dynamics of wetland ecosystems. However, single satellite imagery with both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency is currently unavailable. Instead, the development of a bi-sensor monitoring technique utilizing spatial details of middle-to-high resolution data and temporal details of coarse spatial resolution data is highly desirable. For the initial work on our time-series bi-sensor wetland mapping, the applicability of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) using single-date bi-sensor imagery with different orbiting periods was investigated. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Terra Moderate Resolution Image Spectrometer (MODIS) data were utilized in the Poyang Lake area in China and the Great Salt Lake area in the USA to examine three decisive elements in utilizing MESMA: (1) the method of optimal endmember selection; (2) the threshold between two- and three-endmember models; and (3) the treatment of shade fractions. As a result, we found that (1) the number of spectra for an endmember spectrum similar to other endmember spectra meeting the modelling restrictions of maximum and minimum land-cover fractions and root mean square error (RMSE) within a class (In_CoB), the number of spectra for an endmember spectrum similar to other endmember spectra meeting the modelling restrictions outside of a class (Out_CoB), the ratio of In_CoB to Out_CoB multiplied by the inverse number of spectra within the class (CoBI) and the endmember average RMSE (EAR) were optimal endmember selection methods for the TM maps, whereas CoBI, EAR and minimum average spectral angle (MASA) were optimal endmember selection methods for the MODIS maps; (2) the MODIS maps were more sensitive to change in the two- and three-endmember modelling thresholds than the TM maps; and (3) the addition of shade fractions to dark water fractions were an appropriate shade treatment. This research demonstrated how MESMA can be applied for multi-scale mapping of wetland ecosystems, how the difference in observation dates between the TM and MODIS data affects the agreement in land-cover fractions and how spectral similarity between dark water and shade affects the agreement in land-cover fractions.";"Michishita, Ryo

The paper is based on data from the survey of relevant literature, analysis of policy and legal documents, field observations and a series of stakeholder workshops held in the villages of Mopipi, Mokobaxane and Rakops in Boteti Sub‐District between 2008 and 2009. The study's findings indicate that formal land use and rangeland management institutions have influenced the process of environmental change in the study area, mostly in a negative way. Institutional failure and support to the expansion of the livestock sector have promoted overstocking; arable production support has encouraged land clearance in a drought‐prone and windy area; whereas protectionist wildlife management has been in conflict with, rather than complementary to, traditional uses of the communal rangelands. The environmental outcomes of all this have been the shrinkage of the Boteti commons, overgrazing, deforestation and wind erosion. The study recommends adoption of a community‐based natural resource management strategy, which could simultaneously secure livelihoods and conserve the commons.

"AGRIS:US201301937436";"Influence of land use on organic carbon pool and chemical properties of Vertic Cambisols in central and southern Italy";"";"Land use strongly influences soil properties and unsuitable practices lead to degradation of soil and environmental quality. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different land uses on some chemical properties of soils developed from Pliocene clays, within hilly environments of central and southern Italy. The areas investigated are located in Vicarello di Volterra (Pisa, Tuscany), S. Quirico d'Orcia (Siena, Tuscany) and Soveria Simeri (Catanzaro, Calabria). Within each area different land uses were compared, including a natural ecosystem (Mediterranean bush), a perennial grass or pasture and an intensive crop (wheat, as monoculture or in rotation). The soils were sampled at 0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4m depth and analysed for particle size, pH, bulk density, cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cations, total organic carbon (TOC) and humified carbon (HC) concentrations, organic carbon stock and total N. The stratification ratio of soil organic carbon was calculated to characterize soil organic carbon distribution with depth. At all sites, soil under Mediterranean bush contained the largest amounts of TOC (as both concentration and stock), HC, total N and exchangeable K, together with the highest cation exchange capacity and the lowest pH values. The decrease in soil OC stock with land use change from natural to agricultural ecosystem was 65-85% to 0.1m depth, 55-82% to 0.2m depth and 44-76% to 0.4m depth, with the lowest decrements for perennial grass from S. Quirico and the highest decrement for continuous wheat from Soveria Simeri. Continuous wheat cropping, based on conventional tillage, proved to be the least sustainable land use. At Soveria Simeri, the organic carbon content under pasture was not significantly larger than under wheat cultivation, probably because of grazing mismanagement; however, organic carbon under pasture was more humified. At S. Quirico, the perennial grass resulted in a significant increase in soil organic carbon at the soil surface relative to the wheat cultivation, while at Vicarello no differences were observed between alfalfa/wheat rotation and perennial grass. Our results lead to the questioning of sustainability of intensive cereal farming and uncontrolled grazing in the considered environments, emphasizing the need for greater attention to conservative land managements.";"Papini, R.

"AGRIS:US201500184572";"Combining gray system and poroelastic models to investigate subsidence problems in Tainan, Taiwan";"";"Tainan, located in southwestern Taiwan, is a high-risk region for flooding and climate change effect and has a potential for future heavy rains. Groundwater pumping for aquaculture and irrigation along the coastal plain of Tainan is monitored due to subsidence. Predicting future subsidence and understanding the effect of climate change on subsidence can assist with regard to the planning and management of water and land resources in the early stages of subsidence, whose possible damage can thus be avoided. This study combines a physical model, called the nonlinear poroelastic model, and a gray-box model, called the gray system model, to evaluate and predict subsidence in the Tainan area. The subsidence under the climate change effect caused by changes in groundwater use is estimated. The climate change impact on subsidence and the potential for subsidence hazards are also analyzed. When taking into consideration the climate change effect, it is predicted that subsidence in Tainan will increase with increasing groundwater use. The maximum subsidence will increase from 29 cm (without additional discharge) to 34 cm (with additional 23.6 % discharge) and 35 cm (with additional 31.7 % discharge) in Xiaying District by 2039. The pattern of subsidence areas obtained by combining the nonlinear poroelastic and the gray system models is similar to that obtained using only the gray system model. However, the largest subsidence areas are different, and the subsidence quantity is much lower for the former due to the constraint of the physics-based poroelastic model. The combination of the nonlinear poroelastic model and the gray system model gives more reasonable estimations than either model can give alone. Large subsidence impact areas are located in the northwestern part of Tainan, and the largest impact is in Xiaying District. The potential for subsidence hazards is classified from the subsidence rates. The subsidence rate in Tainan is below 3 cm/year in the target years, and thus the potential for subsidence hazards is at middle and low levels. With climate change, the area with a middle level of potential for subsidence hazards extends across Yanshui, Xiaying, and Beimen Districts. From the study results, although the subsidence quantity is relatively low, rising sea levels and other effects of climate change expose Tainan to a high risk of flooding. Land and water resources should thus be managed to alleviate subsidence problems in the future.";"Wang, Shih-Jung

In countries such as Ghana, local and even national campaigns have been launched to expel the herders but they persist. This case-study which utilised interviews and group discussions involving farmers and herders, sought to understand the dynamics and subtleties of herders’ resilience in an environment where natural resource access and use rights are tied to common property principles and where herders have no enshrined land and resource rights. Using territoriality as the analytical capsule, we found that the herders’ persistence is related to mainly non-territoriality where the goal is to influence relationships and resource access but not control area. Categorising their non-territorial expression into persuasive and aggressive forms, we provide a new platform for deconstructing farmer-herder relationships in the West African sub-region.";"Yembilah, Rita

Because it is generally the first species affected by low spring flows, the endangered fountain darter (Etheostoma fonticola) has been a focal point for controversies involving the endangered species act, state of Texas groundwater law, and private property rights. We developed an age- and sex-structured population model for the fountain darter, calibrated the model within the constraints of published parameter estimates such that populations simulated under historical spring flows resembled those documented in the field from 1973 to 2007, and used the model to project population dynamics under scenarios of reduced spring flows that could occur as a result of a drought or increased urban water demands. Our simulations suggested that even extending the low spring flows associated with the record drought of 2011 for three consecutive years would have no noticeable effect on population dynamics, and that minimum annual population levels were relatively unaffected until flows were reduced below 2.8m³/s, with minimum population levels falling sharply when flows were reduced beyond about 1.68m³/s. We view our model as a base model representing the impacts of changes in spring flow on the fountain darter which could be developed further to represent the impacts not only of changes in spring flow but also changes in water quality resulting from increases in the runoff of contaminants associated with continued urban development.";"Mora, Miguel A.

For such activity agricultural or ameliorative multi-rotor mowers with joint knives are used. Multi-rotor mowers are characterized with high productivity and reliability along with complete cutting ability. Parameters of cutting devices are analyzed according the peculiarities of reclaimed land (among the peculiarities there are outlined unevenness and inclination of the relief). Besides, bushes in reclaimed lands are usually having thick stalks hard to cut. Therefore, ameliorative mower requires not only high speed of cutting knives, but also high energy of knives' stroke, allow cutting thick stalks under the roots. Theoretical and experimental research on the substantiation of geometric parameters of the knife cutting edge in a rotary mower while cutting bush vegetation on reclaimed lands is presented. The scheme of cutting device of multi-rotor mower is shown; the shape of cutting knife and variances of sharpening of cutting edges is displayed. Forces, directed on cutting edge of knife, are presented on the scheme. The process of cutting with the help of knives with up-and-down sharpening is shown. Experimental device is displayed.

"AGRIS:US201500015134";"Fragmentation of forest communities in the eastern United States";"";"Forest fragmentation threatens the sustainability of forest communities in the eastern United States. Forest communities exhibiting either a low total area or low percentage of intact forest are subject to relatively higher risk of shifts in stand composition towards edge-adapted and invasive species. Such changes in stand composition could result in local extirpation of communities, homogenization of forest communities at broader spatial scales, and a consequential reduction of the biodiversity values of forestland. To evaluate current conditions, we combined forest inventory data with land cover data to compare 70 forest communities in terms of the amount and ownership of intact (i.e., not fragmented) forest, and the proximate causes (i.e., adjacent land cover) of fragmentation. Only 45% of total forestland area was intact in 4.41-ha neighborhoods, but that varied from 13% to 78% among forest communities. Among 10 community groups, the proximate causes of fragmentation reflected their typical geographic context, and the relative importance of fragmentation by development was higher in mostly-forested neighborhoods than in less-forested neighborhoods. Fragmentation was also higher on privately owned forestland than on public forestland. Because of the regional dominance of only a few forest communities and private land ownership, the total regional area of intact forest was driven more by the total area of those strata than by their fragmentation characteristics. The results provide insight for targeting land management strategies to maintain the diversity and regional distributions of intact forest communities.";"Riitters, Kurt H.

Resource ownership and control within the household has differential impacts on the health and overall well-being of male and female members. This paper examines intra-household resource ownership and how it affects nutrition and health status of household members. Data from a household survey containing detailed gender-disaggregated information on resource ownership as well as food and anthropometry were collected from a rural Kenyan district and used in the analysis. Results showed that male members of the household had more access to education, income and land than the females. Mothers' education, household income, frequency of illness and nutrient intake were the most important factors that contributed to the nutritional status of children. The education and household's economic status were important determinants of child morbidity. Malnutrition and poor health of children and women is linked to the existing poverty in the study region, therefore emphasis needs to be put on eradication of discrimination against women in accessing education and accessing land, which will contribute to an increase in household incomes. Government policies need to focus on promotion of nutrition education through adult education programmes and incorporating it in the school curricula. Improvement of health-care facilities in rural areas is also paramount to improving health and nutrition in these areas.";"Marinda, Pamela A.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"poverty;rural areas;land ownership";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301081010";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2006.00518.x";"";"";"";"327-336"

This study is unique in that it is the first of its kind to be applied to New Zealand ISS.  This study also considers a broader range of ISS than most other climate change studies recently conducted.   Using historical climate data and four climate change scenarios, we modelled the impact of climate change on water supply and quality, transport, energy demand, public health and air quality.  Our analysis reveals that many of Hamilton City's infrastructure sectors demonstrated greater responsiveness to population changes than changes in gradual climate change. Any future planning decisions should be sensitive to climate change, but not driven by it (even though that may be fashionable to do so).   We find there is considerable scope for extending this analysis.  First, there is a need for local infrastructure managers to improve the coverage of the data needed for this kind of study.  Second, any future study of this kind must focus on daily (rather than monthly) time steps and extreme (as well as gradual) climate changes.";"Jollands, Nigel

With regard to constraints and possibilities for the production of irrigated rice in the south of Brazil there is no documentation on local soil knowledge. The goals of this study were to answer the following questions: (1) Which soil quality perceptions do rice farmers have? (2) Which soil quality indicators are most important to them? (3) Do rice farmers use their knowledge about soil quality indicators when making soil management decisions and developing sustainable management? The study was carried out in the municipality of Camaquã-Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The research methods used included semi-structured interviews alternated with group discussions. Farmers named eleven characteristics as good indicators for soil quality: earthworms, soil colour, yield, spontaneous vegetation, soil organic matter, root development, soil friability, rice plant development, colour of the rice plant, number of rice tillers and cattle health. Out of these, three indicators were found to be useful in farmers’ decision-making: spontaneous vegetation, rice plant development and soil colour. The potential use of local knowledge for maintaining soil quality and developing sustainable land management is discussed.";"Lima, A.C.R.

"AGRIS:QL2012002414";"Rural development and poverty nexus";"";"The development experience indicates a strong link between rural development and poverty reduction. In Pakistan agriculture is the major source of economic growth, employment and livelihood. The agricultural productivity is low and many factors are responsible for its low productivity. Majority of rural population is marginalized in terms of access to physical and social assets, and in terms of institutions and inequality. Rural poor lack access to instruments to mitigate and cope with shocks that affect their well being and ability to come out of poverty. Gender and rural/urban differences in human development and poverty are substantial. This paper examines the influence of public policies and past development efforts on rural development, poverty reduction and rural welfare outcomes. In Pakistan, misguided policies and institutional weaknesses stifled rural development and resulted in increase in rural poverty, inequality and vulnerability to shocks. The most important impediment to rural development is an overly restrictive policy regime: assets distribution, availability of credit and subsidies. Frequent changes in agricultural support policies resulted in inefficient use of resources and low agricultural productivity. Poverty in rural areas is also perpetuated because of weak research and development (R&D) base, lack of adequate infrastructure and agricultural markets, poor soil and water management practices. The declining financial resources added pressure on already weak infrastructure. In the 1990s, drought conditions led to acute livelihood problems and sharp rise in rural poverty. The paper emphasizes that there is considerable scope for policy interventions aimed at harnessing development potential and improving livelihood opportunities of million of people living in poverty and human deprivation.

Geospatial technologies, particularly remote sensing, could potentially be used in these ecosystems to (1) evaluate the longevity of fuel reduction treatments, (2) provide data for planning and designing future fuel-reduction treatments, and (3) assess the spatial distribution of horizontal fuel structure following fuel-reduction treatments. High-spatial resolution color-infrared imagery (0.06-m� pixels) was acquired for pinyon and juniper woodland plots where fuels were reduced by either prescribed fire, tree cutting, or mastication at five sites in Oregon, California, Nevada, and Utah. Imagery was taken with a Vexcel UltraCam X digital camera in June 2009. Within each treatment plot, ground cover was measured as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project. Trimble eCognition Developer was used to classify land cover classes using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques. Differences between cover estimates using OBIA and ground-measurements were not consistently higher or lower for any land cover class and when evaluated for individual sites, were within ±5� % of each other. The overall accuracy and the K ₕₐₜ statistic for classified thematic maps for each treatment were: prescribed burn 85� % and 0.81; cut and fell 82� % and 0.77, and mastication 84� % and 0.80. Although cover assessments from OBIA differed somewhat from ground measurements, they are sufficiently accurate to evaluate treatment success and for supporting a broad range of management concerns.";"Hulet, April

"AGRIS:US201600014076";"Shifting rights, property and authority in the forest frontier: ‘stakes’ for local land users and citizens";"";"Customary land and forests are more embedded in the global economy than ever. With globally significant supplies of land and raw materials and favorable terms for foreign investors, developing countries – particularly in Africa – have become increasingly attractive trade partners and destinations for investors. Increasing competition over land is placing new pressures on vast tracts of forest and woodland, areas often considered ‘under-utilized’ by national governments despite their critical role in supporting local livelihoods. While increased demand for primary agricultural, forest and mining commodities in the context of forest tenure reforms and decentralized decision-making could create unprecedented economic opportunities for forest-dependent communities, increased ‘stakes’ over forest resources and land will undoubtedly heighten governance challenges. This is in no small part due to the political dynamics of property, and to the role of the ‘recursive constitution of property rights and authority’ in the evolution of the modern nation-state. By identifying the social ‘stakes’ associated with different pathways through which sectoral and extra-sectoral commodities shape forests, this paper provides a conceptual framework for analyzing how shifting contours of rights, property and authority in the context of forest-related trade and investment shape human well-being for affected communities and the wider citizenry of host countries. It then illustrates the use of the framework through its application to two brief case studies from southern Africa: tobacco production in Malawi and copper mining in Zambia. It is hoped that this framework will provide a meaningful contribution to growing scholarship on the political dynamics of property, and implications for rights-based approaches to agricultural investment and large-scale land acquisitions.";"German, Laura

The analyses demonstrate that farmers make decisions about woodlot technology based on the household and field characteristics. The factors that significantly influenced the decision to adopt rotational woodlot technology included: gender, tree tenure security, seed supply, contact with extension and research agencies, soil erosion index, size of landholding, fuelwood scarcity, and main source of family income. To promote greater adoption of rotational woodlot technology, particular attention should be placed on the use of appropriate socioeconomic characterization, to better target technologies to areas with greater adoption potential.";"Buyinza, Mukadasi

"AGRIS:US201600131390";"Tradeoffs in the Rehabilitation of a Succulent Karoo Rangeland";"";"Rangeland rehabilitation has multiple, sometimes conflicting goals, such as the reestablishment of the predisturbance vegetation, soil protection, and forage production. The rehabilitation techniques should be also cost‐effective and practicable. Given the difficulties and high costs of restoring Succulent Karoo rangelands and the continuously high grazing pressure in the communal lands, tradeoffs should be accepted in the achievement of these goals. We tested the capability of paddock manure redistribution to reverse degradation trends in a heavily grazed Succulent Karoo rangeland in South Africa. Over 3 years, the effects of the manure application were compared with areas planted with mature shrubs as a benchmark for a predisturbance vegetation structure and with four popular rehabilitation techniques: (1) livestock exclusion; (2) brushpacking (coverage of dead shrubs); (3) mineral fertilizing; and (4) microcatchment construction. Manure was, besides planting, the only treatment that resulted in a significant increase in drought‐resistant vegetation cover, but it compromised the dominance of native vegetation. In the manure plots, a pasture‐like vegetation of non‐native forage plants (which germinated mainly from seeds in the dung), developed (foremost Atriplex semibaccata). Manure application counteracted erosion as effectively as the planted shrubs and brushpacks. Expected negative side effects such as a decrease in plant species richness or salinization of topsoil were not detected. We also checked the potential of topsoil salinization by the halophytic A. semibaccata and found it to be low. For sites where a decrease in grazing pressure is unrealistic under current land tenure, redistribution of manure should be further explored to mitigate acute symptoms of degradation.

"AGRIS:US201400097787";"Harvest of Natural Shrubs with a Biobaler in Various Environments in Quebec, Ontario and Minnesota";"";"The biobaler is a novel approach to cut woody crops up to 150-mm basal diameter and compress the biomass into round bales. It can be used to harvest short-rotation woody crop plantations such as willow or hybrid poplar. It can also be used to clear wild brush, forest understory, and encroaching small trees to improve land management. A commercial version of the biobaler was evaluated for the latter purpose, i.e., to harvest natural shrubs in various environments in central Canada (at three sites in Québec and two sites in Ontario) and in mid-western United States (at seven sites in Minnesota). More than 250 bales were harvested and monitored on natural stands in 2009 and 2010 to gain information on machinery management under wide-ranging conditions of crop species, density, and soil conditions. The harvest rate ranged from 2 to 26 bales/h (average of 14 bales/h). Bale mass averaged 477 kg at 46% moisture content [260 kg dry mass (DM)/bale at a density of 166 kg DM/m³]. Diesel fuel consumption averaged 8.5 L/t DM. Harvesting cost with the biobaler was estimated at $33/t DM in high yield with rapid harvest (20 bale/h) and $64/t DM at low capacity (10 bales/h) which can be caused by lower yield or poor traction. The information will be helpful to evaluate the cost of environmental management of natural stands covered with brush and the potential biomass that may be recovered.";"Savoie, P.

The awareness campaign mainly consisted of nine meetings with the forest owners and nine workshops with all stakeholders, i.e. representatives of the forest inspectorates, county headquarters of the national forest administration, mass media, forest landowners, forest managers, logging companies and local authorities, including police and gendarmerie. The discussions, facilitated in each meeting by the three authors, were recorded and the minutes produced there have been further used for diagnosing the main interaction bottlenecks occurred between stakeholders. These discussions have been examined through the transactional analysis method in order to find out the main communication problems needed to addresses at national, regional and local level by the representatives of the public authorities in charge with implementing and supervising the forest policy. The main results of this analysis consist of a list of problems supposed to generate conflicts of various kinds (legal, technical, managerial and communicational) in Romanian forestry. The study has also revealed some important and frequent pitfalls that jeopardize the communication between prevailing stakeholders. Explaining them and their root causes could be a very useful input for further PR training programs and for the academic curricula.";"Dragoi, Marian

"AGRIS:US2012200212";"MORE SOCIAL CAPITAL, LESS EROSION: EVIDENCE FROM PERU'S ALTIPLANO";"";"The debate over sustainable intensification has hinged on private incentives to abate land degradation.  Largely missing is the role of social capital in both creating incentives and removing barriers to soil conservation.  Yet soil conservation embodies the externality problem that bedevils so many aspects of natural resource management.  Action by one farmer to reduce water or wind erosion may benefit neighboring fields by slowing the rate of water or wind movement across those lands.  Yet these benefits are not fully captured by the farmer making the conservation investment.  However, when economic agents care for one another, these externalities can be internalized, reducing the individual's disincentive to perform a socially level of natural resource conservation.  Likewise, community organizations may provide collective capital and labor to overcome adoption barriers faced by individuals.
The twin hypotheses that 1) farming practices influence soil erosion and 2) social capital influences the adoption of sustainable farming practices are tested with data from a 1999 survey of 197 farms in the Peruvian Altiplano around Lake Titicaca.  The survey used cluster sampling of farms in
villages to represent each of three arable agro-ecological zones in the Ilave-Huenque river basin.  Relative asset levels were used to stratify resident households within villages.  Personal interviews collected a wide range of data on farm household assets, management practices, and status of agricultural natural resources.";"Swinton, Scott M.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2000-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012200212";"http://purl.umn.edu/21853";"";"";"";""

Using data from the state of Vermont, this study first examines the effects of development restrictions on the market price of rural and semi-rural properties and then addresses the question of whether the prices paid for development rights are close to the market value.

"AGRIS:US201600184111";"Raptor Presence Along an UrbanâWildland Gradient: Influences of Prey Abundance and Land Cover";"";"Native animals are affected differently by urbanization. Some species respond favorably and thrive in human-dominated landscapes, but others are extirpated. Raptors are often sensitive to changes in land cover and prey abundance. We therefore used a combination of broadcast surveys and incidental observations while spot-mapping to evaluate the influences of these two variables on the presence of raptors at 21 sites from 2004â2008 along an urban-to-wildland gradient in western Washington, U.S.A. We detected three species of hawks: Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter striatus), Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii), and Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis); and five species of owls: Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma), Western Screech-Owl (Megascops kennicottii), Barred Owl (Strix varia), Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) and Barn Owl (Tyto alba). Models that included specific land-cover elements as independent variables explained presence for all species better than models including only prey abundance. Cooper's Hawks and Barred Owls showed a positive response to human-altered landscapes, specifically the edges between deciduous-mixed forest and light intensity urban land cover. Raptor species richness was consistent across the gradient of urbanization (xÂ¯ = 3.67 species/site) and not correlated with land-cover diversity, songbird species richness, or total forest cover.";"Rullman, Stan

"AGRIS:US2016200179";"SLIPPAGE OR SPURIOUS CORRELATION:  AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM";"";"Previous research finds that some environmental benefits stemming from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) are offset by slippage: farmers simply plant more acreage to substitute for land that was idled.  Our analysis shows that previous slippage estimates likely stem from spurious correlation.  Most land retired under CRP is of lower-than-average quality.  Due to the marginal economic viability of these lands they also are more likely to move both into and out of agricultural production.  CRP enrollments therefore will be spatially correlated with non-cropland to cropland conversions even if no slippage is present. Using time-series rather than cross-sectional variation in CRP enrollments, we obtain new slippage estimates that control for land heterogeneity using fixed and random effects.  Contrary to previous findings, we find little or no slippage in the form of new plantings of commodity crops.  Moderate CRP-induced plantings take the form of new hay plantings that arise mostly from converted pastureland, but these conversions create little in the way of unintended environmental damages.  Total commodity production is reduced by less than the proportion of acres idled because land retired is of lower-than-average quality and because it sometimes stood fallow or in hay before it was enrolled in CRP.  Aside from its policy implications, our study demonstrates the crucial importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in empirical research.";"Bucholtz, Shawn

However, they are not readily available to the majority of public sector vaccine research groups, and even those with access to suitable adjuvants may still fail in the development of their vaccines because of lack of knowledge on how to correctly formulate the adjuvants. This shortcoming led the World Health Organization to advocate for the establishment of the Vaccine Formulation Laboratory at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. The primary mission of the laboratory is to transfer adjuvants and formulation technology free of intellectual property rights to academic institutions, small biotechnology companies and developing countries vaccine manufacturers. In this context, the transfer of an oil-in-water emulsion to Bio Farma, an Indonesian vaccine manufacturer, was initiated to increase domestic pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity as part of the national pandemic influenza preparedness plan.";"Collin, Nicolas

"AGRIS:US201600126830";"Modelling and quantifying the spatial distribution of post-wildfire ash loads";"";"Ash is generated in every wildfire, but its eco-hydro-geomorphic effects remain poorly understood and quantified, especially at large spatial scales. Here we present a new method that allows modelling the spatial distribution of ash loads in the post-fire landscape, based on a severe wildfire that burnt ~13600ha of a forested water supply catchment in October 2013 (2013 Hall Road Fire, 100km south-west of Sydney, Australia). Employing an existing spectral ratio-based index, we developed a new spectral index using Landsat 8 satellite imagery: the normalised wildfire ash index (NWAI). Before- and after-fire images were normalised and a differenced wildfire ash image (dNWAI) computed. The relationship between dNWAI and ash loads (t ha-1) quantified in situ at nine sampling locations burnt under a range of fire severities was determined using a polynomial regression (R2=0.98). A spatially applied model was computed within a geographic information system (GIS) to illustrate the spatial distribution of ash across the area burnt and to estimate ash loads in the five subcatchments affected by the wildfire. Approximately 181000 tonnes of ash was produced by the wildfire, with specific loads increasing with fire severity. This new tool to model wildfire ash distribution can inform decisions about post-fire land management in future wildfires in the region. It can also be adapted for its application in other fire-prone environments.";"Chafer, Chris J.

Situated in a region with abundant agriculture, Delmarva Bays and other wetlands may enhance water quality by reducing nutrient and sediment levels in local waters. A significant portion have been drained and converted from forested wetlands to agriculture. Using LiDAR to locate Bays, we estimate that there are 17,000 Bays on the Delmarva Peninsula, which is an order of magnitude greater than earlier estimates. Using a stratified sampling scheme based on Bay density, morphometric parameters of 1494 Bays were measured from the LiDAR data and their land use was assessed using aerial photography. Eighty percent of the Bays range in size from 0.46 to 5.68 ha, have a relief ranging between 0.55 and 2.02m, and have a major to minor axis ratio between 1.08 and 1.65. Forty-one percent of the Bays sampled have been converted to agriculture and another 29 % have been partially converted, while 29 % retain natural vegetative cover. Improved understanding of the geomorphology, abundance and land cover of Delmarva Bays should lead to better management and conservation efforts.";"Fenstermacher, D. E.

"AGRIS:US201500016116";"effect of forest fire on mass movement in Lebanese mountainous areas";"";"Mass movements are major hazards that threaten natural and human environments. In Lebanon, the occurrence of mass movements increased by almost 60% between 1956 and 2008. Forest fire has emerged as an additional hazard: it destroyed over 25% of Lebanon’s forests in a period less than 40 years. This paper investigates the potential effect of forest fire on the occurrence of mass movements in the Damour and Nahr Ibrahim watersheds of Lebanon. Mass movement and forest fire inventory maps were produced through remote sensing using aerial and satellite images. Forest fire was included as an additional factor in mass movement induction, and its effect was quantified from Landsat images through the normalised burn ratio (NBR) index. A field study was conducted to substantiate the mass movement inventory and NBR maps. Following the standardisation of the effect factors into layers using geographic information systems, the weight factor of each layer for inducing mass movements was evaluated using the modified InfoVal method, and a mass movement susceptibility map was generated. Exceeded only by changes in land cover, the NBR produced the highest weights, making forest fire burn severity the second highest factor influencing mass movement occurrence in the study areas.";"Ziadé, Rouba

This study assessed the effect of farmers' resource endowment and nutrient management strategies on variability in soil fertility and plant nutrient uptake between different fields in Gokwe South (ave. rainfall ~650 mm year⁻¹; 16.3 persons km⁻²) and Murewa (ave. rainfall ~850 mm year⁻¹; 44.1 persons km⁻²) districts, Zimbabwe. In Murewa, resource-endowed farmers applied manure (>3.5 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹) on fields closest to their homesteads (homefields) and none to fields further away (outfields). In Gokwe the manure was not targeted to any particular field, and farmers quickly abandoned outfields and opened up new fields further way from the homestead once fertility had declined, but homefields were continually cultivated. Soil available P was higher in homefields (8-13 mg kg⁻¹) of resource-endowed farmers than on outfields and all fields on resource constrained farms (2-6 mg kg⁻¹) in Murewa. Soil fertility decreased with increasing distance from the homestead in Murewa while the reverse trend occurred in Gokwe South, indicating the impact of different soil fertility management strategies on spatial soil fertility gradients. In both districts, maize showed deficiency of N and P, implying that these were the most limiting nutrients. It was concluded that besides farmers' access to resources, the direction of soil fertility gradients also depends on agro-ecological conditions which influence resource management strategies.";"Masvaya, E.

"AGRIS:DJ2012089786";"Assessing current and potential patterns of 16 forest species driven by climate change scenarios in México";"";"In order to analyze the impacts of climate change on species endowed with forestry relevance, the present study practiced simulations in the potential distribution of 16 forest species inside the Mexican Republic’s temperate, tropical, and semiarid zones. For the examination of this effect we pictured the base scenario,as well as three models of climate change (GFDL-CM-2.0, MPI-ECHAM-5, HADGEM-1) that would take place under the socio-economic scenarios A2 and B2 by 2050. The methodology consists in: 1) a modeling of climatology corresponding to the period 1950-2000 (base scenario); 2) a consideration of the reasons for the change in precipitation and temperature within each one of the three climate change models; 3) a calculation of the soil humidity balance; 4) the creation of matrices of the forest species’ environmental requirements, and 5) a proposal for a potential spatial distribution of the species. The results show that, because of a rise in temperature and a decrease in precipitation along the entire national territory almost every month, each one of the forest species living in the temperate zones will be affected within the span of time considered. Among the species of the tropical zones, there appears a substantial decrease in the levels of those with the highest suitability, which is linked to the restrictions that are set on their development as the dry period is heightened. As for the species of the arid and semi-arid regions, the models indicate that an increase will be marked on the area of those with no suitability, which is associated with the enhancement of hydric deficit. Of the climate change models here considered, the HADGEM-1 establishes the most restrictive conditions, the MPI-ECHAM-5 establishes an intermediate situation of affectation, and the model GFDL-CM-2.0 establishes the least affectation. Geographically, the country does not present constant changes in the potential distribution of the species; these latter vary according to the climate change model that has been used, the species that has been analyzed, and the ecological zone that has been delimited.";"J.

"AGRIS:US201400085574";"Climate change and grazing interact to alter flowering patterns in the Mongolian steppe";"";"Socio-economic changes threaten nomadic pastoralism across the world, changing traditional grazing patterns. Such land-use changes will co-occur with climate change, and while both are potentially important determinants of future ecosystem functioning, interactions between them remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of grazing by large herbivores and climate manipulation using open-top chambers (OTCs) on flower number and flowering species richness in mountain steppe of northern Mongolia. In this region, sedentary pastoralism is replacing nomadic pastoralism, and temperature is predicted to increase. Grazing and OTCs interacted to affect forb flowering richness, which was reduced following grazing removal, and reduced by OTCs in grazed plots only. This interaction was directly linked to the soil moisture and temperature environments created by the experimental treatments: most species flowered when both soil moisture and temperature levels were high (i.e. in grazed plots without OTCs), while fewer species flowered when either temperature, or moisture, or both, were low. Removal of grazing increased the average number of graminoid flowers produced at peak flowering in Year 1, but otherwise grazing removal and OTCs did not affect community-level flower composition. Of four abundant graminoid species examined individually, three showed increased flower number with grazing removal, while one showed the reverse. Four abundant forb species showed no significant response to either treatment. Our results highlight how climate change effects on mountain steppe could be contingent on land-use, and that studies designed to understand ecosystem response to climate change should incorporate co-occurring drivers of change, such as altered grazing regimes.";"Spence, Laura A.

"AGRIS:US201301919838";"evaluation of West Virginia's Managed Timberland Tax Incentive Program";"";"Preferential property tax treatment of forested land is part of legislative policy in all 50 states. West Virginia's Managed Timberland (Managed Timberland) is designed to retain private forest land in forested use. In West Virginia, although private forest land owners hold 9.7million acres of forest land (83% of forest land), Managed Timberland enrolled acres have remained at approximately 2million acres since 1998. This lack of enrollment may be a cause for concern regarding the success and benefits of the program. This study evaluates West Virginia's Managed Timberland program, examines the factors that influence forest landowners' decision to participate in the program, and proposes strategies for increasing enrollment and improving the program. The data for this study were collected from a mail survey of participants and non-participants of the program conducted in the fall of 2008 on West Virginia forest landowners. Participants tended to hear about the Managed Timberland program from a professional forester and the majority of them were satisfied with the program administration. Aspects of the program that participants opposed most strongly were the annual contract renewal requirement and the tax assessors' overriding authority. Most participants (51%) indicated that a longer contract time was a favorable change to the program. Many non-participants reported that they were not enrolled in Managed Timberland because they had never heard of the program. Although most non-participants were undecided as to whether they would enroll in the future, 25% said they would consider it. Significant factors influencing enrollment were age, income, place of residence, county location of the enrolled property, and perceived benefits of the program.";"Fortney, Jennifer

"AGRIS:US201500015868";"Evaluating the relative impact of climate and economic changes on forest and agricultural ecosystem services in mountain regions";"";"Provisioning of ecosystem services (ES) in mountainous regions is predicted to be influenced by i) the direct biophysical impacts of climate change, ii) climate mediated land use change, and iii) socioeconomic driven changes in land use. The relative importance and the spatial distribution of these factors on forest and agricultural derived ES, however, is unclear, making the implementation of ES management schemes difficult. Using an integrated economic–ecological modeling framework, we evaluated the impact of these driving forces on the provision of forest and agricultural ES in a mountain region of southern Switzerland. Results imply that forest ES will be strongly influenced by the direct impact of climate change, but that changes in land use will have a comparatively small impact. The simulation of direct impacts of climate change affects forest ES at all elevations, while land use changes can only be found at high elevations. In contrast, changes to agricultural ES were found to be primarily due to shifts in economic conditions that alter land use and land management. The direct influence of climate change on agriculture is only predicted to be substantial at high elevations, while socioeconomic driven shifts in land use are projected to affect agricultural ES at all elevations. Our simulation results suggest that policy schemes designed to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on forests should focus on suitable adaptive management plans, accelerating adaptation processes for currently forested areas. To maintain provision of agricultural ES policy needs to focus on economic conditions rather than on supporting adaptation to new climate.";"Briner, Simon

Shifting policy agendas have prioritised private land rights and commercial land uses, seeking to dismantle the racial divide between the white commercial farming areas and the ex-Bantustans by allocating former white farms to black farmers. These agendas and planning models reflect class and gender bias and a poor understanding of common property.

However, with land tenure reform in South Africa currently at a state of legislative impasse, real uncertainty now exists over land rights and governance of rangeland in many communal areas. This paper draws on case study material from Eastern Cape province to illustrate how this ongoing uncertainty has resulted in the operation of a range of traditional authority and civil society institutions in different communal areas with varying degrees of legitimate authority over land administration and highly variable performance in managing rangeland resources. Collective management of rangeland resources seems most difficult in environments where land rights are contested because of the coexistence of traditional leaders and civil society institutions. On this basis an approach to tenure reform is advocated, which vests all powers over local land administration in democratically elected and accountable civil society institutions. Some successful examples of this already exist and might serve to guide policy formation, which must be flexible enough to accommodate collective management approaches that emphasise cooperation both within and between communities.";"Bennett, James E";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land rights;rangelands;land tenure";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ZAF;018;002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500071187";"http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2013.776634";"";"";"";"77-83"

Forest conservation can reduce soil erosion, and therefore efforts to maintain upstream forest cover within a watershed contribute to the economic life span of a hydropower facility. The cost of forest conservation can be viewed as an investment in hydropower and be financed via a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme. A novel modelling framework is used to estimate payments for forest conservation consisting of: (1) land-use change projection; (2) watershed erosion modelling; (3) reservoir sedimentation estimation; (4) power generation loss calculation; and (5) PES scheme design. The framework was applied to a proposed dam in Cambodia (Pursat 1). The estimated net present value of forest conservation was US$ 4.7 million when using average annual climate values over 100 years, or US$ 6.4 million when considering droughts every eight years. This can be remunerated with annual payments of US$ 4.26 haâ»Â¹ or US$ 5.78 haâ»Â¹, respectively, covering forest protection costs estimated at US$ 0.9 haâ»Â¹ yrâ»Â¹. The application of this type of PES represents a rational option that allows for conservation and development of hydropower watersheds susceptible to erosion and sedimentation.";"ARIAS, MAURICIO E.

The findings show that increased temperature and decreased rainfall are widely held perceptions; all respondents stated that they had observed increase in temperature and decrease in annual and seasonal rainfall amounts. The major impacts of climate change on local livelihoods as reported by respondents include decline in the length of growing period, increased crop damage by insects and pests, and increased severity of weed infestation. Some respondents also reported an increase in the incidence of livestock diseases. The adaptive responses by the smallholder farmers to the perceived or experienced climate change include adjustments in crop and livestock production activities, and investments in sustainable land management at household and community levels.

This is made clear by an analysis of the management rules and practices for territorial farming contracts, intended to implement this Act. The difficulty of this reconciliation can also be observed by the impact that the statute’s application has had on its targets — production units. We conducted open or conversation interviews with institutional personnel and with farmers who have signed these contracts. Those signed so far have supported production for export from both places, markedly in Guadeloupe and less so in Reunion. In Guadeloupe, these contracts have rarely served to help develop the practices of participating farmers or to incite new projects. Technical, economic or even organizational innovations have remained more ad hoc than at Reunion. Although the objectives of these contracts have been ""deflected"", this learning process via diversion of the statute augurs well for a better adjustment to the new sustainable agriculture contracts by farmers and the institutions working with them.

La multifonctionnalité de l’agriculture promue par la loi d’orientation agricole (LOA) cohabite difficilement avec les modèles intensifs dominants en Guadeloupe et à la Réunion. L’analyse des règles et des pratiques de gestion des contrats territoriaux d’exploitation (CTE), instruments de la LOA, permet d’en rendre compte. La difficulté de cohabitation s’apprécie également par les impacts que l’application de la LOA a eus sur les unités de production, cibles de la loi. Des entretiens ouverts et non directifs ont été réalisés auprès des institutions d’une part, et auprès d’agriculteurs signataires des CTE, d’autre part. Les CTE signés ont appuyé la production pour l’exportation, de façon marquée en Guadeloupe, de manière plus nuancée à La Réunion. En Guadeloupe, ils ont rarement servi à faire évoluer les pratiques des exploitants signataires ou à susciter de nouveaux projets. Les innovations techniques, économiques ou encore organisationnelles y sont restées plus ponctuelles qu’à la Réunion. Si les objectifs des CTE ont été « détournés », le processus d’apprentissage via le contournement de la LOA augure d’une prise en main plus satisfaisante du contrat d’agriculture durable (CAD) par la profession agricole et les institutions d’accompagnement.";"Dulcire , Michel

This paper put forward an optimizing model based on variable precision rough sets (VPRS) for the land cover discrimination in wetland inventory. In the case study of Lake Baiyangdian which has important ecological functions to the northern China, this model is established successfully according to the domain-experts knowledge. The procedure is as follows. First step is data collection, including remote-sensing data (e.g., Landsat-5 TM bands), the digitized relief maps, and statistical yearbooks. Second, the remote sensing imagery (RSI) and relief maps are co-registered into the same resolution. Third, a condition set, including various attributes is derived from spectral bands, band math or ratio indices based on previous studies, at the same time, the decision set is derived from true land types after investigation and validation. Then, the remote sensing decision table (RSDT) is constructed by linking condition set with decision set according to the sequential pixels in RSI. Fourth, we create one forward greedy searching algorithm based on VPRS to handle this RSDT. After adjusting parameters such as β and knowledge granularity diameter (KGD), we obtain the stable optimized results. Comparative experiments and evaluation show that the discrimination or retrieval accuracy of VPRS model is satisfying (overall accuracy: 87.32% and KHAT: 0.84) and better than original data. Moreover, data dimension has been decreased dramatically (from 12 to 3) and key attributes found by the model may be useful for specific retrieval in wetland inventories.";"Xie, Feng

A data-set was presented including two catchments covering the major land use types and different hydrological connection levels to rivers within Eastern China: Middle Yangtze (river-isolated lakes) and Huai River (non-river-connected lakes). Total dissolved nitrogen [TDN, including DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN)], total organic carbon (TOC) and physical variables (T, DO, pH, OPR, conductivity) were measured in seventeen lakes over summer and winter. In all study lakes, both DON and NH₄ ⁺-N were the major fractions of TDN, with much lower proportions of NO₃ ⁻-N and NO₂-N. A variation pattern with higher DON and lower NH₄ ⁺-N concentrations was observed in non-river-connected lakes, and yet reverse pattern in river-isolated lakes. Higher DON concentrations were recorded with a high extent of farmland in land use, reflecting the influence of human impact on DON loads. These relationships and correlation analysis indicated that DON concentrations were controlled by several factors including temperature, latitude, precipitation, hydrological process and farmland cover in land use. Seasonal variations showed that higher mean surface DON concentration (0.004–0.666 mg/L) was measured in winter, which might be due to resuspension of the organic matter from bottom sediments. The uptake of DON by phytoplankton and bacteria was likely to be the most significant reason for low DON concentrations (0.006–0.335 mg/L) during the summer, supported by increasing DON concentrations accompanied with disappearing Chla after phytoplankton died. Much higher NO₃ ⁻-N concentrations in summer were attributed to nitrogenous fertilizer, high rainfall, and inorganic nitrogen suspending brought by frequent wind wave.";"Zhang, Yali

It confirms that the increase is largely due to U.S. patenters, with an earlier surge in Asia, and some increase in Europe. Growth has taken place in all technologies, but not in all industries, being concentrated in the electrical, electronics, computing, and scientific instruments industries. It then examines whether these patents are valued by the market. We know from survey evidence that patents in these industries are not usually considered important for appropriability, but are sometimes considered necessary to secure financing for entering the industry. I compare the market value of patents held by entrant firms to those held by incumbents (controlling for R&D). Using data on publicly traded firms 1980-1989, I find that in industries based on electrical and mechanical technologies the market value of entrants' patents is positive in the post-1984 period (after the patenting surge), but not before, when patents were relatively unimportant in these industries. Also, the value of patent rights in complex product industries (where each product relies on many patents held by a number of other firms) is much higher for entrants than incumbents in the post-1984 period. For discrete product industries (where each product relies on only a few patents, and where the importance of patents for appropriability has traditionally been higher), there is no difference between incumbents and entrants.";"Hall, B.H.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"150;142;USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301034696";"http://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0892-9912/contents";"";"";"";"35-48"

However, because lakes are dynamic, results obtained from individual images acquired on a single date are not representative and do not accurately reflect ongoing changes. In this study, we used 8-day moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) composite data from 2000 to 2010 to map water surface changes over 629 lakes in China. We combined automatic extraction of training data and support vector machine classification to derive the spatial distribution of these large water bodies. The producer’s and user’s accuracies for MODIS images were 91.06� % and 89.81� %, respectively, when compared with interpretation results from 30� m resolution Landsat images taken on similar days. Area changes, variability, inundation intensity, and rainy seasons of the 629 lakes were analyzed based on this multi-temporal lake database. The total area of the 629 lakes increased over the study period, primarily as a result of the expansion of lake areas on the Tibetan Plateau. There were 12 lakes with a maximum area >1,000� km², and six of these decreased in area from 2000 to 2010. The shrinkages of Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake were −54.76 and −25.08� km²/a, respectively. The area of lakes on Tibetan Plateau, in northern Xinjiang, northeastern Inner Mongolia, and northeastern China varied little, while lakes on the Yangtze Plain, in southern Inner Mongolia, and central Xinjiang fluctuated considerably. Inundation intensity increased for lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, in northern Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin, while inundation extent decreased in central Xinjiang, southern Tibet, southern Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and on the Yangtze Plain. This study is an attempt to develop high-frequency specific land cover maps to improve applicability of general land cover maps. The lake products serve as an important supplement to hydrologic data. The lake database enables the generation of new land surface process models, which could improve the precision of simulations, based on more accurate observations of dynamic lake systems.";"Sun, Fangdi

Its global range was previously estimated at 760 km², but in 2007-2008 available habitat covered<35 km². Density estimates from multi-model inference analysis of distance transect data provided a global population estimate of 90-256 adults (possibly with a serious sex-ratio bias towards males). Logistic regression models of habitat selection showed that males preferentially occurred in areas of grassland with greater cover of medium-length grass (5-15 cm), less cover of bare ground and fewer bushes. Habitat transects extending outward from its core range revealed massive and rapid bush encroachment, corroborating information from semi-structured interviews. The survival of both local Borana pastoralism and this species - mainland Africa's likeliest first avian extinction - depends on restoring seasonal patterns of grazing, resisting agricultural conversion of grasslands, reversing fire suppression policies and clearing bush.";"Spottiswoode, C.N.

This research posits the hypothesis that watermanagement in agriculture during droughts strongly depends on the risks farmers face and ontheir expectations, based on past drought experiences. Specifically, it is hypothesized thatfarmers’ participation in the water spot or water rights markets are a function of their individuallevels of risk, the variability of water supply and irrigation efficiency, the type of crops grownand the severity and frequency of past droughts. To evaluate these hypotheses, data werecollected from a sample of 333 farmers in the Limarí River Valley in Northern Chile, during theunprecedented drought that took place from 1994 through 1997.

This growth chamber experiment subjected intact plant–soil cylinders from a Wyoming, USA, prairie to a 3‐way factorial of CO2 (370 vs. 720 μL L−1), defoliation (non‐clipped vs. clipped) and soil nitrogen (control vs. 10 g m−2 added N) under simulated natural climatic conditions. Above‐ and below‐ground biomass and N dynamics of the functional groups C3 grasses, C4 grasses and forbs were investigated. CO2 and defoliation had independent influences on biomass and N parameters of these rangeland plants. Growth under CO2‐enriched conditions enhanced above‐ground biomass 50% in C3 grasses alone, while shoot N concentration declined 16% in both C3 and C4 grasses. Plant‐soil 15N uptake was unaffected by CO2 treatment. In contrast, defoliation had no effect on biomass, but increased tissue N concentration 29% across all functional groups. Without additional N, forage quality, which is in direct relation to N concentration, will decline under increasing atmospheric CO2. Increased dominance of C3 grasses plus reduced forage quality may necessitate changes in grazing management practices in mixed‐species rangelands.";"LeCain, D. R.

The resulting forest change map showed the area of afforestation between 1990 and 2008 was 579,000 (±10,000)ha, and the area of deforestation was 75,000 (± 5000)ha.

"AGRIS:US201400048859";"Farmland Preservation Verdicts—Rezoning Agricultural Land in British Columbia";"";"The Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) in British Columbia (BC), Canada, is a provincial zoning scheme designed to protect agricultural land from development. Since 1973, landowners have not been permitted to use ALR land for nonagricultural purposes, prompting some to seek recovery of development option value by applying for exclusion from the ALR. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and a binary choice (logit) model, this study examines factors that impact the acceptance of ALR exclusion applications. With data from two regions in southwestern BC, we find that applications are more likely to be approved when the land is closer to the major highway, has a smaller parcel size, consists of a smaller portion of the total parcel area, or has poorer quality soils. Therefore, as intended by public policy, agricultural capability is a key determinant in exclusion decisions, retaining properties of greater agricultural value in the ALR. Even though public opinion has suggested otherwise, the political party in power at the time of the decision was only a weak factor, mostly moderated by the number of applications in a given year. A spatial‐effects model found no evidence of spatial autocorrelation, supporting the conclusions drawn from the nonspatial model estimations. La réserve de terres agricoles de la Colombie‐Britannique (ALR), au Canada, est un plan de zonage provincial destinéà protéger les terres agricoles contre le développement urbain. Depuis 1973, les propriétaires fonciers ne peuvent utiliser les terres de la réserve à des fins non agricoles, ce qui incite certains à tenter de récupérer une certaine valeur d’option en faisant une demande d’exclusion. À l’aide de la technologie des systèmes d’information géographique (SIG) et d’un modèle de choix binaire (type logit), nous avons examiné les facteurs qui influencent l’acceptation des demandes d’exclusion. À l’aide de données sur deux régions du sud‐ouest de la Colombie‐Britannique, nous avons observé que les demandes d’exclusion sont plus susceptibles d’être acceptées lorsque les terres sont situées en bordure d’une route importante, sont de petite taille, ne représentent qu’une portion d’une superficie plus grande ou présentent des sols de mauvaise qualité. En conséquence, comme le prévoit la politique du gouvernement, la capacité agricole est un facteur clé dans les décisions d’exclusion qui permet de conserver les propriétés de grande valeur agricole dans la réserve. Bien que l’opinion publique indique le contraire, le parti politique au pouvoir au moment de la décision ne constituait qu’un faible facteur, principalement réduit par le nombre de demandes au cours d’une année donnée. Un modèle d’effets spatiaux n’a pas réussi à montrer l’existence d’une autocorrélation spatiale appuyant les conclusions tirées des estimations du modèle non spatial.";"Stobbe, Tracy E.

"AGRIS:LV2011000337";"Proportional real estate tax application problems in Latvia";"Samērīga nekustamā īpašuma nodokļa piemērošanas problēmas Latvijā";"Writing topics actuality is based on the government proposed property tax increase of 2011 residential tax. Author of the article concludes that till now disproportionately spacious cadastral value range and its inadequacy towards resident income has restricted to establish a fair personal income and property tax proportionate to the objective of appropriate tax. Just now Latvia is experiencing huge increase in amounts of real estate tax debt and number of debtors. The planned tax increase will worsen the state of poor people, reduce household purchasing power and in no way stimulate the development of the Latvian economy in general. To ensure reasonable real estate tax application the author considers the following measures: (1) Real estate tax has to be connected with the person's income and present paying opportunities. Ability to pay has to be rated by residents real income in each region of country, as difference between resident income levels by region are relatively small. Furthermore, for many state and local government employed occupations wages are the same regardless from the region in which the workplace is located.  (2) Socially acceptable real estate tax would have to be set down a specific minimum home size and value, which should be applied with a relatively small tax rate, while leaving the rest of home size with a proportionately increasing tax rate. Real estate tax must also be linked with the resident size in the particular home. (3) Immediate change of methodology on how cadastral values are evaluated in Latvia is required. Review manners in which the State Land Department is setting the property cadastral values. Cadastral valuation can’t be based solely on real estate market information on disposals, because they are affected by many confounding factors – unknown origin free cash investment, credit availability, speculative transactions, etc. (4) It is required to conceptually review the role of local government in real estate tax realisation – determination of real estate base (cadastral value), real estate rate accommodation (establishing differential rates or rate corridors in territory of one local government) and tax administration processes.

"AGRIS:US2016220828";"Quantifying the potential impacts of increasing agricultural fragmentation on land value";"";"Societal expectations from rural lands have traditionally been focussed on the production of food andfibre. Yet the perception of rural areas is changing and they are now seen in many instances to becapable of delivering multiple functions or non-commodity outputs including land conservation andthe preservation of biodiversity, contributing to the sustainable management of renewable naturalresources and enhancing the socio-economic viability of many areas (OECD, 2001). The overallmultifunctionality is constrained or favoured by biophysical and socio-economic drivers. As thesetypes of drivers vary spatially and temporally, so does the functionality of the landscape andheterogeneous patterns emerge. Associated with multiple functions at a single location are a variety ofpressures which can manifest themselves as conflict between interacting land uses (Gimona and vander Horst, 2007; Willemen et al., 2010). One such conflict in rural zones is that between agriculturaluse and residential use.";"Versace, V.L.

However, the effectiveness of this technique may rely on the plant species used and the habitat conditions present. To assess the degree to which planting two native species, Haloxylon salicornicum and Calligonum polygonoides, facilitates degraded land restoration, soil and herbaceous plant community properties were measured 7 years after planting. Soil samples were extracted at two depths (0–5 and 5–20 cm) from three sub-habitats, i.e., under the shrub canopy, from alleys between shrubs and from the open area. Shrub planting increased the quantity of silt + clay content (30–39 %); enhanced water holding capacities (24–30 %); increased the levels of organic carbon (48–69 %), available nitrogen (31–47 %), available phosphorus (32–41 %), and electrical conductivity (21–33 %); and decreased the pH (7–12 %) and bulk density levels (5–6 %) in the surface layer of soils beneath the canopy. Soil property changes were more significant at the surface (0–5 cm) than in the deeper layer (5–20 cm), and were more pronounced under H. salicornicum than under C. polygonoides. Furthermore, the density and biomass levels of herbaceous plants were 1.1 to 1.2 and 1.4 to 1.6 times greater, respectively, in the shrub alleys than in open area. H. salicornicum induced more robust soil amelioration and herbaceous plant facilitative properties than did C. polygonoides. Artificially planting these shrubs may thus be employed to restore degraded areas of arid regions.";"Rathore, V. S.

"AGRIS:US201500204351";"Understanding Human–Coyote Encounters in Urban Ecosystems Using Citizen Science Data: What Do Socioeconomics Tell Us?";"";"The coyote (Canis latrans) has dramatically expanded its range to include the cities and suburbs of the western US and those of the Eastern Seaboard. Highly adaptable, this newcomer’s success causes conflicts with residents, necessitating research to understand the distribution of coyotes in urban landscapes. Citizen science can be a powerful approach toward this aim. However, to date, the few studies that have used publicly reported coyote sighting data have lacked an in-depth consideration of human socioeconomic variables, which we suggest are an important source of overlooked variation in data that describe the simultaneous occurrence of coyotes and humans. We explored the relative importance of socioeconomic variables compared to those describing coyote habitat in predicting human–coyote encounters in highly-urbanized Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, USA using 707 public reports of coyote sightings, high-resolution land cover, US Census data, and an autologistic multi-model inference approach. Three of the four socioeconomic variables which we hypothesized would have an important influence on encounter probability, namely building density, household income, and occupation, had effects at least as large as or larger than coyote habitat variables. Our results indicate that the consideration of readily available socioeconomic variables in the analysis of citizen science data improves the prediction of species distributions by providing insight into the effects of important factors for which data are often lacking, such as resource availability for coyotes on private property and observer experience. Managers should take advantage of citizen scientists in human-dominated landscapes to monitor coyotes in order to understand their interactions with humans.";"Wine, Stuart

"AGRIS:US201301610556";"conservation auction for landscape linkage in the southern Desert Uplands, Queensland";"";"Conservation auctions are a type of market-based instrument (MBI) that can achieve a more cost-efficient allocation of public funds than approaches such as devolved grants. In this paper, the conduct of a multiple round conservation auction to improve biodiversity management in a rangelands area is outlined. The auction was designed to develop a wildlife corridor across the southern Desert Uplands bioregion in Queensland and to improve management of rangelands areas. The conservation auction incorporated two important new design features. First, there was a need to promote landholder cooperation so that proposed areas for better land management were aligned and connected across the region. The second innovative design feature was to hold multiple bidding (three) rounds, which differs from the standard application of a single bidding round. The auction outcomes resulted in conservation contracts covering 85000ha of remnant vegetation awarded at an average cost of $2* per hectare per annum. Although complete landscape connectivity across the Desert Uplands was not achieved, over 70% of the successful bids, accounting for over 62000ha (77% of the total bid area), were part of a group that formed a distinct corridor or landscape linkage with only single or part-property gaps. The results also indicate that multiple bidding rounds improved auction efficiency (for the government), although there was little improvement in connectivity. Sixty-six percent more environmental benefit units could be purchased for the given budget of $350000 between rounds one and three.";"Windle, Jill

This article investigates the potential of structural biophysical variables as common parameters to consistently combine multi-sensor time series and to exploit them for land/crop cover classification. Artificial neural networks were trained based on a radiative transfer model in order to retrieve high resolution LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER from Landsat-8 and SPOT-4. The correlation coefficients between field measurements and the retrieved biophysical variables were 0.83, 0.85 and 0.79 for LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER, respectively. The retrieved biophysical variables’ time series displayed consistent average temporal trajectories, even though the class variability and signal-to-noise ratio increased compared to NDVI. Six random forest classifiers were trained and applied along the season with different inputs: spectral bands, NDVI, as well as FAPAR, LAI and FCOVER, separately and jointly. Classifications with structural biophysical variables reached end-of-season overall accuracies ranging from 73%–76% when used alone and 77% when used jointly. This corresponds to 90% and 95% of the accuracy level achieved with the spectral bands and NDVI. FCOVER appears to be the most promising biophysical variable for classification. When assuming that the cropland extent is known, crop type classification reaches 89% with spectral information, 87% with the NDVI and 81%–84% with biophysical variables";"Waldner, François

"AGRIS:US201500083634";"influence of litter quality and micro-habitat on litter decomposition and soil properties in a silvopasture system";"";"Studies to understand litter processes and soil properties are useful for maintaining pastureland productivity as animal husbandry is the dominant occupation in the hot arid region. We aimed to quantify how micro-habitats and combinations of litters of the introduced leguminous tree Colophospermum mopane with the grasses Cenchrus ciliaris or Lasiurus sindicus influence decomposition rate and soil nutrient changes in a hot desert silvopasture system. Litter bags with tree litter alone (T), tree + C. ciliaris in 1:1 ratio (TCC) and tree + L. sindicus 1:1 ratio (TLS) litter were placed inside and outside of the C. mopane canopy and at the surface, 3–7 cm and 8–12 cm soil depths. We examined litter loss, soil fauna abundance, organic carbon (SOC), total (TN), ammonium (NH₄–N) and nitrate (NO₃–N) nitrogen, phosphorus (PO₄–P), soil respiration (SR) and dehydrogenase activity (DHA) in soil adjacent to each litter bag. After 12 months exposure, the mean residual litter was 40.2% of the initial value and annual decomposition rate constant (k) was 0.98 (0.49–1.80). Highest (p < 0.01) litter loss was in the first four months, when faunal abundance, SR, DHA and humidity were highest but it decreased with time. These variables and k were highest under the tree canopies. The litter loss and k were highest (p < 0.01) in TLS under the tree canopy, but the reverse trend was found for litter outside the canopy. Faunal abundance, litter loss, k, nutrient release and biochemical activities were highest (p < 0.01) in the 3–7 cm soil layer. Positive correlations of litter loss and soil fauna abundance with soil nutrients, SR and DHA demonstrated the interactions of litter quality and micro-habitats together with soil fauna on increased soil fertility. These results suggest that a Colophospermum mopane and L. sindicus silvopasture system best promotes faunal abundance, litter decomposition and soil fertility. The properties of these species and the associated faunal resources may be utilised as an ecosystem-restoration strategy in designing a silvopasture system. This may help to control land degradation and increase productivity sustainably in this environment.";"Tripathi, G.

Both communal rights and individualized rights exist the latter being introduced with the establishment of commercial farms. The state is identified as one driving force behind property right changes especially in one study site (Ambash), which is suitable for irrigated agriculture whereas its direct intervention is minimal in other sites. The coercive interventions started in 1960s have had detrimental impacts on the livelihoods of pastoral households.

This use of past valuation information for current policy analysis is called benefit transfer. In this report, we present information from our database of 1239 consumer surplus estimates usable for benefit transfer that we created from our extensive literature review. The outdoor recreation use value database spans from 1967 through 2003 with activities ranging from birdwatching and picnicking to rock climbing and snorkeling. A park manager or other planner could easily use the information from our database to estimate consumer surplus values for a park, region, or activity, separately, or in combination. For instance, consumer surplus per person per day for wildlife viewing is US$35.30. However, if you are interested in a specific area, such as Alaska, you would find that the consumer surplus for wildlife viewing is US$41.11. Here, we see that the wildlife value in Alaska is higher than the overall average of wildlife viewing, which may be due to the fact that many people go to Alaska to see the big five: wolves, brown bears, dall sheep, caribou, and moose.

Proximity impacts extend beyond abutting properties and go as far as to those within almost a quarter of a mile.

"AGRIS:US201600001623";"Value of Landscapes in Northern Namibia: A System of Intertwined Material and Nonmaterial Services";"";"It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems provide varied services that should be considered in land management decisions. One of the challenges in the valuation of landscapes is that they often provide multiple services that combine into one social–ecological system. In this article we show how overlaps of those services can be measured, visualized, and explained. The results from a case study conducted in a rural community in northern Namibia show that in some landscapes, services are intertwined. We draw on a practice approach and ethnographic data to explain this finding and argue that services are related within places and fields of action. More specifically, we show that material services such as the provision of food and income form a unified whole with nonmaterial or “cultural” services such as beauty and social interaction and are often experienced simultaneously.

Transformed divergence was used to identify potential textural images which were calculated with the gray-level co-occurrence matrix method. The standard deviation of selected textural images and correlation coefficients between them were then used to determine the best combination of texture images for land-cover classification. Classification results based on different scenarios with maximum likelihood classifier were compared. Based on the identified best scenarios, different classification algorithms – maximum likelihood classifier, classification tree analysis, Fuzzy ARTMAP (a neural-network method), k-nearest neighbor, object-based classification, and support vector machine were compared for examining which algorithm was suitable for land-cover classification in the tropical moist region. This research indicates that the combination of radiometric images and their textures provided considerably better classification accuracies than individual datasets. The L-band data provided much better land-cover classification than C-band data but neither L-band nor C-band was suitable for fine land-cover classification system, no matter which classification algorithm was used. L-band data provided reasonably good classification accuracies for coarse land-cover classification system such as forest, succession, agropasture, water, wetland, and urban with an overall classification accuracy of 72.2%, but C-band data provided only 54.7%. Compared to the maximum likelihood classifier, both classification tree analysis and Fuzzy ARTMAP provided better performances, object-based classification and support vector machine had similar performances, and k-nearest neighbor performed poorly. More research should address the use of multitemporal radar data and the integration of radar and optical sensor data for improving land-cover classification.";"Li, Guiying

However, little is known about the potential effects of land management activities on chlorine biogeochemistry. This study examines the effects of previous nitrogen addition on chlorine chemistry in a Pinus sylvestris L. forest located in south-central Sweden (60°00′N, 13°43′E). Repeated addition of nitrogen to study plots over a 20-year period resulted in total additions of 0, 450 and 900� kg� N� ha⁻¹. Soil samples were collected before harvesting, and soil solution and biomass were sampled following final felling. Contrary to previous findings, we found no clear evidence that previous addition of nitrogen had hampered the formation of organic chlorine in the organic soil layer. We suggest that the effects of nitrogen addition on chlorination processes are not seen in the surface soil, but are instead manifested in the migration of organic matter in the mineral soil. Soil organic matter from the E-horizon had a lower chlorination degree in the nitrogen-amended plots than in the control plots. In addition, we observed lower Cl⁻ levels in the seedling needles following high nitrogen fertilization (900� N) than in 450� N or control. These results add on the importance of studying chlorine dynamics with focus on what chlorinated soil organic matter can be resistant to degradation compared to average soil organic matter and what can be leached as a result of harvesting and available for vegetation.";"Teresia, Svensson

Spatial pattern data of deep soil water content (SWC) at the regional scale are scarce due to the labour and time constraints of field measurements. We measured gravimetric deep SWC (DSWC) at depths of 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800 and 1000 cm at 382 sites across the Loess Plateau, China. The coefficient of variation was high for soil water content (SWC) in the horizontal direction (48%), but was relatively small for SWC in the vertical direction (9%). Semivariogram ranges for DSWC at different depths were between 198 and 609 km. Kriged distribution maps indicated that deep soil layers became moister along northwest to southeast transects. Multiple statistical analyses related DSWC to plant characteristics (e.g. plant age explained >21% of the variability), geographical location and altitude (8–13%), soil texture and infiltrability, evaporation zone and eco-hydrological processes (P < 0.05). Regional land management decisions can be based on our DSWC distribution data to determine land uses and plant species appropriate for the soil type and location that would maintain a stable soil water balance. Maintaining infiltrability is of great importance in this and other water-scarce regions of the world.Editor D. Koutsoyiannis; Associate editor J.

"AGRIS:US201400183105";"Evaluating weather effects on interannual variation in net ecosystem productivity of a coastal temperate forest landscape: A model intercomparison";"";"Forest productivity is strongly affected by seasonal weather patterns and by natural or anthropogenic disturbances. However weather effects on forest productivity are not currently represented in inventory-based models such as CBM-CFS3 used in national forest C accounting programs. To evaluate different approaches to modelling these effects, a model intercomparison was conducted among CBM-CFS3 and four process models (ecosys, CN-CLASS, Can-IBIS and 3PG) over a 2500ha landscape in the Oyster River (OR) area of British Columbia, Canada. The process models used local weather data to simulate net primary productivity (NPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and net biome productivity (NBP) from 1920 to 2005. Other inputs used by the process and inventory models were generated from soil, land cover and disturbance records. During a period of intense disturbance from 1928 to 1943, simulated NBP diverged considerably among the models. This divergence was attributed to differences among models in the sizes of detrital and humus C stocks in different soil layers to which a uniform set of soil C transformation coefficients was applied during disturbances. After the disturbance period, divergence in modelled NBP among models was much smaller, and attributed mainly to differences in simulated NPP caused by different approaches to modelling weather effects on productivity. In spite of these differences, age-detrended variation in annual NPP and NEP of closed canopy forest stands was negatively correlated with mean daily maximum air temperature during July–September (Tₐₘₐₓ) in all process models (R²=0.4–0.6), indicating that these correlations were robust. The negative correlation between Tₐₘₐₓ and NEP was attributed to different processes in different models, which were tested by comparing CO₂ fluxes from these models with those measured by eddy covariance (EC) under contrasting air temperatures (Tₐ). The general agreement in sensitivity of annual NPP to Tₐₘₐₓ among the process models led to the development of a generalized algorithm for weather effects on NPP of coastal temperate coniferous forests for use in inventory-based models such as CBM-CFS3: NPP′=NPP−57.1 (Tₐₘₐₓ−18.6), where NPP and NPP′ are the current and temperature-adjusted annual NPP estimates from the inventory-based model, 18.6 is the long-term mean daily maximum air temperature during July–September, and Tₐₘₐₓ is the mean value for the current year. Our analysis indicated that the sensitivity of NPP to Tₐₘₐₓ was nonlinear, so that this algorithm should not be extrapolated beyond the conditions of this study. However the process-based methodology to estimate weather effects on NPP and NEP developed in this study is widely applicable to other forest types and may be adopted for other inventory based forest carbon cycle models.";"Wang, Z.

"AGRIS:US201600059908";"Comparison of support vector machine, neural network, and CART algorithms for the land-cover classification using limited training data points";"";"Support vector machine (SVM) was applied for land-cover characterization using MODIS time-series data. Classification performance was examined with respect to training sample size, sample variability, and landscape homogeneity (purity). The results were compared to two conventional nonparametric image classification algorithms: multilayer perceptron neural networks (NN) and classification and regression trees (CART). For 2001 MODIS time-series data, SVM generated overall accuracies ranging from 77% to 80% for training sample sizes from 20 to 800 pixels per class, compared to 67–76% and 62–73% for NN and CART, respectively. These results indicated that SVM’s had superior generalization capability, particularly with respect to small training sample sizes. There was also less variability of SVM performance when classification trials were repeated using different training sets. Additionally, classification accuracies were directly related to sample homogeneity/heterogeneity. The overall accuracies for the SVM algorithm were 91% (Kappa=0.77) and 64% (Kappa=0.34) for homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels, respectively. The inclusion of heterogeneous pixels in the training sample did not increase overall accuracies. Also, the SVM performance was examined for the classification of multiple year MODIS time-series data at annual intervals. Finally, using only the SVM output values, a method was developed to directly classify pixel purity. Approximately 65% of pixels within the Albemarle–Pamlico Basin study area were labeled as “functionally homogeneous” with an overall classification accuracy of 91% (Kappa=0.79). The results indicated a high potential for regional scale operational land-cover characterization applications.";"Shao, Yang

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

We use an integrated economic and ecological modelling approach tocompare the results of the scenarios with a reference situation that reflects the Common AgriculturalPolicy prior to the Fischler Reform. The economic sub model is based on single farmswhich alter their land use in response to economic stimuli. Within the economic part, keyfactors like the farm’s endowment with machinery, quota and buildings but also the farmer’sattitude are regarded. Within the rule based ecological sub model we analyze three main parameters:(a) protected habitats according to the EC Habitats Directive, (b) biodiversity forselected taxonomic groups (plants, lichens, ground beetles) and (c) habitat quality of selectedtarget species (plants, butterflies). An overall evaluation of the scenarios leads to the conclusionthat the impact of the Fischler reform will be fairly limited in the study area, since at theobserved level of intensity the lower product prices will be compensated by higher directpayments. If all payments were strictly targeted to agri-environmental measures and set to alevel which guarantees a low input management of the grass land, the overall public expensescould be reduced by approx. 100 to 200 € ha-1. In addition this setting will provide additionalhabitats for the target species. However, the number of agricultural employment opportunitiesand the agricultural value added decline severely. Regarding all indicators but the extent ofprotected habitats and the public costs, a scenario of complete market liberalization performsthe worst.";"Roeder, Norbert

"AGRIS:US201400107259";"Multi-scale object-based image analysis and feature selection of multi-sensor earth observation imagery using random forests";"";"The random forest (RF) classifier is a relatively new machine learning algorithm that can handle data sets with large numbers and types of variables. Multi-scale object-based image analysis (MOBIA) can generate dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of variables used to classify earth observation (EO) imagery. In this study, a MOBIA approach is used to classify the land cover in an area undergoing intensive agricultural development. The information derived from the elevation data and imagery from two EO satellites are classified using the RF algorithm. Using a wrapper feature selection algorithm based on the RF, a large initial data set consisting of 418 variables was reduced by ∼60%, with relatively little loss in the overall classification accuracy. With this feature-reduced data set, the RF classifier produced a useable depiction of the land cover in the selected study area and achieved an overall classification accuracy of greater than 90%. Variable importance measures produced by the RF algorithm provided an insight into which object features were relatively more important for classifying the individual land-cover types. The MOBIA approach outlined in this study achieved the following: (i) consistently high overall classification accuracies (>85%) using the RF algorithm in all models examined, both before and after feature reduction; (ii) feature selection of a large data set with little expense to the overall classification accuracy; and (iii) increased interpretability of classification models due to the feature selection process and the use of variable importance scores generated by the RF algorithm.";"Duro, Dennis C.

Three features of the planning process were unique to the revision of the Tongass National Forest plan. First, a major goal was to produce a landscape-scale plan for long-term resource sustainability. Second, the 23-person planning team included six research scientists as full members. Finally, an agreement was reached between the Pacific Northwest Research Station and the Tongass National Forest to collaborate and obtain high-priority information needed for the next planning cycle. Benefits accrued to the Pacific Northwest Research Station by demonstrating the relevance of sound science in successful forest planning. Benefits also accrued to the USDA Forest Service Alaska Region in more informed, credible, and defensible decisions. Finally, benefits accrued at the national level when the process of conducting a science consistency check was incorporated into the regulations for forest planning.";"Everest, Fred H.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301704522";"http://hdl.handle.net/10113/36407";"";"";"";"13-24"
"AGRIS:US201500013965";"Assessing humification and organic C compounds by laser-induced fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopies under conventional and no-till management in Brazilian Oxisols";"";"Data on humification is important to assessing the rate and magnitude of soil carbon (C) sequestration. Thus, this study assessed the humification degree (HLIF) of soil organic matter (SOM) and the changes in functional C groups (aromatic-C and aliphatic-C) for contrasting land use and management practices (native vegetation (NV), conventional plow-based tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) systems) in sub-tropical and tropical Brazilian environments. Experiments were conducted at Ponta Grossa (PG) in Paraná State and Lucas do Rio Verde (LRV) in Mato Grosso State of Brazil. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIFS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies, were used on whole soil samples to 1-m depth, and on seven aggregate size classes (8–19, 4–8, 2–4, 1–2, 0.5–1, 0.25–0.5, 0.053–0.25mm) obtained by wet sieving of 0–5 and 5–10cm layers. Three functional C groups were selected based on FTIR: aliphatic-C₁ (1404cm⁻¹), aromatic-C (1632cm⁻¹), and aliphatic-C₂ (2852 and 2922cm⁻¹). The HLIF was 3 to 5 times higher at the LRV site than at PG at all soil depths, indicating that selective preservation by aromaticity of SOM is the predominant mechanism in this environment. Relatively lower HFIL was observed in NT soils at both locations because of aggregation which protects most labile moieties. The depletion of C concentration in CT was related to the decrease in functional C groups (i.e., aromatic-C and aliphatic-C) and an overall increase in the humification degree, indicating that physical protection mechanisms are not sufficient to protect the labile fractions of OM. In contrast, the intensity of functional C groups under NT systems was similar to that in the soil under NV at both locations. A discriminant analysis of principal components clearly showed that soils at both locations can be clustered into three groups, corresponding to the three main land-use and management practices. Thus, soils under NV, NT, and CT differed significantly in terms of the composition of organic compounds, and in the interactions between inorganic and organic fractions. Land use changes modify the arrangement of organic compounds necessitating the diversification of agroecosystems and conversion to NT farming. Altogether, our results reveal that LIFS and FTIR are fast, efficient, and precise techniques for analyzing the degree of SOC humification, functional C groups, and hence the efficiency of NT cropping systems in promoting long-term carbon sequestration in soils.";"Tivet, Florent

"AGRIS:US201400167512";"Can management induced changes in the carbonate system drive soil carbon sequestration? A review with particular focus on Australia";"";"In many important agricultural regions, soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks can rival the amount of carbon found in organic form. Land management practices, including irrigation, fertilization and liming, have the potential to greatly alter the soil inorganic carbon cycle thus creating an important feedback to atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. However, the current literature is less clear regarding the direction and magnitude of this feedback. Application of irrigation water, for example, can increase the rate of soil carbonate precipitation, but depending on the source of calcium and bicarbonate, the net reaction can be an atmospheric carbon sink, a carbon source or carbon neutral. Similarly, the accelerated dissolution of soil carbonates due to various acidifying processes can act as a net sink or source of atmospheric CO₂ depending on the spatial and temporal frame of reference. While SIC stocks in agricultural soils have been found to increase or decrease by as much as 1.0tCha⁻¹yr⁻¹, given the need to account for both the supply and fate of reactants and reaction products, ascribing these stock changes as a net sink or net source activity is difficult. This review paper provides an overview of the major inorganic carbon transformations in soils as affected by agricultural management, including the practice of liming to raise soil pH, and when these transformations should be considered a net atmospheric carbon source or sink.";"Sanderman, Jonathan";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400167512";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.04.015";"";"";"";"70-77"
"AGRIS:US201300965314";"Pasture and livestock management workshop for novices: a new curriculum for a new clientele";"";"Since 1994, urban-absentee landowners have dominated rural landownership in Texas. This landownership change has created potential environmental problems associated with natural resource management. Few of the new landowners have any formal training in the basics of the soil-plant-animal interface. The solution may be to develop a vehicle that provides the new class of landowners with basic information regarding natural resource management. Faculty members from the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Agricultural Research and Extension Center-Overton (representing both Texas Cooperative Extension and the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and having department affiliations with Soil and Crop Sciences, Animal Science, and Agricultural Economics) developed the Pasture and Livestock Management Workshop for Novices. The main goals in developing the program were to: (i) provide basic information regarding management of soil-plant-animal resources; and (ii) introduce the workshop participants to the educational resources available to them through the land-grant university system. To determine effectiveness of the program, pretests and posttests were administered to the workshop participants. To date, pretest scores have averaged 63.8 (D average), whereas posttest scores have averaged 80.3 (B average). Exit surveys were also conducted to determine the attitude of the workshop participants regarding the overall quality of their experience. The popularity of the workshop is such that, since the inception of the first workshop (2001), subsequent workshops have been booked nearly 1 year in advance. Given the combination of learning environment, mix of classroom and field laboratory exercises, and nonthreatening scientific presentations, we have little doubt that the Pasture and Livestock Management Workshop will continue to be a popular program with urban-absentee landowners.";"Redmon, L.A.

The goal was to set up empirical equations which can predict these hydrochemical properties for non-monitored river stretches from geodata of e.g. terrain attributes, lithology, soils, land cover and climate. For an extensive dataset of 1120 river water sampling locations average values of river water pH, alkalinity and PCO₂ were calculated. The catchment boundaries and catchment properties were calculated using GIS and different sets of geodata. The correlations between the hydrochemical properties and the catchment properties were explored using simple and multiple linear regression analysis. For each of the considered hydrochemical parameters, a multiple regression equation was fitted: for pH with the predictor's mean annual precipitation and areal proportions of carbonate rocks (r²=0.60); for alkalinity, in addition to these two predictors, with subsoil pH and areal proportions agricultural lands (r²=0.66); and for pPCO₂ (i.e. the negative logarithm of PCO₂) with mean air temperature, mean catchment slope gradient, and mean annual precipitation (r²=0.43). Based on these results, we argue that spatial patterns in river water pH and alkalinity are governed by catchment processes related to chemical rock weathering. For the PCO₂, on the other hand, the spatial patterns are governed by in-river processes on which catchment properties can have an indirect effect. We conclude that our approach can be used to predict averages of these parameters for non-monitored river stretches, which in-turn allows for a better spatially explicit representation of the rivers' carbonate system at the regional to global scale, which will be needed for a refined analysis of rivers in the global carbon cycle.";"Lauerwald, Ronny

In this paper we design a framed laboratory experiment on downstream water pollution to investigate (a) the importance of framing in determining the behavior of upstreamers regarding the negative externalities, and (b) the potential of downstreamers to influence the choices of upstreamers using non-monetary sanctions and rewards, alleviating the need for intervention by the local governments and regulatory institutions. Our results show that framing has a significant impact on the behavior of subjects. Subjects behaved more profit-oriented in the self-interest framing and more egalitarian in the empathy framing. In addition, we show that nudging subjects to “walk in the shoes of others” significantly increased empathetic behavior. Lastly, negative emotional feedback is a powerful tool for changing behavior of subjects towards more environmentally friendly and empathetic behavior. Interestingly, positive emotional feedback is counterproductive in that it instead decreases environmentally friendly and empathetic behavior. In general our results indicate that explicit emotional feedback, even though not expressed by everyone, works similarly to the implicit appeal to emotions through framing.";"Czap, Hans J.

"AGRIS:US201400176577";"Linking invertebrate communities to decomposition rate and nitrogen availability in pine forest soils";"";"Interpretation of biological indicators of soil quality depends on their ability to reflect ecological processes such as decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Mineral soils in pairs of relatively undisturbed and disturbed pine forests in each of three land resource regions of North Carolina (i.e., coastal plain, piedmont, and mountains) were monitored 15 times over two years. Abundance of nematodes in 35 families, collembolans in 8 families, and 16 other microarthropod taxa were enumerated. Nematodes were identified only in mineral soil whereas microarthropods were identified separately in litter and mineral soil. Rate (mg lost per day) of cellulose and wood decomposition were estimated based on weight loss of standardized substrates enclosed in litter baskets; available nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) and ammonium (NH₄ ⁺) were quantified in soil. Principal components analysis was performed on 59 invertebrate taxa to identify the taxa explaining the greatest proportion of variation in the monitored community. Soil microclimate and chemical properties were included as covariables. Canonical correlation was performed to quantify the relationship between soil invertebrate communities and indicators of ecological processes. Variation in soil N availability and decomposition rate was best explained when the two microfaunal communities, nematodes and arthropods, respectively, were examined separately. Nematode communities explained 2.3–6.9% of the variation in NO₃ ⁻ and NH₄ ⁺ availability, indicators of N mineralization, in disturbed forests compared to 8.6–12.4% in undisturbed forests. In contrast, arthropod communities explained 11–14.8% of the variation in decomposition rate in disturbed forests compared to 2.8–14.3% in undisturbed forests. These results are the first to quantify, from a wide and realistic spatial variability in the environmental factors, the value of in situ soil microfaunal communities as indicators of soil processes, N availability and decomposition.";"Neher, D.A.

"AGRIS:US201600125515";"multi-scale hierarchical framework for developing understanding of river behaviour to support river management";"";"This paper introduces this special issue of Aquatic Sciences. It outlines a multi-scale, hierarchical framework for developing process-based understanding of catchment to reach hydromorphology that can aid design and delivery of sustainable river management solutions. The framework was developed within the REFORM (REstoring rivers FOR effective catchment Management) project, funded by the European Union’s FP7 Programme. Specific aspects of this ‘REFORM framework’ and some applications are presented in other papers in this special issue. The REFORM framework is founded on previous hierarchical frameworks, sixteen examples of which are reviewed. However, the REFORM framework has some particular properties that reflect the European context for which it was developed. The framework delineates regional landscapes into nested spatial units at catchment, landscape unit, segment, reach, geomorphic unit and finer scales. Reaches, regardless of their ‘naturalness’, are assigned to a river type based on valley confinement, planform and bed material. Indicators are quantified at each spatial scale to feed three groups of assessments. First, contemporary indicators at reach and geomorphic unit scales investigate present processes, forms and human pressures within each reach. These feed assessments of present reach hydromorphological function/alteration, including whether the reach is functioning appropriately for its type; riparian corridor function and alteration; and hydromorphological adjustment. Second, indicators at catchment to segment scales investigate water and sediment production and delivery to reaches and how these are affected by human pressures now and in the past. These are used to construct an inventory of changes over space and time. Third, historical reach and geomorphic unit scale indicators are used to construct the trajectory of reach-scale changes. Contemporary reach-scale assessments, space–time inventory, and trajectory of changes are then combined to establish how river reaches of different type, subject to different human pressures, and located in different environmental contexts behave in response to changes at all considered spatial scales. These support forecasts of the likely responses of reaches to future scenarios (e.g., changes in climate, land cover, channel interventions).";"Gurnell, A. M.

"AGRIS:US201600125514";"Diagnosing problems produced by flow regulation and other disturbances in Southern European Rivers: the Porma and Curueño Rivers (Duero Basin, NW Spain)";"";"This research presents an analysis of river responses to flow regulation and other disturbances over time. The study was conducted in the Porma and Curueño rivers, using the hierarchical multi-scale process-based framework developed within the European REFORM Project. The characterisation of the rivers at the landscape unit, segment and reach scales under current and past conditions by different hydro-morphological indicators has provided a useful approach to (1) identify where and how main channel adjustments have occurred, (2) establish causal relationships at different scales and (3) discuss potential future scenarios and restoration strategies. Reduction of mean annual flow at the catchment scale has been observed and associated with forest expansion in the uplands. Channel narrowing, braiding reduction and riparian vegetation encroachment have occurred along both rivers, although with variable intensity among the reaches as a result of their landscape setting. Damming and flow regulation of the Porma River have been directly associated with locally accelerated narrowing, vertical bank profiles, the absence of bare gravel bars and no Salicaceae recruitment observed in certain reaches. The vertical bank profiles and the absence of in-channel bare gravel deposition forms are good indicators of sediment starvation downstream from the dam. The findings from this study suggest the importance of multi-scale approaches to assess the impacts of human-induced, short-term changes (e.g., flow regulation by dams and reservoirs) in the context of other disturbances at broader scales (e.g., climate and land cover changes) and their utility in the diagnosing problems and the proposal of restoration measures.";"González del Tánago, M.

"AGRIS:US201400064738";"Fertility management and landscape position: farmers' use of nutrient sources in western Niger and possible improvements";"";"Poor millet growth and yields in Niger are commonly attributed to rainfall deficits and low soil nutrient content. Land management by local farmers is done as a function of soil types, crops, and available resources. Farmer management practices in millet fields located on four different landscape positions were studied in a village in western Niger located near the 600 mm isohyet. Average distance from homestead to field was 980 m, with fields in the valley bottom much closer (average 225 m) and fields on the plateau much further (average 2300 m). Farmers considered the valley and plateau fields slightly more fertile than the other fields, but rainfall infiltration on plateau fields is often relatively poor. Nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the soil were highest on the less intensively cropped plateaus. More than 50% of the fields did not receive any applied nutrients other than during livestock grazing of leftover stover. Manure application was done through corralling in only four of the fields studied (20%), out of which three were farmed by Fulani using their own herds for manuring. There was no significant effect of landscape unit on yield, though yields in the valley and on the upper slope were slightly higher than average. Millet grain yields, soil carbon and soil phosphorus decreased significantly with distance from the living quarters. This may be because manuring usually takes place close to home (average distance in 1997 <200 m). Manure application increased millet grain production from 126 kg ha(−1) to 316 kg ha(−1) in 1997. Manuring yielded more than 1000 kg ha(−1) in 1996, when rainfall was much more favourable. Fallowed fields yielded an average 143 kg ha(−1) of millet grain in 1997, with fallow taking place an average of 1640 m from the homestead. Another soil fertility management practice included use of millet threshing residues in fields adjacent to the village. There was no chemical fertilizer application. Any improvement to the system will require the solution of existing constraints limiting the integration of livestock and crops and/or limiting the input of external sources of nutrients in Niger. These limitations can include lack of land to allow fallowing practices and/or grazing; local non-availability of mineral fertiliser; lack of capital to buy fertiliser, due in part to low millet prices; lack of means of transport for inputs; but also lack of means for pest control and lack of labour for sowing, weeding and thinning. Initial improvements may be made by making more efficient use of the available manure, through much lighter and slightly more frequent manuring of much larger areas.";"Gandah, M.

"AGRIS:US201301679657";"Trends in productivity of crops, fallow and rangelands in Southwest Niger: Impact of land use, management and variable rainfall";"";"To document trends in land use and herbaceous production, 71 field sites sampled among cropped fields, fallow fields and rangelands in the Fakara region (Niger) were monitored from 1994 to 2006. The overall trend in land use confirmed the historical increase of the cropped areas since mid 20th century, at an annual rate of 2% from 1994 to 2006. This trend is the result of changes in the relative extent of fields permanently cropped and fields under shifting cultivation, and for the latter, the relative proportion of short (3 years) and long (10 years) duration fallows. Type of land use together with topography and soil type determine the herbaceous production and the resulting yield measured towards the end of the wet season. The variation in site yields between years is of the same order of magnitude as the variation in yields between sites within a year. There is an overall decreasing trend in site yields by 5% annually from 1994 to 2006 that is not explained by variations in rainfall. The decreasing trend is observed on fields under shifting cultivation, fallowed fields and rangelands, although not all sites are equally affected. Causes are likely to be multiple which might include changes in land use, decline of soil fertility and increased grazing pressure. Indeed, the remaining rangelands on marginal land and the fallows still accessible to livestock are subject to such a heavy grazing during the rainy season that the herbaceous standing mass measured at the end of the season reflects poorly the actual production. After the two first years of cropping, the herbaceous yield in fields under shifting cultivation with no fertilisation is negatively affected by the number of successive years of cropping. Moreover, clearing fallow after a decreasing number of years affects the mean herbaceous yield of fallowed fields by reducing the contribution of more productive old fallows. Changes in land use, grazing pressure and soil fertility also triggered changes in species composition with a strong reduction in diversity from rangelands to fallows, and again from fallows to cropland weeds. No correlations was found however between productivity and species composition. Cumulative rainfall does not explain between site or between year deviations in herbaceous yield even when sites are sorted by land use type or by soil type in the case of fallow and rangelands. Simulated production calculated with the STEP model does not explain herbaceous yields much better even when sites are grouped by land use and soil type. However, relative changes of herbaceous yields are reasonably predicted on sites that remained fallowed and were not heavily grazed for at least four consecutive years.";"Hiernaux, Pierre

"AGRIS:US201400064731";"Use of the partial nutrient budget as an indicator of nutrient depletion in the highlands of southwestern Uganda";"";"Agricultural management has its roots in the manipulation of the system to optimise conditions for crop production. It is now widely recognised that this could result in land degradation with subsequent serious impact on crop productivity if the nutrient losses to the agricultural system are not replaced. A nutrient budget is an account of gains and losses of nutrients in an agricultural system, a tool that could be used to develop sound nutrient management and sustainable agriculture. This tool was applied to the annual crop farming system in the highlands of southwestern Uganda to demonstrate (i) within farm nutrient depletion and accumulating zones, and (ii) the extent of nutrient losses at farm and district levels through marketing pathways. Partial nutrient budgets were constructed at field and farm levels using farmer-recorded resource inputs and outputs over a period of one year, and at the district level using annual inventory data of agricultural imports and exports. The computed nutrient balances were highly variable at field and farm levels, but predominantly negative. Nitrogen (N) gains and losses averaged 30.6 and 72.3 kg ha(−1) yr(−1), respectively in the homestead fields; 10.8 and 33.4 kg ha(−1) yr(−1) in the outfields; 15.8 and 17.4 kg ha(−1) yr(−1) at the farm level; and only losses of 5.6 kg ha(−1) yr(−1) at the district level. Potassium (K) gains and losses followed a similar trend, although less in magnitude. The phosphorus (P) balance was positive but only in the homestead fields and at the farm level. Where agricultural produce were marketed, nutrient losses were reflected more at the higher scales (e.g. district level) and became tied up in pools from which recycling back to agriculture was barely feasible, and with quite alarming monetary implications. Such results can be used to influence policies at different scales on nutrient management.";"Bekunda, Mateete

Bush encroachment is prevalent in semi‐arid sites where Acacia mellifera Benth. is widespread in communal areas and private ranches, showing that land tenure changes over the last 40 years have not avoided rangeland degradation. Herbaceous cover is dominated in intensively grazed areas by the annual grass Schmidtia kalahariensis Stent and in moderately grazed areas by the perennial grass Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees. Nutritious perennial grass species including Eragrostis pallens Hack. Ex Schinz remain prevalent in Wildlife Management Areas. Other ecological changes include the invasion of the exotic Prosopis glandulosa Torr. and dense stands of Rhigozum trichotomum Kuntze. in the arid southwest. Regional patterns of wildlife species show that the expansion of cattleposts and fenced ranches has led to large areas of low wildlife conservation value even in areas where cattle production is not practiced. Findings show the need for integrated landscape‐scale planning of land use if the ecological value and biodiversity of the southern Kalahari is to be retained.";"Dougill, Andrew J.

"AGRIS:US201500213471";"Assessment of geo-hazards in a rapidly changing landscape: the three Gorges Reservoir Region in China";"";"Large dam projects attract worldwide scientific attention due to their environmental impacts and socioeconomic consequences. One prominent example is the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) at the Yangtze River in China. Due to considerable resettlements, large-scale expansion of infrastructure and shifts in land use and management, the TGD project has irreversible impacts on the Upper Yangtze River Basin and strongly challenges the environmental conditions of this fast-developing region. Soil erosion and landslides are major geo-hazards. Knowing the extent and consequences of those geo-hazards for the landscape is essential to predict and evaluate their risk potential and allows for the development of strategies for a sustainable future land use in the Three Gorges Region (TGR). In this context, our research objectives are (1) to better understand the mechanisms of soil erosion, landslides, and diffuse matter fluxes in the TGR and their anthropogenic and environmental control factors, (2) to predict their hazard potential by combining spatial and temporal, scenario-driven high-resolution modeling in combination with multi-scale earth observation data, and (3) to develop a multi-component approach for the assessment and monitoring of geogene structures and processes. The paper describes the workflow of the project and introduces case studies, representing the current state of our research. It is shown that land-use changes as well as the water-level fluctuations of the reservoir are the crucial drivers for the soil erosion and landslide hazard. Furthermore, we present a framework aiming at the establishment of a monitoring and measuring network as well as an early warning system.";"Strehmel, Alexander

Drawing production data from a household survey conducted in the highlands of Ethiopia, we estimate a stochastic production function to evaluate the effects of variety richness, land degradation, and their interaction on the mean and the variance of wheat yield. Ethiopia is a center of diversity for durum wheat and farmers manage complex variety mixtures on multiple plots. Econometric evidence shows that variety richness increases farm productivity. Variety richness also reduces yield variability but only for high levels of genetic diversity. Simulations with estimated parameters illustrate how planting more diverse durum wheat varieties on multiple plots contribute to improving farmer's welfare.";"Di Falco, Salvatore

In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion-activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves. Our study suggests that natural areas within urbanizing landscapes can be effective in providing habitat for some wildlife species.";"Haverland, Matthew B.

A simple measured index, that well represents relationship between shelterbelt structure and wind speed reduction, is required by landowners to enable them in establishing more effective shelterbelts. A three-dimensional crown (3D) density is proposed, which can be easily identified through shelterbelt parameters including maximum height, shelterbelt width, vertical crown/stem area ratio, and horizontal crown/stem area ratio. The utility of the index was tested in 10-year-old Casuarina equisetifolia and in 7-year-old Acacia auriculiformis shelterbelts in north central Coast of Vietnam. There was a significant negative linear relationship (R ²� =� 0.64, p� <� 0.001) between 3D density and wind speed reduction efficiency, while there was no relationship between a two-dimensional crown density and wind speed reduction efficiency. Reduction efficiency was found to increase at higher wind speeds in shelterbelts of A. auriculiformis, but not C. equisetifolia. The A. auriculiformis shelterbelt was more efficient in reducing wind speed compared to C. equisetifolia shelterbelt. The former recovered 70� % wind speed at 130� m (16.5H) leeward, while it recovered 70� % at 85� m (8H) leeward in C. equisetifolia shelterbelt.";"Van Thuyet, Dang

Lower drug development costs, and hence prices, can be brought about by abolishing national drug administrations and replacing them with private certification boards that compete on the basis of safety, efficiency and cost of their drug approval process. A major benefit of this type of privatization is that it would not necessitate limits on data exclusivity in order to achieve lower prices.

"AGRIS:US201500085803";"Dynamics of people's socio-economic status in the face of schistosomiasis control interventions in Ukerewe district, Tanzania";"";"There is a paucity of research on micro-level assessment of the dynamics of socio-economic status following health interventions. The use of household asset data to determine wealth indices is a common procedure for estimating socio-economic position in low-income countries. Indeed, in such settings information about income is usually lacking and the collection of individual consumption or expenditure data would require in-depth interviews, posing a considerable risk of bias. In this study, we determined the socio-economic status of 159 households in a village in north-western Tanzania before and 1 year after participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention to control schistosomiasis. We constructed a household ‘wealth index’ based on durable assets ownership (e.g. bicycle and radio) and household characteristics dealing with ownership of land and house construction features (e.g. type of walls and roof). We employed principal components analysis and classified households into wealth quintiles. The study revealed that asset variables with positive factor scores were associated with higher socio-economic status, whereas asset variables with negative factor scores were associated with lower socio-economic status. Overall, households which were rated as the poorest and very poor were on the decrease, whereas those rated as poor, less poor and the least poor were on the increase after PHAST intervention. This decrease/increase was significant. The median shifted from −0.761 to −0.448, and the mean from −0.204 (standard deviation (SD) 1.924) to 0.193 (SD 2.079) between pre- and post-intervention phases. The difference in socio-economic status of the people comparing the pre- and post-intervention phases was highly statistically significant (p<0.001). This observation was confirmed by a multinomial model with a random effect on the households. We argue that significant changes in the socio-economic status observed in our study are attributable to the PHAST intervention, despite other sporadic interventions against schistosomiasis.";"Mwanga, Joseph R.

Policies that encourage cleanup and re-use of brownfields offer real estate developers reductions in regulatory burden, relief from liability for future cleanups once certain mitigation standards are met, and/or financial support for regeneration of brownfields.  We use conjoint choice experiments-a stated preference approach-to assess the responses of real estate developers to different mixes of these incentives. Our survey instrument was administered in person to a sample of developers and real estate professionals randomly intercepted at the Marché International des Professionnels de l'Immobilier (MIPIM) in Cannes, France, in March 2002. Conditional and random-coefficient logit models of the responses to the choice questions indicate that developers find sites with contamination problems less attractive than others, and that they value liability relief. This confirms our expectation that contaminated sites are less desirable because of the associated cleanup costs, but refutes earlier claims that liability does not matter. Our developers are not deterred by prior contamination, once it has been cleaned up, suggesting that ""contamination stigma"" is not very important, and appreciate fast-track review of development and remediation plans, direct financial incentives, and flexible (negotiable) cleanup standards. Developers with prior experience with contaminated sites are more responsive to the policies than are inexperienced developers, especially for subsidies. Inexperienced developers are more responsive to liability relief and regulatory relief than they are to subsidies. Similar considerations hold true for larger developers.";"Alberini, Anna

We combine two high‐resolution sediment records from Iffigsee (2065 m a.s.l.) and Lauenensee (1382 m a.s.l.) at different elevations in the Northern Swiss Alps to provide a detailed history of vegetational changes during the period of first pastoralism (ca. 7000–5000 cal. BP, 5000–3000 BC) in order to understand ongoing and future changes in mountain ecosystems. We use palaeoecological methods (fossil pollen, spore, microscopic charcoal and macrofossil analysis) as well as ecological ordination techniques and time‐series analysis to quantify the impact of fire and grazing on natural mountain vegetation at Iffigsee. Fire was used by Neolithic people to create pastures at timberline and clear forests for arable farming in the valley. This had a significant, long‐term effect on the mountain vegetation and a negative impact on keystone forest species such as Abies alba, Larix decidua and Pinus cembra. The mass expansion of Picea abies at ca. 5500 cal. BP (ca. 3500 BC) was facilitated by anthropogenic disturbance (fire, grazing and logging) causing an irreversible decline in Abies alba. Temperate Abies alba forests, which existed under warmer‐than‐today conditions, might be better adapted to projected climate change than today's drought‐sensitive Picea abies forests, especially under low anthropogenic disturbance following land abandonment. Synthesis. Human impact for millennia has shaped mountain vegetation in the Alps and still continues to have a large effect on today's species composition and distribution. Fire and traditional pastoralism have the potential to mitigate the effects of climate change, maintain species‐rich high‐alpine meadows and prevent biodiversity losses.";"Schwörer, Christoph

The approach referred to as stratified relative radiometric normalization (SRRN) uses a time-series of imagery to stratify the landscape for localized radiometric normalization. The goal is to improve the detection accuracy of abrupt land cover changes (human-induced, natural disaster, etc.) while decreasing false detection of natural vegetation changes that are not of interest. These vegetation changes may be associated with such phenomena as phenology, growth and stress (e.g. drought), which occur at varying spatial and temporal scales, depending on landscape position, vegetation type, season, precipitation history and historic episodes of local disturbance. The SRRN approach was tested for a study area on the Californian border between the USA and Mexico using Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite imagery. Change products were generated from imagery radiometrically normalized using the SRRN procedure and with imagery normalized using a traditional empirical line technique. Reference data derived from high spatial resolution airborne imagery were utilized to validate the two change products. The SRRN procedure provided several benefits and was found to improve the overall accuracy of detecting abrupt land cover changes by nearly 20%.";"Coulter, Lloyd L.

The Common Agricultural Policy, substantially reformed in the Luxemburg Compromise, will be considered in the framework of the “Health Check”. Against this background, the regional developments anticipated in dairy production, beef cattle husbandry and agricultural land use by the year 2015 are analysed with the help of the regionalized agricultural sector model RAUMIS. Simulations on the adaptability of dairy production under different market conditions are carried out with regard to the expiration of the dairy quota regulation. The farming intensity on arable land is generally increasing due to the increase in agricultural prices, the elimination of set aside obligation and the promotion of renewable resource crops. The increasing competitiveness of cash crops is speeding the departure of dairy production from arable crop areas into competitive grassland regions. In contrast, milk production is either constant or reduced on less competitive grassland locations. Among the regions reducing production are, according to the model results, low mountain ranges with high levels of grassland, for example in the Black Forest, in the Schwäbisch Alp, in the Hessian Mountain area in parts of the Eifel and parts of the Hunsrück. In the course of the many decades of milk quota system, a significant milk production potential was deactivated which could play a large role when the quota regulations expire. Based on a calculated “milk equilibrium price” at which the quota amounts are exactly produced, a price increase of ten percent leads to a long term expansion of the milk produced by about six million tons. There is thus no reversal of the successive milk production reductions in the least competitive regions, not even through significantly higher direct payments distributed in the framework of the introduction of the “regional model” in grassland regions, since these are decoupled payments. Should this drop in milk production have negative consequences for other sectors, for example tourism, it is to question, whether specific measures should be developed for the affected regions.";"Kreins, Peter

Two Landsat images were acquired for Pittsfield Township, MI, USA, classified, and overlaid to produce a map of change. Error variables were created for the classified maps. Hypotheses were proposed describing the spatial and temporal structures of error in the classified maps, and evaluated using geostatistics and point pattern analysis. Results showed that the spatial error structure for all three classified maps was composed of both a small-scale, local error interactions, and a large-scale trend. Errors in the individual land-cover (LC) maps interacted as a result of temporal dependence, which increased the expected accuracy of the map of change.

The results from parametric and non-parametric analysis indicated that productivity from conserved plots was lower than from non-conserved plots. The Oaxaca-Blinder productivity decomposition results showed that there was little difference in plot characteristics between conserved and non-conserved plots, however the returns to those characteristics were higher for non-conserved plots. The sensitivity analysis, increasing fodder grass production on bunds, suggests that there are possibilities to make conserved plots as productive as non-conserved ones. The findings imply that fanya juu bunds may be inappropriate to the local conditions under the existing condition. Farmers in the study area reported that these bunds h ave problem of water-logging, reduce land available for production, and create difficulties in turning the ox-drawn plough due to narrow bund sp acing. Apart from these, there is no attempt made to integrate these bunds with soil fertility management techniques.

These sites are the Luwian settlements of Kelenderis (modern Aydıncık) and nearby Nagidos (Bozyazı), both in Mersin Province and both occupied since around 4000 BP. Changes in local climatic conditions over this period have produced variations in the rates of fluvial transport of sediment/soil from the hinterland into the relevant deltaic regions, thus influencing rates of coastal progradation and aggradation. In addition, both eustatic and neotectonic movements have contributed to deltaic subsidence and/or hinterland uplift, with consequential impact on coastal evolution (positive or negative). The novel geoarchaeological methodology adopted in this study involves the creation of a graphical archive from detailed and standardised measurements taken from rectified mono- and stereoscopic aerial photographs. These archival data were then integrated with data from several types of historical map and field measurements in order to develop a geographical information system (GIS) database that could be interrogated, enabling graphical models of past coastal change to be constructed and calculations then made of the coastal configurations at successive historical periods. These calculations reveal that over the past 6000 years there has been only limited erosion/degradation in the karstic hinterland supplying the sediment to these two study sites (contrary to some previous statements concerning the high degradation risk of Mediterranean karst terrains). Furthermore, rates of progradation in each delta appear to have become diminished or even reversed in the past several decades as a result of both natural and anthropogenic factors. The precise contribution of neotectonic movements in this seismically active zone remains unquantified and is a topic requiring further interdisciplinary study.";"Bal, Y.

"AGRIS:US201400064862";"Formalizing expert judgements in land degradation assessment: a case study for Ethiopia";"";"Expert judgements are potentially a valuable source of information in land degradation assessment, especially in areas where data paucity impedes the use of quantitative models. However, expert opinions are also much disputed because they are not tested for consistency, abstain from formal documentation, while their quantitative interpretation is inherently unidentifiable. This paper evaluates and formalizes the use of expert judgements to conduct a nationwide water erosion hazard assessment in Ethiopia. We, therefore, test the experts' judgement for consistency, its correlation with quantitative measurements on soil loss and its reproducibility. The study uses an Ethiopian and an international dataset for which experts gave qualitative judgements on water erosion hazard, for well-described sites under different types of land uses. Experts show a high consistency in their judgements on land degradation, but a comparison with quantitative soil losses from runoff plots reveals that boundaries of middle classes vary widely between experts, while they tend to overestimate soil loss. Reproducing expert opinions with an ordered logit model shows a reasonable accuracy in predicting presence or absence of erosion, yet the model is less precise in distinguishing between higher erosion classes. In 58 per cent of the cases, the model gives a similar classification as the experts, in 19 per cent the model estimates higher and, more seriously, in 23 per cent a lower erosion class. Mapping the model results for Ethiopia demonstrates a high erosion hazard for land under annual crop cultivation, while erosion under perennial crops, rangeland and forest is absent or moderate. The likelihood of the model to select the correct hazard class for rangeland is relatively high but medium to low probabilities prevail for erosion classes of other land uses. The model needs a further justification to give adequate results for arid areas.";"Sonneveld, B.G.J.S.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land degradation;rangelands";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ETH";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400064862";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.564";"";"";"";"347-361"

"AGRIS:US201600186452";"Reviewing the role of habitat banking and tradable development rights in the conservation policy mix";"";"Habitat banking and tradable development rights (TDR) have gained considerable currency as a way of achieving âno net lossâ of biodiversity and of reconciling nature conservation with economic development goals. This paper reviews the use of these instruments for biodiversity conservation and assesses their roles in the policy mix. The two instruments are compared in terms of effectiveness, cost effectiveness, social impact, institutional context and legal requirements. The role in the policy mix is discussed highlighting sequential relationships, as well as complementarities or synergies, redundancy and conflicts with other instruments, such as biodiversity offsets and land-use zoning.Habitat banking and TDR have the potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation objectives and attain cost-effective solutions with positive social impacts on local communities and landowners. They can also help to create a new mind-set more favourable to public-private cooperation in biodiversity conservation. At the same time, these policy instruments face a number of theoretical and implementation challenges, such as additionality and equivalence of offsets, endurance of land-use planning regulations, monitoring of offset performance, or time lags between restoration and resulting conservation benefits.A clear, enforceable regulatory approach is a prerequisite for the success of habitat banking and TDR. In return, these schemes provide powerful incentives for compliance with regulatory norms and ensure a more equitable allocation of the benefits and costs of land-use controls and conservation. Environmentally harmful subsidies in other policy sectors as well as alternative offset options, however, reduce the attractiveness and effectiveness of these instruments. Thus, the overall performance of habitat banking and TDR hinges on how they are integrated into the biodiversity conservation policy mix and fine-tuned with other sectoral policies.";"SANTOS, RUI

A socio-economic model of farmers' decisions on intercropping as an indicator for overall crop diversity was developed. The study was conducted between November 2009 and March 2010 in five districts in Tanzania, which were selected on the basis of the coconut's economic importance, using structured questionnaires which were administered to 200 household heads. Respondents were categorized in three groups – resource-poor farmers (43% of sample), medium-level farmers (50%) and well-off farmers (7%) according to six criteria. More than 80% of farmers were aware of the negative effects of the coconut mite. The result further indicated that the damaged nuts cause a loss of more than 30% of the cash income from coconut. Intercropping coconut with cassava, maize, cashew nut, sorghum and pineapples were the alternatives used by farmers to cope with declining coconut production caused by coconut mite and lethal yellowing disease. Land ownership and size, income from crops, non-farm income and family size were the main factors that influenced the farmer's decision to diversify crops. Although farmers diversify their cropping systems in order to be self-reliant, there is still a need to promote policies and programmes that will address coconut production constraints such pests and diseases such as rehabilitation of old plantations.";"Oleke, Jofrey M.

However, the programs do not require that farming activities be maintained in the future.  Farming may be discontinued on PDR parcels due to changes in economic conditions or if the parcels are converted to non-farm, rural estates.  Such changes may reduce the flow of public goods that citizens seek to obtain by implementing PDR programs.  We examine changes in land use on PDR parcels to determine if current activities are consistent with program goals.  While changes have occurred in the crops and livestock produced on Rhode Island farms, over time, all of the farms on which development rights were purchased during 1985 through 1999 are currently being farmed by the original owners or by new operators who have either purchased or leased the land.";"Wichelns, Dennis

The desert area exhibited high salinity in the top 10 m, probably due to concentration of salts over several years. Below 15 m, the salinity decreased with depth and approached the salinity of the native ground water. For the irrigated area, the chemical composition of the soil water was similar to that of the applied water but concentrations were higher. The irrigation efficiency calculated from the salinities of the irrigation and soil water was 78%.The average NO3-concentration from five of six sites was 100 mg/l, but was as high as 24,000 mg/l at another. Soil water from the urban runoff site had an electrical conductivity that was about three times less than that from the irrigated site, showing the effect of leaching with rain water. The observed salt distributions in the vadose zone were reasonably correlated to land use at the sites sampled.";"Rice, R.C.

This limits predictions of edge effects on remnant vegetation in cleared agricultural landscapes, and of changes in these effects with reforestation. Using fixed and roving weather stations, we examined influences on temperate woodland microclimate of adjoining land use (agriculture versus tree plantation), distance from edge (0-150m), and woodland structural attributes (canopy openness, stem density and basal area). Shading by plantations significantly decreased temperatures and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) at woodland edges in winter (up to 0.8°C and 75Pa relative to agricultural edges). However, this effect was reversed in the non-winter months, when daytime temperatures and VPD were generally greater at plantation than agricultural edges (up to 0.5°C and 300Pa). This was the opposite of edge-type effects recorded for closed-forest types, and was explained by lower wind speeds at plantation edges, which led to the accumulation of heat in the 25m firebreak between the two land uses. A similar 'dead zone' also apparently contributed to cooler, moister night-time conditions at plantation edges. Consistent with closed forests, and irrespective of edge type and season, we measured a depth of edge influence of 40-50m for daytime temperature and VPD. However, magnitude of edge influence (ca. 0.5°C and 100Pa) was much less than in closed forests, and woodland interiors were warmer and drier than edges, whereas closed-forest interiors are usually cooler and moister than edges. This unique microclimate gradient into woodlands was explained both by decreasing wind speeds, and by positive relationships of temperature and VPD with basal area and stem density, highlighting the role of sub-canopy heat sinks like tree trunks in regulating interior microclimates of sparse vegetation types.";"Wright, Thomas E.

"AGRIS:US201400177627";"Mongolian pine plantations enhance soil physico-chemical properties and carbon and nitrogen capacities in semi-arid degraded sandy land in China";"";"Horqin Sandy Land is a seriously desertified and an ecologically fragile region of China. Soil degradation and desertification in this region are the result of several decades of overgrazing, non-manure cropping with short fallow, and arbitrary land use and management. We investigated whether the afforestation of active sand dunes with Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) enhances the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storages and the overall soil quality. We compared soil physico-chemical properties, and C and N storages in the total and light fraction soil organic matter of active sand dunes, and of 25- and 35-year-old plantations. Soil water holding capacity, fine particle content and nutrients were significantly higher in plantations than in active sand dunes, with greater improvements occurring in the top 5cm than in the 5–15cm layer of the soil profile. Soil C and total N storages were 6.1 and 3.7 folds in 25-year-old, and 10.2 and 5.3 folds in 35-year-old plantations compared to active sand dunes, respectively. Carbon and N storages in the light fraction were 20.9 and 15.8 folds in 25-year-old, and 36.1 and 25.0 folds in 35-year-old plantations, respectively, relative to active sand dunes. The light fraction played an important role in soil C sequestration and its amount is an indicator of the effects of afforestation on C storage in sandy soil. The upper 15cm of the soil profile in the 35-year-old plantations of Mongolian pine has the capacity to sequester significant amount of C in the region, potentially offsetting part of the carbon that has been lost due to desertification over the past century in the Horqin Sandy Land. Our results conclude that afforestation with Mongolian pine has had positive impacts on soil quality and has increased the capacity for soil C sequestration in semi-arid degraded areas.";"Li, Yuqiang

However, the dynamics of the natural resources in relation to different biophysical and socio-economic factors are still remains poorly understood. The present study investigates the basic natural resources i.e. forest, rangeland and surface water bodies’ status using satellite data for the years 1990, 1998, and 2006, and their change detection in relation to biophysical and socio-economic factors. Monitoring land-use/cover change detection using remotely sensed data has been a well recognized technique. The analysis of change detection revealed eleven important land cover changes, which occurred during the past 16 years (1990–2006) in the region. The rate of land cover change was observed to vary across the sub periods and a general decline of forest cover and increase in rangelands and water bodies was observed. Logistic regression model was employed to analyze the relationship between changes and explanatory factors. The land cover change results and logistic models developed in this study are useful in supporting natural resources management efforts and provide useful information for managers/policy makers in formulation of sustainable management strategies for the region.";"Torahi, Ali A.

The data for identification of LC changes were taken from the 1990 and 2006 CORINE LC (CLC) data layers. They were derived by computer-aided visual interpretation of satellite images under the CLC Projects. The data about frequency of flood events in small catchments are from the period 1996-2006. Two hypotheses were formulated: (1) the greater the area of LC changes, the more frequent flood events; (2) in catchments where LC changes accelerating formation of direct runoff (e.g. urbanization, deforestation, farming) dominates, flood events are more frequent than in catchments where the prevailing LC changes (e.g. afforestation) reduce formation of direct runoff. Validity of hypotheses was tested in the framework of flood potential of catchments by two-factor ANOVA method. The obtained results indicate that (1) flood event frequency increases with the increasing total area of LC changes in a catchment. This tendency clearly manifests itself in catchments with very high flood potential. It is somewhat less distinct in catchments with moderate and high flood potentials. (2) There were no differences in flood event frequency between the group of catchments, where LC changes accelerating the formation of the direct runoff prevailed and the group of catchments where LC changes decelerating the formation of direct runoff were dominated.";"Solín, Ľubomír

"AGRIS:US201301696246";"Wild Ungulate Herbivory of Willow on Two National Forest Allotments in Wyoming";"";"Willows (Salix) are important riparian plants and often used to indicate riparian condition. Many herbivores feed on willows, but there is limited information about willow browsing by wildlife except in national parks. This study was conducted to estimate wild ungulate herbivory of willow on two US Forest Service allotments in northern Wyoming and to compare these values to published estimates for national parks. We also compared total annual and seasonal willow utilization by wildlife between sites dominated by willows of different heights. The effects of height category, site, and season on willow utilization were determined with a repeated measures analysis. Four permanent willow utilization transects were established at each of six study sites per allotment on two allotments, in communities supporting planeleaf (Salix planifolia Pursh), Wolf's (Salix wolfii Bebb), Drummond's (Salix drummondiana Barratt ex Hook.), or Eastwood's (Salix eastwoodiae Cock. ex A. Heller) willow. Twenty-five twigs were marked per transect (distributed across 6–12 plants/transect). Lengths of marked twigs were recorded on four dates to estimate willow utilization for winter/spring, summer, and late summer/fall periods. Total annual willow utilization on one allotment (53%) was similar to published estimates for national parks (P=0.0864), whereas utilization for the other allotment (58%) was greater (P=0.0421) than national parks. Seasonal patterns of willow utilization differed among sites within height categories (P<0.001). Total annual willow utilization by wildlife also varied by site within height category (P=0.0165) but was not greater for short (43–56%) versus tall (59–63%) willow communities. Wildlife browsing of willow in this study equaled, or exceeded, estimates for national parks, where concern has been expressed about willow community conditions. Generalizations about willow utilization for tall and short willow communities are problematic. Management decisions should be based on site-specific information as opposed to generalizations.";"Meiman, Paul J.

"AGRIS:US201400143173";"Three distinct global estimates of historical land-cover change and land-use conversions for over 200 years";"";"Earth’s land cover has been extensively transformed over time due to both human activities and natural causes. Previous global studies have focused on developing spatial and temporal patterns of dominant human land-use activities (e.g., cropland, pastureland, urban land, wood harvest). Process-based modeling studies adopt different strategies to estimate the changes in land cover by using these land-use data sets in combination with a potential vegetation map, and subsequently use this information for impact assessments. However, due to unaccounted changes in land cover (resulting from both indirect anthropogenic and natural causes), heterogeneity in land-use/cover (LUC) conversions among grid cells, even for the same land use activity, and uncertainty associated with potential vegetation mapping and historical estimates of human land use result in land cover estimates that are substantially different compared to results acquired from remote sensing observations. Here, we present a method to implicitly account for the differences arising from these uncertainties in order to provide historical estimates of land cover that are consistent with satellite estimates for recent years. Due to uncertainty in historical agricultural land use, we use three widely accepted global estimates of cropland and pastureland in combination with common wood harvest and urban land data sets to generate three distinct estimates of historical land-cover change and underlying LUC conversions. Hence, these distinct historical reconstructions offer a wide range of plausible regional estimates of uncertainty and the extent to which different ecosystems have undergone changes. The annual land cover maps and LUC conversion maps are reported at 0.5°×0.5° resolution and describe the area of 28 landcover types and respective underlying land-use transitions. The reconstructed data sets are relevant for studies addressing the impact of land-cover change on biogeophysics, biogeochemistry, water cycle, and global climate.";"Meiyappan, Prasanth

Currently there are strong concerns about surface water nutrient pollution, and the purpose of this study was to determine the impacts of temperate rice cultivation on nutrient dynamics at the small watershed scale. Over the course of the 2008 growing season (May through September), bi-weekly grab samples were collected from outlets of 11 agricultural subwatersheds in California. Samples were analyzed for NO₃-N, NH₄-N, PO₄-P, K, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, and the average values across all subwatersheds and sampling dates were 0.22, 0.031, 0.047, 1.36, and 0.32mgL⁻¹, respectively. Linear mixed effects analysis was used to evaluate the magnitude of relationships between nutrient concentration and flux and subwatershed characteristics (i.e. percent soil clay and organic matter, percent rice area, irrigation water reuse, subwatershed discharge, irrigated area, and time, measured as the day in the growing season). For all nutrients, flux decreased over time and increased with discharge. Concentrations of K and DON were highest at the start and end of the growing season. Concentrations of NH₄-N were near non-detect levels, with the exception of a peak in mid-July, which corresponds to when many growers top-dress rice fields with N fertilizer. Nitrate-N concentration and flux decreased with percent rice area, whereas PO₄-P concentrations increased with percent rice area, indicating that rice area should be considered in future watershed-scale studies of nutrient discharge. In all subwatersheds, the discharge loads of K were smaller than surface water input loads, while NO₃-N, NH₄-N, PO₄-P, and DON discharge loads exceeded input loads when total growing season discharge was greater than 3500–6600m³ha⁻¹. This implies that the management of subwatershed discharge can be used to control nutrient export from rice-growing areas.";"Krupa, Monika

Agricultural land use has benefited significantly from the use of suitability systems in recent years. These systems have jointly showed their capabilities in the evaluation and assessment of suitable sites for a variety of crops.In the present study and research work land suitability evaluation (qualitative classification) has been determined for onion, potato, maize and alfalfa in Khalat pushan research station of Tabriz University in East Azerbaijan by using of Simple Limitation method (SLM), Limitation Method regarding Number and Intensity (LMNI) and parametric (PM) such as square root and storie methods. Climate, soil and landscape qualities and their characteristics which most influence crop suitability have been combined by the adopted methodology. In this study economic factors have been excluded and moderate management has been assumed. The use of different methods showed that the most important limitation factors are climate, lime, pH, OM, texture and gravel alone or in combinations. Evaluation indicates that SLM and LMNI show similar suitability classes, which confirms the previous findings for several crops by other researchers. However, in many cases the use of parametric methods, especially the square root method revealed to be more realistic in showing the distinguished suitability classes in many cases. Therefore, based on the obtained results (especially by the square root method), the cultivation of alfalfa, potato and onion can be recommended, except for soil profile 2, which is not suitable (N2) for onion.";"Jafarzadeh, Ali

In the Rio Grande Plains region of southern Texas, previous studies have shown woody encroachment by leguminous Prosopis glandulosa (mesquite) trees increases soil C and N, decreases microbial biomass N relative to soil N, and accelerates N mineralization and nitrification. We examined responses of the dominant organic N components in soil (amino acids and amino sugars) and two soil-bound protein-N acquiring enzymes (arylamidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase) along a grassland-to-woodland successional chronosequence to determine changes to soil N chemistry and extractability. The proportion of total N held within amino compounds was significantly lower in the woodlands (47 %) relative to the grassland soils (62 %). This increase in non-hydrolysable N was accompanied by increases in plant cell wall derived amino acids (e.g. hydroxyproline, serine) and losses of microbial amino sugars, indicating the woodland organic N pool was altered in composition and potentially in quality, either because it was more structurally protected or difficult to degrade due to polymerization/condensation reactions. Soil carbon-normalized activities of both soil-bound N-acquiring enzymes were significantly higher in woodland soils, consistent with changes in the biochemical composition of organic N. Although soil total N increases following woody encroachment, this additional organic N appears to be less extractable by chemical hydrolysis and thus potentially in more refractory forms, which may limit microbial N accessibility, slow the cycling of soil organic carbon, and contribute to observed soil C and N accrual in these systems.";"Creamer, Courtney A.

"AGRIS:US2012200178";"Determinants and Effects on Property Values of Participation in Voluntary Cleanup Programs: The Case of Colorado";"";"State Voluntary Cleanup Programs (VCPs) were established starting in the 1990s to encourage the environmental remediation and redevelopment of contaminated properties. These programs typically offer liability relief, subsidies and other regulatory incentives in exchange for site cleanup. This paper asks three questions: First, what type of properties are attracted to voluntary cleanup programs? Second, what is the interaction between these state programs and other incentives for remediation and economic development, such as Enterprise Zone and Brownfield Zone designations? Third, what is the effect of participation in the VCP on property values? We use data from Colorado's VCP to answer these questions. We find that most of the properties enrolled in this program were not previously listed on EPA's contaminated site registries, and that most applicants seek to obtain directly a no further action determination without undergoing remediation. The main determinants of participation are the size of the parcel and whether the surrounding land use is primarily residential, while other incentives have little effect. Properties with confirmed contamination sell at a 47% discount relative to comparable uncontaminated parcels, and participation tends to raise the property price, but this latter effect is not statistically significant. Taken together, these findings suggest that the participating properties are those with high development potential, and hint at the possibility that owners or developers may be seeking to obtain a clean bill of health from the State with only minimal or no cleanup efforts. Were these findings confirmed with data from other states, they would raise doubts about the effectiveness of voluntary programs in encouraging remediation and their usefulness in reversing some of the undesired effects of the Superfund legislation.";"Alberini, Anna";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012200178";"http://purl.umn.edu/12215";"";"";"";""

The environmental effects of grasslands and perennial forages are described (on soil quality, on the flows of substances such as nitrate and pesticides, on biodiversity, on the landscape, etc.). The area of these perennial covers is of importance, but the way they are inserted spatially in the territory has also to be considered. In certain regions these perennial covers can only be maintained through a voluntary policy of maintenance of livestock on the territories' farms.

However, there have been few denitrification studies in semi-arid grassland. This study was designed to determine the denitrification potential of four representative land cover types (typical steppe, meadow steppe, marshland, arid steppe) in two grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China. We found that soils from different land cover types exhibited significantly different denitrification potentials, with highest rates in marshland and lowest rates in arid steppe. Denitrification potentials were maximal in the upper layer and generally decreased with depth for all soils. Soil water content, soil carbon and nitrogen availability, and C/N ratio were found to be significantly correlated with denitrification potentials in all soils. Addition of glucose or/and nitrate significantly increased denitrification activities throughout the profile for all soils, suggesting that both bioavailable carbon and nitrogen were limiting factors of denitrification in these grasslands soils. However, further field studies are needed to translate the denitrification potentials determined in laboratory measurements to denitrification rates under field conditions.";"Wu, X.

"AGRIS:US201300736446";"Successful Adaptive Management - The Integration of Research and Management";"";"Adaptive management is a way for managers to do their jobs in the face of uncertainty and learn by doing. Managers gain greater knowledge of their systems by testing different strategies during the management process. The term “adaptive management” is used often, but there is confusion about exactly what adaptive management is, and managers are hard-pressed to find any clear guidelines for implementing it. As a result, they can find the process of moving from the concept of adaptive management to the actual practice intimidating; they need a clear understanding of adaptive management before they can begin to use it. Luckily, adaptive management is not as complicated as the literature sometimes makes it appear. The process of adaptive management involves formulating questions, selecting alternative techniques to test these questions, and testing these techniques on the landscape. Care is taken to measure those system responses that best tell whether the system is moving toward site objectives, and results are fed back into the decision process. We argue that there are 2 strategies that can be used to improve the success of adaptive management. The first is to start with a simple adaptive management plan and then add complexity over time. The second is to include researchers in all stages of the process to benefit from their expertise in ecology, experimental design, and data analysis. Although adaptive management takes time, rewards include increased understanding of the system, a management program that is scientifically valid, and a management strategy tailored to a particular site. In this paper we briefly explain adaptive management and then offer a step-by-step process for developing and implementing adaptive management in small reserves or on private lands. We believe increased understanding of adaptive management will lead to its widespread use and will ensure that more people benefit from its strengths.";"Morghan, K.J.R.

"AGRIS:US201300857490";"Pricing the social contract in the British Columbian forest sector";"";"In this paper, we investigate the impact of various socioeconomic conditions on the value of timber tenures in the province of British Columbia. Two timber tenure models were created, one for short-term timber sale licenses and the other for longer term forest licenses. The short-term model revealed that timber sales that were awarded according to a combination of employment, revenue, and manufacturing criteria yielded $8.63/m3 less revenue than timber sales awarded based on revenue alone. Similarly, the long-term model indicates that manufacturing and employment conditions significantly reduce the bid on forest licenses. In both instances, we suggest that such conditions distort the use of timber, labour, and capital. Therefore, we conclude that recent forest policy changes in the province that removed several of these conditions greatly improved economic efficiency. Nevertheless, distribution impacts are likely to be important because resource rents have potentially been redistributed away from rural communities to the provincial government.";"Niquidet, K.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

"AGRIS:US201400135178";"Can trait‐based analyses of changes in species distribution be transferred to new geographic areas?";"";"AIM: Anthropogenic environmental change is having a major impact on biodiversity. By identifying traits that correlate with changes in species range, comparative studies can shed light on the mechanisms driving this change; but such studies will be more useful for conservation if they have true predictive power, i.e. if their trait‐based models can be transferred to new regions. We aim to examine the ability of trait‐based models to predict changes in plant distribution across seven geographic regions that varied in terms of land cover and species composition. LOCATION: Britain and Flanders (Belgium). METHODS: We estimated distribution change for more than 1000 species for over 70 years of data (1930s to 2004), using data from published plant atlases. We identified regional trait‐based models of plant distribution change. Traits included morphological characteristics, Ellenberg values and distribution‐based traits. The trait models were then used to predict change in all other regions, with the level of linear correlation between predicted and observed changes in range used as a measure of transferability. We then related transferability to land cover and species similarity between regions. RESULTS: We found that trait correlates of range change varied regionally, highlighting the regional variation in the drivers of range change in plants. These trait models also varied in the amount of variation explained, with r² values ranging from 0.05 to 0.17. A key cross‐regional difference was the variation in the relationship between soil nutrient association (Ellenberg N) and distribution change, which was strongly positive in Flanders and southern England but significantly negative in northern Scotland. We found that transferability between regions was significantly correlated with the level of similarity in land cover. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that trait‐based models can predict broad‐scale changes in species distributions in regions that share similar land‐cover composition; however, predictions between regions with differing land‐cover cover tend to be poor.";"Powney, Gary D.

"AGRIS:US201400135174";"global 1‐km consensus land‐cover product for biodiversity and ecosystem modelling";"";"AIM: For many applications in biodiversity and ecology, existing remote sensing‐derived land‐cover products have limitations due to among‐product inconsistency and their typically non‐continuous nature. Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1‐km resolution global product that provides scale‐integrated and accuracy‐weighted consensus land‐cover information on an approximately continuous scale. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy‐based integration approach, we integrated four global land‐cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30‐m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. RESULTS: Our product offers accuracy‐weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land‐cover classes within every nominal 1‐km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land‐cover information contained in the fine‐grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine‐grain land‐cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land‐cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land‐cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.";"Tuanmu, Mao‐Ning

Estimating the abundance of deer is problematic, but faecal pellet counts (an index of abundance) have been conducted on New Zealand's public conservation land since the 1950s. We compiled faecal pellet count data from published and unpublished sources, and used the most common data type (presence–absence of pellets in plots along transects) to investigate decadal changes in the relative abundances of deer at the national, island (North and South) and Department of Conservation conservancy spatial scales. A quadratic model with different trends for each conservancy best explained the pellet frequency data for the period 1952–2010: pellet frequencies were highest during the 1950s–1970s and then declined to minima in the 1980s and 1990s and then increased in the 2000s. The decline in pellet frequencies was likely caused by increasing commercial deer harvesting, and the recent increases in pellet frequencies in several conservancies are likely a consequence of reduced commercial harvesting. The key limitations of faecal pellet count data collected in New Zealand (i.e. spatial and temporal variability, and that only summary statistics are often available) are discussed.";"Forsyth, DM

"AGRIS:US201500192355";"Driving mechanism and boundary control of urban sprawl";"";"Since the reform and opening-up, China’s economy has achieved remarkable development and so does the urbanization. However, there is an unavoidable contradiction between urban sprawl and the protection of arable land and the environment. By redefining the urban sprawl boundary, this paper is to provide a solution for the conflict above on the China’s urbanization context. The ideal boundary, moderate boundary and limit boundary are defined for urban sprawl in space. Taking Nanjing city as a case, the three urban sprawl boundaries are estimated in this paper based on the calculation of agricultural land resources value in Nanjing. The results show that 1) the integrated value of agricultural (cultivated) land resources in Nanjing is 1.55 × 10⁷CNY·hm⁻², the economic value accounts for only 8.74% of the integrated value, while 91.26% of the integrated value has not revealed itself due to the existing institutional arrangements, policy distortions, and imperfect land market; 2) it is difficult to define the ideal and moderate boundaries due to the relatively low price of North Nanjing. In South Nanjing the land price is expensive and the ideal, moderate and limit boundaries are expanded to Jiangning, Qixia, and Yuhuatai; 3) the city scale of South Nanjing should be limited within 5.82 × 10⁴hm², which is roughly the same as the designated size of 5.81 × 10⁴hm²in the urban planning. It is suggested that the rational scope of urban expansion should be controlled within the moderate boundary.";"Jiang, Dongmei

"AGRIS:US201301635164";"Rationale for Monitoring Invasive Plant Populations as a Crucial Step for Management";"";"Many land managers are faced with trying to optimize management of invasive plant species based on budget constraints and lack of knowledge of the true potential of the species. Generally, “early detection rapid response” (EDRR) is the assumed best management strategy and tends to drive management regardless of the invasion stage or possible variation in the invasion potential of the population. We created a simulation model to evaluate the optimal management strategy to reduce the rate of invasion of nonindigenous plant species. The strategies were specifically chosen to assess the value of information from monitoring populations. We compared four management strategies and a no-management control over a 20-yr period in the context of a management area: (1) managing a fixed number of populations at random each year (EDRR random), (2) managing an equivalent number of populations along a road each year (EDRR road), (3) managing half of the fixed populations that were determined by monitoring to be sources of new populations (monitoring every year), and (4) managing an equivalent set of source populations only on even years, leaving the odd years for monitoring (monitoring every other year). EDRR random location without regard to population invasion potential, and monitoring every year targeting management on populations determined to be invasive (sources for new populations), were the most successful strategies for reducing the increase in total number of populations. The model simulations suggest that managers could dedicate 50% of their management time to monitoring without risk of accelerating invasions or reducing the impact of their weed management program.";"Maxwell, Bruce D.

In Mauritania, average land productivity of rice schemes lies between 3 and 3.5tha⁻¹ and irrigated land has progressively being abandoned. At the same time, there is new international attention towards interventions in large-scale irrigation in the Sahel. Spatial and temporal variability of production are main causes of low productivity of large-scale irrigation schemes in Mauritania and threats to their sustainability. The present paper focuses on the performance of three representative large-scale schemes located along the River Senegal by analysing intra-scheme variability with respect to yield and irrigation intensity using field observations and satellite images. A sample of tertiary canals was selected in each irrigation scheme for weekly surveys of irrigation processes and maintenance. Yield measurement, irrigation (II) and harvest intensity (HI), indicators of irrigation adequacy (IIA) and drainage adequacy (IDA) constituted the basis of this analysis. Semi-structured interviews with the different actors at the various management levels (farmers; cooperatives; union of cooperatives; state irrigation agency; and the private service provider managing the water delivery in one of the schemes) were held in order to gain information on irrigation and drainage infrastructure, organisation and management of the schemes, financial aspects and irrigated surface. Within each irrigation scheme, a great variability was detected with respect to irrigation intensity and yield. Irrigation intensity could vary as much as from 0 to 1 whilst yield could range from 0.4 to 7tha⁻¹ in a single scheme. The analysis of water distribution patterns at scheme level indicated that variability in irrigation supplies and drainage were main sources of variability of yields and irrigation intensity. Physical, technical, and organisational factors underlie non-uniform water distribution patterns. The understanding of the origins of patterns of variability is a first step towards a more realistic assessment of schemes’ sustainability and contribution to food security.";"Borgia, Cecilia

However, there is little information available on the spatial and temporal aspects of plant‐pollinator mutualist diversity relative to farm management. Information on these aspects will provide a better understanding of agri‐environment schemes in a conservation context. In the present study, we use additive partitioning (sum of within and among community diversity) to determine local (alpha) diversity and spatial and temporal (beta) diversity of bees and flowering plants in differently managed vineyards and adjacent natural vegetation in the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot. Alpha, spatial beta and temporal beta diversities accounted for 18–61%, 19–72% and 7–36% of total bee diversity, respectively. Local diversity and spatial turnover of flowering plant diversity were significantly higher in the natural vegetation compared with organic and conventional vineyards. Spatial turnover of bees varied significantly with longitudinal coordinates of study sites. We show that wildlife‐friendly management practices ensure species‐rich plant communities that promote pollinator diversity. We demonstrate the necessity to conserve mosaics of natural and semi‐natural habitats in agricultural landscapes to conserve plant and bees. Our findings demonstrate the need to include spatial factors of habitats for effective conservation in this region.";"Kehinde, Temitope

Some 56,200 claims have been received by insurers with payouts totalling $2.55 billion. This paper backgrounds weather and climatic factors implicated in the flooding and the historical flood experience of Brisbane. We examine the time history of water releases from the Wivenhoe dam, which have been accused of aggravating damage downstream. The dam was built in response to even worse flooding in 1974 and now serves as Brisbane’s main water supply. In our analysis, the dam operators made sub-optimal decisions by neglecting forecasts of further rainfall and assuming a ‘no rainfall’ scenario. Questions have also been raised about the availability of insurance cover for riverine flood, and the Queensland government’s decision not to insure its infrastructure. These and other questions have led to Federal and State government inquiries. We argue that insurance is a form of risk transfer for the residual risk following risk management efforts and cannot in itself be a solution for poor land-use planning. With this in mind, we discuss the need for risk-related insurance premiums to encourage flood risk mitigating behaviours by all actors, and for transparency in the availability of flood maps. Examples of good flood risk management to arise from this flood are described.";"Robin C. van den Honert

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is applied to simulate the effects of temperature on the hydrology and sediment and nutrient load in the lower Pearl River Basin, South China. Calibration and validation results for SWAT showed that the Yamen estuary is appropriate for simulating the impacts of temperature change on both hydrological processes and nutrient input. The possible temperature change scenarios were set at T–2, T–1.5, T–1, T–0.5, T+0.5, T+1, T+1.5, T+2, T+2.5, T+3°C compared to the current temperature, T°C. The results showed that the relative variation of discharge with temperature was slight. The sediment load at T+3°C is increased by 13.58% compared to that at T°C. Inorganic N and P inputs to the Yamen estuary showed an increasing trend with the temperature increase from T–2°C to T+3°C. Global warming can reduce the vegetation land cover by slowing plant growth, which will aggravate the water and soil loss. Temperature changes would have an effect on mineralization and nitrification by changing soil temperature and temperatures. The warming is projected to cause an increase of sediment and nutrient load into the estuary and accelerate eutrophication in the coastal area.Citation Li, Y., Chen, B.-M., Wang, Z.-G. & Peng, S.-L.

The runoff and soil loss data at watershed, catchment, and field level are necessary for planning soil and water conservation interventions. In this study, an attempt was made to develop a spatial soil loss estimation model for Seethagondi cluster using RUSLE coupled with ARCGIS and was used to estimate the soil loss spatially and temporally. The daily rainfall data of Aphrodite for the period from 1951 to 2007 was used, and the annual rainfall varied from 508 to 1351 mm with a mean annual rainfall of 950 mm and a mean erosivity of 6789 MJ mm ha⁻¹ h⁻¹ year⁻¹. Considerable variation in land use land cover especially in crop land and fallow land was observed during normal and drought years, and corresponding variation in the erosivity, C factor, and soil loss was also noted. The mean value of C factor derived from NDVI for crop land was 0.42 and 0.22 in normal year and drought years, respectively. The topography is undulating and major portion of the cluster has slope less than 10°, and 85.3 % of the cluster has soil loss below 20 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. The soil loss from crop land varied from 2.9 to 3.6 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in low rainfall years to 31.8 to 34.7 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in high rainfall years with a mean annual soil loss of 12.2 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. The soil loss from crop land was higher in the month of August with an annual soil loss of 13.1 and 2.9 t ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ in normal and drought year, respectively. Based on the soil loss in a normal year, the interventions recommended for 85.3 % of area of the watershed includes agronomic measures such as contour cultivation, graded bunds, strip cropping, mixed cropping, crop rotations, mulching, summer plowing, vegetative bunds, agri-horticultural system, and management practices such as broad bed furrow, raised sunken beds, and harvesting available water using farm ponds and percolation tanks. This methodology can be adopted for estimating the soil loss from similar ungauged watersheds with deficient data and for planning suitable soil and water conservation interventions for the sustainable management of the watersheds.";"Rejani, R.

"AGRIS:US201600057949";"Exploring the Potential of Object Based Image Analysis for Mapping Urban Land Cover";"";"The paper investigates the performance and potential of object based image analysis technique (OBIA) for land cover information extraction from high resolution satellite datasets. Efficiency of the technique has been assessed in different urban land cover situations using merged CARTOSAT-1 and IRS-P6 LISS-IV image subsets of Dehradun, India. Multi-scale iterative Nearest Neighbour classification has been applied. Classification results have been quantitatively evaluated. Results reveal that OBIA is a fast, simple, flexible and efficient semi automated tool to deal with high spatial and spectral heterogeneity inherent in high resolution urban datasets. Integration of shape and texture characteristics with traditional spectral signatures, and use of multiple object levels in the classification process yielded classified map units having high correspondence with real world geographical entities. High accuracies were achieved for spectrally and spatially distinct classes like built up structures and tree covered land. Performance of the technique is impaired in case of classes having overlapping spectral characteristics. The parameters for segmentation and class descriptions developed for one area were successfully transferred to the other with minor adaptations. Utility of the technique is further enhanced by flexibility of visualisation of maps at different levels of classification hierarchy and immediate integration of the classified product in GIS environment with direct realization of vector maps for spatial analysis.";"Jalan, Seema";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600057949";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-011-0182-3";"";"";"";"507-518"

Single tree biomass assessment data from 42 cut trees were used in developing local allometric equations which may be used as an index during post-mining reforestation projects. The total biomass of pine ecosystems was determined from dendrometric measurements of sample plots with the use of elaborated equations. Forest floor vegetation was determined using the harvest method. Control plots were set up in the vicinity of the mining-sites at a managed forest on natural pine sites (NPS). Results confirm wide ecological amplitude of pine and indicate a high PME productivity on all substrates (2.79–4.34Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹).";"Pietrzykowski, Marcin

Remote Sensing data and GIS were used to delineate the groundwater potential zones of the area. IRS-1D (LISS III) data have been utilized to extract information on various themes such as geomorphology, structure, drainage and land use/land cover. Available lithology and soil maps have also been used. DEM has been generated from contours taken from Survey of India topographical maps in order to obtain the slope percentage and slope aspect of the area. The groundwater potential zones were delineated by weighted overlay analysis. The themes geology, geomorphology, slope and soil were considered and the weightages assigned to different classes of respective themes according to their role in groundwater potential. Finally, five groundwater potential zones viz., very good, good, moderate; poor and very poor were delineated for the study area. It was estimated that about 110.41 sq km area which forms 37.55% of the total area are in the zones of very poor, poor and moderate category and about 183.75 sq km (62.45%) in zones of good and very good category.";"Sinha, Devi Dayal

"AGRIS:US2012203248";"A Global Land Use and Biomass Approach to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Fossil Fuel Use and to Preserve Biodiversity";"";"As average growth consumptions per capita and world population will continue to grow, the promotion of sustainable developments during the next half a century implies to take into account environmental aspects, local potentialities and futures changes in population as well climatic, economic and social factors. At the global level, land and fossil fuel availability per capita, capacity of absorption of greenhouse gas emissions are considered the most important environmental factors. Whereas at local levels are to be considered preservation or improvement of soil fertility, of water regimes, of quality of air, soil and water. Biodiversity must be taken into account at both levels to cope also with climate change. But as underlined by IPCC lead authors, up to now there is no tool available to deal with these issues in a comprehensive and adequate manner. A new tool, presented here, the Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA) has therefore been developed. It takes into account all actions, from the sun to final services, in three stages: solar energy bioconversion and phytomass production at I; conversion of phytomass and non renewable resources into final products and waste disposal at II ; arrangement of products to meet final needs, such as nutrition, housing mobility etc. at III. IEAs start at the global level with the GIEA , the results of which are then to be confronted with constraints at local levels from LIEAs. This new tool can be used to identify impacts of technological changes in land management and to compare alternative practices better than with LCAs. It was used to analyze environmental impacts of technological changes between 1950 and 2000 in France, in wheat production at stage I. It appeared that not only yields, but also the primary mitigation potential (PMP) per hectare have been multiplied by 4, whereas the net primary energy gain per ha has been multiplied by 3.2. Besides this, 14,5 Mha (the area of the French forest about a quarter of France) land use change could be avoided; in the case of deforestation this would have led to the emission of more than 4 billion tons of CO2. Lessons are drawn from the past and for the next fifty years: In developed and industrialized countries, alternative managements of land and increased use of non food phytomass can and should be envisaged. In Sub-Saharan Africa population is expected to double during the next 50 years and soil fertility is drastically decreasing; agricultural practices are no longer sustainable. If no changes appear in agriculture, forests and GHG emission from deforestation as well as biodiversity are threatened by further and inevitable land use change. Increasing yields per hectare should therefore become the priority; it would at the same time increase food security, improve mitigation and adaptation to climate change, help to combat deforestation and desertification, better preserve biodiversity, and ultimately also allow more bioenergy production: This would improve the food security and at the same time help to achieve the objectives of the three main UN environmental conventions and of the UN Millennium Goal.";"Riedacker, Arthur";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"FRA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012203248";"http://purl.umn.edu/9551";"";"";"";""

The study investigates the causes of land degradation, and adoption of soil conservation practices using a two-stage decision making process. The data for the study were collected with the aid of structured questionnaire and analyzed with descriptive analysis, difference regression equation and simultaneous probit model. The results show erosion as the major cause of land degradation and 69% of the farmers experienced a low level of crop loss to land degradation while a one percent (1%) increase in land area cultivated results in 0.067% loss of rice output. Majority of the farmers (80%) prefer fertilizer application as a conservation method. Their level of education and membership of organization raise conservation practices by the farmers is influenced by the extent to which they perceive land degradation to be a problem; level of education, ownership of farmland; farm size and percentage of crop loss.

"AGRIS:US201600194373";"Vegetation and Soil Seed Bank Relationships Across Microhabitats in an Abandoned Quercus suber Parkland Under Simulated Fire";"";"Mediterranean agro-forestry systems are undergoing rapid change due to abandonment. This turns formerly cultivated or grazed oak-tree parklands (i.e., savanna-type formations called âdehesasâ) into flammable formations of scattered trees within a matrix of shrubs with open spaces. Wildfires can now occur, threatening the persistence of these formations. Fire-prone shrublands commonly regenerate after fire from seeds stored in the soil. Understanding the relationships between standing vegetation and the soil seed bank across microhabitats can help predict the response of the system in case of fire. Here we investigated these relationships in an abandoned Quercus suber (cork oak) dehesa in central Spain. Vegetation and soil were sampled and assigned to different microhabitats: under the trees (TRC), in dense shrub cover (DSC), and in low shrub cover (LSC). A heat shock was applied to half of each sample to simulate fire; the other half served as control. Both sets of samples were then germinated in a greenhouse. Almost 90% of the species were herbs, while the rest were woody shrubs. The number of species recorded in TRC and DSC was lower than in LSC, in which species richness, particularly herbs, was maximal. Heating increased the total number of species that germinated, but mean species richness per sample was not altered. Heating markedly increased the number of germinations in all microhabitats, particularly those of woody species. Furthermore, the germination of shrubby species increased in the 3 microhabitats, notably in TRC. While the standing plant community was well differentiated among microhabitats, this was not the case for the soil seed bank, which was homogeneous across microhabitats, with or without heating. We conclude that the high density of shrubby seeds found in TRC or in the other microhabitats presents substantial threats to the persistence of Q. suber parklands in case of fire.";"Torres, IvÃ¡n

"AGRIS:US201500201405";"Spatio-temporal patterns in land use and management affecting surface runoff response of agricultural catchments—A review";"";"Surface runoff and associated erosion processes adversely affect soil and surface water quality. There is increasing evidence that a sound understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics of land use and management are crucial to understanding surface runoff processes and underpinning mitigation strategies. In this review, we synthesise the effects of (1) temporal patterns of land management of individual fields, and (2) spatio-temporal interaction of several fields within catchments by applying semivariance analysis, which allows the extent and range of the different patterns to be compared. Consistent effects of management on the temporal dynamics of surface runoff of individual fields can be identified, some of which have been incorporated into small-scale hydrological models. In contrast, the effects of patchiness, the spatial organisation of patches with different soil hydrological properties, and the effects of linear landscape structures are less well understood and are rarely incorporated in models. The main challenge for quantifying these effects arises from temporal changes within individual patches, where the largest contrasts usually occur in mid-summer and cause a seasonally varying effect of patchiness on the overall catchment response. Some studies indicate that increasing agricultural patchiness, due to decreasing field sizes, reduces the catchment-scale response to rainfall, especially in cases of Hortonian runoff. Linear structures associated with patchiness of fields (e.g. field borders, ditches, and ephemeral gullies) may either increase or decrease the hydraulic connectivity within a catchment. The largest gap in research relates to the effects and temporal variation of patch interaction, the influence of the spatial organisation of patches and the interaction with linear structures. In view of the substantial changes in the structure of agricultural landscapes occurring throughout the world, it is necessary to improve our knowledge of the influence of patchiness and connectivity, and to implement this knowledge in new modelling tools.";"Fiener, P.

Both byproducts have been studied separately for land application benefits. There are possible environmental benefits of WTRs and biosolids co-application but these studies are limited. Our objectives were to determine relative long-term (13–15 yr) effects of a single and short-term (2–4 yr) effects of repeated WTR-biosolids co-applications on soil chemistry, microbiology, and plant community structure in a Colorado semiarid grassland. Only relative changes associated between co-applications were studied, as we assumed WTR application would only occur if used as a management practice. Three WTR rates (5, 10, and 21 Mg ha–1) were surface co-applied (no incorporation) with a single biosolids rate (10 Mg ha–1) once in 1991 (long-term plots) and again in 2002 (short-term plots). Soil 0- to 8-, 8- to 15-, and 15- to 30-cm depth pH, electrical conductivity (EC), NO3–N, NH4–N, total C, and total N were not affected by WTR application in 2004, 2005, or 2006. Ammonium-bicarbonate diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA)- extractable soil Al was unaffected by WTR application, but extractable P and Mo decreased with increasing WTR rate because of WTR adsorption. Plant tissue P and Mo content decreased with specific plant species and years due to adsorption to WTR; no deficiency symptoms were observed. Plant community composition and cover were largely unaffected by WTR application. Soil microbial community structure was unaffected by WTR co-application rate (total ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester [EL-FAME] concentrations ranged from 33.4 to 54.8 nmol g–1 soil), although time since biosolids-WTR application affected a subset of microbial community fatty acids including markers for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, WTR-biosolids co-applications did not adversely affect semiarid grassland ecosystem dynamics.";"Ippolito, J.A.

The existing literature offers little to verify or quantify presumed preference shifts. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative examination of whether stated preferences for development and conservation tradeoffs differ according to length of residency in a rural community, and explores implications of these findings for assumptions regarding development and conservation preferences.  Results are based on stated preferences estimated from a multi-attribute contingent choice survey of Rhode Island rural residents.  Heterogeneity-according to length of town residency-is incorporated using Lagrangian Interpolation Polynomials.  This approach models the influence of  policy attributes as a polynomial function of residence time, thereby allowing estimated coefficient values to vary as a continuous function of residence duration.";"Johnston, Robert J.

"AGRIS:US201400051674";"GIS based mapping of land cover changes utilizing multi-temporal remotely sensed image data in Lake Hawassa Watershed, Ethiopia";"";"Classifying multi-temporal image data to produce thematic maps and quantify land cover changes is one of the most common applications of remote sensing. Mapping land cover changes at the regional level is essential for a wide range of applications including land use planning, decision making, land cover database generation, and as a source of information for sustainable management of natural resources. Land cover changes in Lake Hawassa Watershed, Southern Ethiopia, were investigated using Landsat MSS image data of 1973, and Landsat TM images of 1985, 1995, and 2011, covering a period of nearly four decades. Each image was partitioned in a GIS environment, and classified using an unsupervised algorithm followed by a supervised classification method. A hybrid approach was employed in order to reduce spectral confusion due to high variability of land cover. Classification of satellite image data was performed integrating field data, aerial photographs, topographical maps, medium resolution satellite image (SPOT 20� m), and visual image interpretation. The image data were classified into nine land cover types: water, built-up, cropland, woody vegetation, forest, grassland, swamp, bare land, and scrub. The overall accuracy of the LULC maps ranged from 82.5 to 85.0� %. The achieved accuracies were reasonable, and the observed classification errors were attributable to coarse spatial resolution and pixels containing a mixture of cover types. Land cover change statistics were extracted and tabulated using the ERDAS Imagine software. The results indicated an increase in built-up area, cropland, and bare land areas, and a reduction in the six other land cover classes. Predominant land cover is cropland changing from 43.6� % in 1973 to 56.4� % in 2011. A significant portion of land cover was converted into cropland. Woody vegetation and forest cover which occupied 21.0 and 10.3� % in 1973, respectively, diminished to 13.6 and 5.6� % in 2011. The change in water body was very peculiar in that the area of Lake Hawassa increased from 91.9� km² in 1973 to 95.2� km² in 2011, while that of Lake Cheleleka whose area was 11.3� km² in 1973 totally vanished in 2011 and transformed into mud-flat and grass dominated swamp. The “change and no change” analysis revealed that more than one third (548.0� km²) of the total area was exposed to change between 1973 and 2011. This study was useful in identifying the major land cover changes, and the analysis pursued provided a valuable insight into the ongoing changes in the area under investigation.";"Nigatu Wondrade

The revised universal soil loss equation empirical model, erosion pins, and isotopic sediment core analyses were used to evaluate watershed erosion, stream bank erosion, and reservoir sediment accumulation rates for Ni Reservoir, in central Virginia. Land-use and land cover seems to be dominant control in watershed soil erosion, with barren land and human-disturbed areas contributing the most sediment, and forest and herbaceous areas contributing the least. Results show a 7� % increase in human development from 2001 (14� %) to 2009 (21.6� %), corresponding to an increase in soil loss of 0.82� Mg ha⁻¹� year⁻¹ in the same time period. ²¹⁰Pb-based sediment accumulation rates at three locations in Ni Reservoir were 1.020, 0.364, and 0.543� g cm⁻²� year⁻¹ respectively, indicating that sediment accumulation and distribution in the reservoir is influenced by reservoir configuration and significant contributions from bedload. All three locations indicate an increase in modern sediment accumulation rates. Erosion pin results show variability in stream bank erosion with values ranging from 4.7 to 11.3� cm year⁻¹. These results indicate that urban growth and the decline in vegetative cover has increased sediment fluxes from the watershed and poses a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of the Ni Reservoir as urbanization continues to increase.";"Pope, Ian C.

Our goal is to make the relevant tools and methods that have been developed by conservation scientists accessible to conservation practitioners working towards wilderness preservation. LOCATION: Wilderness areas, in particular the North American boreal region. METHODS: We describe prominent spatial tools from natural resource management, landscape ecology and conservation biology for incorporating natural disturbance dynamics into systematic conservation planning. Then, we identify emerging methods that combine and customize these types of tools to account for interacting ecological processes in wilderness conservation plans with a specific focus on conserving natural disturbances in the North American boreal region. RESULTS: Two classes of tools are well suited to the task of conservation planning in dynamic landscapes: site‐selection tools (e.g. Marxan and Zonation) and process‐based modelling tools (e.g. CONSERV and LANDIS‐II). Four methods for explicitly including natural disturbance dynamics into conservation plans emerge from the combination of these tools: spatial catalysts combined with site‐selection tools, probability theory combined with site‐selection tools, spatial simulation models and spatial simulation models combined with site‐selection tools. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Globally, there are few wilderness areas remaining; therefore, there is increasing impetus to effectively protect the world's remaining intact areas. Careful combinations of probabilistic models, such as Markov chain models, or spatial simulation tools, such as CONSERV and Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator, with site‐selection tools, such as Benchmark Builder and Marxan, are promising approaches for accounting for natural disturbance dynamics when land use planning in wilderness areas such as the North American boreal region. The protection of natural disturbance dynamics will play an increasingly important role in the long‐term persistence of biodiversity in earth's remaining wilderness areas as ongoing anthropogenic disturbances and climate change imperil broad‐scale ecological processes.";"Leroux, Shawn J.

"AGRIS:US201400191538";"Soil profile carbon and nitrogen in prairie, perennial grass–legume mixture and wheat-fallow production in the central High Plains, USA";"";"Conversion of native prairie land for agricultural production has resulted in significant loss and redistribution of soil organic matter (SOM) in the soil profile ultimately leading to declining soil fertility in a low-productivity semiarid agroecosystem. Improved understanding of such losses can lead to development of sustainable land management practices that maintain soil fertility and enhance soil quality. This study was conducted to determine whether conservation practices impact soil profile carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation in central High Plains. Soil samples were taken at four-depth increments to 1.2m in July of 2011 from five unfertilized fields under long-term management with varying degrees of soil disturbance: (1) historic wheat (Triticum aestivum)-fallow (HT) – managed with tillage alone, (2) conventional wheat-fallow (CT) – input of herbicides for weed control and fewer tillage operation than historic wheat-fallow, (3) no-till wheat-fallow (NT) – not plowed since 2000 and herbicides used for weed control, (4) grass–legume mixture – established in 2005 as in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and (5) native mixed grass prairie (NP) – representing a relatively undisturbed reference location. Cumulative soil organic C (SOC) was not significantly different among the three wheat-fallow systems when the whole profile (0–120cm) was analyzed. However, SOC, dissolved organic C (DOC), and total soil N contents decreased in the direction NP>CRP≥NT>HT≥CT in the surface 0–30cm depth. In the surface 0–30cm depth, estimated annual SOC storage rate averaged 0.28Mg Cha⁻¹year⁻¹ since the cessation of tillage in 2000 and 0.58Mg Cha⁻¹year⁻¹ since the establishment of CRP grass–legume mixture in 2005. Cumulative soil inorganic C (SIC) accumulation ranged between 8.1 and 24.9Mgha⁻¹and was greatest under wheat-fallow systems, particularly at deeper soil layers, relative to the perennial systems (NP and CRP). Results from this study suggest that repeated soil disturbance induced by cropping and fallow favored large accumulation of SIC which presence may result in decline in soil fertility and productivity; whereas conversion from tilled wheat-fallow to CRP grass–legume mixture offers great SOC storage potential relative to NT wheat-fallow practices.";"Hurisso, Tunsisa T.

Farmers utilize land to earn their livelihood and as a store of wealth for future retirement. Potential rural residents have increasingly sought open space for a home site and pursuit of a lifestyle. Developers seek financial opportunities to invest in and develop it for non-farm uses. Recreational needs such as hunting are often met through use of land. For some, land is viewed as an investment and a hedge against inflation.

"AGRIS:US201500014869";"Efficacy of Management Practices to Mitigate the Off-Site Movement and Ecological Risk of Pesticides Transported with Runoff from Agricultural and Turf Systems";"";"Highly managed biotic systems, such as agricultural crops and managed turf, often require multiple applications of pesticides that may be transported with runoff to areas beyond the intended target site. Pesticides have been detected in surface waters of rural and urban watersheds raising questions concerning their source, potential environmental effects and a need for strategies to reduce their inputs. Experiments were designed to quantify pesticides transported with runoff from agricultural plots representing fresh market tomato production and turf plots maintained as a golf course fairway to evaluate the efficacy of management practices to mitigate chemical transport from these systems. Reported runoff-to-surface water scenarios were used to extrapolate pesticide loads in runoff to estimated environmental concentrations of pesticides in surface waters receiving the runoff. Surface water concentrations of the pesticides were compared with published toxicity data to assess reductions in the ecological risk associated with implementation of the management practices. Runoff from tomatoes grown on raised beds covered with polyethylene mulch with bare-soil furrows was found to present a greater risk to sensitive aquatic organisms than the vegetative hairy vetch mulch. In the managed turf system, replacing solid tine core cultivation with hollow tine core cultivation reduced surface water concentrations of the pesticides to levels below the median lethal concentration of sensitive aquatic organisms; lessening risk associated with pesticides in runoff from the fairway turf. Our results demonstrate that management practices can enhance the sustainability of intensely managed biotic systems, which provides growers and managers with strategies for improving the retention and efficacy of pesticides at targeted locations while reducing adverse impacts to non-target organisms.";"Rice, Pamela J.

Repeat field surveys combine policy and scientific objectives to provide evidence on how multiple aspects of the environment are changing over time, a key goal of international science in the face of profound human impacts on ecosystems. Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007), the fifth survey since 1978, retained consistency with previous surveys, whilst evolving in line with technological and conceptual advances in the collection and integration of data to understand landscape change. This paper outlines approaches taken in the 2007 survey and its subsequent analysis and presents some of the headline results of the survey and their relevance for national and international policy objectives. Key changes between 1998 and 2007 included: a) significant shifts in agricultural land cover from arable to grassland, accompanied by increases in the area of broadleaved woodland, b) decreases in the length of managed hedges associated with agricultural land, as a proportion deteriorated to lines of trees and c) increases in the areas and numbers of wet habitats (standing open water, ponds) and species preferring wetter conditions (1998–2007 and 1978–2007). Despite international policy directed at maintaining and enhancing biodiversity, there were widespread decreases in species richness in all linear and area habitats, except on arable land, consistent with an increase in competitive and late successional species between 1998 and 2007 and 1978 and 2007. Late successional and competitive species: Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), Hawthorn (Cratageous monogyna) and Bramble (Rubus fruticosus), in the top ten recorded species recorded in 2007, all increased between 1998 and 2007. The most commonly recorded species in CS (1990, 1998 and 2007) was agricultural Ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Increases in both water quality and soil pH were in line with policy aimed at addressing previous deterioration of both. Headwater streams broadly showed continued improvements in biological quality from 1998 to 2007, continuing trends seen since 1990. In soils, there were significant increases in soil pH between 1998 and 2007 consistent with recovery from acidification.";"Norton, L.R.

This article describes an identity frame (created by insiders) of ethical hunting in the United States, based on analysis of hunter education manuals and official statements of hunting nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Similar themes permeated texts from both sources (e.g., obeying law, fair chase). NGOs, however, placed significantly more emphasis on being skilled (15% vs. 6%) and being motivated by experiencing nature (10% vs. 2%), whereas government agencies placed significantly more emphasis on respecting landowners (28% vs. 15%). Agencies may frame ethical hunting as more socially interdependent and rule abiding because they perceive a need to prioritize government authority (law) and property owner interests. These findings highlight a need for identity frames focusing on how hunting impacts biodiversity and humane treatment of animals.";"Peterson, M.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

To solve the problem, the groundwater model SGMP was applied in a waterlogged area of Haryana State of India in which about 500,000ha has already waterlogged resulting in reduced crop yield and abandonment of agricultural lands. After successful calibration and validation, several scenario building exercises have been conducted. Error and sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were done. The impact of potential policy changes on the groundwater levels has been analysed through the model. The alternative scenarios revealed that small increase in the net recharge would cause the waterlogging problem to aggravate. On the other hand, if net recharge decreases, the situation would turn favorable. The study also revealed that by reducing the recharge in the range of 5–20% from the average values, the watertable could be stabilized at a safe depth. To prevent the area from further salinisation some recommendations can be given such as; increase in groundwater abstraction, water distribution as per water requirements of crops, and the lining of surface irrigation systems. Thus it is apparent that the SGMP model seems to be an effective tool for groundwater simulation. It has the potential of assessing the watertable behaviour due to various interventions. The results of simulation studies of existing and proposed water management policy, therefore, may form the basis for the identification of appropriate water management plans for the future.";"Singh, Ajay";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"IND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400178395";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.12.042";"";"";"";"220-229"

Quantitative matrices that were borrowed from landscape ecology were first used to measure the variety and spatial arrangement of open space plots and landuses around houses. Amenity values of those measures were then evaluated in a hedonic regression that was corrected for identification problem caused by the endogeneity of landuse variables. Empirical estimates from this research reveal that urban residents positively valued the varieties of open space but negatively valued the diversity within developed land uses in their neighborhoods. Similarly, open space plots with square shape and smooth, straight edges were preferred to those with more complex shapes and irregular edges. Further, residents preferred open spaces in few larger plots to many smaller pieces that are scattered throughout the neighborhood. Findings from this study will be useful in enhancing the quality and amenity value of open spaces and conceivably increase local property tax base.";"Poudyal, Neelam C.

"AGRIS:US201300870208";"Habitat heterogeneity overrides the species-area relationship";"";"The most obvious, although not exclusive, explanation for the increase of species richness with increasing sample area (the species-area relationship) is that species richness is ultimately linked to area-based increases in habitat heterogeneity. The aim of this paper is to examine the relative importance of area and habitat heterogeneity in determining species richness in nature reserves. Specifically, the work tests the hypothesis that species-area relationships are not positive if habitat heterogeneity does not increase with area. Sixteen nature reserves (area range 89-11,030 ha) in central Hungary. Four-year faunistic inventories were conducted in the reserves involving c. 70 fieldworkers and 65 taxonomists. CORINE 50,000 land-cover maps were used for calculating the heterogeneity of the reserve landscape (number of habitat types, number of habitat patches and total length of edges). Large reserves were less heterogeneous than small reserves, probably because large reserves were established in large blocks of unproductive land whereas small reserves tended to be in more fertile land. In total, 3975 arthropod species were included in the analysis. The slope of the species-area relationship was positive only for Neuroptera and Trichoptera. There was no significant relationship in the other nine taxa examined (Collembola, Acari, Orthoptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera, Araneae, Diplopoda, Chilopoda, Diptera). The density (number of species ha⁻¹) of all species, however, showed a positive correlation with heterogeneity. The general lack of fit of species-area relationships in this study is inconsistent with most previous published studies. Importantly, and unlike many other studies, habitat heterogeneity was not correlated with reserve area in the studied system. In the absence of this source of covariation, stronger relationships were identified that suggested a fundamental link between species richness and habitat heterogeneity. The results indicate that habitat heterogeneity rather than area per se is the most important predictor of species richness in the studied system.";"Báldi, András";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300870208";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01825.x";"";"";"";"675-681"

An integrated approach utilizing remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) was used to extract information pertaining to LULC change. Multi-date LULC maps were generated by analyzing remotely sensed images of three dates which include LandSat TM 1992, LandSat ETM+ 2001 and IRS LISS-III 2005. The LULC information was extracted by adopting on-screen image interpretation technique in a GIS environment at 1:25,000 scale. Based on the analysis, changes were observed in the spatial extent of different LULC types over a period of 13� years. Significant changes were observed in the spatial extent of forest, horticulture, built-up and agriculture. Forest cover in the watershed has decreased by 1.47� %, Agricultural by 0.93� % while as built-up area has increased by 0.92� %. The net decrease in forest cover and agriculture land indicate the anthropogenic interference into surrounding natural ecosystems. From the study it was found that the major driving forces for these changes were population growth and changes in the stream discharge. The changes in the stream discharge were found responsible for the conversion of agricultural land into horticulture, as horticulture has increased by 1.14� % in spatial extent. It has been found that increasing human population together with decreasing stream discharge account for LULC changes in the watershed. Therefore, the existing policy framework needs to focus upon mitigating the impacts of forces responsible for LULC change so as to ensure sustainable development of land resources.";"Showqi, Irfana

Improving regulatory enforcement requires an understanding of prevailing challenges to detection and sanctioning activities. Drawing from empirical field research in 15 Colombian parks, I show that current enforcement efforts may be insufficient to deter most priority threats. For long-term infractions, such as agriculture, livestock grazing, and construction, sanctioning violators is challenging, whereas for furtive infractions, such as logging and hunting, it may be difficult to detect violators. Investment in staff, equipment and infrastructure may fail to increase enforcement capacity and yield positive conservation outcomes unless accompanied by resolution of land tenure, clarification of use rights, improved patrolling strategies and protection of park guards.";"Nolte, Christoph";"";"Cambridge University Press";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land rights;protected areas;grazing;land tenure";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600190189";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605314000891";"";"";"";"317-322"

Insufficient recognition is given to the inevitable long term pressures for conversion to other land uses and to the weakness of local constituencies for conservation. Conservation institutions must build their capacity to engage with the process of change. They must constantly adapt to deal with a continuously unfolding set of challenges, opportunities and changing societal needs. This can be achieved by long term on-the-ground engagement and muddling through. The range of conservation options must be enlarged to give more attention to biodiversity in managed landscapes and to mosaics composed of areas with dif-fering intensities of use. The challenge is to build the human capacity and institutions to achieve this.";"Sayer Jeffrey

The conflicting impacts found are partly as a result of different model specifications, the type of data used – panel or cross sectional data – and possibly due to imperfections in rural markets. We control for these problems using household and plot level panel data from rural farmers in Uganda. We find that ownership of cattle has a negative and significant impact on land productivity. Investment in farm related assets, land improvements and other small livestock, however, significantly increases productivity. The conflicting impacts are a result of measurement error. The plot size inverse productivity is robust to different specifications and is largely explained by plot-specific unobserved heterogeneity and imperfections in rural markets.";"Ainembabazi, John Herbert

Self-training is an effective semisupervised method, which can reduce the effort needed to prepare the training set by training the model with a small number of labeled examples and an additional set of unlabeled examples. In this study, a novel semisupervised SVM model that uses self-training approach is proposed to address the problem of remote sensing land cover classification. The key characteristics of this approach are that (1) the self-adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to get the optimum parameters that improve the generalization performance of the SVM classifier, and (2) the Gustafson–Kessel fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed for the selection of unlabeled points to reduce the impact of ineffective labels. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated firstly with samples from remote sensing data and then by identifying different land cover regions in the remote sensing imagery. Experimental results show that accuracy level is increased by applying this learning scheme, which results in the smallest generalization error compared with the other schemes.";"Liu, Ying

"AGRIS:US201500013887";"Ploughing and grazing alter the spatial patterning of surface soils in a shrub-encroached woodland";"";"Grazing is known to affect the spatial patterning of soil resources through biologically-mediated processes such as the removal of plant biomass and deposition of dung. In dense shrublands, grazing is thought to reinforce the concentration of resources around shrubs (fertile island effect) by enhancing the movement of resources from the interspace to the shrub hummocks. Shrub removal practices such as ploughing, which is commonly used to manage dense shrub patches, has unknown impacts on the distribution of soil properties. In this study we examined the effects of two land management practices, grazing and ploughing, on the spatial distribution of surface soil resources. At the unploughed–ungrazed site, the connectivity (autocorrelation range) of shrub cover was about 3.9m and there was a well-defined pattern in soil labile C that was related to the distribution of the cover of both shrubs and litter. We also observed a strong pattern of biological crust cover and an autocorrelation range of 2.5m, similar to that of mineralisable and mineral N. At the unploughed–grazed site, the autocorrelation range of both shrub and crust cover was reduced to 1.9m and 1.8m, respectively, although the range of litter cover increased to 4.4m. Under a treatment of grazing without ploughing, the autocorrelation range of soil labile C was less related to litter cover. Whilst ploughing slightly increased the autocorrelation range of both shrub and litter cover at sites that were grazed, it obliterated any spatial pattern in biological soil crusts. We attribute changes in the spatial patterns of soil N under grazing to inputs of animal dung rather than soil crust cover. Our results indicate that grazing alone, or in combination with ploughing, leads to reduced connectivity of shrub and crust cover, reduction in crust patterning, and marked effects on shrub–litter–nutrient spatial relationships. The results reinforce the notion that management of shrublands by grazing and ploughing is likely to have marked effects on the distribution of surface soils.";"Daryanto, Stefani

The bulk of effort devoted to designing efficient connected components labeling (CCL) algorithms concentrated on the domain of binary images where labeling is required for a computer to recognize objects. In contrast, in the Geographical Information Science (GIS) a CCL algorithm is mostly applied to multi-categorical rasters in order to either convert a raster to a shapefile, or for statistical characterization of individual clumps. Recently, it has become necessary to label connected components in very large, giga-cell size, multi-categorical rasters but performance of existing CCL algorithms lacks sufficient speed to accomplish such task. In this paper we present a modification to the popular two-scan CCL algorithm that enables labeling of giga-cell size, multi-categorical rasters. Our approach is to apply a divide-and-conquer technique coupled with parallel processing to a standard two-scan algorithm. For specificity, we have developed a variant of a standard CCL algorithm implemented as r.clump in GRASS GIS. We have established optimal values of data blocks (stemming from the divide-and-conquer technique) and optimal number of computational threads (stemming from parallel processing) for a new algorithm called r.clump3p. The performance of the new algorithm was tested on a series of rasters up to 160Mcells in size; for largest size test raster a speed up over the original algorithm is 74 times. Finally, we have applied the new algorithm to the National Land Cover Dataset 2006 raster with 1.6×10¹⁰ cells. Labeling this raster took 39h using two-processors, 16 cores computer and resulted in 221,718,501 clumps. Estimated speed up over the original algorithm is 450 times. The r.clump3p works within the GRASS environment and is available in the public domain.";"Netzel, Pawel

"AGRIS:US201600104966";"Multidimensional Statistical Framework to Explore Seasonal Profile, Severity and Land-Use Preferences of Wildfires in a Mediterranean Country";"";"SUMMARYThis study analyses spatio-temporal patterns of wildfires in Greece using a multidimensional statistical framework based on non-parametric correlations, principal component analysis, clustering and stepwise discriminant analysis. Specifically, we assess the frequency, seasonal profile, severity and land-use type of 135 178 wildfires which occurred between 2000–2012 in Greece, one of the countries most affected by fire in Europe. Our results show that both the number of fires and the average size of the area covered by fire show a specific seasonal pattern with a marked increase during the dry season. Principal component analysis identifies three dimensions linked with the main type of land-use affected by the fires: (i) medium and large fires primarily affected landscapes composed of forests, mixed woodlands/shrublands and croplands; (ii) small fires mainly affected fragmented landscapes, i.e. those with mosaics of different crops, market gardens and non-vegetated, abandoned or marginal areas; (iii) fires affecting wetlands and pastures occurred particularly in late summer and showing medium-low severity. Hierarchical clustering highlights similarities in spatio-temporal patterns between fire indicators (ignition date, burnt land cover classes, fire size, fire density). K-means clustering allows us to distinguish between low-severity fires occurring in the wet season from intense and frequent fires occurring in the dry season but with distinct land-use selectivity. The research reported here contributes insight into the complexity of wild fires in the Mediterranean region and supports the design of more effective fire prevention measures including sustainable forest management practices and careful regional planning to minimise risk factors.";"Salvati, L.

"AGRIS:US201400035461";"Validating modelled NPP using statistical yield data";"";"The German Remote Sensing Data Center operates the Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology Model, a process model that estimates the net primary productivity of agricultural areas. The model is driven by remote sensing data and meteorological data. Remotely sensed datasets including a time series of the leaf area index, which describes vegetation condition, and a land cover classification, which provides information about land use, are needed. Currently leaf area indices and land cover data derived from the sensor vegetation are used. Both datasets have spatial resolutions of about 1 km × 1 km and are freely available for the area of investigation (Germany and Austria). The meteorological input parameters are air temperature (at 2 m height), precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed (at 10 m height) and soil water content (in the four uppermost soil layers); these are obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, with a spatial resolution of about 0.25° × 0.25° and a temporal resolution up to four times daily. The output of the model, the gross primary productivity, is calculated at daily resolution. By subtracting the cumulative plant maintenance and growth respiration, the net primary productivity is then determined. In order to validate the modelled net primary productivity, crop yield estimates derived from the national statistics of Germany and Austria are used. After estimating above-ground biomass using plant-specific above- to below-ground ratios, conversion factors (corn-to-straw and leaf-to-beet relations) are applied to estimate total biomass. Finally the carbon content of dry matter is estimated. To correlate model results with these statistical data, the modelled data are aggregated to net primary productivity per administrative district. The results show that a process model using remote sensing data as input can deliver reliable estimates of agricultural biomass potential which are highly correlated with statistically derived estimates of actual biomass produced.";"Tum, Markus

Ismeretes, hogy két elgondolás él a köztudatban. Egyik a liberális földfelfogás, amely szerint a föld olyan termelési eszköz, mellyel más termelési eszközökhöz hasonlóan profitot lehet termelni, amely biztosítja a klasszikus értelemben vett bővített újratermelést. A másik nézet a közgazdasági kategóriákat mellőzve a földet a nemzet kincsének, a paraszti lét alapjának, az élet megtestesítőjének tekinti. Amennyiben ez utóbbi teória eltekint a földnek, mint termelési eszköznek objektív tulajdonságaitól, melyek akaratunktól függetlenül működnek, oda jutunk, ahol ma a magyar mezőgazdaság leledzik, vagyis néhány alapanyag kivételével kiszorultunk a piacokról. Ne áltassuk magunkat, ez tény. Az árutermelést megtestesítő tömegtermékeink alig igényelnek munkaerőt, parasztjainknak egyre kevesebb dolguk akad, és megélhetésük is megkérdőjeleződik. Azok maradnak talpon, és szerencsére egyre többen vannak, akik nem merengenek, hanem a gazdasági törvényeket figyelembe véve, és a szabályzórendszert kihasználva menedzselik magukat. A profit maximalizálására törekednek, amely elfogadható szinten biztosítja a gazdálkodó életfeltételeit, a közteherviselést, és ez mellett lehetővé teszi a pótlólagos ráfordításokat is. Nemcsak a fejlesztésekre koncentrál, hanem gondoskodik a hozzájuk nélkülözhetetlen forgóalapokról is, termelése fenntartható és környezetvédő. Ugyanakkor a hagyományokat is ápolja, de nem azokra épít. Ez a feltörő réteg ad reményt némi optimizmusra. ----------------------------------------------------------- Viewing land first of all as a production asset, I think practical thinking is useful rather than nostalgia. There are two generally held views in this field. One is the liberal approach, i.e. that land is a production asset used to make profit just like any other production asset, as a basis of classical extended reproduction. The other approach ignores economic categories and views land as the treasure of the nation, the basis of farming life and a source of life itself. Should this latter theory ignore the factual characteristics of land which exist whether we want then or not, we come to the present situation of Hungarian agriculture, i.e. that apart from some raw materials, we are eliminated from the market. Let’s not pretend otherwise – this is the truth. Our typical mass products hardly require a labour force, our farmers have less and less to do and their livelihood is in jeopardy. The ones to survive – and fortunately there are ore and more of them – are those who stop daydreaming and instead take into consideration the laws of economy, take advantage of the regulatory system, and manage themselves. They strive to maximise profits to reach an acceptable level of living standards, public dues, while allowing additional expenditure. Rather than focusing only on development projects, they secure the necessary revolving funds, while employing sustainable green production methods. They consciously keep traditions alive without basing their actions on them. This ambitious group of farmers is a reason for optimism.";"Nagy, Frigyes";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016206605";"http://purl.umn.edu/99198";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400160164";"Uniform global deforestation patterns — An empirical analysis";"";"The forest transition (FT) hypothesis implies that changes in a region's forest cover follow a determinable pattern of decline and later re-expansion over time, which is supposed to be similar across regions and countries. Such a uniform pattern – if empirically proven and quantified – might help in establishing REDD+ baselines (i.e., references against which reductions in the emissions from deforestation and forest degradation of developing countries could be measured, and subsequently be rewarded). REDD+ baselines are required to be based on a globally standardised method and also to consider country-specific circumstances. These requirements might be fulfilled by applying the concept of forest transition in a baseline setting. With the objective of finding empirical evidence for a uniform global deforestation pattern, we specified a model of forest cover decline which is empirically testable at the global scale. Referring to the causal theory of the FT concept, we define variables which are globally testable with currently available data. By parameterisation of different model specifications, we first analyse deforestation patterns of developing countries, applying cross-section data from the most recent FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010. Population density, cereal area yield, land suitability and the proportion of potential forest vegetation area are determined to significantly explain the variance of forest cover decline. In a next step, we test the basic model by including modelled historical cross-section data of developed countries. The previously defined model was still found to be valid and no significant differences occurred between developing and developed countries. Hence, a uniform pattern of forest cover decline could be detected on the national scale for 140 countries by an adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.788. The empirical evidence of a deforestation pattern provides the necessary justification for any further discussion of an inclusion in REDD+ baselines.";"Köthke, Margret

"AGRIS:US2016202327";"Trade and Intellectual Property Rights in the Agricultural Seed Sector";"";"The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) has continued to be fiercely debated between North and South, particularly with respect to its provisions for the agricultural sector. Article 27.3(b) of the TRIPS Agreement requires WTO member countries to offer some form of intellectual property protection for new plant varieties, either in the form of patents (common in the U.S.) or plant breeder’s rights (PBR). This paper analyses the effects of the introduction of PBRs in almost 70 importing countries on the value of exports of agricultural seeds and planting material from 10 exporting EU countries, including all principal traditional exporters of seeds, as well as the US. A fixed effects quantile regression model, based on the general specification for the gravity model for international trade, is estimated using panel data covering 19 years (1989-2007) of export flows in order to assess the effect of International Convention on the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) membership on seed imports. Basing inference on the panel bootstrap, we find no significant effect from UPOV membership on seed imports.";"Eaton, Derek J.F.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-06-31";"en";"agriculture";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016202327";"http://purl.umn.edu/51782";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201600190454";"Modelling forest bird community richness using CORINE land cover data: a study at the landscape scale in Hungary";"";"In this study we (1) examined the applicability of the widely available CORINE land cover map of Europe in predicting several components of the richness of forest breeding bird community, and (2) analysed how different ecologically meaningful species groups respond to the differences in landscape composition and how these differences are reflected in the relationships between total species richness and richness of these species groups at the 2.5 Ã 2.5 km2 scale. We found that landscape composition had only moderate success in predicting the richness components of the forest bird community. The predictive power of the applied general linear models differed very much: roughly 60% of the observed variance was explained when the dependent variables (species richness and abundance) were calculated using data of all the 21 studied forest bird species or that of common forest birds. However, species richness and abundance of groups of more vulnerable species were predicted with much less success (30% variance explained), suggesting that CORINE is not an adequate tool in predicting the conservation status of these sensitive forest birds. Forest cover explicated 90 to 100% of the explained variance in the models suggesting that forest bird community was much less sensitive to the type of land cover occuring in the surroundings. We showed that richness and abundance of selected species groups had different non-linear relationships with total species richness, suggesting that â if used alone â, total species richness is a weak predictor of other richness components of the forest bird community.";"Mag, Zs.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

"AGRIS:US201500082867";"Range expansion and comparative habitat use of insular, congeneric lagomorphs: invasive European hares Lepus europaeus and endemic Irish hares Lepus timidus hibernicus";"";"The European hare (Lepus europaeus) has declined throughout its native range but invaded numerous regions where it has negatively impacted native wildlife. In southern Sweden, it replaces the native mountain hare (L. timidus) through competition and hybridisation. We investigated temporal change in the invasive range of the European hare in Ireland, and compared its habitat use with the endemic Irish hare (L. timidus hibernicus). The range of the European hare was three times larger and its core range twice as large in 2012–2013 than in 2005. Its rate of radial range expansion was 0.73 km year⁻¹with its introduction estimated to have occurred ca. 1970. Both species utilised improved and rough grasslands and exhibited markedly similar regression coefficients with almost every land cover variable examined. Irish hares were associated with low fibre and high sugar content grass (good quality grazing) whilst the invader had a greater tolerance for low quality forage. European hares were associated with habitat patch edge density, suggesting it may be more suited to using hedgerows as diurnal resting sites than the Irish hare. Consequently, the invader had a wider niche breadth than the native but their niche overlap was virtually complete. Given the impact of the European hare on native species elsewhere, and its apparent pre-adaption for improved grasslands interspersed with arable land (a habitat that covers 70 % of Ireland), its establishment and range expansion poses a significant threat to the ecological security of the endemic Irish hare, particularly given their ecological similarities.";"Caravaggi, Anthony

There is, however, still a long way to go to replicate, adapt and develop approaches to take such ideas to scale and increase productivity within existing agricultural water management contexts. Recognizing this, the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) seeks to achieve sustainable intensification through productive and efficient use of resources, restoring the productive capacity of degraded agricultural landscapes and reducing risk and uncertainty through the sustainable management of land and water resources. WLE research has contributed to reductions in fertilizer use through substitution with reused organic waste products, improved groundwater governance in India and changing the policy framework for smallholder farmers in Africa to improve their access to simple water management technologies. Achieving more widespread adoption of these kinds of practices requires evidence which can increase our understanding of the constraints and effectiveness of different options; an openness to explore new and sometimes counterâintuitive ideas; working across institutional boundaries; consideration of the rainfed to irrigation continuum; and a commitment to provide the necessary policy framework, capacity and resources to support incentives for change.";"Bird, Jeremy";"";"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"sustainable land management;water management;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IND;002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600187004";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.1838";"";"";"";"146-153"

Their land is exploited and occupied, which facilitates the rapid development of economy, as well as brings the gap between the poor and the rich and the inharmonious disputes. The necessity for protecting the land right of farmers under the new situation is expounded, covering the necessity of carrying out the relevant agricultural policies; the necessity of improving rural economic status and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas; the necessity of reducing land disputes and constructing harmonious society. The violation of farmers’ land rights is analyzed from two aspects. The first one is the violation of farmers’ land right in land tenure section , which includes the lack of ecological compensation system the lack of contract operation right; the second one is the violation of farmers’ land right in land transfer section, including the absence of land requisition system, substandard land contract and land transfer and the limitation of house stead circulation; the third one is the vacant of land development right affects farmers’ share of enjoying the added value of land.

"AGRIS:US201600197861";"Environmental factors influencing the occurrence of coyotes and conflicts in urban areas";"";"The increase of global urbanization can have effects on wildlife species, including carnivores such as coyotes (Canis latrans). As coyotes continue to settle in more urban areas, reports of human-coyote conflicts, such as attacks on humans or pets, may also increase. Understanding environmental variables that might influence whether or not coyotes and human-coyote conflicts will occur in certain urban areas may assist wildlife officials in creating management plans for urban wildlife. We conducted a survey of 105 urban areas in the United States requesting information on the occurrence of coyotes and human-coyote conflicts. We analyzed the responses with data on human population size, geographic region, land cover, housing density, and precipitation. Larger urban areas were more likely to contain both coyotes and human-coyote conflicts, and were also more likely to have greater numbers of conflicts. Urban areas in the western regions with larger amounts of high-intensity development and less forested and agricultural areas were more likely to have conflicts. Most urban areas considered the management of conflicts to be of low priority and emphasized education of citizens rather than removal of individual coyotes. Our results may assist urban wildlife managers in understanding the geographic and demographic factors correlated with the occurrence of coyotes and human-coyote conflicts. Practices such as education campaigns and landscape design incorporating wildlife habitat modifications (e.g., reducing dense cover) may reduce human-carnivore conflicts in urban ecosystems.";"Poessel, Sharon A.

Magyarország kiváló mezőgazdasági adottságaiból kiindulva többen már biomassza nagyhatalomként is aposztrofálták hazánkat. A biomassza-alapú energiatermelés (azaz a bioenergetika) lehetőségeinek és korlátainak vitájában azonban gyakran elkövetik azt a hibát, hogy a kérdést a fenntarthatóságtól függetlenül tárgyalják. Ennek következtében országos, ágazati vagy projektszinten is találkozha¬tunk félrevezető kalkulációkkal, amelyek téves üzleti vagy akár gazdaságpolitikai döntések forrásává álhatnak. Tanulmányunkban azt javasoljuk, hogy a bioenergetikai ágazat stratégiai fejlesztésénél a fenntartható energiagazdálkodás legyen a kiindulópont, és felvázoljuk ennek rendszerét, összetevőit, közéjük illesztve a bioenergetikát is. A bioenergetikai potenciál mértékének meghatározásakor pedig, az egységes fogalomhasználat érdekében, az igen eltérő tartalmú lehetséges potenciálok közül a fenntartható potenciált javasoljuk alapul venni, miután kalkulálni vagy realizálni a bioenergetikai potenciált messze nem ugyanaz. A teljesség igénye nélkül rámutatunk több nyitott kérdésre, amelyek korrekt megválaszolása előfeltétele a formálódó új ágazat, a bioenergetika kibontakozásának. Ezek között fontos szerepe van a környezeti előnyök-hátrányok átfogó mérlegelésének, illetve a társadalmi hatásoknál a közvetlen és közvetett munkahelyteremtő potenciál elemzésének.   ----------------------------------  The increasing importance of energy supply among the global challenges of mankind is drawing the attention of many people to the possible role of agriculture in this field. Taking into account the outstanding agricultural potential of Hungary some experts consider our country a leading power in biomass. When discussing the potential and limitations of energy production from biomass (i.e. bioenergetics), however, a very common mistake is to ignore its sustainability aspects. This leads to misleading calculations becoming a basis of false business or even economic policy decisions at national, industry or project level. In our study we propose to make sustainable energy management the starting point for strategic development in the bioenergy industry. We outline the relevant system and its elements, as well as the role of bioenergetics as one of the components. To promote consistent use of terminology, we propose to use sustainable capacity as the basis for assessing bioenergetics potential – out of the various potential concepts with widely differing content – as calculation and realization of bioenergetics potential are two very different things. The paper points out some open questions which need to be properly addressed if the emerging new industry, bioenergetics is to reach maturity. These include issues such as the comprehensive analysis of environmental benefits and disadvantages, as well as the analysis of a social aspect, the industry’s direct and indirect effect on job creation.";"Dinya, Laszlo";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016207550";"http://purl.umn.edu/92488";"";"";"";""

EuroâAmerican settlement and 20thâcentury fire suppression practices drastically altered historic fire regimes, leading to excessive fuel accumulation and uncharacteristically severe wildfires in some areas and diminished flammability resulting from shifts to more fireâsensitive forest species in others. Prescribed fire is a valuable tool for fuel management and ecosystem restoration, but the practice is fraught with controversy and uncertainty. Here, we summarize fire use in the forests and woodlands of North America and the current state of the practice, and explore challenges associated with the use of prescribed fire. Although new scientific knowledge has reduced barriers to prescribed burning, societal aversion to risk often trumps known, longâterm ecological benefits. Broader implementation of prescribed burning and strategic management of wildfires in fireâdependent ecosystems will require improved integration of science, policy, and management, and greater societal acceptance through education and public involvement in landâmanagement issues.";"Ryan, Kevin C

The basic assumption for the model is that land users select the land use alternative from a set of agricultural and silvicultural land use systems which is expected to generate the highest possible land rent. The model is used to estimate effects of fully decoupled transfer payments on land use in a less favoured region in Hesse, Germany. The results confirm that the CAP Reform removes the distorting effects of coupled transfer payments. The extent and direction of land use changes are spatially variant. Overall, the CAP Reform will lead to increases of permanent grassland area at the cost of arable land. The total agricultural land rent generated in the region will grow substantially, mainly due to higher amounts of transfer payments.";"Weinmann, Bernd

To assess the accuracy of a change map, stratified sampling is often implemented with a disproportionately larger sample size allocated to the map change stratum. But this allocation targeting user's accuracy of change is not necessarily effective for the competing objective of estimating the area of change. Sampling theory provides the basis for deciding a sample size allocation to strata when multiple, but competing estimation objectives are of interest.

In this study we used a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data and Landsat imagery to identify areas that changed from 2001 to 2008 as a result of irrigation and water-level fluctuations in the Nile River and nearby waterbodies. We used two different methods of time series analysis – principal components analysis (PCA) and harmonic decomposition – applied to the MODIS 250 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images to derive simple three-class land-cover maps and then assessed their accuracy using a set of reference polygons derived from 30 m Landsat 5 and 7 imagery. We analysed our MODIS 250 m maps against a new MODIS global land-cover product (MOD12Q1 collection 5) to assess whether regionally specific mapping approaches are superior to a standard global product. Results showed that the accuracy of the PCA-based product was greater than the accuracy of either the harmonic decomposition or MOD12Q1 products for the years 2001, 2003 and 2008. However, the accuracy of the PCA product was only slightly better than the MOD12Q1 for 2001 and 2003. Overall, the results suggest that our PCA-based approach produces a high level of user and producer accuracies, although the MOD12Q1 product also showed consistently high accuracy. Overlay of 2001–2008 PCA-based maps showed a net increase of 12,129 ha of irrigated vegetation, with the largest increase found from 2006 to 2008 around the districts of Edfu and Kom Ombo. This result was unexpected in light of ambitious government plans to develop 336,000 ha of irrigated agriculture around the Toshka Lakes.";"Fuller, Douglas O.

"AGRIS:US201301722798";"Grazing effects on the sustainability of an oak coppice forest";"";"In Greece, deciduous oak forests usually provide both, wood production and grazing of understory vegetation. Grazing as a management tool was assayed in a deciduous oak coppice forest of 2000ha under conversion during the management period of 1991-2005 in Central Macedonia, Greece. In this forest, 1340 cows and 3880 goats were grazing from May to October along the years. The impact of grazing pressure on forest growth was related to the difference of the overall wood stock in two sampling times conducted during the management period of 1991 and 2005. Three grazing pressures were distinguished in the forest: heavy, moderate and light. The moderate grazing improved tree growth and provided significant wood production during the management period. It has also resulted in a sustainable production of herbage and browse in the understory, supporting the maintenance of the livestock. It seems that the conversion of a deciduous oak coppice forest to a high forest along with livestock grazing in the understory is a very efficient management scheme for sustainable production in such a forest.";"Ainalis, Apostolos B.

The area is characterized by harsh environment, fragile ecosystems and limited water resources and arable lands. Throughout its long history these lands were the main source of grain and animal production. By the end of this century and in spite of the national, regional and international efforts to combat desertification and mitigate the effect of drought and desiccation, desertification is still one of the major environmental problems in the Arab Region. The rapid increase in population by some 3% annually, considered among the highest worldwide, along with the changing of consumption patterns and life styles, resulting in increasing food demand, have hastened land degradation in this arid environment. Land degradation in the Arab Region due to misuse is widespread and is proceeding at accelerating rates. Failures of resource management policies are aggravated by overgrazing, overexploitation of water and land resources, overcultivation of marginal lands, deforestation, and the use of inappropriate technologies.

On the basis of the observation monthly climatic data collected from 782 weather stations of China during the period from 1981 to 2010, the climatic scenarios data of RCP26, RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios released by CMIP5, and the land cover current data of China in 2010, the land cover scenarios of southwestern China were respectively simulated. The average total accuracy and Kappa index of SMLCS are 90.25 and 87.96 %, respectively. The results show that there would be a very apparent similar variety on the spatial distribution pattern of land cover in the karst areas of southwestern China under all the three scenarios during the period from 2010 to 2100, but there would have the different change rate. In general, the change rate of land cover type under RCP85 scenario would be the fastest, then under RCP45 scenario, and under RCP26 would be the slowest. From 2010 to 2100, deciduous coniferous forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, grassland, cropland, nival area, and desert and bare rock would have a gradual decrease trend, while evergreen coniferous forest, evergreen broadleaf forests, mixed forest, scrublands, wetlands, construction built-up land, and water bodies body would gradually increase in karst areas of southwestern China, in which wetland would have the fastest increase rate (5.28 % per decade on average), and desert and bare rock would decrease with the fastest rate (2.34 % per decade on average).";"Fan, Zemeng

This paper focuses on the potential impact of the reform on land idling decisions in France with the help of a survey of the intentions of landowners. Both operator and non-operator landowners were considered since, although SFP entitlements are owned only by operator landowners in France, non-operator landowners may now have a higher incentive to switch to operating land by idling land and maintaining it under GAEC in order to claim SFPs. The key variables in landowners’ decisions to idle land in GAEC appear to be both monetary and non-monetary. Despite the likely difference in conversion and cross-compliance costs, operators and non-operators were shown to be equally uninterested in GAEC, suggesting that no dramatic changes in terms of idling land should occur in France as a result of the 2003 reform.";"Bougherara , Douadia

The integration of environmental indicators such as landscape indicators, for the characterization and monitoring of the Alentejo Extremadura area is one of the most relevant components of the project. This paper reports the achievements in defining Local Landscape Units (LLU) for a pilot area of Central Alentejo – the Pardiela river basin. The methodological approach applied Geographic Information System tools to integrate soils, geomorphology and land cover. The land cover map applies the CORINE Land Cover Legend Level 5 to Central Alentejo at a scale of 1 : 10,000. This map contains variables related to vegetation, hydrology (streams and water bodies) and human settlements (buildings, equipment, roads).

With more than a decade of use, the actual farm-level environmental impact of HT canola can be evaluated. This article reports on a spring 2007 survey of nearly 600 canola farmers in the three prairie provinces of Western Canada. Producers were asked about their crop production experiences for 2005 and 2006 and expected crop planting for 2007. A reduction in the total number of chemical applications over the 3-year period was reported, resulting in a decrease of herbicide active ingredient being applied to farmland in Western Canada of nearly 1.3 million kg annually. Fewer tillage passes over the survey period were reported, improving moisture conservation, decreasing soil erosion and contributing to carbon sequestration in annual cropland. An estimated 1 million tonnes of carbon is either sequestered or no longer released under land management facilitated by HT canola production, as compared to 1995. The value of this carbon off-set is estimated to be C$5 million. Comparisons with similar studies and against non-adoption of HT canola can guide future decisions about HT canola adoption.";"Smyth, Stuart J.

"AGRIS:US201301707357";"Interacting effects of management and environmental variability at multiple scales on invasive species distributions";"";"1. The distribution and abundance of invasive species can be driven by both environmental variables and land management decisions. However, understanding these relationships can be complicated by interactions between management actions and environmental variability, and differences in scale among these variables. The resulting 'context-dependence' of management actions may be well-appreciated by ecologists and land managers, but can frustrate attempts to apply general management principles. 2. In this study, we quantify the effects of land management and environmental variability at different scales on the occurrence and abundance of Hieracium pilosella, a major agricultural weed in New Zealand. We used a hierarchical study design and analysis to capture relevant scales of variation in management actions and environmental heterogeneity, and test hypotheses about how these factors interact. 3. We show that fertilizing and grazing interact with environmental gradients at the scale of management application (farm paddocks) to influence the establishment and local abundance of H. pilosella. 4. We further show that H. pilosella's relationships with fine-scale abiotic and biotic factors are consistent with expected mechanisms driven by larger-scale management actions. Using data on occurrence and local abundance, we tease apart which factors are important to establishment and subsequent local spread. 5.Synthesis and applications. A major challenge for environmental scientists is to predict how invasive species may respond to ongoing landscape modifications and environmental change. This effort will require approaches to study design and analysis that can accommodate complexities such as interacting management and environmental variables at different scales. Management actions will be more likely to succeed when they explicitly account for variation in environmental context.";"Diez, Jeffrey M.

"AGRIS:US201500217289";"Capitalization by formalization? – Challenging the current paradigm of land reforms";"";"Most of the land reforms in developing countries in recent decades follow a blueprint that is based on the property rights theory. This blueprint was supported by Western government-backed development aid institutions and the World Bank and intends to achieve a capitalization of property rights on land by formalization and individualization. Its supporters expect higher efficiency of the land markets and higher tenure security. The focus of the article is not so much on the formalization efforts themselves, but on the capitalization of the use rights. In contrast to the opinions of the property rights theorists, it is argued that this approach leads to a decoupling of benefits and costs of land use, which causes external costs, encourages rent-seeking behaviour and weakens the state. The central statement of supporters of privatization, namely that this strategy supports the efficiency of land markets, is rejected. Instead, the approach gives way to economically efficient and powerful interests at the expense of other groups and a diversity of living forms. Some evidence is provided using the examples of Germany (as a Western “blueprint”) and Cambodia (as a land in reform process). The plea is to couple the benefits and costs of land use and thus to eliminate external effects. This coupling can be achieved by a “decapitalization” of the use right on land.";"Loehr, Dirk";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land use;property rights;land rights;land reform";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"DEU;KHM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217289";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.01.001";"";"";"";"837-845"

The experiment was based on traditionally conserved exclosures (ngitili). Data were collected in Shinyanga rural and Meatu districts, Tanzania, from October to November 2011. Five grazing strategies were compared: old private ngitili , young private ngitili , old communal ngitili , young communal ngitili and continuously grazed land. Aboveground biomass was significantly higher in old private ngitili than continuously grazed land, but there was no significant difference in amount of biomass between communal ngitili and continuously grazed land. The mean percentage basal cover was significantly higher in ngitili than continuously grazed land. The duration of protection (old ngitili compared with young ngitili) was not found to have any significant influence on both aboveground herbaceous biomass production and basal cover. The Shannon–Wiener index and Simpson index of diversity revealed no significant differences in species diversity among the different strategies. Both the continuously grazed land and communal ngitili were generally in poor condition and a special rehabilitation programme for improvement of these fragile grazing lands should be investigated.";"Selemani, Ismail S

"AGRIS:US201500217284";"direct use value of municipal commonage goods and services to urban households in the Eastern Cape, South Africa";"";"To redress past racial discrepancies in ownership and tenure, the ANC government of South Africa initiated programmes to make land accessible to the previously disadvantaged. A key component of the national land reform programme was the provision of commonage lands to urban municipalities for use by the urban poor. However, there has been no assessment of the contribution that urban commonage makes to previously disadvantaged households. This study assessed the economic benefits of the commonage programme to local households, through an in-depth survey of 90 households across three small towns in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. We examined the marketed and non-marketed consumptive direct-use values of land-based livelihoods on commonage, calculated via the ‘own reported values’ approach. The results indicate that a proportion of South Africa's urban population rely to some degree on municipal commonage for part of their livelihoods. Commonage contributions to total livelihood incomes ranged between 14 and 20%. If the contributions from commonage were excluded, the incomes of over 10% of households in each study town would drop below the poverty line. Overall, the value of harvests from commonage was worth over R1 000 (US$ 142) per hectare per year and over R4.7 million (US$ 0.68 million) per commonage per year. However, the extent and nature of use and reliance was not uniform among households, so that we developed a typology of commonage users, with four types being identified. However, rapidly growing urban populations and high levels of poverty potentially threaten the sustainability of commonage resource use. Yet the national land reform programme focuses largely on the transfer of land to municipalities and not on sustainable management. Municipalities, in turn, invest relatively little in commonage management, and the little they do is focussed on livestock production. Non-timber forest products are not considered at all, even though this study shows that they are a vital resource for the urban poor, notably for energy and construction materials.";"Davenport, N.A.

"AGRIS:US201301958001";"Willow cover as a stream-recovery indicator under a conservation grazing plan";"";"Many rangeland streams and associated fisheries have suffered from livestock grazing as a cost of upland-forage utilization. Due to damage from intensive usage, restoration of damaged streams is now a common land-management objective. The Squaw Valley Ranch of Elko County, Nevada, US, in cooperation with the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Barrick Gold Corp., is attempting to improve those portions of the Rock Creek watershed negatively affected by past ranch operations. The watershed includes both historical and occupied habitat for the threatened Lahonton cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi [Richardson]). From 2003, and continuing to the present, hot-season livestock grazing on Squaw Valley Ranch private and permitted public-land riparian areas was greatly reduced. To assess the effectiveness of this conservation effort, we (1) evaluated BLM archived images of riparian photo points in the watershed, (2) tested for change over time using data from systematic, intermittent, aerial sampling that acquired 2-cm resolution images from low-altitude surveys conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2006, and (3) compared Landsat scenes of the area from before and after 2003. Willow (Salix spp.) cover was chosen as the primary ecological indictor of riparian condition and we introduce willow canopy (m2) per m of stream length in the image field-of-view, as a practical measure of willow status. Archived images from photo points show mostly low-condition riparian plant communities, often with little or no willow canopy evident before 2003, but with conspicuous improvement thereafter. This subjective perception is supported by objective analyses finding, (1) the relative increase in willow cover nearly tripled on one stream, more than doubled on three others, and increased on all but one (fire affected) and (2) a highly significant post-2003 increase in willows in the Landsat record. Thus, the post-2003 increase in willow cover documented in three complementary lines of evidence from ground, air, and space support the predicted ecological benefits of reduced hot-season riparian grazing and the utility of 2-cm imagery as a tool for assessing watershed-wide conservation benefits from a federal cost-share-eligible conservation practice. This appears to be the first use of willow measurements from an aerial survey as a particular indicator of riparian condition and trend and the first demonstration of change detection based on objective measurements from a watershed-scale riparian monitoring effort that used systematic sampling (versus subjective selection) and high sample density to address the large Type II error (false negative) risk common to conventional land-management survey efforts.";"Booth, D.

"AGRIS:US201500217282";"Rural–urban gradient analysis of ecosystem services supply and demand dynamics";"";"Urban regions are important places of ecosystem service demands and, at the same time, are the primary source of global environmental impacts. Although there is broad agreement on the importance of incorporating the concept of ecosystem services into policy strategies and decision-making, the lack of a standardized approach to quantifying ecosystem services at the landscape scale has hindered progress in this direction. Moreover, tradeoffs between ecosystem services and the supply/demand ratio of ecosystem services in urban landscapes have rarely been investigated. In our paper, we present a method to quantify and map the supply and demand of three essential provisioning services – energy, food, and water – along the rural–urban gradient of the eastern German region Leipzig–Halle. This urban region has experienced significant socio-economic dynamics and land use changes since the German reunification in 1990. The results show that both the demand and the supply of ecosystem services changed considerably during the time span under consideration (1990–2007). We identified an increasing supply/demand ratio of food and water but a decreasing supply/demand ratio of energy. In addition, the pattern of ecosystem demands shows a levelling of rural–urban gradients, reflecting profound modifications of traditional rural–urban relationships. The changes of ecosystem service supply gradients are determined more by land use intensity, such as the intensification of agricultural production, than by land cover changes such as urban sprawl. The comparison of supply/demand ratios and rural–urban patterns of ecosystem services can help decision-makers in landscape management in striving for a sustainable balance between resource supply and demand.";"Kroll, Franziska

"AGRIS:US201500014682";"Patterns of seagrass community response to local shoreline development";"";"Three quarters of the global human population will live in coastal areas in the coming decades and will continue to develop these areas as population density increases. Anthropogenic stressors from this coastal development may lead to fragmented habitats, altered food webs, changes in sediment characteristics, and loss of near-shore vegetated habitats. Seagrass systems are important vegetated estuarine habitats that are vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors, but provide valuable ecosystem functions. Key to maintaining these habitats that filter water, stabilize sediments, and provide refuge to juvenile animals is an understanding of the impacts of local coastal development. To assess development impacts in seagrass communities, we surveyed 20 seagrass beds in lower Chesapeake Bay, VA. We sampled primary producers, consumers, water quality, and sediment characteristics in seagrass beds, and characterized development along the adjacent shoreline using land cover data. Overall, we could not detect effects of local coastal development on these seagrass communities. Seagrass biomass varied only between sites, and was positively correlated with sediment organic matter. Epiphytic algal biomass and epibiont (epifauna and epiphyte) community composition varied between western and eastern regions of the bay. But, neither eelgrass (Zostera marina) leaf nitrogen (a proxy for integrated nitrogen loading), crustacean grazer biomass, epifaunal predator abundance, nor fish and crab abundance differed significantly among sites or regions. Overall, factors operating on different scales appear to drive primary producers, seagrass-associated faunal communities, and sediment properties in these important submerged vegetated habitats in lower Chesapeake Bay.";"Blake, Rachael E.

Soil Sci. 92: 383â402. Mollisols â a.k.a., Black Soils or Prairie Soils â make up about 916 million ha, which is 7% of the world's ice-free land surface. Their distribution strongly correlates with native prairie ecosystems, but is not limited to them. They are most prevalent in the mid-latitudes of North America, Eurasia, and South America. In North America, they cover 200 million ha of the United States, more than 40 million ha of Canada and 50 million ha of Mexico. Across Eurasia they cover around 450 million ha, extending from the western 148 million ha in southern Russia and 34 million ha in Ukraine to the eastern 35 million ha in northeast China. They are common to South America's Argentina and Uruguay, covering about 89 million and 13 million ha, respectively. Mollisols are often recognized as inherently productive and fertile soils. They are extensively and intensively farmed, and increasingly dedicated to cereals production, which needs significant inputs of fertilizers and tillage. Mollisols are also important soils in pasture, range and forage systems. Thus, it is not surprising that these soils are prone to soil erosion, dehumification (loss of stable aggregates and organic matter) and are suffering from anthropogenic soil acidity. Therefore, soil scientists from all of the world's Mollisols regions are concerned about the sustainability of some of current trends in land use and agricultural practices. These same scientists recommend increasing the acreage under minimum or restricted tillage, returning plant residues and adding organic amendments such as animal manure to maintain or increase soil organic matter content, and more systematic use of chemical amendments such as agricultural limestone to replenish soil calcium reserves.";"Liu, Xiaobing

"AGRIS:US201400049141";"Between Forestry and Farming: Policy and Environmental Implications of the Barriers to Agroforestry Adoption";"";"Farming and forestry are practices with clearly defined institutions, markets, and policies. These are not as clearly defined for agroforestry, a practice experiencing increased interest in the USA. This study examined the barriers preventing the adoption of agroforestry within a household level theoretical framework informed by transaction costs and multifunctionality, using survey data from 353 Missouri (USA) landowners. Costs of establishing or managing trees, the time required to manage, and the lack of tree management experience are perceived as the most influential barriers limiting implementation of agroforestry on the farm. A principal component factor analysis of the perceived barriers identified two factors: the first, labeled Transaction Costs, related to information access and perceived establishment costs; the second factor, labeled Profitability Concerns, was associated with perceptions of the effects of agroforestry on farm profitability and agricultural production. Overall, Transaction Costs appears to be a greater barrier to implementation of agroforestry. Cluster analysis yielded three types of landowners: environmentalists, agriculturalists, and disengaged, who differ in their perceptions of these barriers. Statistical tests revealed differences among clusters on their farmland attributes, multifunctionality indicators, and their resources for adopting agroforestry. Environmentalists appear as more likely to adopt agroforestry, followed by the agriculturalists. Policy implications are also discussed. Les secteurs de l’agriculture et de la foresterie possèdent des institutions, des marchés et des politiques clairement définis. Ces éléments ne sont pas aussi clairement définis dans le cas du secteur de l’agroforesterie, qui recueille un intérêt croissant aux États‐Unis. Dans la présente étude, nous avons examiné les obstacles à l’adoption de l’agroforesterie à l’aide d’un cadre théorique au niveau des ménages comprenant des données sur les coûts de transaction et la multifonctionnalité issues d’un sondage réalisé auprès de 353 propriétaires fonciers dans l’État du Missouri, aux États‐Unis. Les coûts de plantation, le temps nécessaire à la gestion et le manque d’expérience en gestion arboricole sont perçus comme étant les principaux obstacles à l’implantation de l’agroforesterie sur la ferme. Une analyse en composantes principales a permis de déterminer deux facteurs : le premier, appelé Coûts de transaction (Transaction Costs), était liéà l’accès à l’information et aux coûts de plantation perçus; le deuxième, appelé Inquiétudes sur la rentabilité (Profitability Concerns), était liéà la perception des conséquences de l’agroforesterie sur la rentabilité et la production de la ferme. De manière générale, les Coûts de transaction semblent constituer le plus important obstacle à l’implantation de l’agroforesterie. Une analyse de grappes a fait ressortir trois types de propriétaires fonciers : les environnementalistes, les agriculturalistes et les désengagés, qui ont une perception bien différente de ces obstacles. Des tests statistiques ont révélé des différences parmi les grappes quant aux attributs de leurs terres agricoles, aux indicateurs de multifonctionnalité et à leurs ressources pour adopter l’agroforesterie. Les Environnementalistes semblent plus enclins à adopter l’agroforesterie, suivis des Agriculturalistes. Nous avons aussi abordé l’incidence sur les politiques.";"Valdivia, Corinne

More than 450,000 ha were burned. The severity of those fires has led to calls for massively increased planned burning for fuel reduction, with a Government Enquiry (a Royal Commission) currently considering all aspects of the fires and future policy, to help safeguard life and property. Public concerns are naturally high, and any measures suggested to reduce the likelihood and severity of future fires must be appraised seriously. However, the conservation of Victoria's heritage of biodiversity is also of major concern, and—in particular—the outcomes of the more extensive use of fire for invertebrates have scarcely been heeded even in current prescriptions for planned burning. In this essay, we assemble some information on invertebrate interactions with fire in the region, and use this to suggest guides for improved fire management practices that are based more on scientific principles that focus on invertebrate conservation.";"New, T.

"AGRIS:US201300894124";"Fuzzy-logic modeling of land suitability for hybrid poplar across the Prairie Provinces of Canada";"";"Determining the feasibility of a large-scale afforestation program is one approach being investigated by the Government of Canada to increase Canada's potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Large-scale afforestation, however, requires knowledge of where it is suitable to establish and grow trees. Spatial models based on Boolean logic and/or statistical models within a geographic information system may be used for this purpose, but empirical environmental data are often lacking, and the association of these data to land suitability is most often a subjective process. As a solution to this problem, this paper presents a fuzzy-logic modeling approach to assess land suitability for afforestation of hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) over the Prairie Provinces of Canada. Expert knowledge regarding the selection and magnitudes of environmental variables were integrated into fuzzy rule sets from which estimates of land suitability were generated and presented in map form. The environmental variables selected included growing season precipitation, climate moisture index, growing degree days, and Canada Land Inventory capability for agriculture and elevation. Approximately 150,000 km², or 28% of the eligible land base within the Prairie Provinces was found to be suitable for afforestation. Accuracy assessments conducted with fuzzy accuracy methods provided a more descriptive assessment of the resulting land suitability map than figures generated from a more conventional Boolean-based accuracy measure. Modeling, mapping and accuracy assessment issues were identified for future extension of this work to map hybrid poplar land suitability over Canada.";"Joss, B. N.

"AGRIS:US201400081840";"Western Land Managers Will Need All Available Tools For Adapting To Climate Change, Including Grazing: A Critique of Beschta et al";"";"In a previous article, Beschta et al. (2013) argue that grazing by large ungulates (both native and domestic) should be eliminated or greatly reduced on western public lands to reduce potential climate change impacts. The authors were selective in their use of the scientific literature, and their publication is more of an opinion article than a synthesis. Their conclusions do not reflect the complexities associated with herbivore grazing. Interactions of climate change and grazing will depend on the specific situation. For example, increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperatures may increase both accumulation of fine fuels (primarily grasses) and thus increase wildfire risk. Prescribed grazing by livestock is one of the few management tools available for reducing fine fuel accumulation. While there are certainly points on the landscape where herbivore impacts can be identified, there are also vast grazed areas where impacts are minimal. Broad scale reduction of domestic and wild herbivores to help native plant communities cope with climate change will be unnecessary because over the past 20 to 50 years land managers have actively sought to bring populations of native and domestic herbivores in balance with the potential of vegetation and soils. To cope with a changing climate, land managers will need access to all available vegetation management tools, including grazing.";"Svejcar, Tony

"AGRIS:US201400081841";"Is Fire Exclusion in Mountain Big Sagebrush Communities Prudent? Soil Nutrient, Plant Diversity, and Arthropod Response to Burning";"";"Fire has largely been excluded from many mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. vaseyana (Rydb.) Beetle) communities. Land and wildlife managers are especially reluctant to reintroduce fire in mountain big sagebrush plant communities, especially those communities without significant conifer encroachment, because of the decline in sagebrush-associated wildlife. Given this management direction, a better understanding of fire exclusion and burning effects are needed. We compared prescribed burned to unburned control plots at six sites on the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Oregon. Burning generally increased soil nutrient availability, though not all measured soil nutrient concentrations varied between the burn and control plots. Plant diversity initially increased with burning, but then decreased. Burning altered the arthropod community, which included doubling the density of arthropods the first year after treatment. Some arthropod Orders increased and others decreased with burning. For example, Araneae (spiders) were 1.7- and 1.8-fold less and Hemiptera (true bugs) were 6.6- and 2.1-fold greater in the burn compared to the control in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Our results provide evidence that burning can create spatial and temporal heterogeneity in mountain big sagebrush communities and thus, it is an important component of the ecosystem. We suggest that management plans for many mountain big sagebrush communities may need to include infrequent burning. At the very least managers should be aware that fire exclusion has some potentially negative impacts other than the encroachment of conifers in these communities.";"Davies, Kirk W.

"AGRIS:US201301607187";"Maps, markets and Merlot: The making of an antipodean wine appellation";"";"Rural places acquire value in different ways and geographers have adopted a range of approaches to understand the way value is created in land and place. This paper analyses the case of the Gimblett Gravels wine district in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. This district has been transformed over the space of 20 years from a peri-urban wasteland to, now, one of the most sought-after and expensive winegrowing areas in the country. In this process of revaluation, several forces were evident. There was an economic-environmental process, by which grape growers and winemakers learned that the district possessed the ability to produce consistent harvests of high quality red grapes and, consequently, land was purchased at ever-increasing rates. There was then a deliberate attempt to 'construct' the Gimblett Gravels district in the market place, the result of concerted co-operative action by winegrowers in the district to promote the idea of a Gimblett Gravels terroir in a registered trademark. Finally, we can see that the revaluation of the district has also been related to the wider social acceptance of wine as a fashionable commodity. These processes have occurred in a virtual legislative vacuum in New Zealand regarding the protection and regulation of geographical indicators, though this may soon change. Thus, to understand the value of place, it is argued that we need a multi-faceted approach that incorporates environmental and economic processes alongside political regulation and social construction.";"Overton, John

"AGRIS:US201300863173";"Combining sediment source tracing techniques with traditional monitoring to assess the impact of improved land management on catchment sediment yields";"";"This paper aims to demonstrate the potential value of combining sediment source tracing techniques with traditional monitoring approaches, when documenting the impact of improved land management on catchment sediment yields. It reports the results of an investigation undertaken in a small (1.19km²) agricultural catchment in southern Brazil, which was monitored before and after the implementation of improved land management practices. Attention focussed on 50 storm events that occurred between May 2002 and March 2006 and which reflected the behaviour of the catchment during the pre-change, transition and post-change periods. Improved land management, involving minimum-till cultivation and the maintenance of good crop cover, was introduced in early 2003. The traditional monitoring provided a basis for evaluating the changes in storm runoff volume, storm hydrograph peak and storm-period sediment load and mean suspended sediment concentration. The results indicate that both storm runoff volumes and peak flows associated with a given amount of rainfall provided evidence of a significant decrease after the introduction of improved land management. Storm-period sediment loads showed a similar reduction, with a reduction by as much as 80% for low magnitude events and of ca. 40% for events of intermediate magnitude. However, there was no significant change in mean suspended sediment concentrations, indicating that the reductions in sediment load were primarily the result of the reduced storm runoff volume. Sediment source fingerprinting was used to explore the changes in the relative and absolute contributions to the storm sediment loads from the three key sources, namely the surface of the fields under crops, the unpaved roads and the stream channels. A comparison of the load-weighted mean contributions for the pre- and post-treatment periods indicated that the contribution from the field surfaces and unpaved roads decreased from 63% and 36% to 54% and 24%, respectively, whereas the contribution from the stream channels increased from ca. 2% to 22%. By relating the absolute amounts of sediment mobilised from each individual source group to variables representing the runoff and precipitation associated with the events, it was possible to identify changes in the response of the individual sediment sources to the changes in land management that occurred within the catchment. Sediment mobilisation from the stream channel during individual events increased substantially over the whole range of flows after the introduction of improved land management in the study catchment, whereas the amounts of sediment mobilised from the surfaces of the fields and the unpaved roads showed a significant decrease during events of low and intermediate magnitude. The short monitoring period associated with the study, coupled with inter-annual variations in rainfall, necessarily limit the scope and rigour of the study reported, but it is seen to provide a useful demonstration of how the coupling of sediment source tracing with more traditional monitoring techniques can provide an improved understanding of the impact of improved management practices on the sediment response of a catchment, as well as important information to inform the design and implementation of effective sediment management and control measures.";"Minella, Jean P.G.

The sustainable use of agricultural land is therefore essential to economic growth, human well-being, social equity, and ecosystem services. However, salinization, erosion, and desertification cause severe land degradation which, in turn, degrade human health and ecosystem services. Here, we review the impact of agricultural land use in the five countries of Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, during 2008–2013 in 362 articles. We use the Land Use Functions framework to analyze the type and relative shares of environmental, economic, and social topics related to agricultural land use. Our major findings are (1) research on land use in Central Asia received high levels of international attention and the trend in the number of publications exceeded the global average. (2) The impacts of land use on abiotic environmental resources were the most explored. (3) Little research is available about how agricultural land use affects biotic resources. (4) Relationships between land degradation, e.g., salinization and dust storms, and human health were the least explored.

In order to understand how alterations of such patterns could influence e.g. wildlife species occurrences and community composition, it is important to first study these relationships empirically and at the appropriate scale. We surveyed the wildlife community in a boreal ecosystem in central Sweden using pellet group counts, while walking ‘‘wildlife triangles’’. Our main aim was to investigate how the distribution of medium- and large-sized wild mammals and large-sized forest birds were affected by environmental variables at the landscape scale. In 2001––2003, pellet groups of mammals and forest birds were counted on 211 triangular routes with a perimeter of 4+4+4 km. The pellet groups which had accumulated after leaf fall were counted in spring. The environmental properties of each triangle, including information on latitude, altitude, infrastructure, land cover, forest type and forest stage, were determined using GIS maps. Statistical analyses involved mainly ordination (Principal Component Analysis, PCA). Significant environmental variables explaining the wildlife community composition and distribution in the boreal ecosystem were altitude, clear-felling and infrastructure. Our conclusion, however, is that most boreal mammal and forest bird species are habitat generalists and show little spatial pattern in distributions at the landscape scale. This indicates that habitat selectiveness probably occurs at a local scale in the boreal forest. Ultimately, our conclusion provides important direction for e.g. conservation measures and wildlife management.";"Wallgren, Määrtha

The ecological security pattern (ESP), an effective way for protecting the ecological security, is becoming increasingly important in reconciling the rapid urbanization and ecology protection in urban planning practices. Based on the cost-distance analysis method, we constructed a three-rank (basic, moderate and strict-rank) composite ESP of Gaoming (Guangdong, China) aiming at protecting the survivals and habitat securities of rare vegetations, wild animals and human beings. The proposed composite ESP is established on five equal-weighted individual ESPs (namely Geology-ESP, Hydrology-ESP, Atmosphere-ESP, Biodiversity-ESP and Farmland-ESP) for geologic disasters prevention, flood prevention and drinking water protection, air pollution prevention, biodiversity conservation and farmland protection, respectively. Our results show that under the basic, moderate, and strict- rank ESPs, the integration and connectivity of the ecological components are constantly improved, but the connectivity between neighboring urban patches decline gradually. The moderate-rank ESP proves to be the optimal spatial pattern for balancing the conflicts between urban development and ecological protection. Notably, the ESP that considers the security of atmosphere and farmland securities, which protects the regional farmlands better and well balance the expansions of industrial and residual lands, proves to be much more reasonable.";"Su, Yongxian

Information on land change modelling and carbon mapping can contribute to quantify future carbon emissions from deforestation. However limitations in data availability and technical capabilities may constitute an obstacle for countries interested in participating in the REDD programme. This paper evaluates the influence of quantity and allocation of mapped carbon stocks and expected deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation. The paper introduces the conceptual space where quantity and allocation are involved in predicting carbon emissions, and then uses the concepts to predict carbon emissions in the Brazilian Amazon, using previously published information about carbon mapping and deforestation modelling. Results showed that variation in quantity of carbon among carbon maps was the most influential component of uncertainty, followed by quantity of predicted deforestation. Spatial allocation of carbon within carbon maps was less influential than quantity of carbon in the maps. For most of the carbon maps, spatial allocation of deforestation had a minor but variable effect on the prediction of carbon emissions relative to the other components. The influence of spatial carbon allocation reaches its maximum when 50% of the initial forest area is deforested. The method can be applied to other case studies to evaluate the interacting effects of quantity and allocation of carbon with future deforestation on the prediction of carbon emissions from deforestation.";"GUTIERREZ-VELEZ, VICTOR HUGO

This complexity increases uncertainty in ecological forecasts, and impedes preparation for the ecological consequences of climate change. We describe a recently developed “multi-modeling” system for ecological forecasting in a 7600 km² watershed in the North American Great Lakes Basin. Using a series of linked land cover, climate, hydrologic, hydraulic, thermal, loading, and biological response models, we examined how changes in both land cover and climate may interact to shape the habitat suitability of river segments for common sport fishes and alter patterns of biological integrity. In scenario-based modeling, both climate and land use change altered multiple ecosystem properties. Because water temperature has a controlling influence on species distributions, sport fishes were overall more sensitive to climate change than to land cover change. However, community-based biological integrity metrics were more sensitive to land use change than climate change; as were nutrient export rates. We discuss the implications of this result for regional preparations for climate change adaptation, and the extent to which the result may be constrained by our modeling methodology.";"Wiley, M. J.

Population explosion in the world generates continuously growing demand on foods and industrial raw materials. Supply of increased demand is supported by R&D, at the same time using results of it polarizes the economies. In the agriculture the technical development (i.e. development of technical, technological and biological basis of production, chemicalization, education of human resources) produces potential for increasing efficiency of production. The first period of technical development serves characteristically the supply of quantitative demand, but after it reached the equilibrium of supply and demand, then qualitative development becomes aim. Development releases labour, which can be positive or negative externalities for society. Later on demand of sustainability appears, with its ecological, economical and social aspects. Based on experiences of Hungarian model realized in the 1970s and 1980s, the paper examines how technical development is realizable successfully in the frame of segmented farm structure, how competitive and efficient farming could be done in this structure, keeping in mind in advantages of large farms. The paper analyses the competitiveness of virtual large-scale farms (which are based on cooperation and coordination of small farms), and confirms their efficiency with model examinations.

"AGRIS:US2016216806";"Policies, Natural Resource Governance and Local Development";"";"The role that agriculture should play in economic development has been recognised for years. In recent years, concern has been expressed over rising agricultural and food prices. The world market prices for major food commodities have risen sharply to historic highs of more than 60 percent abovelevels just two years ago. Many factors have contributed to the rise in food commodity prices. Some factors reflect trends of slower growth in production and more rapid growth in demand that have contributed to a tightening of world balances of grains and oilseeds over the last decade. Otherfactors that have added to global food commodity price inflation include the declining value of the US dollar, rising energy prices, increasing agricultural costs of production, growing foreign exchangeholdings by major food-importing countries, and policies adopted recently by some exporting and importing countries to mitigate their own food price inflation (Trostle, 2008).Mozambique has a vast extension of land and diversity of natural resources. Resources areinadequately used, the rural income continues to fall, and poverty is increasing. The rural standard of living has been deteriorating year by year. To date, estimations reveal that between 60 and 80percent of cultivated land in all the provinces is concentrated in areas between 0.2 and 1 ha. For a sample of 192 farmers, using a translog stochastic production frontier like that of Bravo-Ureta andPinheiro (1993), who estimated a Cobb-Douglas total value product frontier for analysis purposes, the study found that the average economic efficiency (EE), technical efficiency (TE) and allocative efficiency (AE) for the sample were 11.6%, 83.0% and 13.7% respectively. These results suggestthat there is considerable room to maximise resource usage and increase agricultural output without additional input and given the existing technology.The adoption of new technologies designed to enhance farm output and income has receivedparticular attention as a means to accelerate economic development. However, output growth is not only determined by technological innovations, but also by the efficiency with which availabletechnologies are used in the absence of inefficiency factors. As Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro (1993)noted, the evidence presented in this study suggests that there is much room for improving the efficiency of natural resource management in general. The results based on frontier methodology are generally consistent with the notion that local actors play an important role in the management oflocal resources; consequently, public investments designed to enhance human and social capital at local level can be expected to generate additional skills and output even in the absence of newtechnologies. The participation of citizens in all stages is crucial.";"Massuanganhe, Israel Jacob";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"MOZ";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016216806";"http://purl.umn.edu/53061";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400106790";"Impact of reference datasets and autocorrelation on classification accuracy";"";"Reference data and accuracy assessments via error matrices build the foundation for measuring success of classifications. An error matrix is often based on the traditional holdout method that utilizes only one training/test dataset. If the training/test dataset does not fully represent the variability in a population, accuracy may be over – or under – estimated. Furthermore, reference data may be flawed by spatial errors or autocorrelation that may lead to overoptimistic results. For a forest study we first corrected spatially erroneous ground data and then used aerial photography to sample additional reference data around the field-sampled plots (Mannel et al.2006). These reference data were used to classify forest cover and subsequently determine classification success. Cross-validation randomly separates datasets into several training/test sets and is well documented to perform a more precise accuracy measure than the traditional holdout method. However, random cross-validation of autocorrelated data may overestimate accuracy, which in our case was between 5% and 8% for a 90% confidence interval. In addition, we observed accuracies differing by up to 35% for different land cover classes depending on which training/test datasets were used. The observed discrepancies illustrate the need for paying attention to autocorrelation and utilizing more than one permanent training/test dataset, for example, through a k-fold holdout method.¹Now at: Cottey College, 6000 W.

Using a mixed-integer linear programming model, this study examines the impacts of conservation-oriented community forest policies in Nepal on three household income groups.

"AGRIS:US201400106797";"Earthquake-induced landslide mapping in the western Himalayas using medium resolution ASTER imagery";"";"On 8 October 2005, a devastating earthquake struck northern Pakistan and several parts of Pakistani- and Indian-controlled Kashmir. The severely hit areas lie in close proximity to the most tectonically active region of the western Himalayas. The earthquake destroyed close to 400 000 houses and over 75 000 people lost their lives. The intensity of the earthquake was such that it triggered widespread landslides, which caused considerable destruction of the area's forests, and blocked the mountain roads and rivers. Satellite imagery-based analysis can be effectively used to provide critical geologic information for determining the causes of earthquakes, mapping of faults and lineaments, as well as for hazards and damage assessment mapping. In this study, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery acquired on 27 October 2005 was analysed to assess earthquake-induced land cover changes in severely hit areas. Image analysis techniques including intensity hue and saturation (IHS), principal component analysis (PCA), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) were applied on VNIR–SWIR bands of ASTER for the purpose of identification and mapping of landslides triggered by the earthquake in areas of northern Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. The techniques proved effective in identifying freshly exposed surfaces on mountain slopes, landslide scars and debris deposits. Accurate identification and mapping of landslides and slope failures can play an important role in post-earthquake damage assessment and hazards mapping in earthquake-prone mountainous areas.";"Lodhi, Mahtab A.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"PAK";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400106797";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.502158";"";"";"";"5331-5346"

"AGRIS:US201400183766";"Modeling of soil erosion and sediment transport in the East River Basin in southern China";"";"Soil erosion is a major global environmental problem that has caused many issues involving land degradation, sedimentation of waterways, ecological degradation, and nonpoint source pollution. Therefore, it is significant to understand the processes of soil erosion and sediment transport along rivers, and this can help identify the erosion prone areas and find potential measures to alleviate the environmental effects. In this study, we investigated soil erosion and identified the most seriously eroded areas in the East River Basin in southern China using a physically-based model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We also introduced a classical sediment transport method (Zhang) into SWAT and compared it with the built-in Bagnold method in simulating sediment transport process along the river. The derived spatial soil erosion map and land use based erosion levels can explicitly illustrate the identification and prioritization of the critical soil erosion areas in this basin. Our results also indicate that erosion is quite sensitive to soil properties and slope. Comparison of Bagnold and Zhang methods shows that the latter can give an overall better performance especially in tracking the peak and low sediment concentrations along the river. We also found that the East River is mainly characterized by sediment deposition in most of the segments and at most times of a year. Overall, the results presented in this paper can provide decision support for watershed managers about where the best management practices (conservation measures) can be implemented effectively and at low cost. The methods we used in this study can also be of interest in sediment modeling for other basins worldwide.";"Wu, Yiping

The ways in which people use land and/or natural resources within and around protected areas can also shift and evolve temporally but this remains an under-acknowledged challenge for protected area managers. Here we investigate the factors driving a rapid rise in charcoal production within a new, multiple-use protected area in Madagascar, to inform appropriate management responses. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 208 charcoal producers to ascertain the mix of livelihood activities they practised in 2010/2011 and 5 years previously. Respondents had diversified their livelihood activities over time, and cultivation and pastoralism had decreased as primary sources of revenue. Reasons for the growing reliance on charcoal production include the reduced viability of alternative livelihoods (primarily farming), as a result of changing rainfall patterns and the loss of irrigation infrastructure, as well as a growing need for cash to support themselves and their families. Our results suggest that charcoal production is not a desirable activity but a safety net when times are difficult. Conservation efforts to ameliorate underlying factors driving livelihood change, such as dam restoration, could reduce the prevalence of charcoal production, but simultaneous action to cut demand is also required. We recommend that mechanisms to detect, understand and respond to social change are integrated systematically into protected area management planning, alongside traditional biodiversity monitoring.";"Gardner, Charlie J.

The spatial and temporal consistency of an object-based change detection algorithm was tested through a multi-year application on the forest of Borneo, using SPOT-VEGETATION time series from 2000 to 2008. Continuous change thresholds allowed the tuning of the algorithm according to specific requirements in terms of omission and commission errors. The accuracy of the method was assessed using the ROC (relative operating characteristics) curves, which were found useful to evaluate the performance of the method independently of the selected threshold and to support the selection of an optimal threshold. The forest area that annually changed between 2000 and 2008 was detected and a cumulative change map was produced. The resulting change rates and the distribution of the forest change patterns were in agreement with other sources of information. These results demonstrated the very promising temporal consistency of the proposed approach. Further work aims at testing it at larger scales.";"Bontemps, Sophie

The data was obtained from assessments of range condition and recommended carrying capacity for individual ranch units that were completed between 1973 and 1993 by the Comision Tecnica para la Determinacion de Coeficientes de Agostadero. Variables measured were range condition, land tenure (communal ejido or private ranch), management characteristics (human density, livestock stocking rate, ranch size, and infrastructure condition), and bio-physical characteristics (rangeland site quality and precipitation in the year of assessment). We used a combination of simple, univariate chi-square analyses and more complex, multi-variate ordered logistic regression analyses to assess the relationships among these variables. There was no evidence from the logistic regression analysis that range condition of ranches in Sonora was related to the ejido or private tenure systems. Infrastructure condition was different between the 2 tenure systems, and infrastructure condition was positively related to range condition for both ejido and private ranches. Based on the univariate and multivariate analyses, precipitation amounts in the year of assessment was less for private ranches, and range condition on private ranches was more sensitive to precipitation than ejido ranches. Compared to estimates made in the 1960's and 1970's in other parts of Mexico, we found there to be less of a difference in stocking rate between the more lightly stocked private ranches and more heavily stocked ejido ranches, and generally good condition infrastructure on all ranches. The important relationship between precipitation and range condition implies that range condition assessments should be done over many years to produce estimates of trend that can be compared across wet and dry years.";"Coronado-Quintana, J.A.

Special attention is paid to incentives that decrease the profitability of irrigation water use and subsidies on improved irrigation technology. Although the literature and economic theory suggest that the range of possible incentives is wide (water pricing, metering, water rights, water markets, taxes, subsidies, information, participatory management, etc.), the results of this study show that the range of potentially effective incentives in the Yemeni political context is more limited due to difficulties of implementing and enforcing change. The Yemeni case is unique, as there is a close linkage between water and qat production. Reducing water consumption will substantially reduce the benefits from qat production and consequently farm income, which is a politically sensitive way of bringing about a balance between supply and demand of water.

In each trial, treatments with high and low soil organic C were chosen to represent contrasts in long-term soil management effects, including tillage intensity, organic matter and nutrient management and crop rotations. For each trial, a fallow representing a relatively undisturbed reference was also sampled. Earthworm taxonomic richness decreased in the direction fallow>high-C soil>low-C soil and earthworm abundance was higher in fallow than under continuous crop production. Termite abundance was not significantly different between fallow and high and low-C treatments and termite taxonomic richness was higher in fallow soil than in the two cropping systems. We concluded that fewer species of earthworms and termites were favored under agricultural management that led to lower soil C. Results indicated that the soil disturbance induced by continuous crop production was more detrimental to earthworms than to termites, when compared to the fallow.";"Ayuke, F.O.

"AGRIS:US201400181695";"Effects of land cover on runoff coefficient";"";"Land cover is considered to have significant influence on the hydrologic response of a river basin. In this study, we assessed how changes in land cover over time affected flood behaviour from 1988 to 2005, in the Upper Ping River Basin, northern Thailand. We correlated the types of land cover with rainfall–runoff behaviour for smaller and larger flood events taking place during this period. To quantify land cover, nine Landsat 5 TM images taken during the dry season (January or February) were obtained and processed to examine inter-annual land cover changes. From the networks of daily read rainfall data and stream gaugings available across the basin, 68 rainfall and 11 runoff stations were selected to evaluate peak flow rate and runoff coefficient for flood events. For individual sub-catchments, strong non-linear correlations were found between the overall runoff coefficient and peak flow rates for flood events. These runoff coefficients to peak flow relationships varied from year to year with different land cover for each sub-catchment. From these relationships within a particular sub-catchment, we determined relationships between different types of land cover and runoff coefficient for the 2, 5, 10 and 15year Annual Recurrence Interval (ARI) peak flood events. We found that runoff coefficient increased with increasing forest proportion for these specified peak flood conditions, on nine out of eleven sub-catchments. On the other hand, the runoff coefficient associated with these peak flood events decreased as agricultural and disturbed forest areas increased. The influence of land cover on runoff coefficient was, however, found to be very different between smaller (lower than ∼2year ARI) and larger flood events (larger than ∼2year ARI). Runoff coefficient is higher for high forest cover during larger flood events; but for smaller flood events, runoff coefficient is lower when forest cover is high. This is due to the fact that for smaller flood events, rainfall loss rate for the forest area is normally higher than that of the non-forest area according to higher evapotranspiration and soil moisture capacity. Forests have proved to potentially offer flood mitigation benefits for smaller flood events. However, for larger flood events the situation of the basin can be different, especially on a basin with higher antecedent soil moisture or even under saturation stage. Antecedent soil moisture from the previous storms could be better retained within the forest area than the non-forest area due to deeper rote zone and higher soil moisture holding capacity of the forest area compared to non-forest area. For the larger flood events, forest area tends to produce more runoff than non-forest area as found in this study. These findings gave us a more thorough understanding of the effect of land cover types on flood behaviour at different stages of soil moisture conditions, and the severity of storm events. It can be useful for land use and flood management of the river basin.";"Sriwongsitanon, Nutchanart

The three cases chosen provide a range of intellectual property protection (IPP) environments, crops, and companies, namely, (1) wheat in the United States and the European Union, (2) rootworm-resistant corn, and (3) hybrid tomatoes. The analysis suggests that IPP for US wheat is weak because growers are allowed to save seed and because breeders are responsible for the costs—both transactional and reputational—associated with enforcing those IPP rights that do exist. IPP in processed tomatoes is higher than in wheat because all processing tomatoes are now hybrids. However, the possibility that protected tomato varieties could be asexually reproduced weakens IPP and the incentive for the private sector to fund the basic research that might lead to high-value varieties. IPP in the US corn market is strong, and as a result, the private sector dominates in all aspects of the research process.";"Hayes, Dermot J.

Therefore, erosion must be correctly estimated and effective precautions must be taken for a sustainable agricultural activity. Hence, many models and methods have been developed for estimation of soil erodibility or calculating of quantity of the soil loss. In the present paper, using of fuzzy logic based models were examined in soil erosion prediction studies. For this goal, binary logic was described and then the transition from the classical logic to fuzzy logic has been studied. In the last section of the paper, a conducted research project is presented as an example of this matter. According to results of the said study and similar studies, fuzzy logic based models are more successful than classical logic based models in estimation of soil erosion; and they require fewer variables in application.

Due to the lack of temporal features as inputs in producing FROM-GLC, considerable confusion exists among land-cover types (e.g. agriculture lands, grasslands, shrublands, and bareland). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) provides high-temporal frequency information on surface cover. Other auxiliary bioclimatic, digital elevation model (DEM), and world maps on soil-water conditions are possible sources for improving the accuracy of FROM-GLC. In this article, a segmentation-based approach was applied to Landsat imagery to down-scale coarser-resolution MODIS data (250 m) and other 1 km resolution auxiliary data to the segment scale based on TM data. Two classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and two different strategies for use of training samples (global and regional samples based on a spatial temporal selection criterion) were performed. Results show that RF based on the global use of training samples achieves an overall classification accuracy of 67.08% when assessed by test samples collected independently. This is better than the 64.89% achieved by FROM-GLC based on the same set of test samples. Accuracies for vegetation cover types are most substantially improved.";"Yu, Le

This could be reduced by introducing vegetation and open water surfaces in urban design. This study evaluates the cooling efficiency of green and blue infrastructure to reduce urban heat load using a set of idealized case simulations and a real city model application for Vienna. The idealized case simulations show that the cooling effect of green and blue infrastructure is dependent on the building type, time of the day and in case of blue infrastructure, the water temperature. The temperature reduction and the size of the cooled surface are largest in densely built-up environments. The real case simulations for Vienna, which include the terrain, inhomogeneous land use distribution and observed climate data, show that urban planning measures should be applied extensively in order to gain substantial cooling on the city scale. The best efficiency can be reached by targeted implementation of minor but combined measures such as a decrease in building density of 10 %, a decrease in pavement by 20 % and an enlargement in green or water spaces by 20 %. Additionally, the modelling results show that equal heat load mitigation measures may have different efficiency dependent on location in the city due to the prevailing meteorological conditions and land use characteristics in the neighbouring environment.";"Žuvela-Aloise, M.

The modelling approach results in reducing the semantic complexity of landscape transformations, while this model can be understood by both humans and machines. The output consists in linguistic descriptions of the landscape or landscape properties, along with quantitative descriptions.

To date, no watershed-scale studies have properly addressed this issue. This paper fills this gap by using a scenario-modeling framework applied in the Reda watershed, a small (482� km²) agricultural coastal area in northern Poland. We used the SWAT model to quantify the effects of future climate, land cover, and management changes under multiple scenarios up to the 2050s. The combined effect of climate and land use change on N-NO₃ and P-PO₄ loads is an increase by 20–60 and 24–31� %, respectively, depending on the intensity of future agricultural usage. Using a scenario that assumes a major shift toward a more intensive agriculture following the Danish model would bring significantly higher crop yields but cause a great deterioration of water quality. Using vegetative cover in winter and spring (VC) would be a very efficient way to reduce future P-PO₄ loads so that they are lower than levels observed at present. However, even the best combination of measures (VC, buffer zones, reduced fertilization, and constructed wetlands) would not help to remediate heavily increased N-NO₃ loads due to climate change and agricultural intensification.";"Piniewski, Mikołaj

"AGRIS:US2012200235";"The Relationship between Farm Size and Productivity in Chinese Agriculture";"";"This paper examines the relationship between farm size and productivity in China's agriculture. In developing agriculture where there is a broad range of farm sizes, farm size and productivity or output per unit of land are often found to be inversely related. In China, where average farm size is small and the distribution of farm sizes is relatively compact, farm size and productivity are weakly inversely related. However, when we utilize the egalitarian principle during land allocation in China and use imputed homogenous land area rather than actual land area in the regression, the inverse relationship between farm size and productivity disappears. Hence, the strong inverse relationship that some studies have found are undoubtly due to a number of methodological problems, including the failure to account properly for land quality differences and the method of land distribution. Applying the principal agency theory, we also discuss the possibility that market inefficiency may contribute to the inverse relationship. We examine the necessity and validity (Hahn & Hausman 2002) of the instrumental estimation applied in the paper. The corresponding variance estimates are adjusted as Murphy & Topel (1985) suggested.";"Chen, Zhuo

"AGRIS:US201500007284";"Effect of land management on soil microbial N supply to crop N uptake in a dry tropical cropland in Tanzania";"";"In Sub-Saharan Africa, conservation of available soil N during early crop growth, when N loss by leaching generally occurs, is important to improve crop productivity. In a dry tropical cropland in Tanzania, we assessed the potential role of soil microbes as a temporal N sink–source to conserve the available soil N until later crop growth, which generally requires substantial crop N uptake. We evaluated the effect of land management [i.e., no input, plant residue application before planting (P plot) with or without fertilizer application, fertilizer application alone, and non-cultivated plots] on the relationship between soil N pool [microbial biomass N (MBN) and inorganic N] and crop N uptake throughout the ∼120-d crop growth period in two consecutive years. In the P plot, MBN clearly increased (∼14.6–29.6kgNha⁻¹) early in the crop growth period in both years because of immobilization of potentially leachable N, and it conserved a larger soil N pool (∼10.5–21.2kgNha⁻¹) than in the control plot. Especially in one year in which N leaching was critical, increased MBN maintained a larger soil N pool in the P plot throughout the experimental period, and a delay of increased MB C:N ratio and a substantial decrease in MBN was observed, indicating better soil microbial N supply for crop N uptake during later crop growth. Therefore, plant residue application before planting should enhance the role of soil microbes as a temporal N sink–source, leading to the conservation of potentially leachable N until later phase of crop growth, especially in years in which N leaching is relatively severe. Although further studies are necessary, our results suggest that plant residue application before planting is a promising option to achieve better N synchronization.";"Sugihara, Soh

The Aksum area (Tigray, northern Ethiopia) presents favourable conditions for the development of a long-term approach for assessing soil conservation techniques that have been applied for centuries (i.e., since the Aksumite kingdom, 400 BC to 800 AD). These techniques have been maintained until the present day, and parts of the terraced systems of the area are still in use. During the 1970s, social and political events led to a remarkable change in land use patterns, and large arable areas were converted into grazing land, resulting in a significant increase in soil loss. The rates of soil erosion were evaluated based on analyses of the deep scratches (plough marks) left on stones in the soil by the maresha, the ard plough pulled by oxen used in agricultural practices of the area, and the patinas, varnishes and weathering rinds exposed by soil loss after the abandonment of the fields. The study results show average rates of soil erosion of 2.8tha⁻¹y⁻¹ and 65.8tha⁻¹y⁻¹ for the soil conservation conditions under traditional agriculture (long-term observations) and accelerated erosion after abandonment (short-term observations), respectively. A comparison using recently calibrated erosion evaluation techniques conducted to support the field measurements revealed a close correlation between the calculated and recorded data.";"Ciampalini, Rossano

"AGRIS:US2016205096";"Carbon Credit Payment Options for Agroforestry Projects in Africa";"";"The potential of using carbon offset credits from agroforestry projects for farmers in developing areas has become more prevalent in both Clean Development Mechanism and voluntary carbon markets. Since the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, many international development organizations have been interested in using the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to help both mitigate CO2 emissions through agroforestry projects offsets and as a poverty reduction tool. Few organizations that have begun talking with farmers about planting trees for carbon offset credits have been able to tell the farmers how much money they would receive from their new tree growth or the costs they will incur in doing so. For this study, a whole farm budget toolkit was designed to help fill this gap and to help evaluate payment methods for carbon offset credits in agroforestry projects. This toolkit is intended to be used by development assistance organizations and farmers starting carbon credit programs.

Farmers will adopt cover crops if the net economic benefit of utilizing them is positive. This study examines farmers’ willingness to grow cover crops as a soil conservation practice and to examine the socio-economic factors affecting their decision. Survey data collected in 2007-8 from Alabama farmers about cover crop adoption and management is utilized to estimate a cover crop adoption model.";"Bergtold, Jason S.

We show that in 9 of 15 two-digit NAICS industries investigated, there is evidence of urban bias consistent with a comparative advantage to starting a business in urban markets. The urban advantage is due primarily to faster firm entry rates. Urban and rural firms have similar firm exit rates, consistent with a presumption that there are equal expected profit rates conditional on entry across markets. Urban areas grow faster because they induce faster firm entry and not because urban firms are more likely to succeed.";"Yu, Li

The USSR collapse in 1991 has led to widespread changes in land cover and land use due to economic and political transformations within the region. Management practices during and after the Soviet era have intensified ecological problems and demands on resources. Satellite derived vegetation greenness data offer insights into these dynamics by providing measurements linked to vegetation productivity and the timing of vegetation growth cycles, including the timing of greenness onset, peak, and senescence. The main research goals are to examine the impact of socio-economic and bioclimatic factors by characterizing interannual dynamics of regional land surface phenology. One of the longest available records (1981–2006) of geospatial time-series data of the biweekly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to derive annual pheno-metrics for sites in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Land cover types include irrigated agriculture, riparian zones, and arid desert regions. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between pre- and post-Soviet collapse seasonal NDVI trajectories and interannual variation in greenness onset and vegetation response. Changes in satellite-based land surface phenological information are attributed to differences in prevailing land management, climate, and socio-economic factors before and after the USSR collapse.";"Kariyeva, Jahan

While some human-dominated landscapes on continents support relatively high native biodiversity, this capacity is little studied in oceanic island systems characterized by high endemism and vulnerability to invasion. Using Hawaii as a case study, we assessed the conservation value of working landscapes on an oceanic island by surveying native and non-native plant diversity in mature native forest and in the three dominant land covers/uses to which it has been converted: native, Acacia koa timber plantations, wooded pasture, and open pasture. As expected, native plant diversity (richness and abundance) was significantly higher and non-native abundance significantly lower in mature native forests than any other site type. A. koa plantations and wooded pasture supported four and three times greater, respectively, species richness of native understory plants than open pasture. Also, A. koa plantations and wooded pasture supported similar species communities with about 75% species in common. Conservation and restoration of mature native forest in Hawaii is essential for the protection of native, rare species and limiting the spread of non-native species. A. koa plantations and wooded pasture, however, may help harmonize production and conservation by supporting livelihoods, more biodiversity than open pasture, and some connectivity between native forest remnants important for sustaining landscape-level conservation value into the future.";"Goldman, Rebecca L.

"AGRIS:US201500217918";"Wasted waste—Disappearing reuse at the peri-urban interface";"";"Safe and sustainable management of waste presents a major challenge in cities in the Global South. For decades farmers in the peri-urban interface (PUI) have used biodegradable components of urban waste as inputs into their farming practices. Evidence from Kano, Nigeria; Kumasi, Ghana; Hubli-Dharwad and Kolkata, India reveals in rare detail how urban waste reuse plays an important role in the livelihood strategies of lower-income families nd while waste farming also contributes significantly to urban food security. Health implications affecting farmers, farm-workers and community members often overshadow these benefits as highlighted through the case studies. Additionally, increasing competition over land and resources in the PUI paired with other factors triggered by processes of rapid development and urbanisation have rendered it more difficult for the peri-urban poor to access and use urban waste. The article further explores additional challenges of an institutional nature linked to the informality of reuse practices and prevalent sector approaches that are exacerbated by the institutional fragmentation present in the PUI. It is argued that an integrated city-wide policy that reduces the threats to peri-urban reuse practices while enhancing urban food security and integrated waste management is crucial. However, any effort to sustain these practices needs to incorporate adequate health and safety procedures. Thus, peri-urban farmers, farm workers and labourers constitute important stakeholders in urban planning and decision-making processes. Up to date primary data on the cases studied and further research on specific aspects of urban waste reuse are identified that could facilitate the development of viable solutions for integrated resource flow management.";"Hofmann, Pascale";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"urbanization;urban planning;food security;farming systems;farmers";"Urban Tenure;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IND;GHA;NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217918";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2013.03.011";"";"";"";"13-22"

These introductions have occurred across the continent and in some ecosystems have resulted in considerable modifications to ecosystem processes and functions associated with above- and belowground foodwebs. However, many areas of North America have either never been colonized by introduced earthworms, or have soils that are still inhabited exclusively by native earthworm fauna. Although several modes of transport and subsequent proliferation of non-native earthworms have been identified, little effort has been made to interrupt the flow of new species into new areas. Examples of major avenues for introduction of earthworms are the fish-bait, horticulture, and vermicomposting industries. In this paper we examine land management practices that influence the establishment of introduced species in several ecosystem types, and identify situations where land management may be useful in limiting the spread of introduced earthworm species. Finally, we discuss methods to regulate the importation of earthworms and earthworm-containing media so that introduction of new exotic species can be minimized or avoided. Although our focus in this paper is necessarily North American, many of the management and policy options presented here could be applicable to the problem of earthworm invasions in other parts of the world.";"Callaham, Mac A.

Most of agricultural land in Slovakia is, even after 6 years from the entry of Slovakia into the EU, leased. According to the Structural census of farms (2001), the lease of agricultural land represents 96%, in 2010 it was 91% (EUROSTAT, 2010). The research results obtained by Research Institute of Agriculture and Food Economics (RIAFE) indicate that from the total area of agricultural land used by the reference set of 6 regions for the period of 2001 - 2009 only 3.06% were owned by either individuals or legal persons who managed the agricultural land, and up to 96.94% consisted of the leased land. Similar results have been confirmed by the research obtained by Department of Law of SUA. As much as 75% of agricultural land is owned by private individuals, 5% is state-owned and 20% is still unidentified. It means that 25% of agricultural land which is managed by Slovak Land Fund remains under state control. This fact affects the market of agricultural land as well as the amount of the rent paid. There are still problems such as: high percentage of agricultural land under state management, fragmentation of agricultural land, unfinished landscaping, problems with determination of prices of agricultural land, different regional policies for tax collecting regarding agricultural land, limited possibility of acquiring agricultural land by foreigners. It is undisputed that the property rights to agricultural land and changes in its ownership and lease have an impact on rural development.";"Bandlerová, A., Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra (Slovak Republic).

The objective of this study is to apply the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to model pathogen transport, simulate management practices affecting water quality and predict pathogen loads in Irish catchments. Based on input data regarding agricultural practice, demographics and hydrological parameters for the river Fergus catchment, SWAT was run to predict concentrations of Escherichia coli. Hydrometric validation results display a very good linear relationship between observed and predicted data (Coefficient of determination R ² =0.83, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E =0.78) and indicate satisfactory simulation of hydrologic processes within the catchment. To date, pathogen predictions have proved variable between observed and simulated figures. Based on recommended values for the quantification of catchment modelling accuracy, predictions for E. coli can be described as acceptable and satisfactory with R ² =0.68 and E =0.59. Extensive monitoring is required for such simulations and the current study represents partial validation. Results suggest that although the capabilities exist to simulate pathogen transport in catchments, the capacity to accurately account for all factors that can contribute to water degradation is uncertain. The sensitivity analysis identified the bacteria partition coefficient (BACTKDDB) as the most important input parameter. In addition it reveals areas where further research is required, particularly in assessing the initial concentration of E. coli in human/animal waste. The developed model provides a tool capable of protecting water sources and human health from waterborne pathogens.";"Coffey, R.

The effectiveness of a hypothetical land value tax on moderating urban sprawl is determined by changes in demand for neighborhood open space, and its relationships with lot size and proximity to the central business district (CBD). Achieving this goal will (1) provide applied researchers with an empirical foundation from which the spatial dynamics of urban sprawl in local housing markets can be measured, and (2) provide policy makers, especially in the large and mid-sized metro areas of the Southeast, with an ex ante instrument through which alternative incentives targeting open space preservation can be evaluated. We estimate the effects of a hypothetical land value tax on urban sprawl gauged through the three metrics of demand for neighborhood open space, lot size, and proximity to the CBD by comparing the forecasted values of the demand for these goods under alternative land value taxation schemes. The first is a “regular property tax” when the tax rates on the assessed values of land and structures are identical. The second is a hypothetical “land value tax” that places more weight on the value of land than on the value of structures, holding annual total county tax revenue constant.";"Cho, Seong-Hoon

"AGRIS:US201500015843";"Clarity versus complexity: Land-use modeling as a practical tool for decision-makers";"";"The last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of modeling tools available to examine future land-use and land-cover (LULC) change. Integrated modeling frameworks, agent-based models, cellular automata approaches, and other modeling techniques have substantially improved the representation of complex LULC systems, with each method using a different strategy to address complexity. However, despite the development of new and better modeling tools, the use of these tools is limited for actual planning, decision-making, or policy-making purposes. LULC modelers have become very adept at creating tools for modeling LULC change, but complicated models and lack of transparency limit their utility for decision-makers. The complicated nature of many LULC models also makes it impractical or even impossible to perform a rigorous analysis of modeling uncertainty. This paper provides a review of land-cover modeling approaches and the issues causes by the complicated nature of models, and provides suggestions to facilitate the increased use of LULC models by decision-makers and other stakeholders. The utility of LULC models themselves can be improved by 1) providing model code and documentation, 2) through the use of scenario frameworks to frame overall uncertainties, 3) improving methods for generalizing key LULC processes most important to stakeholders, and 4) adopting more rigorous standards for validating models and quantifying uncertainty. Communication with decision-makers and other stakeholders can be improved by increasing stakeholder participation in all stages of the modeling process, increasing the transparency of model structure and uncertainties, and developing user-friendly decision-support systems to bridge the link between LULC science and policy. By considering these options, LULC science will be better positioned to support decision-makers and increase real-world application of LULC modeling results.";"Sohl, Terry L.

Following their decline until the 1960s, these land management practices have become valued at national and international policy-making levels for their biodiversity, aesthetic qualities and potential for tourism and recreation, but comparatively little attention has been given to consequences for soil conservation. In this paper, the soil erosion risks associated with these land uses are compared with those of selected alternative forestry and agroforestry land uses. Selected soil properties, results of rainfall simulation experiments and field observations of erosion features for (a) two montado and three dehesa sites differing in terms of grazing pressure and tree type, (b) six alternative forestry plantations of various ages and (c) an olive grove are ranked according to relative erosion risk. None of the dehesa or montado sites has an overall mean rank indicating an erosion risk as low as that in established forestry plantations (at least four–five years old). One (heavily grazed) dehesa has a relatively high overall mean rank indicating a relative erosion risk only slightly lower than that obtained for an erosion-prone, newly ploughed and planted eucalyptus plantation. It is concluded that present day dehesa and montado variants can be prone to severe erosion if stocking rates and/or tillage frequency become excessive.

"AGRIS:US201400063584";"environmental narrative of Inland Northwest United States forests, 1800–2000";"";"Fire was arguably the most important forest and rangeland disturbance process in the Inland Northwest United States for millennia. Prior to the Lewis and Clark expedition, fire regimes ranged from high severity with return intervals of one to five centuries, to low severity with fire-free periods lasting three decades or less. Indoamerican burning contributed to the fire ecology of grasslands and lower and mid-montane dry forests, especially where ponderosa pine was the dominant overstory species, but the extent of this contribution is difficult to quantify. Two centuries of settlement, exploitation, management, and climate variation have transformed the fire regimes, vegetation and fuel patterns, and overall functionality of these forests. We present a narrative that portrays conditions beginning at the first contact of Euro-American settlers with Indoamericans of the region and extending to the present. Due in part to its geographic isolation, the Inland Northwest was among the last regions to be discovered by Euro-Americans. In 200 years the region has undergone fur trapping and trading, sheep, cattle, and horse grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, native grassland conversion to agricultural production, urban and rural area development, fire prevention, and fire suppression. We highlight key changes to forest landscape patterns and processes that occurred under these combined influences, discuss implications of the changes, and progress towards restoring sustainability. An adaptive ecosystem management model has been adopted by public land management agencies to remedy current conditions. Ecosystem management is a relatively new concept that emphasizes the integrity and sustainability of land systems rather than outputs from the land. Adaptive management emphasizes the twin notions that incomplete knowledge and high degrees of risk and uncertainty about earth and climate systems will always limit land and resource planning and management decisions, and that management is chiefly a learning and adapting process. We discuss current issues and future options associated with ecosystem management, including the low likelihood of social consensus concerning desired outcomes, the lack of integrated planning, analysis, and decision support tools, and mismatches between existing land management planning processes, Congressional appropriations, and complex management and restoration problems.";"Hessburg, Paul F.

The environmental benefits of tree retention in arid regions of the State are now better appreciated and market opportunities have arisen for the unique timbers of western Queensland. A financial model is developed to facilitate a comparison of the private profitability of small-scale timber production from remnant Acacia woodlands against clearing for pasture development in the Mulga Lands and Desert Uplands bioregions of western Queensland. Four small-scale timber production scenarios, which differ in target markets and the extent of processing (value-adding), are explored within the model. Each scenario is examined for the cases where property rights to the timber are vested with the timber processor, and where royalties are payable. For both cases of resource ownership, at least one scenario generates positive returns from timber production, and exceeds the net farm income per hectare for an average grazing property in the study regions over the period 1989–1990 to 2000–2001. The net present value per hectare of selectively harvesting and processing high-value clearwood from remnant western Queensland woodlands is found to be greater than clearing for grazing.";"Venn, Tyron J.

Applying an object-oriented approach to compare the year 2004 with 1990, one observes that land-cover/use changes are not distributed evenly in the province. A substantial decrease in areas with trees belonging to the 'miombo ecosystem' occurred and an increase of cultivated areas. The nature of agriculture is changing from shifting cultivation to more permanent types. These changes are found in prevalence on gentle slopes and close to the road network. The shift in equilibrium between the cultivated and (semi-) natural vegetated areas to cultivated areas may reduce the availability of forest products and reduce the free ecological services provided by trees. Prolonged cultivation in the same area represents a critical limit for destruction of rootstock and therefore miombo regrowth potential. Community-based management of the natural resources should thus be careful not to disturb the delicate balance of remaining miombo and give emphasis to the regulation of land-use activities, otherwise the negative impacts of land-cover/use change dynamics may fall disproportionately on the poorest members of society.";"Jansen, L.J.M.

This article reviews the numerous sources for REDD+ finance within the context of total global conservation finance. In 2013, there were approximately 47 REDD+ projects conserving nearly 20 million ha with a total transacted value in carbon offset credits estimated to be US$98.8 million. Scaling up conservation financing instruments, particularly REDD+, is critical to halting tropical deforestation and reversing the trend of global climate change. Although the bulk of REDD+ financing, especially for capacity building efforts, comes from public sector channels, this article discusses five opportunities for private sector firms to support REDD+: a firm can develop their own project; a firm can donate unrestricted funds to a nonprofit organization; a firm can invest in a for-profit firm; a firm can choose to support a particular REDD+ project; or a firm can invest into a dedicated fund.";"McFarland, Brian Joseph";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"deforestation;climate change;landowners";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600100659";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2015.1017109";"";"";"";"534-546"
"AGRIS:FR2016226024";"Une approche multi-échelles des arbitrages entre production fourragère et biodiversité dans un agroécosystème prairial";"";"Agri-environmental measures have not been able to halt the decline of biodiversity in agricultural systems. Agricultural practices aimed at preserving diversity on a field scale appear to be deficient. This study models the interactions between grazing/mowing practices and the ecological dynamics of two grassland bird species (Northern Lapwing and Common Redshank) at three nested spatial scales (field, farm and landscape). On a field scale, grazing periods and intensity determine the balance between production and conservation. Optimal ecological performance is achieved at intermediate production levels. On a farm scale, the extent of different agricultural practices determines this balance. Nevertheless, bird conservation always carries a cost in terms of production. On a landscape scale, the spatial layout of land use is also taken into account in determining this balance.

Après une vingtaine d'années de mise en œuvre, les mesures agri-environnementales n'ont pas permis d'enrayer le déclin de la biodiversité dans les paysages agricoles. Des études récentes défendent l'idée que des mesures efficaces demanderaient non seulement de développer des pratiques favorables à la biodiversité à l'échelle de la parcelle mais aussi de favoriser des usages et des agencements spatiaux de ces usages qui accroissent l'hétérogénéité des paysages. On dispose à ce jour de peu de quantifications sur la relation production agricole / biodiversité dans des paysages plus ou moins hétérogènes. L'objectif de cette étude est d'analyser à différentes échelles spatiales la relation entre production fourragère et conservation d'oiseaux dans un agroécosystème prairial exploité par des élevages bovins viande. La démarche de recherche s'appuie sur le développement de plusieurs modèles basés sur la théorie de la viabilité. Ces modèles formalisent à trois échelles spatiales emboitées (parcelle, exploitation, paysage) les interactions entre les pratiques de pâturage et de fauche et les dynamiques écologiques de deux espèces d'oiseaux prairiaux (vanneau huppé et chevalier gambette) et apportent quatre résultats principaux. A l'échelle de la parcelle : 1) les périodes et les intensités de pâturage sont des déterminants majeurs de l'arbitrage entre production et conservation ; 2) les meilleures performances écologiques sont atteintes aux niveaux intermédiaires de performances productives. 3) A l'échelle de l'exploitation agricole, la proportion des différents usages agricoles est un levier majeur de l'arbitrage entre production et conservation mais la conservation des oiseaux a toujours un coût en termes de production. 4) A l'échelle du paysage, l'agencement spatial des usages module l'arbitrage entre production et conservation. L'ensemble de ces résultats révèle des leviers d'arbitrage spécifiques aux différentes échelles. A chacune de ces échelles, l'interaction entre différents modes d'exploitation est à la base des mécanismes d'arbitrage entre production et conservation. L'importance de l'agencement spatial des modes d'exploitation suggère que la conciliation entre production et conservation pourrait fortement bénéficier de coordinations accrues entre exploitations agricoles.";"Leger, Francois

"AGRIS:US201301716370";"impact of farm management on species-specific leaf area index (LAI): Farm-scale data and predictive models";"";"Leaf area index (LAI; the single-sided leaf area per unit area of ground) is a measure of plant standing crop in terrestrial ecosystems and is a key parameter in meteorological, climate and hydrological models. While the LAI of individual species can be measured by destructive harvesting and LAI of whole landscapes can be estimated by remote sensing, estimates of species-specific LAI at the landscape-scale are lacking. Working on a 125ha farm in Somerset, UK during the summers of 2007 and 2008, we developed a method to identify sources of variation in total leaf area over time, between habitats and between species. We measured LAI for all vegetation types on the farm, namely: crops, unmanaged non-woody vegetation, hedgerows and trees. We used established methods to estimate LAI, mostly by gap fraction analysis with a LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer and we divided LAI into its constituent species based on the data from field surveys. We found that the total LAI of the farm was 4.1, although this varied substantially between habitats from 3.3 for cereal fields to 8.0 for woods. Each month we measured LAI and found that, depending on the month, 61-81% of the leaf area was comprised of crop species (including grass and clover in pastures and short-term leys), 7-10% was woody vegetation and the remainder was non-woody semi-natural vegetation. We developed predictive models of LAI, based on our measurements of LAI in each habitat, and found that, for non-woody vegetation, variation in LAI was a function of vegetation type and vegetation height, while for hedgerows LAI was a function of hedge height and width. From our data and our predictive models we predicted changes in LAI due to five likely farm management scenarios. Changes that would have a huge impact on the visual landscape (loss of woods, reduction in hedge size) were predicted to have a smaller effect on farm-scale LAI than changes that would be visually more subtle (changes in vegetation length of grass fields). This type of modelling could be combined with regional land use data to predict the effect of regional agricultural changes (changes in land use or the intensity of land management) on LAI, and hence on ecosystems, biogeochemical cycling, carbon sequestration and hydrology.";"Pocock, Michael J.O.

We considercash and share contracts as well as hybrid contracts, which are increasingly prominent inUS agriculture. The conceptual framework suggests that restrictions on sharing paymentsbetween contracting parties are ineffective and induce an offsetting contractualrearrangement. Empirical results from a multinomial logit model confirm thatgovernment support programs have large significant effects on contract choices and thatthese effects vary by types of subsidies.

Despite considerable concern at the rate of transformation and degradation of the biodiversity-rich Albany Thicket biome in South Africa, most knowledge is gleaned from private commercial lands and state conservation areas. In comparison, there is limited work in communal areas where land uses include biomass extraction, especially for firewood and construction timber. We used aerial photographs to analyze land use and cover change in the high- and low-use zones of an urban commonage and an adjacent protected area over almost six decades, which included a major political transition. Field sampling was undertaken to characterize the current state of the vegetation and soils of the commonage and protected area and to determine the supply and demand for firewood and construction timber. Between the 1950s and 1980s, there was a clear increase in woody vegetation cover, which was reversed after the political transition in the mid-1990s. However, current woody plant standing stocks and sustainable annual production rates are well above current firewood demand, suggesting other probable causes for the decline in woody plant cover. The fragmentation of woody plant cover is paralleled by increases in grassy areas and bare ground, an increase in soil compaction, and decreases in soil moisture, carbon, and nutrients.";"Stickler, M.

We applied antibiotic resistance most-probable-number profiling to the soil bacterial communities, and then described the gradient. Soil samples were collected on the gradient represented by dry evergreen forest (the original vegetation), dry deciduous forest (moderately disturbed) and bare ground (the most degraded) in February (dry season), March (shortly after temporal precipitation) and June (rainy season) 2001. In the period of this study, the degradation was consistently shown as soil conditions like sandy texture, high bulk density, lower pH, high exchangeable acidity, poor mineral and organic nutrients and dryness. Soil fertility index and soil evaluation factor, as the integrative measures of the intensity of land degradation, were described by scores on the first or the second principal component derived from the soil bacterial community profiles for each sampling time (R>0.457, p<0.043) and by scores on the third and fourth principal components for the overall data set (R>0.501, p<0.001), suggesting great dry to moist seasonal effects. Further, the changes had significant relationships with gradients of soil moisture content, acidity and/or soil nitrogen content. The data sets on the soil bacterial community profiles had more complicated data structures than the physicochemical data sets, suggesting effects of the physicochemical changes on the soil bacterial community. The differences between the bacterial and the physicochemical aspects suggest that it is advantageous to observe multiple aspects of soil quality when describing a soil-related gradient of interest.";"Doi, R.

"AGRIS:US201600191131";"Site-based and remote sensing methods for monitoring indicators of vegetation condition: An Australian review";"";"Native vegetation around the world is under threat from historical and ongoing clearance, overgrazing, invasive species, increasing soil and water salinity, altered fire regimes, poor land management and other factors, resulting in a degradation of natural ecosystem services. Consequently, maintaining and improving native vegetation condition is a target frequently adopted by natural resource managers and government agencies world-wide. Adequate monitoring of vegetation condition remains a prerequisite for environmental decision-making and for tracking progress towards management goals. Throughout we consider vegetation condition to include the compositional, structural and functional attributes of vegetation relative to undisturbed vegetation of the same type.Site-based methods have long been used to assess compositional, structural and functional attributes as indicators of vegetation condition, and these methods continue to be used widely today. With developing technologies, remote sensing methods are being employed increasingly for monitoring a range of remotely detectable properties of vegetation, and there is now a growing demand to explicitly integrate the two approaches for mapping and monitoring vegetation condition across a range of scales.Here we review the attributes of vegetation identified as important for monitoring vegetation condition, those indicators that are best measured using traditional site-based methods and those that are more readily detectable using remote sensing methods, including their application in operational programmes within Australia. Further to this we review recent literature on the integration of the two approaches for monitoring indicators of vegetation condition.We find that remote sensing methods have the advantage of offering broad scale automated and repeatable methods for monitoring indicators of vegetation condition, but when combined with detailed ecological site-based data, together can improve monitoring for answering ecological questions across a range of scales. Further work, however, is required to effectively integrate the two approaches for mapping and monitoring vegetation condition.";"Lawley, V.

"AGRIS:US201301619378";"Modifying land management in order to improve efficiency of rainwater use in the African highlands";"";"Water scarcity and drought in Africa are often in the news. The widespread tendency to relate farmers' notion of drought to changes in the occurrence of dry spells is misguided: several recent studies have yielded little evidence of an increase in the length and/or frequency of such spells. The farmers' concept of drought is contextual and an indirect result of land degradation. Plant production suffers because water is not available due to deteriorated physical properties of soil. Farmers' perception of drought refers to the Green Water Use Efficiency (GWUE), i.e. the fraction of rain that is used for plant transpiration. GWUE in Africa is remarkably low: in sub-Saharan Africa, only 15% of the terrestrial rainwater is used by plants for the production of food, fodder and fibre. Although a millet crop grown under traditional circumstances uses only 50mm in transpiration, the crop frequently suffers from agricultural drought due to excessive losses of rainwater. A range of land management practices is available to help improve GWUE. They can be classified according to their function. Hedgerow barriers and terraces can mitigate runoff; infiltration rates below hedgerows in Kenya were found to be three to eight times higher than where the crop was grown. Mulch that triggers soil fauna can improve water availability; mulching with straw from a local perennial grass in Burkina Faso doubled the water use efficiency from 1kgmm⁻¹ without fauna to 2kgmm⁻¹ with fauna. Water harvesting and water-nutrient synergy can improve water use; in case permeable barriers combined with the use of compost Sorghum yield in Burkina Faso was 2.3 times higher than in the control plots and the plots with the barriers only. Green water deserves more attention from policy makers, planners, land users, water engineers and managers.";"Stroosnijder, Leo";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"KEN;BFA;002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301619378";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2008.05.019";"";"";"";"247-256"
"AGRIS:US201500198458";"Spatial distribution of ultrafine particles in urban settings: A land use regression model";"";"BACKGROUND: The toxic effects of ultrafine particles (UFP) are a public health concern. However, epidemiological studies on the long term effects of UFP are limited due to lacking exposure models. Given the high spatial variation of UFP, the assignment of exposure levels in epidemiological studies requires a fine spatial scale. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a short-term measurement protocol used at a large number of locations to derive a land use regression (LUR) model of the spatial variation of UFP in Girona, Spain. METHODS: We measured UFP for 15min on the sidewalk of 644 participants’ homes in 12 towns of Girona province (Spain). The measurements were done during non-rush traffic hours 9:15–12:45 and 15:15–16:45 during 32 days between June 15 and July 31, 2009. In parallel, we counted the number of vehicles driving in both directions. Measurements were repeated on a different day for a subset of 25 sites in Girona city. Potential predictor variables such as building density, distance to bus lines and land cover were derived using geographic information systems. We adjusted for temporal variation using daily mean NOₓ concentrations at a central monitor. Land use regression models for the entire area (Core model) and for individual towns were derived using a supervised forward selection algorithm. RESULTS: The best predictors of UFP were traffic intensity, distance to nearest major crossroad, area of high density residential land and household density. The LUR Core model explained 36% of UFP total variation. Adding sampling date and hour of the day to the Core model increased the R² to 51% without changing the regression slopes. Local models included predictor variables similar to those in the Core model, but performed better with an R² of 50% in Girona city. Independent LUR models for the first and second measurements at the subset of sites with repetitions had R²’s of about 47%. When the mean of the two measurements was used R² improved to 72%. CONCLUSIONS: LUR models for UFP were developed, based on a highly cost-effective short-term monitoring campaign at a large number of sites, with fair performance. Complementing the approach with further strategies to address sources of temporal variation of UFP is likely to result in improved models as indicated by the good performance of the model based on the subset of sites with one repeated measurement. Our approach is promising for UFP and possibly for other PM components requiring active sampling.";"Rivera, Marcela

Within this particular geological context, the objectives were to first determine the natural levels of trace metals in the soils and secondly, to assess which sites were significantly contaminated. Because no universal contamination assessment method is currently available, four different methods were applied and compared in order to facilitate the best diagnosis of contamination. First, the TM geochemical background was determined by using basic descriptive statistics and linear regression models calculated with semi-conservative major elements as predictors. The natural concentrations of trace metals varied greatly due to the high soil heterogeneity encountered on the regional scale and were more-or-less accurately modelled according to the considered TM. Second, the basic descriptive statistics and the linear regression methods were then compared with the enrichment factor (EF) method and multivariate analysis (PCA), in order to evaluate whether the concentrations measured in soils were abnormally high or not. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed and their results used to identify the most probable contamination cases, the influence of the soils characteristics, as well as the agricultural land cover. The basic descriptive method was good as a first and easy approach to describe the TM ambient concentrations, but may misinterpret the natural anomalies as contaminations. Based on geochemical associations, the linear regression method provided more realistic results even if the relationships between major and trace metals were not significant for the most mobile TM. The EF method was useful to identify high point source contaminations, but it was not suitable when considering a large dataset of low TM concentrations. Finally, the PCA method was a good preliminary tool for the description of the global TM concentrations in a studied area, but it could only give indication on the highest contaminated points. By comparing the results of the different methods in the studied region, we estimated that 24% of the arable soils were contaminated by at least one trace metal, mainly Cu in vineyards/orchards and Cd, Pb and/or Zn in grazing lands. In addition, the calcareous soils exhibited globally higher natural and anthropogenic TM concentrations than non-calcareous soils, probably because of the lower TM mobility at alkaline pH.";"Redon, Paul-Olivier

"AGRIS:ES2008001608";"Arid and semiarid rangelands: production, diversity and global change";"""En el conjunto de las Sierras Béticas"": pastos, producción, diversidad y cambio global";"This paper comprises some general issues about the natural and agricultural context in arid and semiarid Mediterranean pastures. We include most of our studies concerning to shrublands characteristics: composition, production and diversity; which have been developed in the oriental sector of Andalusia for more than 20 years. This work is concluded with some personal considerations about the changes in the land uses, mainly due to rural abandonment, and its incidence in the global change. Pastoralism may provide alternatives to the land abandonment, which is the main feature of less-favoured pastoral agrosystems.

Se recogen en este trabajo un conjunto de consideraciones generales sobre el contexto natural y agrario en el que se desarrollan los estudios pascícolas del mediterráneo árido y semiárido. La ponencia hace un énfasis especial en el sector oriental de Andalucía, en el que se han llevado a cabo la mayor parte de los estudios sobre las especies forrajeras de su flora natural, las características y composición de sus pastos, la producción de los mismos y el rango de diversidad que muestran. Se completa esta exposición con algunas valoraciones personales sobre la incidencia de los cambios de usos de la tierra y el papel que la ciencia de los pastos, puede aportar a la búsqueda de alternativas, frente a los interrogantes del cambio global, entre los cuales el abandono rural es quizá el rasgo dominante en estos agrosistemas pastorales tan desfavorecidos.";"Robles, A.B., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Granada (España).

"AGRIS:US2016207491";"World Heritage Listing of Australian Natural Sites: Tourism Stimulus and its Economic Value";"";"Australia has 14 areas inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, on the basis of their globally outstanding natural and in some cases also cultural values. Many regard listing as prestigious and believe that it acts as a signalling device like a brand name. But to what extent and in what ways does the extra prestige bestowed by this listing translate into increased economic value for listed properties? This article deals with two main aspects of World Heritage listing. First, examines the hypothesis that World Heritage listing increases tourist visitation numbers, and available international visitor time-series data are examined to provide empirical evidence. It is found that although visitor numbers are likely to increase as a result of World Heritage listing, the increase is not as large as is often perceived. Some properties continue to experience low visitation rates despite World Heritage listing, and reasons for this phenomenon are advanced. Likely reasons for the inequalities in growth patterns of visits to different World Heritage properties are highlighted. Secondly, the article considers how the economic value of the tourism stimulus provided by World Heritage listing can be measured in principle and relates this to economic impact analysis and total economic valuation. Important and new limitations to the use of the travel cost method in this context are identified.";"Tisdell, Clement A.

"AGRIS:US201500183919";"Texas environmental flow standards and the hydrology-based environmental flow regime methodology";"";"In 2007, the Texas legislature created a program to identify environmental flow standards statewide through the coordinated efforts of scientific and stakeholder groups and rulemaking by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. To aid in this task, a Hydrology-based Environmental Flow Regime (HEFR) method was developed that combines a suite of user-customizable hydrologic statistics with an implementation framework. Following the concepts of the Natural Flow Paradigm, the methodology includes the separation of a long-term hydrograph into key flow components (e.g. subsistence, base, high-flow pulse and overbank) defined by the Texas Instream Flow Program. Seasonal, annual and inter-annual flow component statistics were then coupled with biology, water quality and geomorphology overlays, where available, and with implementation rules applied to example large-scale water supply projects to support development of environmental flow standards for use in water rights permit conditions. The HEFR methodology and resulting flow recommendations are compared to two contemporary in-stream flow studies and adopted environmental flow standards. Subsistence flows were fairly similar. Baseflows were in a similar range, but fewer than three seasonal levels have sometimes been specified in in-stream flow studies. Episodic events are quite different in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration and applicable number. Editor D. Koutsoyiannis; Guest editor M.

This study investigated changes in ecosystem services in response to land use changes caused primarily by human activities in Taiyuan City, the capital of Shanxi Province. Our aim was to provide guidance for sustainable urban development in fragile ecological environments undergoing rapid urbanization. We used remote sensing to evaluate land use changes, and applied a fast method for evaluating ecological service values at two points in time: 1990 and 2005. The ecosystem services value dropped from 743.53×10⁶yuan (1990) to 723.45×10⁶yuan (2005), mostly because farmland and grassland decreased. Over 95% of the total service value was attributable to woodland and farmland. Soil formation and protection, and water supply were the two largest service functions, contributing about 32% of the total service value. The results suggest that future land use planning should control the encroachment of urban areas on farmland, grassland, and woodland, and continue the policy of converting poor farmland to woodland and grassland.";"Liu, Yong

Too much emphasis is given to what we term grand design-ambitious and idealistic plans for conservation. Such plans im-plicitly oppose or restrict development and often attempt to block it by speculatively establishing paper parks. Insufficient recognition is given to the inevitable long term pressures for conversion to other land uses and to the weakness of local constituencies for conservation. Conservation institutions must build their capacity to engage with the process of change. They must constantly adapt to deal with a continuously unfolding set of challenges, opportunities and changing societal needs. This can be achieved by long term on-the-ground engagement and muddling through. The range of conservation options must be enlarged to give more attention to biodiversity in managed landscapes and to mosaics composed of areas with dif-fering intensities of use. The challenge is to build the human capacity and institutions to achieve this.";"Sayer Jeffrey

"AGRIS:US201500184231";"Effects of land use planning on aboveground vegetation biomass in China";"";"Dramatic land use change is expected to take place in China in the coming decades, which will exert great impact on the vegetation biomass. The paper assesses how land use change will influence the size and spatial distribution of the vegetation biomass in China. A spatially explicit land use change model, Dyna-CLUE, is employed together with a biomass density approach to account for the effects of forest age on biomass change. Two scenarios have been developed. The first is a trend scenario where land use trends during the period 1985–1995 are extrapolated, representing the situation before implementing the national ecological restoration program. The second is a planning scenario which takes into consideration a range of land use planning measures. Possible temporal and spatial distribution of land use and vegetation biomass across China was simulated. The results indicate that under the planning scenario, vegetation biomass would be 15.47 Gt in 2030, showing an increase by 0.11 Gt compared to that in 2005. Under the trend scenario, however, the biomass would be 14.62 Gt in 2030, 0.02 Gt higher than that in 2005 due to the forest devastation and forest age effect. Seeming to be relatively trivial, the differences between the scenarios are huge in absolute terms, illustrating the impact of land use planning on biomass variation. Compared with the trend scenario, the area of planted forests under the planning scenario will be larger and biomass density lower. Thus under the planning scenario, the vegetation biomass will be more likely to increase, acting as a carbon sink in the future.";"Sun, Xiaofang

"AGRIS:US201500155572";"Stakeholder dynamics in bioenergy feedstock production; The case of Jatropha curcas L. for biofuel in Chhattisgarh State, India";"";"Through careful management and policy formulation, modern bioenergy programmes could be important for rural development globally. Discussions over sustainable bioenergy use are focused on high level mechanisms (e.g. certification and legislation), led by developed world institutions. Full stakeholder participation, involving all relevant groups, is vital to successfully incorporating sustainability into planning. Getting equal engagement in multi stakeholder consultation (MSC) is challenging, but a structured approach to analysing stakeholder dynamics to improve this situation has been trialled; summed up as: (1) Context analysis; (2) Identification of feedstock production models; (3) Mapping according to land size and ownership, market end use and scale; (4) Typology of production models; (5) Social mapping. Learning from Social Impact Assessment and Sustainability Assessment methodologies has been used in developing this approach. Five models of Jatropha curcas L.-based seed production in the Indian State of Chhattisgarh were identified and stakeholders from relevant groups at all levels consulted. The significant distinctions separating feedstock production models were found to be: land ownership and value chain; and market end use and route. When analysing social impacts locally it was important to consider risks and responsibilities of different groups. Local- and context-specific assessments, such as those undertaken here, are essential in planning for sustainable bioenergy production; although not at the expense of higher level mechanisms. A priori, informed stakeholder interrogation and social mapping, building on detailed context analysis, are presented as practical approaches to increase the likelihood of successful MSC and sustainability analysis, making it a more viable policy making tool.";"Hazelton, Jennifer A.

"AGRIS:US201600020675";"Ranking suitable sites for irrigation with reclaimed water in the Nabeul-Hammamet region (Tunisia) using GIS and AHP-multicriteria decision analysis";"";"The present study describes an innovative methodology to rank suitable sites for irrigation with TWW using fuzzy-AHP based on GIS where the Nabeul-Hammamet aquifer catchment (Tunisia) is selected as the target area. The model is relatively simple and is extendable worldwide. Several influential parameters are identified considering simultaneously technical, social, economical and environmental aspects. They are grouped in five main criteria, namely land suitability for irrigation, resources conflicts, cost effectiveness, social acceptance and environmental impact. Each criterion is subdivided into several sub-criteria. A pair-wise matrix is used to compare these criteria and sub-criteria and to rank them according to their relative importance for site evaluation. Using GIS, geographical layers are obtained for the sub-criteria, leading to mapping and ranking the suitable sites for TWW irrigation. The results show that the total suitable area covers 11,426ha which represents 31% of the total Nabeul-Hammamet aquifer watershed. This constitutes quite a large zone that can absorb the entire volume of available treated wastewater, thereby increasing the region's agricultural production. The best sites to receive the surplus amount of TWW, produced by the treatment plants of the region, are located near these plants and inside agricultural lands. In addition, all these sites are located around the districts already irrigated by TWW, which underlines the role these districts may play in encouraging neighbouring farmers to change their attitude towards TWW and to accept it as an alternative resource for irrigation.";"Anane, Makram

However, it is more efficient and effective to combine remote-sensing measurements with a geographic information system (GIS) database and expert knowledge for change updating than to use remote-sensing technology alone. In this article, these different sources of information are integrated in the proposed framework, which is able to provide rapid updating of LU/LC information. An object-based data analysis is adopted for thematic mapping, taking both spectral and spatial properties into consideration. An expert knowledge coding is introduced and combined quantitatively with other evidence provided by remotely sensed data and the GIS database.

"AGRIS:US201400107079";"Object-oriented classification of land use/cover using digital aerial orthophotography";"";"In automatic/semiautomatic mapping of land use/cover using very high resolution remote-sensing imagery, the major challenge is that a single class of land use contains ground targets with varied spectral values, textures, geometries and spatial features. Here we present an object-oriented strategy for automatic/semiautomatic classifications of land use/cover using very high resolution remote-sensing data. The strategy consists of character detecting, object positioning and coarse classification, then refining the classification result step by step. The strategy combines the form classification of the objects located on the same level by using spectral values, textures and geometric features with function classification by using spatial logic relationships existing among the objects on the same level or between different levels. Furthermore, it overcomes the problem of transformation from form classification to function classification and unifies land use classification and land cover classification organically. Such an approach not only achieves high classification accuracy, but also avoids the salt-and-pepper effect found in conventional pixel-based procedures. The borderlines of the classification result are clear, the patches are pure, and the classification objects exactly match the ground targets distributed across the study site. A feasible technical strategy for the large-scale application is discussed in this article.";"Li, Chungan

"AGRIS:US201301801892";"Irrigation in the context of today's global food crisis";"";"During 2008 the world witnessed a global food crisis which caused social unrest in many countries and drove 75 million more people into poverty. The crisis resulted from sharply higher oil prices, increased bio-fuel production, dwindling grain stocks, market speculation, changing food consumption patterns in emerging economies, and changes in world trade agreements, among other factors. Although the rise in food prices was sudden, the fragility of global food security had been developing for years. During the 1960s and 1970s food production kept pace with demand as more cropland was irrigated and yields of irrigated crops increased dramatically. Irrigation played a critical role in combating hunger, poverty and death due to malnutrition. However, the environmental and social consequences of large irrigation schemes came into question, and investments in irrigation subsequently diminished. Today's food crisis is compounded by a rapidly growing world population, the conversion of food producing lands to bio-fuel production, diminishing available freshwater supplies, competition for water by other sectors, climate change impacts, and the reduction in arable lands due to urbanization. It is critical that investments focus on increasing agricultural production through improved management of land and water resources, and the involvement of all stakeholders.";"Madramootoo, Chandra A.

"AGRIS:US2016216322";"Continuity and change: Land and water use reforms in rural Uzbekistan. Socio-economic and legal analyses for the region Khorezm";"";"Decades of Soviet rule have left a heritage of environmental and social problemsin Central Asia. The demise of an entire ecosystem at unprecedented pace, the""Aral Sea Syndrome"", is the most prominent of the undesired outcomes of thefocus on agricultural production that has dominated land and resource use andcontinues till today. The international outcry over this ecological crisis has delegatedother – and maybe more urgent – problems to a second pane. Rural livelihoodsare rapidly deteriorating, unemployment is high, and rural poverty widespread.Ecological aspects, although strongly affecting everyday life in rural areas – such aswater and soil salinity and environmental pollution – are not the fore most concernto the local population, as the economic survival is the more pressing need.Nevertheless, it is exactly in this situation where the larger part of the populationexploits the natural resources further rather than preserving the ecological basisas a natural means of the local land’s productivity.Since their independence in 1991, the five countries of Central Asia have dealtwith these challenges in different ways. Uzbekistan has opted for slow, gradualreforms, keeping a strong government control over agricultural production. Its agriculturalsector is still characterized by a dominance of state ordered crops, mainlycotton and winter wheat which are sold to state agencies. State control and thelack of land ownership, true privatization (land is leased, not owned) and skills arewidely seen as the major causes for the rural poverty and rampant environmentaldegradation. According to common opinion, the slow pace of reforms and thestrong government control have aggravated environmental degradation and socialproblems. Careful analysis shows that the real picture is more complex and lessstraightforward than a quick look at the system would suggest, however.It is here that the Center's for Development Research (ZEF) project on ""Economicand Ecological Restructuring of Land- and Water Use in the Region Khorezm(Uzbekistan)"" sees its role. In this rural economy the use of natural resources,economic performance and the related social dimensions are closely linked. Theinnovative approach of the project is to tackle the issues at stake with a stronglyinterdisciplinary approach. Economists, social scientists and natural scientists areworking together to analyse the on-going changes in land and water use, allowinga deeper insight into the causal change between land use, poverty and environmentaldegradation. The results of some of the individual research projects –some of them surprising – are the subject of this book and will provide the basis for recommendations and solutions for decision-makers that address the ecologicaldeterioration as well as its economic and social consequences. The project aimsat providing a comprehensive, science-based plan for restructuring, at three nestedintervention levels: Markets, policies and institutions, and technologies. Modellingwill assist in developing scenarios of different levels of resource use and providedecision makers with information as to the future consequences of the decisionstaken today.These concepts are being developed in a long-term scientific research programwith the ultimate goal of improving rural livelihoods through judicious and sustainableland and water resource management. There is a specific regional focuson the Khorezm district of Uzbekistan, and the main partner is the State Universityof Urgench (capital of the Uzbek region Khorezm). The co-operation is based onstrong links built with local partners and international agencies for technical cooperation.Most prominent in this context are the collaborative agreements withUNESCO and with the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources Managementof the Republic of Uzbekistan. The cooperation with both partners is essential,not least because they will further ensure a strong embedding in national policymaking and capacity building efforts.Khorezm is a district of the Republic of Uzbekistan, located in the irrigated lowlandsof the Amu Darya River, which is the major tributary to the Aral Sea. It isin many ways an example of all of the irrigated lands along the rivers that cutthrough the Middle Asian deserts – mostly flatland, former desert areas that areirrigated for hundreds – if not sometimes even thousands of years – which havebeen subjected to huge changes in the last 40-50 years by means of immenseirrigation projects that represent a very strong path dependency for today’s effortsto manage the resources in the region.From the outset the main donor of the project, the Federal Ministry of Educationand Research (BMBF) of Germany, understood that such a project can be developedonly with a long-term perspective. The project was laid out for 10 to 12years, structured into four phases of which the first two have been completed sofar. Phase I saw the establishment of central databases and infrastructure, andPhase II field surveys and trials for understanding institutions and processes,that allowed the development of simulation and optimization models. Phase IIIwill be dedicated to testing an integrated concept for restructuring land use in atypical area of the region, on-farm, which will lead in Phase IV to the developmentof policy recommendations and a contribution to informed decision makingby Uzbek policy makers, by the water administration, and by farmers.The present volume represents preliminary results of the research undertakenmainly in the social and economic realm during project phase I and part ofphase II. It combines the contributions from a workshop held at Bonn Universityin April 2005. Its intention is manifold: First it provides basic information related to ongoing changes in land and water use and thereby enhances the knowledgebase for judging the effects of further change. Second, it describes those researchtools which have been adapted by colleagues to become suitable for this regionin transition and for the given historical background. One other goal was toenhance the analytical capacity on the basis of which solutions and/or recommendationsare to be developed. As the articles are the result of phase I and, tosome extent, of phase II of the project, they are ""work in progress"".This book should be seen in the context of two forthcoming volumes: One on thediverse aspects of tree intercropping systems in the Central Asian regions, andanother that will provide an integrative view of the research undertaken in thefirst years of this project.We would like to thank all partners, and particularly our colleagues from Uzbekistan,for having made this book possible. Without the close cooperation in thisinternational, multicultural research team, the achievement would not have beenpossible. Most prominently we would like to thank Prof. Dr. Alimboy Sadullaev,Dr. Ruzumboy Eshchanov and Prof. Dr. Bahtiyor Ruzmetov from the StateUniversity of Urgench who have always supported this project unfalteringly andwith great enthusiasm and continue to do so.Furthermore, we would like to thank those who have helped in editing the text.In that respect the special attention given to this volume by our colleagueJennifer Franz is greatly appreciated. Thanks also go to Guzal Matniyazova,Elena Kan, and Vefa Moustafaev for their support and the provision and correctionof Russian abstracts.

"AGRIS:US201600065124";"Security aspects of future renewable energy systems–A short overview";"";"Energy security is sometimes used to advocate renewable energy systems. Renewable energy systems can improve some aspects of security, but they will not automatically lead to the removal of all types of security problems and new problems will most certainly arise. This paper analyses energy security aspects of renewable energy systems on the basis of a broad typology on energy and security. Renewable energy sources do not suffer from the same long-term resource availability problems as finite fossil resources and their geographical location is less concentrated, but other issues such as dependence on variable flowing resources and competition for scarce land resources will grow in importance. Many security issues related to energy are also dependent on the energy carrier rather than the energy resource and on the existence of effectively functioning institutions and regulations. New interdependencies will appear and will have to be handled within future international and bilateral institutional frameworks.";"Johansson, Bengt";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600065124";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.09.023";"";"";"";"598-605"

However, knowledge of gas flux from irrigated agriculture is very limited. From April 2005 to October 2006, a study was conducted in the Aral Sea Basin, Uzbekistan, to quantify and compare emissions of N₂O and CH₄ in various annual and perennial land-use systems: irrigated cotton, winter wheat and rice crops, a poplar plantation and a natural Tugai (floodplain) forest. In the annual systems, average N₂O emissions ranged from 10 to 150 μg N₂O-N m⁻² h⁻¹ with highest N₂O emissions in the cotton fields, covering a similar range of previous studies from irrigated cropping systems. Emission factors (uncorrected for background emission), used to determine the fertilizer-induced N₂O emission as a percentage of N fertilizer applied, ranged from 0.2% to 2.6%. Seasonal variations in N₂O emissions were principally controlled by fertilization and irrigation management. Pulses of N₂O emissions occurred after concomitant N-fertilizer application and irrigation. The unfertilized poplar plantation showed high N₂O emissions over the entire study period (30 μg N₂O-N m⁻² h⁻¹), whereas only negligible fluxes of N₂O (<2 μg N₂O-N m⁻² h⁻¹) occurred in the Tugai. Significant CH₄ fluxes only were determined from the flooded rice field: Fluxes were low with mean flux rates of 32 mg CH₄ m⁻² day⁻¹ and a low seasonal total of 35.2 kg CH₄ ha⁻¹. The global warming potential (GWP) of the N₂O and CH₄ fluxes was highest under rice and cotton, with seasonal changes between 500 and 3000 kg CO₂ eq. ha⁻¹. The biennial cotton-wheat-rice crop rotation commonly practiced in the region would average a GWP of 2500 kg CO₂ eq. ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. The analyses point out opportunities for reducing the GWP of these irrigated agricultural systems by (i) optimization of fertilization and irrigation practices and (ii) conversion of annual cropping systems into perennial forest plantations, especially on less profitable, marginal lands.";"SCHEER, CLEMENS

There is considerable uncertainty, however, in the extent to which woody encroachment alters dryland soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools. To date, studies assessing SOC and TN response to woody plant proliferation have not explicitly assessed the variability caused by shrub age or size and subcanopy spatial gradients. These factors were quantified via spatially intensive soil sampling around Prosopis velutina shrubs in a semidesert grassland, using shrub size as a proxy for age. We found that bulk density increased with distance from the bole (P < 0.005) and decreased with increasing shrub size (P= 0.056), while both SOC and TN increased with shrub size and decreased with distance from the bole (P < 0.001 for both). Significant (and predictable) spatial variation in bulk density suggests that use of generic values would generate unreliable estimates of SOC and TN mass, and subcanopy SOC pools could be overestimated by nearly 30% if intercanopy bulk density values were applied to subcanopy sites. Predictive models based on field-documented spatial patterns were used to generate integrated estimates of under-shrub SOC and TN pools, and these were compared with results obtained by typical area-weighting protocols based on point samples obtained next to the bole or at a specified distance from the bole. Values obtained using traditional area-weighting approaches generally overestimated SOC pools relative to those obtained using the spatially integrated approach, the discrepancy increasing with increasing shrub size and proximity of the point sample to the bole. These discrepancies were observed at the individual plant scale and for landscapes populated by various shrub size classes. Results suggest that sampling aimed at quantifying shrub encroachment impacts on SOC and TN pools will require area-weighting algorithms that simultaneously account for shrub size (age) and subcanopy spatial patterns.";"THROOP, HEATHER L.

Ador-Simulation, a combined model that simulates irrigation, water delivery, and crop growth and production was applied in a surface irrigated area (1213ha) located in the Bear River Irrigation Project, Utah, U.S.A.. A soil survey, a campaign of on-farm irrigation evaluations and an analysis of the database from the Bear River Canal Company and other resources were performed in order to obtain the data required to simulate the water flows of the study area in 2008. Net land productivity (581US$ha⁻¹) was 20% lower than the potential value, whereas on-farm irrigation efficiency (IE) averaged only 60%. According to the water accounting, water use amounted to 14.24Mm³, 86% of which was consumed through evapotranspiration or otherwise non-recoverable. Gross water productivity over depleted water reached 0.132US$m⁻³. In addition, two strategies for increasing farm productivity were analyzed. These strategies intended to improve water management and infrastructures raised on-farm IE to 90% reducing the gap between current and potential productivities by about 50%. Water diverted to the project was reduced by 2.64Mm³. An analysis based on IE could lead to think that this volume would be saved. However, the water accounting showed that actually only 0.91Mm³ would be available for alternative uses. These results provide insights to support the decision-making processes of farmers, water user associations, river basin authorities and policy makers. Water accounting overcomes the limitations and hydrological misunderstandings of traditional analysis based on irrigation efficiency to assess irrigated areas in the context of water scarcity and competitive agricultural markets.";"Lecina, S.

"AGRIS:US2016202759";"The Political Economy of Downzoning";"";"Increasingly, in response to concerns about urban sprawl and environmental protection, local governments are exercising their police power to reduce the legal permitted density on undeveloped land.  This controversial practice, known in many parts of the country as ""downzoning"", is generally opposed by farmers, developers and others whose market opportunities are limited by such action.  This paper constructs a theoretical model of the impact of larger minimum lot sizes on the current land prices of farmers and homeowners within the same community.  The theoretical model suggests that net losses for farmers and net gains for homeowners from downzoning are a reasonable, if not inevitable, expectation.  Following Pelzman, Hahn, and Campos, the paper then develops a model to explain the public choice decision-making process that leads to downzoning by local public officials.  This model is tested using data on 214 New Jersey municipalities.  The probability of downzoning is found to increase when there is a lot of open space to protect, but only when farmers constitute a small proportion of all voters.  The probability of downzoning also increases when a community has experienced rapid population growth and increased land values.  It is more likely to be found in municipalities that have enacted right-to-farm ordinances, suggesting an overall preservation focus on the part of the community along with some sensitivity to farmers' concerns.";"Gottlieb, Paul D.

Based on the second national soil survey (1979-1992), total soil inorganic carbon (SIC) storage in China was estimated to be 53.3±6.3 PgC (1 Pg=10¹⁵ g) to the depth investigated to 2 m. Soil inorganic carbon storages were 4.6, 10.6, 11.1, and 20.8 Pg for the depth ranges of 0-0.1, 0.1-0.3, 0.3-0.5, and 0.5-1 m, respectively. Stocks for 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1 m of depth accounted for 8.7%, 28.7%, 49.6%, and 88.9% of total SIC, respectively. In contrast with soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, which is highest under 500-800 mm yr⁻¹ of mean precipitation, SIC storage peaks where mean precipitation is <400 mm yr⁻¹. The amount and vertical distribution of SIC was related to climate and land cover type. Content of SIC in each incremental horizon was positively related with mean annual temperature and negatively related with mean annual precipitation, with the magnitude of SIC content across land cover types showing the following order: desert, grassland >shrubland, cropland >marsh, forest, meadow. Densities of SIC increased generally with depth in all ecosystem types with the exception of deserts and marshes where it peaked in intermediate layers (0.1-0.3 m for first and 0.3-0.5 m for latter). Being an abundant component of soil carbon stocks in China, SIC dynamics and the process involved in its accumulation or loss from soils require a better understanding.";"MI, NA

"AGRIS:US201400110368";"Designing a conservation area network that supports the representation and persistence of freshwater biodiversity";"";"1. The progression of approaches in systematic conservation planning from representation to representation and persistence has greatly enhanced its potential applicability to freshwaters. However, conceptual frameworks that consolidate principles for incorporating persistence into freshwater conservation planning are still lacking. 2. We present four key principles to consider when planning for the persistence of freshwater biodiversity: selecting ecosystems of high ecological integrity; incorporating connectivity; incorporating areas important to population persistence; and identifying additional natural processes that can be mapped. 3. The practicalities of gathering data and conducting the conservation plan to address these principles are explored here using a case study in the Olifants/Doorn Water Management Area, South Africa. Spatial layers are developed for depicting ecological integrity, sub‐catchment boundaries, riparian zones and wetlands, high water‐yield areas and patterns of groundwater discharge and recharge. 4. These data are used to develop a conservation area network that supports both representation and persistence of freshwater biodiversity. Although the planning region is relatively data rich by global standards, several data deficiencies were identified. We suggest ways of using environmental surrogates to address data deficiencies, improving confidence in these surrogates by combining them wherever possible with existing field data and expert knowledge. 5. We also recommend methods to achieve spatial efficiency by simultaneously designing for representation and persistence of freshwater biodiversity. Spatial efficiency can be achieved in different ways when using a conservation planning algorithm and a multiple‐use zoning strategy. 6. The allocation of multiple‐use zones aligns closely with the objectives of integrated water resources management and land use planning. Given the practicalities at local levels of planning, we recommend using multiple‐use zones in the design phase, rather than merely at the end once the design is complete.";"NEL, JEANNE L.

"AGRIS:US2016203644";"Marketing Ecosystem Services from Agricultural Land: Stated Preferences over Payment Mechanisms and Actual Sales of Farm-Wildlife Contracts";"";"Agriculture conventionally supplies food, fiber and fuel that consumers can purchase through the market. With the right incentives, farmers can also provide ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat, climate regulation, surface water flows and waste absorption and breakdown. Such incentives have so far come almost entirely from government-sponsored programs that rely on financial assistance to farmers to encourage them to alter agricultural practices or input mix to enhance ecosystem services. Programs recently implemented in Costa Rica and Columbia rely on payments by the beneficiaries of the ecosystem services, such as municipal water companies and water users (Pagiola et al. 2002). Few of these programs, however, have attempted to establish a market for ecosystem services in which the beneficiaries of such services pay the suppliers their personal values of ecosystem services in an actual market.Markets for ecosystem services must overcome two major challenges. In order to set prices for ecosystem services at the right level, it is imperative to understand consumers preferences. Farmland, however, has multiple attributes such as wildlife habitat services and landscape view; the marginal rate of substitution among those attributes must be understood to design marketable products for ecosystem services. Moreover, many ecosystem services are public goods for which traditional markets are ill-suited, because many individuals can receive benefits simultaneously regardless of whether they have paid part of the cost of provision. Therefore, consumers have an incentive to free-ride on others. Evidence from previous research on public goods clearly suggests that under-contribution is typical (e.g., Ledyard 1995). The overall goal of this study is to explore the potential to establish an actual market in which the public can purchase ecosystem services generated by agricultural land. More specifically, this paper evaluates the performance of alternative elicitation methods that are intended to reduce individuals incentives to free-ride on others payments for ecosystem services. Using a choice experiment involving a large-scale mail survey, we first estimate the marginal rate of substitution consumers place on various attributes of farmland including the ecosystem services such land can provide. We further compare the results across different payment mechanisms and examine which ones are capable of revealing demand that is closer to consumers true value. Second, we attempt to establish an actual market in which individuals are asked to purchase a share of a farm contract to provide ecosystem service with real money under different payment mechanisms. We compare the market outcomes with the choice experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the performance of different payment mechanisms for provision of ecosystem services using field experiments both within a hypothetical setting and by developing an actual market.The ecosystem service in question in this study is habitat for a grassland-nesting bird called the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryivorus). Yellow and black Bobolinks establish ground nests in hay fields from mid-May into early June. Their visibility and entertaining character, combined with evidence that many birds, including bobolinks, are experiencing population declines (Sauer et al. 2004), make the bird a leading candidate to attract public interest in efforts to manage farmland for vulnerable wildlife. Previous studies have established that hay harvesting conducted during the birds five to six week nesting period is devastating to fledgling success (e.g., Mitchell et al. 2000). A fairly moderate shift in the harvest schedule could provide significant refuge for nesting birds while causing some losses of the quantity and quality of the hay harvested. If a market developed that paid farmers acceptable compensation to protect grassland birds, then farmers would have an incentive to add an ecosystem service to their revenue base while enhancing environmental quality for wildlife.In this study, we compare four payment mechanisms applied in field experiments: 1) voluntary contribution mechanism, 2) provision point with a money-back guarantee and proportional rebate of excess contributions (PPMBG-PR), 3) uniform-price, multi-buyer auction and 4) pivotal mechanism. Voluntary contribution mechanism has no provision point but has a money-back guarantee if enough money is not raised. Under PPMBG-PR, the public good is supplied only if a pre-specified amount of money (the provision point) is raised, and contributors receive their money back if the market fails to raise that amount. Under a multi-buyer auction, everyone who is willing to pay above a certain price will pay a price such that the total sum will be enough to cover the cost for a farmer to change harvest practices. Under a pivotal mechanism only those consumers whose payments make a difference in the provision of the good would pay. The pivotal mechanism is incentive compatible and is used as the baseline. We test the following hypotheses on the WTP, market participation rate and total revenue collection:(1) WTP: Voluntary contribution < Multi-buyer Auction < PPMBG-PR < Pivotal (2) Participation rate: Voluntary contribution < PPMBG-PR < Multi-buyer auction < Pivotal (3) Revenue collection: Pivotal < Voluntary < Multi-buyer auction < PPMBG-PRWe perform a large-scale cross-mechanism comparison using two types of field experiments, a survey involving hypothetical questions and a functioning market for an ecosystem service. In the survey, the subjects are randomly assigned to one of the elicitation methods. We posit a hypothetical situation involving a market for contracts with farmers, describe the assigned elicitation method and ask respondents to compare several sets of two alternative farm wildlife contracts, each with five attributes presented in a stated-choice format. One of the attributes is to change the timing of hay harvesting to enhance the success of a specified number of bobolink fledglings on a given size of farm. The survey data were collected in fall of 2006. Survey questionnaires were sent to all of the 2,987 households in Jamestown, Rhode Island. The response rate was about 37% after accounting for undelivered surveys. Although still preliminary, a key result from the choice experiment is that consumers are least willing to pay for farm wildlife contracts under the voluntary contribution mechanism. The payment method that generated the greatest total purchases of farm wildlife contracts was the multi-buyer auction, followed by the pivotal mechanism and PPMBG-PR, respectively. This result suggests that some features of the payment mechanisms (such as setting of a provision point, fairness and a money-back guarantee) encourage consumers to reveal demand that is closer to each consumer true value of the good than the demand revealed by a simple voluntary contribution mechanism in a field experiment using a hypothetical situation. We are currently in the process of launching an ecosystem-service market in Jamestown by establishing actual farm wildlife contracts with farmers and selling shares of those contracts to consumers. The market will be open to the public for two months during March and April, 2007.  Each farm wildlife contract will be tied to one or more of the payment mechanisms and whether each contract will remain effective during the breeding season will depend on the market outcome under each mechanism. Consumers will be randomly assigned to one of the elicitation methods. Using market data, we will compare the actual consumer behavior across alternative methods and also to their willingness to pay as estimated in the survey choice experiment.";"Uchida, Emi

Results indicate that de-partments expect agribusiness faculty to teach more courses, yet maintain research expecta-tions for agribusiness faculty similar to those of their non-agribusiness peers. As a result, agri-business faculty have lowered their engagement in agribusiness extension programs. Moreover, evidence suggests an increasing trend in the amount of grant dollars obtained and the number of refereed publications reported at the time of tenure evaluation, while the number of non-refereed publications has declined.

"AGRIS:US201600193766";"Conservation of biodiversity in private lands: are Chilean landowners willing to keep threatened species in their lands?";"";"BACKGROUND: The biological conservation in private lands largely depends upon landownersâ willingness to keep populations of wild species on them, an issue highlighted by the Convention on Biological Diversity. In this study, we aim (i) to understand small landownersâ behavioural intentions, or relative intensity to adopt a given behaviour, towards threatened wildlife and (ii) to assess the role of local ecological knowledge, awareness of protected area, and forest ownership on landownersâ behavioural intentions towards threatened biodiversity. We interviewed peasants living around Los Queules National Reserve in Central Chile. RESULTS: Interview results showed that behavioural intentions towards threatened species were species-dependant. Results also showed that higher ecological knowledge and awareness of a protected area were associated with positive behavioural intentions towards wildlife. Peasants who owned land with larger forest cover reported positive behavioural intentions towards wildlife more frequently than peasants with less forest cover on their lands, although associations were not consistent across species. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (i) opportunities for getting peasants to support species conservation depend on the particular species and vary across peasants and (ii) there is a relevant social heterogeneity among peasants in terms of behavioural intentions towards species. As both factors likely influence conservation outcomes, they should be considered in the design of biodiversity conservation efforts.";"Zorondo-RodrÃ­guez, Francisco

This paper analyses the changes in indigenous range management among the Borana pastoralists and the role of development interventions.The fieldwork was carried out during 2000-2002, following a severe drought. Two locations, Dida Hara and Web, that once were part of a large grazing system with seasonally distinct herd movements, experienced differences in development interventions. Indigenous range management strategies and pastoralists' current use of key strategies before and after the last drought were compared based on pastoralists' information about land-use change collected through participatory appraisals, land-use mapping, and household surveys. Priorities for future interventions were discussed in multi-stakeholder workshops.Water development in rainy season grazing areas such as Dida Hara has resulted in year-round grazing and expansion of permanent encampments. This has affected the traditional dry-season areas like Web because it interrupted the organization of rangeland management. Herd mobility became less applicable and traditional land-use classifications have lost their function in range management. The introduction of government-imposed administration disturbed the indigenous institutional networks and negotiation procedures for controlled herd movements. Aggravated by human population growth, this reinforces a higher and more permanent grazing pressure, leading to the deterioration of rangelands.Despite the disturbance of pastoralists' range management practices considerable technical and management capabilities prevail. Innovative development approaches should integrate indigeneous knowledge-based (IK) strategies and formal legislation, but this requires strong external support and official recognition from the Ethiopian Government.

We investigated how conifer encroachment and spring prescribed burning affected forage and cover resources for a sagebrush specialist, the pygmy rabbit. We studied these dynamics at spring prescribed burns in southwestern Montana and eastern Idaho during the summer of 2011. Within each spring prescribed burn, we established plots that described the habitat conditions for pygmy rabbits (forage plant biomass and habitat components that influence predation risk) in areas that were burned, adjacent areas of conifer encroachment, and areas that were neither burned nor encroached. We analyzed the data for significant differences in habitat conditions between the paired reference and encroachment plots and modeled when the burned areas would approximate the conditions on the paired reference plots. Biomass of forage plants and habitat components that reduce predation risk differed between undisturbed reference plots and areas that were either burned or encroached with > 30% conifer canopy. Our models estimated that 13–27 yr were required for a spring prescribed burn to provide levels of cover and forage resources similar to sagebrush steppe reference plots. We documented that vegetation composition was associated with the plot designations (burn, reference, or conifer encroachment), but not with other abiotic factors, such as soil texture, aspect, or study site; this suggested that the documented differences in habitat were related to the treatments, rather than being site-specific characteristics. The information from this study can contribute to habitat management plans for high-elevation mountain big sagebrush sites where conifer encroachment is altering habitat for sagebrush-dependent wildlife species.";"Woods, Bonnie A.

In Chile, the risks related to soil erosion are greater in thepre Andean mountain areas or coastal dry-lands. However, there are also indications of low levelsof erosion in the Central Valley which, given the importance of this region for the country’sagricultural sector, should be taken seriously to avoid a worsening of the situation. This articleexamines the association of natural, social, human and fi nancial capital variables with the adoptionof soil conservation practices in Linares, Chile. The total numbers of practices implemented isanalyzed using a Poisson model which is appropriate when estimating multiple and joint technologyadoption. The data comes primarily from a survey conducted between October and December2005 to a total of 319 small scale farmers located in 32 water communities. The econometric resultsconfi rm that participation in social activities, access to credit, farm size and production system areimportant variables associated with the adoption of conservation practices.

The results suggest that the climate was cold and humid before ∼25 cal ka BP and also during the period ∼23–19 cal ka BP (except East Anatolia). Forest vegetation was 80–90% of the land cover in the northwestern Anatolia and Black Sea coast, and 50–60% along the Mediterranean coast at the same period. During Heinrich Event 2, from ∼25 to 23 cal ka BP, steppe vegetation dominated the Anatolian region due to the sudden change to very cold and arid conditions. Approximately between 18 and 16 cal ka BP in the Late Glacial, during Heinrich Event 1, a brief interval of cold and arid conditions resulted in weaker steppe vegetation over some part of Anatolia.

"AGRIS:US201400003094";"Forgotten forests - issues and prospects in biome mapping using Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests as a case study";"";"BACKGROUND: South America is one of the most species diverse continents in the world. Within South America diversity is not distributed evenly at both local and continental scales and this has led to the recognition of various areas with unique species assemblages. Several schemes currently exist which divide the continental-level diversity into large species assemblages referred to as biomes. Here we review five currently available biome maps for South America, including the WWF Ecoregions, the Americas basemap, the Land Cover Map of South America, Morrone's Biogeographic regions of Latin America, and the Ecological Systems Map. The comparison is performed through a case study on the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) biome using herbarium data of habitat specialist species. RESULTS: Current biome maps of South America perform poorly in depicting SDTF distribution. The poor performance of the maps can be attributed to two main factors: (1) poor spatial resolution, and (2) poor biome delimitation. Poor spatial resolution strongly limits the use of some of the maps in GIS applications, especially for areas with heterogeneous landscape such as the Andes. Whilst the Land Cover Map did not suffer from poor spatial resolution, it showed poor delimitation of biomes. The results highlight that delimiting structurally heterogeneous vegetation is difficult based on remote sensed data alone. A new refined working map of South American SDTF biome is proposed, derived using the Biome Distribution Modelling (BDM) approach where georeferenced herbarium data is used in conjunction with bioclimatic data. CONCLUSIONS: Georeferenced specimen data play potentially an important role in biome mapping. Our study shows that herbarium data could be used as a way of ground-truthing biome maps in silico. The results also illustrate that herbarium data can be used to model vegetation maps through predictive modelling. The BDM approach is a promising new method in biome mapping, and could be particularly useful for mapping poorly known, fragmented, or degraded vegetation. We wish to highlight that biome delimitation is not an exact science, and that transparency is needed on how biomes are used as study units in macroevolutionary and ecological research.";"Särkinen, Tiina

Correlation coefficient method and expert consultation method are used to determine the weight of evaluation index. After the standardization of extreme value, weighted sum method and multiple regression method are adopted to evaluate the influencing factors of agricultural land productivity in Huang-Huai Plain, China.

Resources condition has a higher contribution rate to the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain than that to Henan Province. Both the social and economic condition and the disaster control and sustainable production condition show relatively small contribution rate to the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain. It can be concluded that the main factors affecting the productivity of Huang-Huai Plain are the backward agricultural science and technology level, the poor farmland quality and the farmland infrastructure.

"AGRIS:US2016219119";"CAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN THE MARGINAL LANDS CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY IN THE SAHELIAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES: AN EVIDENCE FROM THE BAS-FOND RICE PRODUCTION IN MALI";"";"To improve national food security, successive Mali governments have always focused on expanding and intensifying production in the government-managed irrigation schemes (Office du Niger), which account for about 50% of domestic rice production.  Because the cost of expanding and rehabilitating those schemes is high, the government is looking for complementary cost-effective ways to achieve this goal.  The government could increase domestic rice supply by investing in improving the farmer-managed inland valley swamps.  Although the government has paid little attention to those marginal lands, farmers have been growing rice in these areas using traditional technologies.  This paper used data from a survey of 334 bas-fond farmers and secondary data to examine the potential contribution that these undeveloped bas-fonds could make to improve food security and rice exports in Mali.  The study found that, if fully developed, the bas-fonds and flooded plains could produce more rice than is currently being supplied by the Office du Niger, or imported through commercial imports or food aid.  As expected, rice yields in the bas-fonds are lower than in the Office du Niger.  However, bas-fonds rice production is both financially profitable and provides a higher return per day of family labor than the competing upland crops (maize, sorghum/millet and cotton).  In addition, the estimated domestic resources cost ratios show that, compared to the Office d u Niger, bas-fond rice production  represents a better use of domestic resources, both for producing rice for home consumption and for the market.";"Dimithe, Georges

"AGRIS:US201400115924";"Postharvest technology innovation and opportunities of extension for horticultural produce: perspective and trends";"";"The social and economic consequences of horticultural product food losses from farm to the consumer remain unacceptably high. In developing countries postharvest losses compromise food security, income generation and poverty alleviation for millions of families. In developed countries substantial product losses result in economic losses to supply chain participants and reduced supplies of healthy products into international markets. This situation results from many factors beyond the control of individual stakeholders in the supply chain, that may occur as a consequence of inadequate infrastructure [e.g. transport, energy supply] and social [e.g. economic, R&D, strategic policy, land tenure] systems that are generally do not receive enough private or public sector funding. Knowledge of the postharvest physiology of major fruit, vegetable and flower crops are generally well known, and postharvest technologies have been developed to cool, pack, transport and store products for increasingly longer times. The continuing challenge is how to channel such a large array of relevant information to provide commercially valuable postharvest and quality solutions to producers in such a way that they, and each supply chain participant, make a sustainable profit while still satisfying consumer demands. What avenues exist to ensure that growers are supplied with the information that enables them to optimize all the postharvest practices and processes required to profitably supply high value, nutritious safe products to consumers? This paper discusses the importance of changing Government policies on funding of outreach and extension programmes with an increasing move from general State funding available for all growers, to commercial or private specialized consultancy services for individual producers on a user-pays basis. It will identify a model and techniques of demonstrated success at different levels and will emphasise the critical importance of information and communication technologies to make available both traditional and new innovative postharvest knowledge, techniques and marketing information. It will stress the importance of champions within any system in ensuring success, profit and satisfaction at all levels of the horticultural product supply chain.";"Hewett, E.W.";"";"International Society for Horticultural Science";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"food security;poverty;land tenure";"Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400115924";"http://www.actahort.org/";"";"";"";"25-32"

Landsat data were employed within a pure-panel stratified one-stage cluster sample to estimate and characterize land-cover change for 1973-2000. Results indicate anthropogenic and natural disturbances, such as forest cutting and fire, were the dominant changes, followed by large fluctuations between agriculture and rangelands. Contrary to common perception, agriculture remained relatively stable over the 27-year period with an estimated loss of 1.0% of agricultural land. The largest net declines occurred in the grasslands/shrubs class at 5,131 km² and forest class at 4,722 km².

Monitoring designs typically must accommodate multiple ecological, logistical, political, and economic objectives and constraints. We present a long-term bioregional monitoring program to assess the status and change in populations of the federally listed candidate frog species, Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] canorus) and mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa/sierrae complex), on USDA Forest Service lands in the Sierra Nevada, California. The program takes advantage of advances in survey design and analysis to: 1) collect data at a metapopulation scale (i.e., small basins), 2) provide occupancy data on ≥2 species with overlapping ranges with the same field-monitoring protocols, 3) provide occupancy estimates applicable to the entire range of each species in the study region, 4) incorporate information from historical occupancy records, and 5) link the survey design to an existing survey design. We estimated occupancy assuming imperfect detection by extending existing procedures for maximum likelihood estimation to incorporate the unequal probability of selection used in the survey design. From 2002 to 2009, we estimate that the Yosemite toad used 0.25 ± 0.01 (SE), 0.86 ± 0.04, and 0.86 ± 0.03 of basins over its range, with historical presence, and with presence since 1990, respectively, and the mountain yellow-legged frog used 0.04 ± 0.01, 0.43 ± 0.04, and 0.47 ± 0.04 of basins over its range, with historical presence, and with presence since 1990, respectively. Survey date and snow pack affected detection of the Yosemite toad but not of the mountain yellow-legged frog.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was applied to the images to map changes in vegetation. An unsupervised classification, followed by classes recoding, filtering, identifications, area computing and post-classification process were applied to the composite of the three years of NDVI images. Maximum likelihood classification was applied to the 2007 image (ETM+2007) using a supervised classification process. Seven vegetation classes were defined from training data sets. The seven classes included the following biomes: riparian forest, dry forest, flooded vegetation, wooded savanna, fallows, parkland, and water. For these classes, the overall accuracy and the overall kappa statistic for the classified map were 72.5% and 0.67, respectively. Data analyses indicated a great change in land resources; especially between 1987 and 2000 probably due to the impact of democratization process social, economic, and political disorder from 1990. Wide-scale loss of vegetation occurred during this period. However, areas of vegetation clearing and regrowth were more visible between 2000 and 2007. The main source of confusion in the contingency matrix was due to heterogeneity within certain classes. It could also be due to spectral homogeneity among the classes.

In this paper a meta-model is developed to simulate interactions between trees, crops and soils under a range of management regimes for a smallholding in Sumatra. The model is used within a dynamic-programming algorithm to determine optimal tree/crop areas, tree-rotation lengths, firewood-harvest and fertilizer application rates for a landholder faced with deteriorating land quality and opportunities to receive carbon credits and fertiliser subsidies. It is found th at profit maximising management strategies depend on initial soil quality. For example, incentives to participate in carbon projects only exist when the soil is degraded because the opportunity cost of the forgone crop production is low. Also, when soil-carbon stocks are low only trees should be grown and residues added to the soil to increase carbon stocks until a threshold level is reached, when it becomes optimal to switch to a steady-state system of crops with fertiliser. In this case, tree rotation lengths depend on carbon and fertiliser prices; where increases in these prices decrease the opportunity cost of growing trees and allow for longer rotations. If, however, the initial soil-carbon stock is high, the profit-maximising strategy is to grow only crops and use fertiliser, which initially depletes the soil of carbon until a steady state is reached and maintained.";"Wise, Russell M.

This article highlights the efforts of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazônia (LBA) related to the topic. In particular, a longitudinal study has analyzed the social and biophysical dimensions of land use/land cover, using a multi-scalar georeferenced approach. The study areas represent a gradient of soil fertility in Amazônia and include distinct landscape mosaics, from the Amazon estuary and the Bragantina region to northeastern Rondônia. Within the project, we emphasize studies in areas of rural settlement due to their social relevance and their impacts on land cover in local and regional scales. To illustrate the potential of such studies, we present comparative results for Machadinho d'Oeste and Vale do Anari, State of Rondônia. The multitemporal analysis included Landsat images and fieldwork. Land owners, loggers, rubber tapers, and other local actors were interviewed about their production systems and land-use history. The calculation of spatial metrics supported our conclusions. The results indicate that settlement design and institutional aspects play a central role in the process of landscape change. The combination of private lots with communal forest reserves, managed by local populations, produces positive outcomes in maintaining larger patches of forest. The methods used contribute to the analysis, integration, and monitoring of land use and land cover in Amazônia, subsidizing policies that incorporate the social and environmental dimensions of regional development.

"AGRIS:US201500196858";"Territorial user rights for artisanal fisheries in Chile – intended and unintended outcomes";"";"Granting property rights in fisheries is assumed to provide incentives for sustainable resource exploitation. These rights might also open other income options for fishers, including some that go beyond the original objectives intended by authorities establishing the right. The opportunity for alternative uses is especially high if the details of these rights are not clearly identified. In Chile, a de novo TURF (Territorial User Rights for Fishery) system, called Management Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (Áreas de Manejo y Explotación de Recursos Bentónicos-AMERB) was created to achieve sustainable exploitation of benthic resources. This study compares two small-scale fishing communities in Chile, Guayacán and Huentelauquén, representing two typical contrasting settings, regarding geographical contexts and surroundings, origin, history, location, social embeddedness, main fisheries activities as well as the motivation and the process through which they acquired their AMERB. While in Guayacán the main fishing activity outside the AMERB is the giant squid and finfish fishery, in Huentelauquén the main and traditional activity has been diving for benthic resources. The objectives to acquire their AMERBs were different in both cases. Huentelauquén applied the AMERB for their traditional activity, the fishery of Concholepas concholepas (“loco”), thus in accordance with the official objective of the AMERB. Due to reduced catches of loco, fishers also added the collection of kelps, using their AMERB to control access to the entire coast surrounding their fishing community, beyond the limits of their AMERB. In Guayacán the AMERB, applied for the management of scallops and a species of red algae, began to be used for sea squirt aquaculture. Within the framework of sustainable fisheries implied by the AMERBs, there was in both cases a clear expectation to gain new sources of income. However with time both AMERBs are being used as a tool for territorial exclusion of other fishers beyond the limits of their respective AMERBs. In Huentelauquén fishers mention mostly negative aspects about the performance of their AMERB, given the poor economic results, being unsatisfied with the AMERB system in general, because they feel that the system disrupted their traditional migration along the coast. In Guayacán, fishers mentioned mostly positive aspects for their AMERB, as it was an opportunity to add new activities. Both examples show that rights-based management approaches are very attractive; they could promote new uses or developments, whose sustainability nevertheless needs to be analyzed further. The analyzed case studies show that, contrary to how the system was developed in Chile, a more bottom-up implementation of new management arrangements may make it easier to agree on common objectives, and/or leave more freedom for fishers to adjust and arrange their livelihood. Considering the importance the AMERBs have acquired for fishers, these kinds of systems need flexible regulations in order that fishers can adapt the system to local traditions, uses or needs and also to their learning and adapting capacities.";"Aburto, J.

The implications of contemporary theories in relation to this matter are examined. Coverage includes the applicability of new welfare economics, the relevance of the neoclassical theory of politics, and the implications of contemporary theories of social conflict resolution and communication. Examining case studies of Swiss and Australian regulation of the use of rural properties and the ensuing conflicts, it is found that many decisions reflect a mixture of these elements. Rarely, if ever, are social decisions in this area made solely on the basis of welfare economics, for instance social cost-benefit analysis. Only some aspects of such decisions can be explained by the neoclassical theory of politics, and only ex post. Theories of social conflict resolution suggest why approaches of discourse and participation may resolve conflicts on regulation and compensation and in which way. These theories and their practical application seem to gain in importance as contest against decisions in a sovereign capacity increases. The high complexity of most conflicts on regulation and compensation cannot be tackled with narrow economic theories. Moreover, the Swiss and Australian examples show that such approaches of conflict resolution may rather favour environmental standards.";"Seidl, Irmi

"AGRIS:US201300759714";"Evaluating sampling strategies and logistic regression methods for modelling complex land cover changes";"";"1. The role of land cover change as a significant component of global change has become increasingly recognized in recent decades. Large databases measuring land cover change, and the data which can potentially be used to explain the observed changes, are also becoming more commonly available. When developing statistical models to investigate observed changes, it is important to be aware that the chosen sampling strategy and modelling techniques can influence results. 2. We present a comparison of three sampling strategies and two forms of grouped logistic regression models (multinomial and ordinal) in the investigation of patterns of successional change after agricultural land abandonment in Switzerland. 3. Results indicated that both ordinal and nominal transitional change occurs in the landscape and that the use of different sampling regimes and modelling techniques as investigative tools yield different results. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our multimodel inference identified successfully a set of consistently selected indicators of land cover change, which can be used to predict further change, including annual average temperature, the number of already overgrown neighbouring areas of land and distance to historically destructive avalanche sites. This allows for more reliable decision making and planning with respect to landscape management. Although both model approaches gave similar results, ordinal regression yielded more parsimonious models that identified the important predictors of land cover change more efficiently. Thus, this approach is favourable where land cover change pattern can be interpreted as an ordinal process. Otherwise, multinomial logistic regression is a viable alternative.";"RUTHERFORD, G.N.

"AGRIS:US201400004227";"Improving the application of long‐term ecology in conservation and land management";"";"Significant effort is being made to develop more inclusive and systematic decision‐making frameworks in ecology, but these have yet to include palaeoecology. Doing so would address critical questions about long‐term ecological processes (spanning >50� years). This paper outlines the main barriers to the integration of long‐term ecological data (LTE) into management. Using two UK upland case studies, it uses a choice experiment to assess the value placed on LTE by ecological researchers, policymakers and practitioners. Respondents were able to consider how selecting or excluding different sources of evidence might affect management decisions and their environmental outcomes. The results suggest that LTE has the potential to become a valued part of the evidence base for guiding land‐management decisions. Synthesis and applications. Placing more emphasis on site‐based approaches can help translate this potential into practice by demonstrating the practical benefits of using LTE. By working with managers to address site‐based issues, palaeoecology can provide additional insights into ecosystem dynamics and critical thresholds. Using LTE can also improve conservation effectiveness by ensuring that both rapid and lagged responses are anticipated and indicating the range of variability against which management responses can be evaluated.";"Davies, Althea L.

The focus is on the contribution of explanatory variables that represent transaction costs, risk-sharing incentives, or both. An empirical model of contract choice is tested against the 1999 Agricultural Economics and Land Ownership Survey (AELOS) and finds mixed evidence for low transaction cost and risk-sharing-incentive motives for landlord-tenant choices of a share versus cash-rent contract. However, the behavior of landlords and tenants is consistent with them being risk averse. Although it is standard to control for the riskiness of the principal's task that is contracted, we find that other attributes of the landlord are an important part of a relatively complex story for U.S. land tenancy contacting. The latter results have generally been ignored in other published landlord-tenant contracting studies.";"Fukunaga, Keita

We employ the Theory of Planned Behavior to estimate the social availability of woody biomass as a function of landowner behavior intent, landowner characteristics, forest land characteristics, and biomass price on stated willingness to harvest biomass in conjunction with a commercial timber harvest. A mail survey was administered to 1109 nonindustrial private woodland owners in a 26-county region in northeast Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin during the fall of 2009. Using binary logistic regression, we found payment level offered to harvest biomass plays a significant role in landowners' decisions, but that non-monetary factors are also important. Landowner attitudes and opinions regarding soil impacts, aesthetics, and energy independence were important predictors of stated willingness to harvest. Social norms as manifested through the influence of neighbors were also significant. These findings expand existing research and are useful for profiling nonindustrial private woodland owners to identify sustainable sources of biomass to supply a burgeoning bioenergy sector in the Lake States.";"Becker, Dennis R.

Land degradation can both change land cover and surface climate and significantly influence atmospheric circulation. Researches have verified that carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) are major greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere and are directly affected by human activity. However, to date, there is no research on the spatial distribution of GHG concentrations and also no research on how land degradations affect GHG concentrations in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, we used GHG data from the ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT) and the Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and precipitation data from ground stations to analyze the way land degradation affects GHG concentrations in northern China and Mongolia, which exhibit the most serious land degradation process in East Asia. Our research revealed that the CO₂ and CH₄ concentrations (XCO₂ and XCH₄) increased from 2003 to 2009 and then decreased into 2011. We used geostatistics to predict and simulate the spatial distribution of XCO₂ and XCH₄ and found that the distribution of XCO₂ displays a seasonal trend and is primarily affected by plant photosynthesis, soil respiration and precipitation. As the distribution of XCH₄ is mainly affected by the sources' distribution, microbial processes, LST and submarine hydrate, the CH₄ concentration presents no obvious seasonal changes and the high XCH₄ values are primarily found in northeast and southeast China. Land degradation increases the concentration of GHG: the correlation coefficient between NDVI and XCO₂ is R² = 0.76 (P < 0.01) and the value between NDVI and XCH₄ is R² = 0.75 (P < 0.01).";"Guo, M.

However, the effects of other more localized components of global change such as land degradation have been almost completely ignored. In this paper we evaluate the phenological patterns of 10 plant species at three sites with contrasting levels of land degradation due to overgrazing in the Patagonian Monte, Argentina, and their relationship with plant morphology, browsing intensity, and plant competition. Plant phenology differed among sites in eight species, but plant responses were species-specific. In six species the dormancy and senescence periods were shorter indicating longer growing cycles at high degradation than at low degradation site. Generally, plants growing at high degradation site present longer and frequently incomplete vegetative periods and shorter and less dominant reproductive periods than those at low degradation site. However, in some species the duration of reproductive periods was greater in the high degradation site. Plant size (i.e. height, area, and/or internal cover) affected plant phenology in seven species. In contrast, browsing and neighbor's cover were rarely related to plant phenology. Our results suggest that other global change components such as land degradation may affect plant phenology.";"Bisigato, A.J.

Optimal allocation of land use depends on attributes related to terrestrial and aquatic environments. A dynamic model that links land use, overland flow, suspended sediment, and an aquatic species is used to evaluate alternate land use policies. The dwarf wedge mussel that is classified as endangered in the region is used as an indicator species of aquatic health in a watershed in Massachusetts. The simulation model is used to evaluate spatial nature of processes and land use policies. Spatial and temporal changes in runoff, sediment loading, and mussel population are modeled over a period of 4 years. Ten policy scenarios represent combinations of best management practices and development of agriculture and urban land at spatial locations of headwaters, main stem regions, riparian, and entire watershed. Increasing the proportion of agriculture and high density residential land use increased runoff, while increasing the frequency and magnitude of peak flows in the watershed. Sediment loading increased with an increased proportion of agriculture area and decreased with an expansion of high density residential area. Scenarios with an increase in sediment loading above the baseline mean exhibited an irregular recovery of the mussel population from high loading events. Policy implications include the need for best management practices to decrease runoff and sediment loading in the watershed, through education and incentive programs.";"Randhir, Timothy O.

The fuzzy models achieve better predictive accuracies than their classic counterparts.

We selected 20 watersheds at HUC 12 level with different degrees of urbanization and performed hydrologic simulation using a distributed object-oriented rainfall and runoff simulation model. We extracted the discharge per area and ratio of runoff to base flow from simulation results and used them as indicators of hydrology pattern. We derived percentage of ISA, distance from ISA to streams, and stream density as the watershed characteristics to evaluate the relationship with hydrology pattern in watersheds using ordinary least square, spatial error and spatial lag regression models. The comparison indicates that spatial lag regression model can achieve better performance for the evaluation of relationship between ratio of runoff to base flow and watershed characteristics, and that three models provide similar performance for the evaluation of relationship between discharge per area and watershed characteristics. The results from regression analyses demonstrate that ISA plays an important role in watershed hydrology. Ignorance of spatial dependence in analyses will likely cause inaccurate evaluation for relationship between ISA and watershed hydrology. The hydrologic model, regression methods and relationships between watershed characteristics and hydrology pattern provide important tools and information for decision makers to evaluate the effect of different scenarios in land management.";"Zhou, Yuyu

Wild deer provide perhaps one of the best examples of such a management ‘problem’, especially where they are encountered in peri-urban environments. Faced with potential controversy, decision-makers in public land management organisations need information which clearly differentiates between generally acceptable management objectives and methods, and less mainstream preferences. We conducted a questionnaire survey aimed at assessing the preferences of community members in peri-urban Scotland for management methods in response to specific problems and analysed the results in relation to three social categories—age, gender and familiarity with wildlife. Active management was broadly accepted. Fencing dominated as the preferred first management response with little variation across social category, or between management problems. Changing human behaviour (e.g. introducing speed limits) was also a highly preferred response by the respondents in this study. In general, the order of preferred management responses stayed the same in relation to different management impacts. Culling (lethal control) had almost no support as a first management response to any problem, although considerably more respondents support it as a third preference. Our results suggest that culling is acceptable as a subsidiary management response in peri-urban areas, but only where other preferred management methods have been tried and failed.";"Dandy, Norman

"AGRIS:US201400003542";"use of camera trapping for estimating Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) home ranges";"";"The use of non-invasive long-term monitoring data to estimate home ranges of the critically endangered Iberian lynx has been evaluated. This programme began in 2002 and consisting of both annual latrine and camera-trap surveys, with the aims of detecting and individually identifying the maximum number of individuals and delineating female home range boundaries. Radio-tracking data were used to evaluate the accuracy of home range estimates constructed with camera-trapping data. There was little overlap of camera-trapping home ranges (7.0% ± 1.47), which suggests the existence of real territories consistent with the land tenure system expected for the species. Camera trapping home range estimates were half the size of radio-tracking data (54.1% ± 6.0 of overlapping). When comparing core areas, only the radio-tracking data did not yield improved results (36.7 ± 5.4 of overlapping). Estimation of territories, which escaped detection each year, ranged from 0.0% to 5.7%. The results produced by camera-trapping data in this non-intrusive monitoring programme could be considered precise, and are therefore well suited to provide the knowledge required for appropriate conservation of this endangered species.";"Gil-Sánchez, Jose María

"AGRIS:US201500205217";"Streamflow regimes of the Yanhe River under climate and land use change, Loess Plateau, China";"";"Soil and water conservation measures including terracing, afforestation, construction of sediment‐trapping dams, and the ‘Grain for Green Program’ have been extensively implemented in the Yanhe River watershed, of the Loess Plateau, China, over the last six decades, and have resulted in large‐scale land use and land cover changes. This study examined the trends and shifts in streamflow regime over the period of 1953–2010 and relates them to changes in land use and soil and water conservation and to the climatic factors of precipitation and air temperature. The non‐parametric Mann–Kendall test and the Pettitt test were used to identify trends and shifts in streamflow and base flow. A method based on precipitation and potential evaporation was used to evaluate the impacts of climate variability and changes in non‐climate factors changes on annual streamflow. A significant decrease (p = 0.01) in annual streamflow was observed related to a significant change point in 1996, mostly because of significant decreases in streamflow (p = 0.01) in the July to September periods in subsequent years. The annual base flow showed no significant trend from 1953 to 2010 and no change point year, mostly because there were no significant seasonal trends, except for significant decreases (p = 0.05) in the July to September periods. There was no significant trend for precipitation over the studied time period, and no change point was detected. The air temperature showed a significant increasing trend (p < 0.01), and 1986 (p < 0.01) was the change point year. The climate variability, as measured by precipitation and temperature, and non‐climate factors including land use changes and soil and water conservation were estimated to have contributed almost equally to the reduction in annual streamflow. Soil and water conservation practices, including biological measures (e.g. revegetation, planting trees and grass) and engineering measures (such as fish‐scale pits, horizontal trenches, and sediment‐trapping dams) play an important role in reduction of the conversion of rainfall to run‐off.

In a region with meagre rainfall, growing grass is the farmers' main vocation. Between 1855 and 1881, the majority of government 'wastelands' were given on lease to farmers who organized the land into grazing paddocks and fenced with hedges of Balasmodendron berryi. Numerous wells were dug in the grazing lands to provide water for drinking to animals and to some extent for irrigation. Between July and February, the animals are exclusively grazed by rotating between paddocks. The grazing lands are cultivated every 4 to 5 years and sorghum is sown and made into hay for animal feeding between March and June. In several places, the Cenchrus dominated grassland is also sown with legumes like Phaseolus trilobus to improve the quality of forage. Security of land tenure coupled with technological interventions has sustained the productive capacity of the grassland for over a century. The grassland also has a stable human population and healthy female to male ratio. It offers a model for replication elsewhere under similar low rainfall conditions.";"Kumar, Anil

"AGRIS:US201500010334";"Introduced annual grass increases regional fire activity across the arid western USA (1980–2009)";"";"Non‐native, invasive grasses have been linked to altered grass‐fire cycles worldwide. Although a few studies have quantified resulting changes in fire activity at local scales, and many have speculated about larger scales, regional alterations to fire regimes remain poorly documented. We assessed the influence of large‐scale Bromus tectorum (hereafter cheatgrass) invasion on fire size, duration, spread rate, and interannual variability in comparison to other prominent land cover classes across the Great Basin, USA. We compared regional land cover maps to burned area measured using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2000–2009 and to fire extents recorded by the USGS registry of fires from 1980 to 2009. Cheatgrass dominates at least 6% of the central Great Basin (650 000 km²). MODIS records show that 13% of these cheatgrass‐dominated lands burned, resulting in a fire return interval of 78 years for any given location within cheatgrass. This proportion was more than double the amount burned across all other vegetation types (range: 0.5–6% burned). During the 1990s, this difference was even more extreme, with cheatgrass burning nearly four times more frequently than any native vegetation type (16% of cheatgrass burned compared to 1–5% of native vegetation). Cheatgrass was also disproportionately represented in the largest fires, comprising 24% of the land area of the 50 largest fires recorded by MODIS during the 2000s. Furthermore, multi‐date fires that burned across multiple vegetation types were significantly more likely to have started in cheatgrass. Finally, cheatgrass fires showed a strong interannual response to wet years, a trend only weakly observed in native vegetation types. These results demonstrate that cheatgrass invasion has substantially altered the regional fire regime. Although this result has been suspected by managers for decades, this study is the first to document recent cheatgrass‐driven fire regimes at a regional scale.";"Balch, Jennifer K.

Quantifying the impact of transport infrastructure on land use change is necessary for evaluating the role of transportation development in the process of land use and land cover change in the urban-rural fringe. Taking Qixia District of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, China as a typical urban-rural fringe area, this paper analyzes the patterns and characteristics of land use change along three major transportation arteries using land use data from 2000 and 2008. We examine the spatial differentiation and gradient of land use pattern around railway, expressway, and highway corridors to investigate whether land use change in the urban-rural fringe is related to distance from transportation arteries and to clarify the varying impacts of different forms of transport infrastructure on land use patterns. We find that construction land generally tends to be located close to major transportation arteries, and that railways have the most obvious influence on land use change in the urban-rural fringe, while the impact of expressways was not significant. We conclude that there exists a causal relationship between the presence of transportation arteries and land use change in the urban-rural fringe, but this relationship varies across different types of linear transport infrastructure.";"Zhang, Runsen

To detect those fast-moving processes area-wide remains almost impossible in developing countries due to the lack of official statistics, often restricted remote sensing data, and limited financial resources. Due to that lack of data, methods using representative samples and indicators are required. In order to detect and comprehend ongoing spatial processes in the coastal zone of Benin, available heterogeneous remote sensing data were analyzed and surveys were conducted. The processes of migration, agricultural dynamics, and coastal changes were identified and investigated through relevant indicators. By the use of remote sensing, the spatial expression of the complex process-structures can be detected in terms of changes, while socio-economic, demographic, and cultural analysis helps uncover and explain reasons for and settings of the observed changes. Findings such as those obtained constitute a prerequisite for coastal resources management and provide an important planning tool for decision makers.";"Teka, Oscar

This research explored processes and causes of aeolian desertification in the study area. The results showed that aeolian desertification development in Zhenglan Qi of typical region located at the center in the study area can be divided into three stages including rapid occurrence before 1987, parts of rehabilitation and most of deterioration from 1987 to 2000 and little rapid rehabilitation occurrence from 2000 to 2005, according to remote sensing images and field investigations. Gradually declining MI indicated that climate change was not the major cause of aeolian desertification development during the last 40 years, while increasing population should be the underlying cause of local aeolian desertification. Irrational human activities mainly including unsuitable reclamation in the 1960s and lasting over-grazing after 1980 are direct causes contributing to local aeolian desertification, especially over-grazing, while climate change often played a revealer of irrational human activities mainly through drought events. Over-grazing and undesirable climate have different functions during the whole aeolian desertification process. Over-grazing gradually changed grasslands to slight aeolian desertified lands at the initial stage, while climate with windy days or droughts often accelerated formation of serious aeolian desertified lands. Aeolian desertification in the study area both possesses occurrence possibility and great rehabilitative potential. At present, more integrated countermeasures combating local aeolian desertification still are expected.";"Liu, Shulin

These three stations respectively drain 98, 622, and 932 km 2 of mainly agricultural lands. Rainfall data were collected from six newly established raingage stations. The study provides a valuable database to understand some of the complex physical and chemical processes in an east central Illinois watershed and to calibrate, validate, and evaluate mathematical models. Analyses of the limited data from different sampling methods showed consistencies among the methods. The nitrate-N concentrations in Big Ditch during intense storms of 1998 showed inverse relationships with water discharge. Higher goodness-of-fit of the relationships was found within the data for individual months than for the combined set, showing dependence on varying climate, land cover, and management practices during the growing season. The nitrate-N concentrations at each of the three stations during less intense storms in 1999 showed weak positive relationships with water discharge. The total nitrate-N load in Big Ditch generated by the storms of March, May, and June of 1998 was similar to the average annual load, indicating the importance of single-event storms, and therefore their need for close attention. After the intense storm of April 1999, the less intense storms during May and June after long low-flow periods significantly raised the nitrate-N concentrations in all three stations. A similar pattern was noticed in the 1998 observations before each of the major peaks, when the smaller peaks elevated nitrate-N concentrations followed by dilution with the larger peaks. Results of this study show positive relationships between suspended sediment concentration and water discharge for the smaller watershed (Big Ditch); however, no relationships were found in the larger watersheds (Upper Sangamon River at Fisher and Mahomet). Observed data at each of the stations showed positive relationships of phosphate-P, atrazine, and metolachlor concentrations with water discharge.";"Borah, D.K.

To understand and simulate LUCC as the result of local decisions, multi-agent systems models (MAS) have become a popular technique. However, the definition of agents is not often based on real data, ignoring the inherent diversity of farmers and farm characteristics in rural landscapes. The aim of this paper is to describe an empirical method that defines an agent typology and allocates agents into the different agent types for an entire region. This method is illustrated with a case study in the Netherlands, where processes of farm expansion and diversification of farm practices take place. Five different agent types were defined and parameterized in terms of views, farm characteristics and location. Despite its simplicity, this empirical method captures several relations between farmers' views, farm characteristics and land-use decisions and strategies. This approach is a step forward in multi-agent systems of land use/cover change (MAS/LUCC) to include the diversity of land-use decisions and strategies in regional studies by empirically defining, parameterizing and allocating different agent types.";"Valbuena, Diego

"AGRIS:US201600076524";"Assessing impacts of Roads: Application of a Standard Assessment Protocol";"";"Adaptive management of road networks depends on timely data that accurately reflect the impacts of network impacts on ecosystem processes and associated services. In the absence of reliable data, land managers are left with little more than observations and perceptions to support adaptive management of road-associated disturbances. Roads can negatively impact the soil, hydrologic, plant, and animal processes on which virtually all ecosystem services depend. The Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (IIRH) protocol is a qualitative method that has been demonstrated to be effective in characterizing impacts of roads. The goals of this study were to develop, describe, and test an approach for using IIRH to systematically evaluate road impacts across large, diverse arid and semiarid landscapes. We developed a stratified random sampling approach to plot selection based on ecological potential, road inventory data, and image interpretation of road impacts. The test application on a semi-arid landscape in southern New Mexico, USA demonstrates that the approach developed is sensitive to road impacts across a broad range of ecological sites but that not all the types of stratification were useful. Ecological site and road inventory strata accounted for significant variability in the functioning of ecological processes but stratification based on apparent impact did not. Analysis of the repeatability of IIRH applied to road plots indicates that the method is repeatable but consensus evaluations based multiple observers should be used to minimize risk of bias. Landscape-scale analysis of impacts by roads of contrasting designs (maintained dirt or gravel roads versus non- or infrequently maintained roads) suggests that future travel management plans for the study area should consider concentrating traffic on fewer roads that are well-designed and maintained. Application of the approach by land managers will likely provide important insights into minimizing impacts of road networks on key ecosystem services.";"Duniway, Michael C.

Irrigated cropping, particularly in the western USA, is an important source of N2O emissions. However, the impacts of tillage intensity and N fertilizer amount and type have not been extensively studied for irrigated systems. The DAYCENT biogeochemical model was tested using N2O, crop yield, soil N and C, and other data collected from irrigated cropping systems in northeastern Colorado during 2002 to 2006. DAYCENT uses daily weather, soil texture, and land management information to simulate C and N fluxes between the atmosphere, soil, and vegetation. The model properly represented the impacts of tillage intensity and N fertilizer amount on crop yields, soil organic C (SOC), and soil water content. DAYCENT N2O emissions matched the measured data in that simulated emissions increased as N fertilization rates increased and emissions from no-till (NT) tended to be lower on average than conventional-till (CT). However, the model overestimated N2O emissions. Lowering the amount of N2O emitted per unit of N nitrified from 2 to 1% helped improve model fit but the treatments receiving no N fertilizer were still overestimated by more than a factor of 2. Both the model and measurements showed that soil NO3- levels increase with N fertilizer addition and with tillage intensity, but DAYCENT underestimated NO3- levels, particularly for the treatments receiving no N fertilizer. We suggest that DAYCENT could be improved by reducing the background nitrification rate and by accounting for the impact of changes in microbial community structure on denitrification rates.";"Del Grosso, S.J.

The current quantity and quality of lakes in Dhaka was subsequently assessed through a combination of field work, government reports and satellite imagery analysis. The results indicated that past management strategies have failed to prevent the infill and pollution of lakes and wetlands. Many key indicators of poor water quality have exhibited sharp increases over the past decade. Urban encroachment into lakes has been curtailed in only four of Dhaka’s 14 districts, with ten districts losing water land cover over the past 66 years. Policymaker and stakeholder opinions on the drivers of lake pollution were highly variable in this study, creating additional roadblocks in implementing and enforcing effective management strategies.

"AGRIS:US201400173727";"Climate change adaptive capacity of the Canadian forest sector";"";"Canada's forests will be affected by climate change to a greater degree than many other regions. The ability of the Canadian forest sector to successfully adapt to climate change, i.e. its adaptive capacity, was assessed through a series of group discussions and interviews with a variety of forestry stakeholders across Canada. The assessment was oriented to the following determinants of adaptive capacity: 1) The range of available technological options for adaptation that would be considered in response to a perceived climate-related stress; 2) The availability of resources; 3) The structure and functionality of critical institutions to understand the allocation of decision‐making authority, institutional flexibility, and the decision criteria that would be employed; 4) Human and social capital, including the distribution of educational achievement, differential access to personal security and robust property rights; 5) The system's (and individuals’) access to risk-spreading processes (both formal and informal); 6) Decision-makers’ ability to manage information, the processes by which these decision-makers determine which information is credible, and the credibility of the decision-makers themselves. Forest managers were generally optimistic about their ability to identify and implement adaptation options at the forest management unit level. However, institutional barriers were seen to be a major impediment; managers identified tenure reform and a more flexible regulatory environment as essential for the innovation that will be required by climate change. Other factors limiting adaptive capacity include lack of financial resources and low levels of investment in the forest sector, lack of specialized science capacity in climate change impacts and the long-term nature of planning required by long-lived forest species. Several non-governmental institutions may support increased adaptive capacity including forest certification systems, Criteria and Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management, Canada's model forest program and others. However, these institutions will need to be modified in order to support forest managers in planning for climate change.";"Johnston, Mark

"AGRIS:LV2013000251";"Land consolidation as a tool for its successful management";"Zemes konsolidācija kā instruments veiksmīgai saimniekošanai";"As a result of the Land Reform, property forming and land market, farm areas were often built up from a number of land plots (up to 20), sometimes with unfavourable order. With the rural development and stabilization of farm production, the role and tasks of rational territory organization are expected to increase significantly in the area. It can be forecasted that, as a result of land rent and further purchase and sell, and other transactions, many new farmland properties are expected to appear that will not correspond to the requirements of rational territorial organization. It indicates that the importance of land consolidation, i.e., measures for the elimination of land fragmentation and other deficiencies of territorial arrangement, is going to increase more and more. The concept of land consolidation is new in Latvia. Its main tasks are to eliminate land fragmentation and to facilitate farms of optimal size. One of the most important preconditions of land consolidation is the forming of optimal size farmland plots in property and use, and land fragmentation, which has a major impact on both the operating conditions and other rural development processes. Land fragmentation disturbs not only land management, but it also increases transport costs. Having considered the foreign experience, we can draw a conclusion that land consolidation is very important for the development of agriculture. It can be used as a high-performance tool for rural development. Land consolidation creates preconditions for competitive agricultural production, enabling to manage larger and better located lands with less separated plots.";"Platonova, D., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia).

Multi-temporal remote sensing data of the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper were collected and processed to detect the land cover changes and development of cultivations within the two areas. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model were hydrologically processed to delineate the catchment morphometrical parameters and to examine the spatial distribution of cultivated fields and their relation to the extracted drainage networks. The fluvial channels of the Farafra Oasis have largely been obliterated by the prevailing aridity and often buried under aeolian deposits. The soil of these areas are mainly lithic with a high calcium carbonate content, thus limiting the downward percolation of excess irrigation water and therefore develop perched water table and seepage through the buried fluvial channels. On the other hand, the cultivations of Tabuk catchment (which has similar geomorphologic setting to the Farafra Oasis) have shown no signs for waterlogging. This situation is could be related to the different soil properties; the spatial distribution of cultivated areas and the adopted irrigation methods via pivots. The inactive alluvial channels, landforms and irrigation methods have to be considered when planning for a new cultivation in dry land catchments to better control waterlogging hazard. The ‘dry-drainage’ concept can be implemented as the drainage and seepage water, which can be conveyed into certain abandoned playas for evaporation.";"El Bastawesy, Mohammed

Perspectives are still evolving on factors underlying the variability and uncertainty. Debate includes the ways of reducing emissions through rewetting, reforestation and agroforestry. A knowledge value-chain that is long and complex links (a) fundamental understanding of peat and peatland processes leading to sciencebased quantification and default values, (b) willingness and (c) ability to act towards emission reduction, and ultimately (d) to local, national and global actions that effectively provide rules, incentives and motivation to conserve peat and reduce emissions. We discuss this value chain, its stakeholders and issues that still remain partially unresolved. We conclude that, to shorten the denial and conspiracy-theory stages of debate that otherwise slow down steps B and C, networks of international and national scientists have to be involved at the early stage of identifying policysensitive environmental issues. Models span part of the knowledge value-chain but transition of analysis units requires specific attention, from soil volumes through area and commodity flows to opportunities for reductions. While drainage of peatlands triggers landscape-scale increases in emissions, factors beyond drainage depth, including nutrient supply, may have a major influence on decomposition rates. Attempts to disentangle the contributions of plant and peat-based respiration in surface flux measurements involve assumptions that cannot be easily verified in comparisons between land uses. With progress on A leading to new internationally accepted defaults and with resistance on step B reduced, the reality of C and lack of working solutions for D is currently constraining further progress.";"van Noordwijk, Meine

A survey of day-to-day activities was conducted in two representative counties: Taoyuan and Taihe. Daily nitrogen intake from food per capita and potential nitrogen load from human waste on the environment were calculated. The former in Taoyuan and Taihe was 17.0 and 16.0gN, respectively. In Taoyaun and Taihe, 26% and 67% of human waste, respectively, were utilized or returned to agricultural lands, while 74% and 33%, respectively, were discharged into rivers. Therefore, regarding the annual potential nitrogen load from human waste in Taoyuan, approximately 1.61 and 4.58kgN per capita is returned to farmlands and directly discharged into rivers, respectively. Similarly, in Taihe, approximately 3.91 and 1.93kgN per capita is returned to farmlands and directly discharged into rivers, respectively, annually. The impact of changing human behavior patterns on nitrogen flow was examined using a nitrogen flow model that incorporates both food production and consumption processes. The results of economic growth and urbanization were as follows: (1) increased consumption of animal-derived products in rural areas, which increases the importance of these products compared to crop products and (2) less use of organic recyclables such as disposed human waste, which makes rural communities more dependent on chemical fertilizers and imported animal feeds. China is facing serious water pollution problems; therefore, organic matter recycling within communities requires reconsideration.";"Liu, Chen

The factor maps were digitized, converted to raster data and overlaid to determine their possible spatial relationships. Applying a susceptibility model, a map of sand encroachment susceptibility in Kuwait was developed.

"AGRIS:US201400082036";"role of landscape structure in determining palynological and floristic richness";"";"The associations between floristic and palynological richness and landscape structure were studied based on modern pollen–vegetation data from a patchy cultural landscape in southern Estonia (northern temperate vegetation zone). Nine study sites (small lakes and their surrounding vegetation) represent land cover gradient from closed forest to semi-open vegetation. Floristic richness (number of species) and floristic richness of pollen types (number of pollen-equivalent taxa) were used to describe the vegetation within the radius of 250 m from the pollen sampling sites. Palynological richness was calculated to describe the modern pollen samples diversity. Landscape structure was estimated on the basis of landscape openness and three landscape diversity measures: richness of community patches, Simpson evenness of community patches and Simpson diversity of community patches. To study the effect of the spatial scale of landscapes on the vegetation–landscape and pollen–landscape associations, landscape structure was estimated within eight radii (250–2,000 m) around each lake. The results showed that landscape openness was the most important determinant of both floristic richness and palynological richness in southern Estonia and that landscape diversity estimated by Simpson diversity index was also significantly associated with the richness estimates. Floristic and palynological richness were significantly positively correlated with landscape structure within the radii greater than 1,000 m from the pollen sampling sites, which is similar to the estimated Relevant Source Area of Pollen in southern Estonia. We conclude that within one floristic or climatic region, palynological richness gives reliable estimates about the variation in floristic richness and landscape structure; however, caution must be taken when comparing pollen-inferred vegetation diversities from different regions or when interpreting fossil pollen records from times with highly different vegetation associations.";"Meltsov, Vivika

Field margins were sown with either tussock grass and forbs, fine grass and forbs or grass only seed mixtures. After an establishment year, field margins were managed using standard sward cuts, scarification, or graminicide application. For predatory beetles, overall density was greatest where tussock grasses were included within the seed mixtures, while the densities of phytophagous beetles were greatest where forbs were present. Unexpectedly, species rarefaction curves suggested that phytophagous beetle species richness was greatest where field margins were established using a grass only seed mixture. The structure of the beetle assemblages, i.e., the relative abundances of individual species, was largely dependent on seed mixture, although margin management also played an important role. The results suggest that field margins established using seed mixtures containing tussock grasses and forbs would be expected to provide the greatest resources for beetles, at least at local scales. However, the use of a single standardised seed mixture for margin establishment would result in a homogenisation of beetle assemblages at a regional scale.";"Woodcock, Ben A.

"AGRIS:US201300874016";"Validation of plant diversity indicators in semi-natural grasslands";"";"The use of plant biodiversity indicators in a nationwide survey of semi-natural grasslands in Sweden was examined by comparing results from the survey with additional in-depth studies of plant diversity at the same 30 sites in southern Sweden. Additional grasslands, that were not subjected to the nationwide survey (i.e. rejected after an initial site selection), were also investigated in order to examine the quality of the initial site selection and to assess to what extent they harboured species rich plant communities. Results showed that grasslands that were not included in the nationwide survey were generally smaller in size and that they contained significantly lower plant diversity than sites that were included by the survey. However, some indicator species, including indicators for poor management, were abundant in both types of sites. Biodiversity indicators correctly indicated both plant species richness and plant species density when using data from the in-depth study. However, by comparing indicator species found by the nationwide survey and by the in-depth study, it was shown that the survey overlooked 42% of all indicator species occurrences, which removed the significant relationship between indicator richness and total plant species richness. Furthermore, a null model showed that the chosen indicator species did not perform significantly better than species chosen at random from the available species pool. The conclusion was that validation of indicators is crucial, because even though real correlations exist between taxa or between a subset of species and overall diversity, poor precision of surveys might make these indicators useless. This also suggests that the effort put into searching for the indicator species may have to be so high, that it may be more efficient to go directly into assessing the biological values they are supposed to indicate.";"Öster, Mathias

"AGRIS:US201600186856";"Land ownership patterns associated with declining forest birds: targeting the right policy and management for the right birds";"";"For over a century the foundation of biological conservation has been the development of open space networks either through outright public land acquisition or appropriate management of private lands. Because both approaches come with significant trade-offs, it is critical to understand which species are found across various land ownership types so that policy tools and management actions can efficiently be targeted to do the most good. In this paper, presence-only biological data were used to create species distribution maps for 18 imperilled forest bird species that breed within the deciduous forests of New Jersey (USA). These maps, combined with publicly available, spatially explicit information on land ownership, document who owns the habitat relied on by each of these 18 species. There were significant variations in both species- and guild-specific reliance on public versus private lands, with the latter preferentially supporting nearly twice as many species as the former. Subcategories of land ownership provided support for the role of both state-owned forests and privately-owned agricultural lands in forest bird conservation; however, each landownership type supports a distinct set of species. While explicitly recognizing the need to employ diverse conservation strategies, the approach provides a solid framework for structuring forest conservation planning and policy at regional scales.";"MASLO, BROOKE

The Integrated Coastal Area Management (ICAM) concept developed under the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) includes solutions towards the sustainable use of coastal areas in the Mediterranean Region. Antalya is the province of Turkey with the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Sea. Side- Manavgat coasts of the province are privileged areas with their natural beaches, sand dune forests, rivers and natural and historical relic sites. In this study, land use changes in the area from the 1980s when the tourism developments started was investigated. A number of problems coming from the inefficient planning and management practices were determined in the region. The facts that the coastal identity and ecosystems of the area were not sufficiently dealt with in the planning stage, and that the environmental master plans were not produced for a long time, and that the construction density was increased by the revision plans, were the main reasons of actual problems of the study area. Some planning and management recommendations for Side-Manavgat coasts were given within the framework of integrated coastal area planning and management approach.

In particular, recovery of anthropogenic soils (mainly human-derived artefacts from housing construction and other inert materials or topsoil of terminal phase municipal landfills) cannot rely on spontaneous processes and low-cost/low-impact strategies are needed to prevent desertification. Mediterranean wild legume shrubs have great potential for soil recovery and conservation against desertification, thanks to drought resistance, and their symbiosis with N₂-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this study double inoculated autochthonous wild legume shrubs (the genistea Spartium junceum L. and the thermopsidea Anagyris foetida L.) were used in a long-term trial to recover an anthropogenic hill in a semi-arid site of southern Italy, mainly composed of inert and human-derived artefacts. Microbial inoculants strongly enhanced plant establishment and growth on the anthropogenic soil in the greenhouse and in the field up to two years. Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) and bacterial cultivation revealed a dramatic effect of the tripartite symbiosis on the structure of soil bacterial communities that largely overcomes plant species effect and suggests synergism of AMF with the bacterial community of the mycorhizosphere. Our results demonstrate that microsymbiont inoculation on wild legume shrubs is a promising strategy to rehabilitate anthropogenic soils in Mediterranean semi-arid regions.";"Cardinale, Massimiliano

Además, se contrasta en concreto el papel jugado por la concentración parcelaria, la principal medida de reforma de estructuras agrarias aplicada en la agricultura de estas regiones durante las últimas décadas.Los datos empleados se refieren al período 1985-1999 y a una muestrade 458 explotaciones con ganado bovino (activas en 1999) sobre una población de 1.420 unidades productivas  situadas en la Comarca Interior de la provincia de A Coruña. De esas unidades productivas, 46 dejaron de producir leche para reconvertirse a carne en el período estudiado, manteniéndose el resto dedicadas a la producción láctea durante todo el período. Los resultados indican que el abandono de la leche está relacionado de forma positiva con la edad del titular, mientras que otras variables que afectan al  proceso de forma negativa son: la superficie total de la explotación, la producción media por vaca y la superficie media por parcela al inicio del período, la existencia de sucesión y el número de personas de la familia que trabajan fuera de la explotación. En cambio, el hecho de haberse realizado la concentración parcelaria no tiene influencia directa en el proceso de abandono de la producción lechera.TITLE: Analysis of the determinant factors affecting changes from dairy to cattle production in the Cantabrian Coast: Empirical analysis for an inland area of Galicia.SUMMARY This paper analyzes the factors that contribute to changes in farming specialization, and it assesses the importance of such factors in the occurred transformations fromdairy to cattle farms in Northern Spain.  In line with this objective, we examine the role played on this process by the farms´ characteristics as well as farmers´ socio-economic factors. Furthermore, we asses the role played by public land consolidation policies, which were the main structural policies applied in this area during the last decades.  Our data came from a representative sample of 458 livestock farms (active in 1999) in the province of A Coruña, during the period 1985-1999.  From the total, 46 farms switched their productive orientationquitting dairy and entering into cattle production during the period of study. The rest kept their dairy specialization.  Results indicate that dairy exit is positively related to farmer's age. At the same time, it is negatively related to the following variables: dairy production per cow, total land, the existence of heirs, and the amount of family members working outside the farm.  Furthermore, the fact that the farm had been involved in a land consolidation process did not have any direct effect on this change of productive orientation.";"Alvarez, Alfonso Ribas

"AGRIS:US2016201435";"Democracy, Property Rights, Income Equality, and Corruption";"";"This paper presents theoretical and empirical evidence on the nexus between corruption and democracy. We establish a political economy model where the effect of democracy on corruption is conditional on income distribution and property rights protection. Our empirical analysis with cross-national panel data provides evidence that is consistent with the theoretical prediction. Moreover, the effect of democratization on corruption depends on the protection of property rights and income equality which shows that corruption is a nonlinear function of these variables. The results indicate that democracy will work better as a control of corruption if the property rights system works and there is a low level of income inequality. On the other hand if property rights are not secured and there is strong income inequality, democracy may even lead to an increase of corruption. In addition, property rights protection and the mitigation of income inequality contribute in a strong manner to the reduction of corruption.";"Dong, Bin

These are the costs associated with project operation and maintenance (O&M). As is well documented in the literature many developing countries have neglected project O&M which has resulted in a rapid depreciation of past irrigation investments (Carruthers, 1981). Irrigation systems fail to irrigate their planned or projected command areas and after a few years parts of the systems no longer function (Wade, 1975). The problem is that there are too few farmer or government agency incentives which foster investment of capital and human resources in O&M and assure that irrigation projects operate at a high level of performance over a long period of time. For example, there is lack of accountability for O&M because of the weak linkage between those providing O&M and those benefiting from O&M.";"Easter, K.

The information about its productivity is still scarce, which makes it difficult for foresters and landowners to take decisions about the best practices to maintain and/or improve the goods and services derived from the forest. The aim of this study was to construct dominant tree height functions and site index curves for secondary forests of Nothofagus dombeyi (coihue) in south-central Chile. We measured 100 sample units throughout three edaphoclimatic zones, and 300 dominant trees (three per plot) were used for stem analysis. Three non-linear growth models (Chapman–Richards, Weibull and Logistic) were fitted, and the best model for each edaphoclimatic zone corresponded to Chapman–Richards. In addition, it was determined that for each zone it was necessary to obtain a given growth model given the high variability of sites. The best tree height growth corresponded with zone 2, followed by zone 1 and zone 3. In zone 2 trees reach 31 m at age 60, 29 m in zone 1, and 24 m in zone 3, indicating variation in growth patterns and differences between zones. We recommend using the models for a range of ages between 10 and 60 years (base age 35 years). This is the first large-scale study describing growth of N. dombeyi for the southern part of South America in secondary forests where they occur as one of the most important, but least managed, forest resources in the region.";"Esse, Carlos

The objective of this study was to assess the long‐term effects of tillage, fertilizer application and crop rotation on SOC in an agricultural area of southern Norway, where a soil fertility and crop rotation experiment was initiated in 1953 and a second experiment on tillage practices was initiated in 1983. The first experiment comprised 6‐yr crop rotations with cereals only and 2‐yr cereal and 4‐yr grass rotations with recommended (base) and more than the recommended (above base) fertilizer application rates; the second experiment dealt with autumn‐ploughed (conventional‐till) plots and direct‐drilled plots (no‐till). Soil samples at 0–10 and 10–30 cm depths were collected in autumn 2009 and analysed for their C and N contents. The quality of SOM in the top layer was determined by ¹³C solid‐state NMR spectroscopy. The SOC stock did not differ significantly because of rotation or fertilizer application types, even after 56 yr. However, the no‐till system showed a significantly higher SOC stock than the conventional‐till system at the 0–10 cm depth after the 26 yr of experiment, but it was not significantly different at the 10–30 cm depth. In terms of quality, SOM was found to differ by tillage type, rate of fertilizer application and crop rotation. The no‐till system showed an abundance of O‐alkyl C, while conventional‐till system indicated an apparently indirect enrichment in alkyl C, suggesting a more advanced stage of SOM decomposition. The long‐term quantitative and qualitative effects on SOM suggest that adopting a no‐tillage system and including grass in crop rotation and farmyard manure in fertilizer application may contribute to preserve soil fertility and mitigate climate change.";"Shrestha, B.

"AGRIS:US201500212180";"Assessment of the FAO traditional land evaluation methods, A case study: Iranian Land Classification method";"";"Land evaluation is a critical step in land‐use planning. Although many methods have been developed since the formulation of the FAO framework for land evaluation, several of the more traditional approaches still remain in widespread use but have not been adequately evaluated. Contrary to more recent land evaluation systems, which need considerable data, these systems only require basic soil and landscape information to provide a general view of land suitability for major types of land use. As the FAO initially presented its qualitative framework for land‐use planning, based on two previous methods developed in Iran and Brazil, in this study we assessed the reliability and accuracy of a traditional land evaluation method used in Iran, called land classification for irrigation (LCI), comparing its results with several qualitative and quantitative methods and actual yield values. The results showed that, although simpler than more recently developed methods, LCI provided reliable land suitability classes and also showed good relationships both with other methods analysed and with actual yields. Comparisons between qualitative and quantitative methods produced similar results for common crops (a barley–alfalfa–wheat–fallow rotation). However, these methods performed differently for opportunist crops (such as alfalfa) that are more dependent on income and market conditions than on land characteristics. In this work, we also suggest that using the FAO method to indicate LCI subclasses could help users or managers to recognize limitations for land‐use planning.";"Bagheri Bodaghabadi, M.

"AGRIS:US201500212181";"Phosphorus availability and farm structural factors: examining scarcity and oversupply in north‐east Germany";"";"Assessing factors influencing phosphorus (P) availability in soils is important in preventing its overexploitation and excessive application in agricultural systems. Despite high historical P applications in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany), county data on soil test P (STP) reveal considerable disparities in soil available P. In addition, negative soil balances as a result of small mineral P and manure inputs have been observed, raising questions about the factors leading to this situation. Our work focused on identifying possible causes operating at the farm management level by conducting a letter survey in two administrative districts of Brandenburg, the counties Barnim and Uckermark, linking farm management factors (ownership type, farm size, land tenure, animal husbandry with or without grassland and its intensity, presence of a biogas plant and organic production) to farmers’ self‐indicated levels of STP. Small‐ to medium‐sized individual farms tended to have (very) high STP, while large partnership farms and companies/cooperatives were sensitive to factors resulting in low STP. Farms with low shares of land ownership, the presence of grassland, extensive cattle farming and stockless organic farming had lower STP. On the other hand, biogas plants, partly in combination with intensive livestock (cattle) farming, were associated with larger STP. It was concluded that more care should be devoted to the design of agricultural policies and that further (inter‐ and transdisciplinary) research on this topic is needed.";"Theobald, T. F. H.

This study compares the two existing cloud mask products available for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), stored in the quality layer of the MOD09 daily surface reflectance product. For both masks, statistics on cloud occurrence are calculated for 1 year of daily surface reflectance data covering the area of southeast Asia. Furthermore, a cloud mask enhancement algorithm is presented for increasing cloud flag reliability by effectively combining the existing cloud labels together with the utilization of annual statistics based on the blue reflectance band. Furthermore, since a lot of compositing algorithms rely on cloud mask information for the filtering of unsuitable observations, the influence of the different cloud masks on 8-day MOD09A1 composite outputs is examined with respect to data availability and average view angles. The results of the statistical analysis show that the accuracy of the two cloud mask products differs significantly for southeast Asia. Particularly, the radiative influence of land cover proves to strongly affect the reliability of the cloud flags, although to varying degrees throughout the year. The enhancement algorithm successfully identifies undetected clear observations in the original masks while simultaneously setting upper limits for atmospheric contamination. In this manner, considerably higher proportions of cloud-free observations can be retained compared to a clear-sky conservative combination of the masks as applied in other compositing algorithms.";"Leinenkugel, Patrick

"AGRIS:US201400147257";"Water Right Prices in the Rio Grande: Analysis and Policy Implications";"";"Climate change, water supply limits, growing environmental values of water and worldwide population growth continue to raise the scarcity of water. These challenges have intensified the transfer of water from farms to cities. Water right transfers are an important international institution to stretch water supplies. In North America's Rio Grande Basin water right transfers are an especially important institution for meeting the growth in urban demands. Despite the importance of water right transfers as a social institution, sellers face uncertainty on the asking price, while buyers face similar uncertainty on the offer price. Weak information on water right prices stymies water transfers while limiting the future resilience of water transfers to address climate change and the need to cope with change in water supplies and demands. This paper describes the development of a database on water right prices using observed transactions from 1980 to 2007. An empirical model was developed using the data to identify important factors influencing those prices. Five water right price predictors were found to be significant: total regional urban water use, priority date of the water right, quantity of water rights offered for sale, regional reservoir storage volume, and regional farm income. Depending on the future status of food scarcity and urban water conservation programmes, water right prices in the basin could grow from zero to 27% over 2010–2020.";"De Mouche, Leeann

"AGRIS:US201500211972";"ecological impact of city lighting scenarios: exploring gap crossing thresholds for urban bats";"";"As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps.";"Hale, James D.

The research leads to the conclusion that the part of personal income tax deductions in local government budgets should be gradually increased up to 100% determining the personal income tax as local government tax thereafter. This could enhance the possibility to increase the financial independency and to strengthen the income base of local governments. The issue on the distribution of personal income tax by a place of work and not by a place of residence shall be solved in the future, thus, prescribing that the personal income tax is transferred to the budget of that local government in which territory the workplace is located. The immovable property tax should be determined as local government tax and the tax autonomy of local governments should be expanded through the possibilities to define taxable items and rates, and to plan the immovable property tax revenues. Since the promotion of economic performance in its administrative territory is one of the autonomous functions of local governments, it could be reasonable to link the local government budget with some of taxes (for example, corporate income tax), which are closely related with the economic performance. The expansion and diversification of taxes transferable to local government budgets would increase the level of financial autonomy, stability, and legal capacity of every local government.";"Stucere, S., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia).

We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban XXX. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.";"SHIMAZAKI, Atsushi

We model an agricultural market where large and small firms first decide whether to leave the market or not; in case of continuing in production the farms compete for getting access to additional land resources in a Vickrey auction. We find that larger farms allocate more additional quantity than small farms; the latter are more likely to leave the market.

"AGRIS:US2016205977";"Econometric Analysis of some Trade Issues for Meat";"";"This paper is based on an econometric model of the New Zealand meat export trade for the period 1990-2003. The model is known as a gravity model because it describes trade flows as being balanced between the respective pull of domestic and importing country size and incomes. The meat trade is characterised by strict hygiene regulations, quota markets and tariff charges in different markets. In addition, meat is not a homogeneous commodity but is characterised by breed, cut and presentation, and differentiated market destinations. An econometric model not only identifies general trends in demand and supply which might already be fairly obvious to the trade preactitioner but it also puts confidence intervals on the economic relationships being observed. We estimate income elasticities of demand, price elasticities, distance factors, tariff rate quota restrictions, and the impact of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Results are available for `all meat’, `beef and veal’ and `lamb’ exports to 9 countries.";"Cao, Kay

"AGRIS:US201400178510";"Utilising a farmer typology to understand farmer behaviour towards water quality management: Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in Scotland";"";"Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) are employed as compulsory instruments to meet standards on EU water quality. Farmers operating in NVZs face a number of restrictions on agricultural activity and a greater requirement for record keeping in relation to timing and quantities of nitrogen inputs used. This paper presents results of a survey into the attitudes and values of farmers within the designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) in Scotland. A typology based on perceptions towards water quality management was developed using factor and cluster analysis techniques. Three types were identified as ‘resistors’, ‘apathists’ and ‘multifunctionalists’. The ‘resistors’ and the ‘multifunctionalists’ had similar approaches to land use management, but then diverged in terms of their perceptions towards the environment, water management and the NVZ regulations in particular. The apathists were indifferent towards the aims of the regulation and to water quality management in general. This was also evidenced by their lack of uptake of voluntary measures for improving water quality. The lack of engagement from the ‘apathists’, which represent around a third of the responses to the survey, is particularly problematic for policy makers. There is a need for greater targeting of information to this farmer type emphasising favourable perceptions which encourage water quality management behaviours.";"Barnes, A. P.

Until recently, planners and policy makers have relied on regulatory ‘command and control’ planning approaches; however, there is growing interest in the use of market-based instruments to address natural resource management issues in complex and highly contested peri-urban environments. Tradable development rights are one type of market-based instrument. While tradable development rights have been used extensively in the United States, their application in Australia has been limited. Yet, in Australia, population growth and development in peri-urban areas is placing extensive pressure on natural resources and productive agricultural lands. These pressures are particularly acute in Australia's fastest growing metropolitan region, South East Queensland. By using a case study approach we explore stakeholder perspectives on the value of this tool to protect peri-urban landscape values. Whilst current planner and stakeholder perspectives suggest there is considerable support, there are substantial political, institutional, knowledge, resource and legislative barriers that need to be overcome before this tool can be a viable, realistic and acceptable option for land use planning in peri-urban regions such as South East Queensland.";"Harman, Ben

"AGRIS:US201301622190";"Remote sensing and forest inventory for wildlife habitat assessment";"";"Researchers and managers undertaking wildlife habitat assessments commonly require spatially explicit environmental map layers such as those derived from forest inventory and remote sensing. However, end users of geospatial products must often make choices regarding the source and level of detail required for characterizing habitat elements, with few published resources available for guidance. We appraised three environmental data sources that represent options often available to researchers and managers in wildlife ecological studies: (i) a pre-existing forest inventory; (ii) a general-purpose, single-attribute remote sensing land cover map; and (iii) a specific-purpose, multi-attribute remote sensing database. The three information sources were evaluated with two complementary analyses: the first designed to appraise levels of map quality (assessed on the basis of accuracy, vagueness, completion, consistency, level of measurement, and detail) and the second designed to assess their relative capacity to explain patterns of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) telemetry locations across a 100,000-km² study area in west-central Alberta, Canada. We found the forest inventory database to be reasonably functional in its ability to support resource selection analysis in regions where coverage was available, but overall, the data suffered from quality issues related to completeness accuracy, and consistency. The general-purpose remote sensing land cover product ranked higher in terms of overall map quality, but demonstrated a lower capacity for explaining observed patterns of grizzly bear habitat use. We found the best results using the specific-purpose, multi-attribute remote sensing database, and recommend that similar information sources be used as the foundation for wildlife habitat studies whenever possible, particularly those involving large areas that span jurisdictional boundaries.";"McDermid, G.J.

"AGRIS:US201301855553";"Assessing the impact of Entry Level Stewardship on lowland farmland birds in England";"";"Agri-environment schemes (AES) are central to the conservation of Europe's farmland biodiversity. The UK Government's Public Service Agreement target seeks to reverse the decline of farmland birds in England by 2020 through the use of AES. The Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) scheme, introduced in 2005, is the first non-competitive, broad-uptake stewardship scheme designed to deliver simple but effective environmental management on farms throughout England. Approximately 5 million hectares of farmland are currently entered into Environmental Stewardship (ES) agreements, and given the scale of this investment it is important to verify the efficacy of ELS as a mechanism for delivering biodiversity benefits. We used spatially referenced ES agreement data to assess the influence of specific management options and combinations of options on farmland bird population changes between 2005 and 2008 derived from standardized surveys carried out on over 2000 lowland farmland 1-km squares in England. The results showed only limited evidence for short-term effects of ES. Only Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra and Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris showed some landscape-specific positive associations with area under ELS management. There was also limited evidence for positive associations between specific management options and the population changes of the species at which they were aimed. The current pattern of option uptake may be limiting benefits of ELS, with boundary management accounting for over 50% of scheme compensation value. However, the time required for option maturation and the time lags in bird population responses to environmental change mean that it is too early to reach definitive conclusions about the success or failure of the scheme. The findings of this study will assist in the development of ELS by feeding into the 5-year review scheduled for 2010 and have implications for the development of similar schemes elsewhere in Europe.";"DAVEY, CATHERINE M.

A tanulmány Magyarországon képződő szőlővenyige és fanyesedék biomassza-erőművi beszállításának lehetőségeivel foglalkozik. 2009-ben már öt hazai nagyerőműben tüzelnek a környező erdőgazdaságokból származó alapanyagot. Magyarországon rendkívül sok az energetikai célra hasznosítható szőlővenyige és fanyesedék, ami nem kerül hasznosításra, holott ezek erőművi beszállítása – számításaink alapján – 45 km-es szállítási távolság alatt már gazdaságos lehet. A tanulmány hangsúlyozza, hogy az említett melléktermékek erőművi eltüzelése – csekély jövedelemtermelő képessége miatt – jövedelemszerzés helyett inkább a „felesleges” melléktermékektől való megszabadulást, az elhelyezési és megsemmisítési problémák megoldását jelenti, mely költségcsökkenést eredményezhet az egyes gazdaságokban. A szerzők megállapítása szerint a biomasszát mint mellékterméket hasznosító gazdák és települések összefogása ez esetben is elengedhetetlen az erőművekkel szembeni megfelelő alkupozíció kiharcolásához.  ------------------------------------------   The production of electricity from biomass is spreading in Hungary as well. This paper looks at the possibilities of supplying vine cane and wood cuttings produced in Hungary to biomass power plants. In 2009, five large Hungarian power plants already use raw material from the nearby managed forests. An extremely large quantity of vine cane and wood cuttings are produced in Hungary which are suitable – but not used – for electricity production, even though our calculations indicate that such supply could be economical if the distance to cover is less than 45 km. Our paper points out that as burning such by-products in a power plant has little potential for profitability, such use could instead serve to enable farms to get rid of the ‘surplus’ by-products and to resolve issues of disposal and destruction. Some farms could achieve a reduction of their costs this way. The authors have found that cooperation between farmers and communities utilising biomass as a by-product is again essential if they are to step up as a viable negotiating partner of the power plants.";"Pinter, Gabor

Land cover patches were mapped and analysed at three time periods (1954, 1980 and 2008). Changes over time were detected by analysing a combination of multitemporal source data from airborne images and from field surveys. Relationships between cover classes and environmental variables were analysed for the year 2008. Grasslands and scrublands (corresponding to the Natura 2000 Habitats 6210 and 5130, respectively) were found to be the most threatened communities; they occupy small portions of the studied area and are subject to a marked dynamic towards the higher stages of the vegetation successions including a mesophilous and a thermophilous succession. The ability to estimate persistence times and evolution trends of vegetation types following land abandonment is an important tool in land management. Our combined approach yielded a good picture of the vegetation involved in biodiversity loss consequent to land abandonment, as well as estimation of the expected time for this loss to occur.";"Assini, S.

"AGRIS:US201301916397";"Applying ecologically based invasive-plant management";"";"The need for a unified mechanistic ecological framework that improves our ability to make decisions, predicts vegetation change, guides the implementation of restoration, and fosters learning is substantial and unmet. It is becoming increasingly clear that integrating various types of ecological models into an overall framework has great promise for assisting decision making in invasive-plant management and restoration. Overcoming barriers to adoption of ecologically based invasive-plant management will require developing principles and integrating them into a useful format so land managers can easily understand the linkages among ecological processes, vegetation dynamics, management practices, and assessment. We have amended a generally accepted and well-tested successional management framework into a comprehensive decision tool for ecologically based invasive-plant management (EBIPM) by 1) using the Rangeland Health Assessment to identify ecological processes in need of repair, 2) amending our framework to include principles for repairing ecological processes that direct vegetation dynamics, and 3) incorporating adaptive management procedures to foster the acquisition of new information during management. This decision tool provides a step-by-step planning process that integrates assessment and adaptive management with process-based principles to provide management guidance. In our case-study example, EBIPM increased the chance of restoration success by 66% over traditionally applied integrated weed management in an invasive-plant–dominated ephemeral wetland ecosystem. We believe that this framework provides the basis for EBIPM and will enhance our ability to design and implement sustainable invasive-plant management and restoration programs.";"Sheley, R.

Given the complexity of the decision-making, there is a need for Internet-based decision support systems with scenario evaluation capabilities to help planners, resource managers and communities visualize, compare and consider trade-offs among the many values at stake in land use planning. This article presents details on an Ecosystem Portfolio Model (EPM) prototype that integrates ecological, socio-economic information and associated values of relevance to decision-makers and stakeholders. The EPM uses a multi-criteria scenario evaluation framework, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis and spatially-explicit land-use/land-cover change-sensitive models to characterize changes in important land-cover related ecosystem values related to ecosystem services and functions, land parcel prices, and community quality-of-life (QoL) metrics. Parameters in the underlying models can be modified through the interface, allowing users in a facilitated group setting to explore simultaneously issues of scientific uncertainty and divergence in the preferences of stakeholders. One application of the South Florida EPM prototype reported in this article shows the modeled changes (which are significant) in aggregate ecological value, landscape patterns and fragmentation, biodiversity potential and ecological restoration potential for current land uses compared to the 2050 land-use scenario. Ongoing refinements to EPM, and future work especially in regard to modifiable sea level rise scenarios are also discussed.";"Labiosa, W.B.

"AGRIS:US201600195488";"allocation and management of critical resources in rural China under restructuring: Problems and prospects";"";"Rapid and far-reaching development transition has triggered corresponding restructuring in rural China especially since the turn of the new millennium. Recently, there has been an increasing trend emphasizing regional resources in formulating rural development policy and restructuring rural areas. This paper analyzes the rural restructuring in China affected by the allocation and management of critical resources including human resource, land resource and capital, by establishing a theoretical framework of âelements-structure-functionâ of rural territorial system. It is argued that rural restructuring is a process of optimizing the allocation and management of the material and non-material elements affecting the development of rural areas and accomplishing the structure optimization and the function maximum of rural development system. Due to the constraints from the maintained urbanârural dualism of land ownership and household registration, the rapid rural restructuring under both globalization and the implementation of the national strategies on industrialization, urbanization, informatization and agricultural modernization, the changes of the allocation of critical resources have brought about many problems and challenges for the future development of rural China, such as the nonagriculturalization, non-grain preference and abandonment of farmland use together with the derelict and idle rural housing land, the weakening mainbody of rural development, the unfair urbanârural allocation of capital and its structural imbalance, and so on. Aiming at how to resolve the problems and adapt to the challenges, it is pivotal to restructure the rural development space, rural industry, and rural social organization and management mainbody. Furthermore, it is necessary to restructure the contours of state intervention in rural societies and economies and allocate and manage the critical resources affecting rural development, from the perspectives of integrating urban and rural resources, improving the efficiency of resources utilization, and fully understanding the influences of globalization on rural restructuring in China.";"Long, Hualou

"AGRIS:US201500082844";"Effects of forest certification on the ecological condition of Mediterranean streams";"";"Forest certification, a proxy for sustainable forest management, covers more than 10% of the world's forests. Under forest certification, forest managers and landowners must comply with environmental, economic and social management standards aiming to promote forest conservation. Despite an increasing area of certified forests, there is a dearth of data on how forest certification is affecting the conservation of forest ecosystems and associated habitats. Here, we assess the effects of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, one of the largest certification schemes in the world, on the ecological condition of streams crossing Mediterranean evergreen oak woodlands. We used the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP) to compare the ecological condition of streams located in areas with 3 and 5 years of certification, in non‐certified areas and in least disturbed streams. Forest certification positively affected the ecological condition of the surveyed streams, but its effects were only measurable after 5 years of certification. Streams with 5 years of certification had more continuous, dense and diverse riparian vegetation when compared to streams located in non‐certified areas. Moreover, the condition of streams located in areas with 5 years of forest certification was similar to the condition of least disturbed streams. Synthesis and applications. Forest certification promotes the ecological condition of streams occurring within Mediterranean evergreen oak woodlands. This mainly happens because in areas under forest certification, managers and landowners have to comply with management practices that require them to remove or reduce the main causes for stream degradation, allowing riparian habitats to recover. Within landscapes with large and increasing areas under forest certification, such as the Mediterranean cork oak woodlands, the positive effects of certification on the ecological condition of streams may spread across the hydrographic network in the medium to long term.";"Dias, Filipe S.

Impacts of forest plantations on biodiversity are controversial; forest plantations could positively influence biodiversity by producing a buffer zone between native forests and agriculture, while replacement of native forests with plantations could reduce biodiversity. Chile is one of the main producers of wood worldwide, and production is largely based on intensively managed monocultures of exotic tree species. Only a few studies have looked at the effects of forestry plantations on biodiversity in Chile, mainly focusing on pine plantations. The aim of this study was to characterize habitat use and richness of bats between native forests, eucalyptus plantations and grasslands in a biodiversity hotspot in southern Chile to determine how land use affects an important mammalian taxa. We found no difference in use or richness of bats in eucalyptus plantations versus native forests. Regional context within the larger Valdivian watershed (Andes, central valley, coastal range) had a stronger influence on bat activity and richness than land use type (native forest, plantation, grassland), with the Andean region being the most diverse and where most bat activity is concentrated. Our results suggest that the composition and structure of the surrounding landscape mosaic may be fundamental to determine the impacts of forestry and human land use on biodiversity.";"Meynard, Christine N.

Microbial community structure was examined by analyzing the distribution of total and labile organic matter, the size of bacterial and fungal populations, and bacterial metabolic fingerprints and fungal genetic fingerprints. Results showed a gradual positive increase of total microbial biomass between the intensive management reference site and the six grassland soils, and that soil organic matter storage is associated with changes in microbial biomass. There was a large increase in fungal and bacterial populations in the permanent grassland, but bacteria were more weakly affected by agricultural management practices than the fungi. Although potential functional diversity shifts in the bacterial community seemed to be related to the ageing grassland gradient, we were not able to highlight any significant difference in bacterial genetic diversity between the sites. There was, however, a strong relationship between fungal genetic diversity and the ageing grassland. Finally, an increase in microbial activities (% mineralization) was observed according to the age of the meadow. Among agricultural management practices, grassland restoration may have a positive impact in maintaining the soil status.";"Plassart, Pierre

"AGRIS:US201301865472";"Changing land use/cover patterns and implications for sustainable environmental management in the Irangi Hills, central Tanzania";"";"This article examines the changes in land-use/cover types in the Irangi Hills, central Tanzania during the last 45 years and how such changes have influenced environmental and agricultural sustainability in the area. The spatial and temporal changes of land-use/cover were analysed through aerial photographs interpretation. Local perceptions and experiences of changes were addressed through household interviews and field observations. Results from this study show that during the last 45 years open and wooded grasslands, and other tree-cover types covered about 40% of the land area, ranging from 29% in 1960 to 43-45% between 1977 and 1992. Also, during the same period both the total area and spatial distribution of cultivated fields varied greatly. The cultivated area increased from 31% in 1977 to 35% in 1992, mainly due to agricultural expansion into areas formerly used for grazing and in sandy watercourses that shrunk by 55% between 1977 and 1992. The spatial distribution of the different land-use/cover types is influenced by variations in the scale of soil erosion and soil-conservation initiatives implemented in the Irangi Hills since the early 1970s. However, with increasing pressure on the land, and the declining capacity of the soil conservation authority, sustaining agricultural production in the area remains a major challenge.";"Kangalawe, R.

"AGRIS:US201500220195";"global, remote sensing‐based characterization of terrestrial habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and ecosystem modelling";"";"AIM: Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a key landscape characteristic determining biodiversity patterns. However, a lack of standardized, large‐scale, high‐resolution and temporally updatable heterogeneity information based on direct observations has limited our understanding of this connection and its effective use for biodiversity conservation. To address this, we develop here remote sensing‐based metrics to characterize global habitat heterogeneity at 1‐km resolution and assess their value for biodiversity modelling. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: We develop 14 heterogeneity metrics (available at http://www.earthenv.org) based on the textural features of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and closely examine a complementary core set of six of these metrics. We evaluate their ability to provide fine‐grain habitat heterogeneity by comparing the heterogeneity information captured by them with that measured by 30‐m Landsat‐based land‐cover data. Using spatial autoregressive models, we then compare their utility with that of more conventional metrics (derived from topography or categorical land‐cover data) for modelling the species richness of bird communities across the conterminous United States based on Breeding Bird Survey data. RESULTS: The newly derived metrics capture different aspects of habitat heterogeneity and provide fine‐grain information for locations deemed homogeneous by traditional land‐cover classifications at both continental and global extents. Most of them strongly exceed conventional heterogeneity variables in capturing the spatial variation in bird species richness, with Homogeneity emerging as the strongest predictor. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This study develops and validates the performance of readily usable metrics of textural measures capturing fine‐grain habitat heterogeneity. The presented metrics outperform conventional measures in capturing detailed spatial variation in habitats and in predicting key biodiversity patterns. They provide a rigorous and comparable basis for understanding heterogeneity–diversity relationships, and offer a powerful tool for monitoring and understanding the responses of biodiversity and ecosystems to the changing environment.";"Tuanmu, Mao‐Ning

"AGRIS:US201500204817";"Optimization of method to quantify soil organic matter dynamics and carbon sequestration potential in volcanic ash soils";"";"Volcanic ash-derived soils are important globally for their C sequestration potential and because they are at risk of compaction and degradation due to land use change. Poorly or non-crystalline minerals impart enormous capacity for soils to store and stabilize C, but also unusual chemical and physical properties that make quantifying meaningful soil C pools challenging. Here, we optimize a soil physical fractionation method to effectively assess soil organic matter dynamics in volcanic ash soils by first comparing three common methods for Andisols of the same soil series under three land uses. Components of those methods that (1) effectively isolated C pools of different size and turnover and (2) demonstrated potential sensitivity to land use change were then modified for a final, combined method. The isolation of C pools corresponding to fundamental mechanisms of protection within aggregates and organo-mineral control on the stabilization of C, which often function to the extreme in volcanic ash soils, underlie these modifications. Combined application of ultrasonic energy to disrupt aggregates and the removal of light fractions with sequential high density fractionation successfully isolated multiple C pools that ranged in radiocarbon-based turnover time from 7 to 1,011 year in the surface 0–15 cm of mineral soil in an undisturbed, native forest. Soil C accumulates as a result of high, continuous input that cycles through a transitional (century-scale) organo-mineral pool and then either becomes occluded and protected within aggregates (multiple centuries) or enters a continuum of organo-mineral and non-crystalline mineral-dominated pools (from centuries to millennium-scale). Comparison of relative C pool sizes and C isotope signature among soils from native forest, grazed pasture, and managed Eucalyptus plantation revealed the potential for making accurate, direct measurements of soil C change over time with land use and management change or disturbance regime.";"Crow, Susan E.

To facilitate such modelling efforts, a limited number of grassland types were identified using a functional classification of species. These grassland types were characterized by three descriptors required to model herbage growth or feed quality: the abundance-weighted mean leaf dry matter content across grass species, the relative abundance of grasses, and an estimate of species richness. We conducted a multi-site analysis over 749 grasslands from eight temperate regions in France and northern Spain. Using Restricted Maximum Likelihood models, explanatory variables having a significant impact on the descriptors of grassland vegetation were identified. These were management type and nutrients availability described either with an ecological approach based on Ellenberg nutrient indices, or an agronomic approach based on plant nutrition indices. By fixing expert-assigned boundaries along the gradients of management type and nutrients availability, we identified a classification of 3x3 semi-natural grassland types. When compared pairwise with a Kruskal-Wallis test, the identified semi-natural grassland types showed significant differences for vegetation descriptors. The model inputs corresponding to different semi-natural grassland types led to simulated differences in herbage growth and feed quality comparable with the uncertainty on the model output. This confirmed the relevance of the classification based only on nine species-rich semi-natural grassland types easily identifiable on the field to model herbage growth or feed quality.";"Martin, G.

The village landscapes of China's Yangtze Plain are among the most ancient, densely populated and intensively managed in the world and have undergone extremely rapid development in recent decades, causing the wholesale transformation of traditional village landscape structure, primarily at fine spatial scales (< 30m). Here we investigate the causes and consequences of these fine-scale changes, 1942-2002, using a case study of landscape change within a regionally representative sample of village landscapes in Yixing County. High-resolution mapping was coupled with historical data obtained by interviews with elder farmers and archival sources, with uncertainties quantified using Monte Carlo methods. The already dense agricultural populations of 1942 had increased by about 50% by 2002, and this was accompanied by an intensification of land management that caused 53% of land area to undergo a substantial change in landscape class. Paddy area declined by 22% from 1942 to 2002, and this was coupled with an 8% net increase in built surfaces, a 14% increase in aquaculture surface, and most surprisingly, by a 5% net increase in land cover by closed canopy woody vegetation. Most of this change was caused by fine-scale land transformations that fragmented larger managed features into smaller features that incorporated a wider variety of management practices, thereby simultaneously increasing both landscape heterogeneity and complexity. Population growth, agricultural policy changes and market-oriented land management strategies combined to produce these significant long-term agricultural landscape changes. By coupling detailed analysis of fine-scale local landscape transformation processes with land use history across three time periods, this study identified the causes of ecologically significant landscape changes and may also help to indicate future change trends within some of the most densely populated and productive agricultural landscapes in the world.";"Wu, Jun-Xi

We administered a questionnaire to 120 farmers randomly interviewed in the Morni Hill area of the Siwalik Himalayas in India. Our results show that the farmers have considerable knowledge about the implementation of watershed development activities and their impact on the economy, agriculture and the environment. Our respondents generally agreed or strongly agreed with most investigated parameters, with a few exceptions such as employment opportunities in the dairying sector, rise in panchayat funds, milk production, fuel wood availability, grazing lands and use of mechanical inputs in agriculture. Water availability has resulted in a positive change in the cropping pattern, which has shifted to more remunerative crops, such as paddy, pulses, vegetables and high yielding wheat. Approximately 45 % of respondents were highly satisfied with the results of the watershed development activities. The overall level of satisfaction pertaining to different socioeconomic, agriculture and livestock, and environmental parameters was approximately 56 %, which reveals that respondents are well aware of the impacts of the watershed development activities. Therefore, we suggest that farmers’ perceptions could usefully be incorporated into decision-making processes for targeting land and water management interventions.";"Singh, Omvir

"AGRIS:US201600130382";"Legacy of human-induced C erosion and burial on soil–atmosphere C exchange";"";"Carbon exchange associated with accelerated erosion following land cover change is an important component of the global C cycle. In current assessments, however, this component is not accounted for. Here, we integrate the effects of accelerated C erosion across point, hillslope, and catchment scale for the 780-km ² Dijle River catchment over the period 4000 B.C. to A.D. 2000 to demonstrate that accelerated erosion results in a net C sink. We found this long-term C sink to be equivalent to 43% of the eroded C and to have offset 39% (17–66%) of the C emissions due to anthropogenic land cover change since the advent of agriculture. Nevertheless, the erosion-induced C sink strength is limited by a significant loss of buried C in terrestrial depositional stores, which lagged the burial. The time lag between burial and subsequent loss at this study site implies that the C buried in eroded terrestrial deposits during the agricultural expansion of the last 150 y cannot be assumed to be inert to further destabilization, and indeed might become a significant C source. Our analysis exemplifies that accounting for the non–steady-state C dynamics in geomorphic active systems is pertinent to understanding both past and future anthropogenic global change.";"Van Oost, Kristof

Model calibration was done by using SUFI-2 based on monthly river discharge and annual crop yield, where crop yield was used to better estimate the evapotranspiration term, which consequently increased our knowledge on estimating aquifer recharge. The calibration results were satisfactory: The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency ranged from 0.53 to 0.63 for calibration and from 0.42 to 0.72 for validation. The results showed that, although the groundwater level was decreasing about 1 m per year, the groundwater recharge did not change significantly leading to a net withdrawal causing land subsidence over time.";"Rafiei Emam, Ammar

Firstly, this study utilized the USLE model and soil erosion pin data to compare the soil erosion potential of the Chushui and Aiyuzi subwatersheds and concluded that soil erosion drastically increased if accumulated rainfall exceeded 200 mm; also, erosion depths were greater in the Aiyuzi subwatershed while estimated total erosion volume was higher in the Chushui subwatershed; this was attributed to the larger area of Chushui subwatershed and based on field measurements which supported the results of the USLE model. Secondly, this study utilized modified USLE model to compare the extreme event erosion resulting from typhoon Morakot which revealed that high rainfall intensity and long-duration rainfall events can generate large volume non-point sources of sediment that is estimated to far exceed 7–10 times of the annual soil erosion. Thirdly, this study related the C parameter of the USLE model to the existing land use in the Shenmu watershed using current, real data. Finally, this study established a post-typhoon Morakot soil erosion risk map composed of five categories of risk which was compared with post-event land cover to suggest high-erosion risk zones that may require further monitoring, remediation, and engineering measures to limit soil loss.";"Lin, B.

Product validation is ongoing and important for constant product improvement, but few studies have investigated the specific accuracy of MODIS FPAR using in situ measurements and none have focused on agricultural areas. This study therefore presents a validation of the collection 5 MODIS FPAR product in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in western Uzbekistan. High-resolution FPAR maps were compiled via linear regression between in situ FPAR measurements and the RapidEye normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the 2009 season. The data were aggregated to the MODIS scale for comparison. Data on the percentage cover of agricultural crops per MODIS pixel allowed investigation of the impact of spatial heterogeneity on MODIS FPAR accuracy. Overall, the collection 5 MODIS FPAR overestimated RapidEye FPAR between approximately 6% and 15%. MODIS quality flags, the underlying biome classification and spatial heterogeneity were investigated as potential sources of error. MODIS data quality was very good in all cases. A comparison of the MODIS land-cover product with high-resolution land-use classification revealed a significant misclassification by MODIS. Yet, we found that the overestimation of MODIS FPAR is independent of classification accuracy. The results indicate that the amount of background information, present even in the most homogeneous pixels (∼70% crop cover), is most likely the reason for the overestimation. The behaviour of pure pixels could not be investigated due to a lack of appropriate pixels.";"Fritsch, Sebastian

Worldwide land‐use changes involving conversion of vegetation with different photosynthetic pathways (e.g. C₃ and C₄) offer a unique opportunity to quantify SOM decomposition rate and its response to climatic conditions using stable isotope techniques. We synthesized the results from 131 sites (including 87 deforestation observations and 44 reforestation observations) which were compiled from 36 published papers in the literatures as well as our observations in China's Qinling Mountains. Based on the ¹³C natural abundance analysis, we evaluated the dynamics of new and old C in top soil (0–20 cm) following land‐use change and analyzed the relationships between soil organic C (SOC) decomposition rates and climatic factors. We found that SOC decomposition rates increased significantly with mean annual temperature and precipitation in the reforestation sites, and they were not related to any climatic factor in deforestation sites. The mean annual temperature explained 56% of variation in SOC decomposition rates by exponential model (y = 0.0014e⁰.¹³⁹⁵ˣ) in the reforestation sites. The proportion of new soil C increased following deforestation and reforestation, whereas the old soil C showed an opposite trend. The proportion of new soil C exceeded the proportion of old soil C after 45.4 years' reforestation and 43.4 years' deforestation, respectively. The rates of new soil C accumulation increased significantly with mean annual precipitation and temperature in the reforestation sites, yet only significantly increased with mean annual precipitation in the deforestation sites.

"AGRIS:DJ2012065870";"'The Finn line' - a historical curiosity or a juridicial rality? The Sami reindeer herders' land rights in southern Sami areas evaluated from land consolidation practice (In Norwegian with Summary in English)";"";"Attitudes towards the land rights of Sami reindeer herders have changed considerably during the last 100 years. So, too, has consideration of how such rights should be treated by Land Consolidation Courts. This paper reviews changes in attitudes to the Sami land rights with respect to how these are considered in Land Consolidation Courts in southern Sami areas in Norway. The review also considers changing attitudes regarding the competence of Land Consolidation Courts to deal with such matters. There were several cases in the 20th Century in which Land Consolidation Courts treated Sami land rights in a restricted and unfortunate manner. Legal practice, however, was not always like that, evidenced by the so-called 'Finn line' (Norwegian: 'finnelinja' -'Finn' is an archaic name for Sami). This boundary was established during a land consolidation case in 1873 and was confirmed in 1883. At that time, Sami land rights were evidently accepted as appurtenant right in privately owned mountain pasture and the Sami were treated in the same way as others who enjoyed rights of usufruct on it. The regulation of 1883 included rules governing compensation for grazing damage on farming land. In particular, responsibility for grazing damage was divided between owners and the reindeer herders, providing these looked after their animals properly, 'The Finn line' subsequently achieved wider importance. The case of 18731883 has been referred to several times as a valuable and valid precedent for a way in which to organize grazing conflicts in other Sami areas. It was used in 1964 as evidence of the special rights of Sami reindeer people in the Brekken common land case. The Sami won this case in 1968 and, in its judgement, the Norwegian Supreme Court of Justice emphasised the importance of the line (Rt. 1968, p. 394). Although, owing to changes in land use practices, the 'Finn line' no longer has any practical significance, its juridical significance remains because it settles the principle that the rights of Sami reindeer herders' have to be considered in the same way as the rights of farming land owners. The ruling of 1873-1883 makes it clear that reindeer herders stand to gain important concessions, with respect to access to pasture, in land consolidation cases. The degradation of Sami land rights from the end of the 19th Century was a consequence of political manipulation and had no basis in law. Attitudes have now changed and, consequently, there is a need to revise recent legislation, such as the 1978 Reindeer Husbandry Act with regard to rules for compensation for grazing damage on farming land, and the 1979 Land Consolidation Act concerning rules of land use.";"Øyvind Ravna";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-04-19";"";"land consolidation";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012065870";"http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1736";"";"";"";"323-106"
"AGRIS:US2016203074";"ATTITUDES TOWARDS ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR PUBLIC RECREATION LANDS";"";"Public recreation land management agencies have been searching for ways to increase revenue. User fees as implemented by the Fee Demonstration Program have received the most attention. Corporate sponsorships and private donations have also been implemented and other options, such as partial privatization, closure of some areas, and different forms of public-private partnerships have been debated. The present paper reports results from a 2002 mail survey of randomly selected Idaho and New Hampshire households, designed to elicit public attitudes about a wide variety of management policies for public (federal/state) recreation lands. The most socially acceptable forms for raising revenue were donation boxes (61.1%), corporate sponsorships for visitor centers (61.8%) and education facilities (61.1%), and adopt-a-site contracts (81.0%). Both increased taxes and user fees faced greater opposition  (about 49% of respondents) than support (39%). In addition, user fees have resulted in (reported) changes in behavior among a quarter of the respondents, and may have stronger negative impact on low-income households and on the users of public recreation lands. This study is relevant to the current debate in Congress about the future of the Fee Demonstration Program. Our findings can also be used by policy makers interested in raising revenue through socially acceptable management policies. Our results suggest that donations, adopt-a-site and corporate sponsorships (for selected areas) should be used to raise additional revenues, and if additional funding is needed, policy makers may be justified to advocate for increased taxation rather than fees.";"Samnaliev, Mihail

"AGRIS:US201400139458";"Modeling sediment sources and yields in a Pyrenean catchment draining to a large reservoir (Ésera River, Ebro Basin)";"";"PURPOSE: The study aimed to use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate erosion processes in an alpine–prealpine catchment in order to provide data and information that may be relevant for managers so as to minimize reservoir siltation and water quality degradation. The main objective was to assess sediment production across the catchment and sediment supply to the main reservoir. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Barasona reservoir catchment (1,509� km²) is located in the Central Spanish Pyrenees, in the Ebro Basin. This catchment was selected for the case study given the regional significance of the Barasona reservoir and its siltation problems. The catchment has a mountain climate, with strong altitudinal and north–south gradients. The catchment is characterized by heterogeneous topography and lithology, resulting in a varied mosaic of slopes, soil types, and land covers. The Jueu karst system and two small headwater reservoirs were parameterized and calibrated in the model. The SWAT model sediment calibration for the catchment was based on a prior monthly hydrologic calibration, and the model validation was based on the sediment depositional history of the Barasona reservoir. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The simulation period (2003–2006) and the validation period (1993–2002) produced average sediment yields to the reservoir of 643,000 and 575,000� t� year⁻¹, respectively. Large variations in sediment production were found between the subcatchments in the Barasona catchment due to differences in rock outcrops, land cover, and slope gradient. Sediment loss in the Jueu karst system was 15,500� t and the two small headwater reservoirs retained 31,200 and 50,300� t. Sediment production in relation to precipitation showed high temporal variability, with specific sediment yields to the Barasona reservoir ranging from 2.74 to 8.25� t� ha⁻¹� year⁻¹. Strong lithological control was observed for sediment production in the subcatchments. The main sediment sources were located in the badlands developed on marls in the middle part of the catchment (internal depressions). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model has proved useful for identifying areas where significant erosion processes take place in large alpine–prealpine catchments at a regional level and also for assessing discharge losses by the karst system and the sedimentary role of the small reservoirs. The information obtained through this research will be of interest in assessing the spatial distribution of sediment sources and areas of high sediment yield, which will be useful to establish criteria for remediation strategies.";"Palazón, Leticia

Local access to forests has been severely reduced and customary rights restricted as an effect of the national forest zoning plan. Hence, local livelihoods have been negatively affected. Corruption is moreover rampant. This has resulted in a solid majority among local people expressing negative attitudes toward logging companies and the state. Local inhabitants regard NGOs to have a significant potential to ameliorate their relationship with logging companies, while secured user rights was identified as the most significant avenue to improve their relationship with the state. Securing community rights to land and forest resources — including access and use rights to permanent forests/concession areas — come forward as essential for conflict resolution and ensuing local economic and social development.";"Samndong, R.A.

Farms are categorized by geographic region, farm type, farm size, gross cash sales, farm tenure, net farm income, debt-to-asset, and age of farmer to analyze relationships between financial performance and farm characteristics. Farm financial trends for the 1993-2002 period are also presented.Financial performance improved in 2002, except for the west region and livestock farms. Crop farm profit was much higher from strong prices and lower costs, although government payments declined sharply and some west and south central areas suffered drought. Median net farm income was $38,079 in 2002, $27,729 in 2001, and $45,085 in 2000.All 16 financial performance measures declined in 2001, except interest expense ratio, because of lower government subsidies, higher costs and continued low commodity prices. Performance in 2000 and 1999 was the highest since 1993 because of extraordinary government and crop insurance payments, record yields for  some crops and improved beef cattle prices. Performance for the 1993-2002 period was poorest in  1997 and 1998 when over one-half of farms could not make scheduled term debt payments with the year's income.";"Swenson, Andrew L.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016206953";"http://purl.umn.edu/23545";"";"";"";""

While the end to the war in 2002 and the subsequent extraction of natural resources has fueled the country's economic recovery for a minority, for the majority recovery depends less on natural resource extraction than it does on acquiring and maintaining secure access to land and property upon which viable livelihoods can be rebuilt. However the current large scale evictions in urban and peri-urban areas of the country and the resulting acute tenure insecurity is significantly worrying, and is the single most acute land rights, land policy, and political problem in the country. Aspects of the country's constitution and the development of the postwar land law facilitate eviction, and an important opportunity to upgrade postwar informal land rights has been missed.

Eighty-nine elephants were cropped in eight separate hunts during 2009 and 2010 providing 41 tonnes of meat. With adequate air-support, the cropping of family herds was feasibly and humanely conducted by skilled professional hunters. The handling of carcasses and the preservation of large quantities of meat were technically challenging on site. Because of the high demand for fresh meat, the processing facilities to extend meat shelf-life could not be tested. Cropping elephants remains a costly exercise at around US$550 per carcass. Cost recovery is possible with the sale of meat, offal and hides, but in this study was only partially achieved due to mismanagement of product delivery and sale. With 2.3 kg purchased per buyer, the production of meat partially satisfied the local population demand but offered an opportunity to the game meat producers to establish social links with their neighbours. To observe long-term impact on the illegal bushmeat trade currently affecting the SVC we suggest careful monitoring of future harvests.";"Bel, SÃ©bastien Le

"AGRIS:US201300867414";"Potential Outcomes and Consequence of a Proposed Grazing Permit Buyout Program";"";"This study investigated the role that a public land grazing permit buyout would have on ranching operations and conserving private land open space in the Rocky Mountain region of the western United States. Loss of grazing permits could serve as a pivotal factor in expediting private land fragmentation if ranching operations are enticed to sell their land due to loss of economic viability. This type of program inadvertently could be detrimental to overall ecosystem health and have unintended economic, ecological, and cultural consequences for the administering agencies and grazing permittees. The goal of this study was to provide sociodemographic profiles of landowners to better understand social motivations for ranching, implications of permit removal, ongoing conservation activities, and possible policy solutions. We assessed likely participation levels, demographic attitudes, and reasons for participation in a proposed grazing permit buyout program. This paper is based on data collected from a mail survey of 2000 permittees in the Rocky Mountain States (39% response rate), and data collected from qualitative personal interviews. These interviews assessed motivations for participation, potential costs, and search for unforeseen consequences related to a proposed buyout program. We interviewed 49 individuals (33 ranchers, 16 agency personnel), which enabled us to describe likely outcomes and previously unmentioned items for consideration related to a proposed buyout program. Interview data were analyzed and broken into two major themes: motivation for participation in a buyout and potential consequences. Our study indicated that overall participation in potential buyout would be relatively low (17%); however, the associated financial, ecological, and administrative costs could be substantial. We note several unanticipated motivations for possible participation in this type of program, as well as possibly unrecognized impacts for administering agencies and permittees.";"Steinbach, M.S.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

"AGRIS:US201301540676";"Managing Abandoned Farmland: The Need to Link Biological and Sociological Aspects";"";"The lack of a particular use associated with abandoned farmland provides real opportunities with respect to the various land-use pressures occurring in productive territories. These environments remain generally poorly known and, because of this, require in-depth studies on the feasibility of management options, on biological as well as social grounds. This study, based on research on the biophysical potential and the perceptions by the owners of abandoned farmlands, analyzes the feasibility of silvicultural management options to improve forestry potential. Using a questionnaire, we surveyed abandoned farmland owners on different aspects of the status of their abandoned farmland in order to determine their willingness toward the management of these private lands. The land owners were also asked to express their interests and their constraints toward various types of interventions, with an emphasis on silvicultural work. The data were analyzed using multivariate methods to establish relationships between the questionnaire data and the characteristics of the land owners (socioeconomic profile and value system toward the environment). The results show that, in general, abandoned farmland is an unwanted space, is generally little used, is poorly known, and has little importance in the plans of its owners. We have found three types of owner profiles; the owners with a farmer's profile are those who are the most interested in managing their abandoned farmland, whether for agriculture or silviculture. The desire to improve abandoned farmland seems less important to owners with an ecocentric profile (high awareness of the environment) and to older owners. Finally, by associating the type of abandoned farmland owned and the characteristics of the owners, it is possible to propose different management options that reconcile the wishes of the owners as well as the biophysical potential of their abandoned farmland.";"Benjamin, Karyne

Yet critical components of botanical education, research, and management are lacking across government, academic, and private sectors. A recent nationwide survey revealed severe shortages of botanists at government agencies, a wave of upcoming retirements, and an alarming decline in botanical degree programs and course offerings at the nation's colleges and universities. Private sector organizations are helping to fill identified gaps in capacity, but need to work strategically with all sectors to ensure their sustainability into the future.

This often calls for developing empirical models to project land use change as input into ecological models. Providing ecologists with the land use information they desire can present many challenges regarding data, modeling, and econometrics. This paper provides an overview of the relatively recent adaptation of economics-based land use modeling methods toward greater spatial specificity desired in integrated research with ecologists.

The corporation bears the initial investment and earns as a return a share on the profits. The host country provides access and guarantee conditions of operation. Being the investment totally sunk, the corporation must account in its plan not only for uncertainty on market conditions but also for the threat of nationalization. In a real options framework where the government holds an American call option on nationalization we show under which conditions a Nash bargaining is feasible and leads to attain a cooperative agreement maximizing the joint venture surplus. We find that the threat of nationalization does not affect the investment time trigger but only the feasible bargaining set. Finally, we show that the optimal sharing rule results from the way the two parties may differently trade off rents with option value.";"Di Corato, Luca";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-01-31";"en";"expropriation";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212839";"http://purl.umn.edu/59378";"";"";"";""

A trivariate probit model estimates a set of random utility models of participation. Participation decisions at the state and federal levels are found to be driven by many of the same observed factors, but uncorrelated in unobserved characteristics. The important exceptions are that owners of small parcels under development pressure and with parcels of relatively low environmental quality tend to enroll in commodity programs rather than preservation.

This article introduces a landscape dynamics monitoring protocol that incorporates riparian structural classes into the land-cover classification scheme and examines riparian change within the context of surrounding land-cover change. We tested whether Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery could be used to document a riparian tree die-off through the classification of multi-date Landsat images using classification and regression tree (CART) models trained with physiognomic vegetation data. We developed a post-classification change map and used patch metrics to examine the magnitude and trajectories of riparian class change relative to mapped disturbance parameters. Results show that catchments where riparian change occurred can be identified from land-cover change maps; however, the main change resulting from the die-off disturbance was compositional rather than structural, making accurate post-classification change detection difficult.";"Villarreal, Miguel Luis

From an economic perspective, individual land use decisions play a central role in the manifestation of growth pressures, as changes in land use pattern are the cumulative result of numerous individual decisions regarding the use of lands. In this study, the issue of growth management is addressed by developing a spatially disaggregated, microeconomic model of land conversion decisions suitable for describing residential land use change at the rural-urban fringe. The model employs parcel-level data on land use in Calvert County, Maryland, a rapidly growing rural-urban fringe county. A probabilistic model of residential land use change is estimated using a duration model, and the parameter estimates are employed to simulate possible future growth scenarios under alternative growth management scenarios. Results suggest that ""smart growth"" objectives are best met when policies aimed at concentrating growth in target areas are implemented in tandem with policies designed to preserve rural or open space lands.";"Irwin, Elena G.

The partial land, labor and capital productivities are 163643.90 francs CFA/ha, 1716.92 francs CFA/Man.Day, and 2.48 respectively, implying that land is the most productive factor. The seemingly unrelated regression model is highly significant at 1% and revealed factors such as the household head gender, experience in agriculture, off – farm income employment; the household size; the sizes of land under maize, sorghum, and cotton cultivation; the household’s capital; and the maize fertilisation as determinants of the partial land productivity. The partial labor productivity is influenced by the household head gender, his experience in agriculture, an off – farm income employment, the household size, the sizes of land under rice and cotton cultivation, the household’s capital, and the access to credit whereas the household size, the land size under cotton cultivation, and the household’s capital affect the partial capital productivity. These factors need to be taken into account by policy to design agricultural projects that aim to improve agricultural productivity. The land size to be allocated to different crops has to be at the centre of agricultural policy as it has influenced all partial agricultural productivities.";"Kokoye, Sènakpon E. Haroll

"AGRIS:US2016214248";"Labor requirements and profitability of alternative soil fertility replenishment technologies in Zambia";"";"Low soil fertility is a major concern in agricultural productivity and development policy discourse in sub-saharan Africa. The problem is exacerbated by government withdrawal from fertilizer input markets and the inability of private sector operators to fill the gap. This warranted a search for other nutrient sources to supplement chemical fertilizers. Based on field data collected in Zambia, this study assessed the labor inputs implications of “improved tree fallows”, continuous maize cropping with and without mineral fertilizer and, evaluated the financial profitability of the different land use systems. Results show that agroforestry-based land use systems are more profitable (NPV between $233 and $309 per ha) than farmers’ practice of continuous maize production without external fertilization ($130/ha) but, they are less profitable than mineral fertilizer ($499). When the effects of the 50% government subsidy on fertilizers are taken into account, the differences in the profitability of fertilizers over improved tree fallows falls from 61% to 13%. The returns per person labor-day is $3.20 for fertilizer and $2.50, $2.40, and $1.90 respectively, for the three agroforestry options evaluated and only $1.10 for unfertilized maize. These returns compare with a daily agricultural wage of $0.50 in the study area. Key determinants of financial attractiveness and by extension, potential adoptability of the land use systems were identified. Given the low rate (20%) of farmers in Zambia who have access to fertilizers, there is a large niche to integrate other soil nutrient replenishing options with fertilizer to improve food security and reduce poverty among resource-poor smallholder farmers in Africa.";"Ajayi, Olu Clifford

"AGRIS:US2016214244";"Integrating small farms in agent based models";"";"In German agriculture structural change is mainly a result of the outmigration of smaller farms from the sector. The decisions of these farmers to leave or stay in the sector, are not based solely on financial data and market expectations. Other aspects are important such as the preservation of the cultural landscape, the continuation of the family tradition, or self-realisation. Only if these goals are adequately integrated into land use models, one can hope that the type and magnitude of reactions predicted by the model will be similar to that observed in reality. The main goal of this paper is to present a model approach that allows for the integration of non-monetary aspects into an agri-economic land use model. The approach is tested for a sample of 20 farms located in a municipality in the Bavarian Alps. The results show that the choice of the farmers’ attitude has a larger impact on results than the peculiarities of the policy scenario. This holds especially for the emerging farm structure but also for the general land use intensity.";"Roder, Norbert

Maps of different periods have been registered and resampled to similar geographic coordinates using ERDAS Imagine 9.0. The most notable changes include decreases in areas of paddy cultivation, mixed crops, scrub lands and evergreen forests, and increases in built-up areas, rubber plantations, dense mixed forests, and water bodies. Further, large scale exploitation of flood plain mud and river sand have reached menacing proportions leading to bank caving and cut offs at channel bends.

After the fall of the socialist derg regime in 1991, land property rights have remained vested in the state and only usufruct rights have been alienated to farmers – to the disappointment of international donor agencies. This has nurtured an antagonistic debate between advocates of the privatization of land property rights to individual plot holders and those supporting the government’s position. This debate, however, fails to account for the diversity and continuities in Ethiopian land tenure systems. This paper reviews the changing bundles of rights farmers have held during various political regimes in Ethiopia, the imperial, the derg and the current one, at different times and places. Our analysis indicates the marked differences in tenure arrangements after the fall of the empire, but identifies some commonalities in land tenure regimes as well, in particular between the traditional rist system and the current tenure system.";"Crewett, Wibke

We assessed the regional-scale effect of land use and land cover (LULC) on patterns of richness distribution of trees, birds, amphibians, and mammals in the Northern Argentine Dry Chaco (NADC) over c. 19 million hectares. Using species distribution models in a hierarchical framework, we modeled the distributions of 138 species. First, we trained the models for the entire Argentinean Chaco with climatic and topographic variables. Second, we modeled the same species for the NADC including the biophysical variables identified as relevant in the first step plus four LULC-related variables: woody biomass, distance to crops, density of livestock-based rural settlements (puestos), and vegetation cover. Third, we constructed species richness maps by adding the models of individual species and considering two situations, with and without LULC variables. Four, richness maps were used for assessing differences when LULC variables are added and for determining the main drivers of current patterns of species richness. We found a marked decrease in species richness of the four groups as a consequence of inclusion of LULC variables in distribution models. The main factors associated with current richness distribution patterns (both negatively) were woody biomass and density of livestock puestos. Species richness in present-day Semiarid Chaco landscapes is strongly affected by LULC patterns, even in areas not transformed to agriculture. Regional-scale biodiversity planning should consider open habitats such as grasslands and savannas in addition to woodlands.";"Torres, Ricardo

"AGRIS:US201400149361";"Agricultural adjustment, population dynamics and forests redistribution in a subtropical watershed of NW Argentina";"";"Patterns of land-use and land-cover change are usually grouped into one of two categories defined by the dominant trend: (1) deforestation resulting from expanding agriculture and (2) forest expansion, usually related to the abandonment of marginal lands. At regional scale, however, both processes can occur simultaneously even in the absence of net change. Given the focus on net change, such redistribution of agricultural and natural and seminatural lands has been generally overlooked. The interaction between agriculture modernization, human demography and complex topographic gradients of northwestern Argentina has resulted in processes of both forest recovery and deforestation, thus providing the opportunity to analyze patterns and driving forces of land-cover redistribution. We analyzed 20� years (1986–2006) of land-cover change in a subtropical watershed in relation to topographic and demographic variables. Although net forest change represented <1� %, forests redistribution affected 7� % of forest lands. There was a consistent geographic segregation of deforestation and forest recovery, with forests expanding over steep highlands and agriculture expanding over lowland irrigated areas. Population trends were not associated to forest expansion in lowlands but they explained 32� % of forest recovery in highlands. Highland forest expansion and lowland deforestation, respectively, imply conservation opportunities for humid montane forests and the environmental services they provide (e.g., watershed conservation) and threats for the conservation of dry forests and its biodiversity. Our study exemplifies the importance of land-use redistribution (rather than net change) with relevant environmental consequences at regional scale.";"Nanni, Ana Sofía

At that time, damage to agricultural crops constituted grounds for tax remission for individual farmers and landowners. Where it survives, the relevant administrative documentation generally includes a statement from the applicant, a report by the official commission tasked with checking the contents of it, and any decisions made by taxation authorities at regional and “land” level (the Jihlava regional office and the Moravian Land Administration (“ Gubernium ”) respectively). Data extracted may include the type of event, dating, places of occurrence and damage done. The chronology of hydrological and meteorological extremes (torrential rain, flash flood, flood, hailstorm, lightning, frost) covers the period 1706–1849, but only four events are evident before 1748 and there is a gap in records between 1757 and 1789. Extremes are analysed from a spatio-temporal point of view. A total of 97 extreme events (171 extremes of particular type) were identified for the region studied. Torrential rain, hailstorm and flash flood were the major devastating phenomena, and occurred mainly from May to August. Torrential rain and hailstorm are clearly attributable to thunderstorms with very intense convection. Five outstanding events and their impacts upon individual farmers are described in detail. The results are discussed with respect to uncertainties in the basic data and in the context of the Czech Lands, because only some of the extremes disclosed are known and confirmed by other documentary data.

The area under sugarcane cultivation increased over 17-fold, from 690 ha in 1988 to 12729 ha in 2002, with a concomitant loss of about 4680 ha (8·2 per cent) of forest/woodland, mainly on the southern boundary of BFR. Land-use and cover changes were a result of (a) agricultural expansion, (b) increasing human population, exacerbated by large influxes of refugees, (c) conflicts of interest and political interference in the management of BFR and (d) unclear land tenure. Agriculture is the main land-use practice and source of income to local people, with commercial sugarcane and tobacco as the primary cash crops. Individual smallholder sugarcane plantations covered distances ranging from 30 to 1440 m along the BFR edge, with no buffer zone, resulting in direct conflicts between farmers and forest wild animals. There is an ever-increasing need for more land for agricultural expansion, resulting in continued loss of forest/woodland on private/communal lands and encroachment into BFR. This unsustainable agricultural expansion and the local people's perception of BFR as an obstacle to agriculture, threatens the conservation of its threatened wild plants (e.g. Raphia farinifera) and the endangered chimpanzees. Therefore, their sustainable management for both development and conservation will require strong and incorruptible institutions that will seek a balance between resource exploitation and conservation.

"AGRIS:US201301565530";"Fuelwood, deforestation, and land degradation: 10 years of evidence from cebu province, the Philippines";"";"A major development concern of the 1970s and 1980s was 'the other energy' or 'woodfuel crisis'. Woodfuel use in developing regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America was believed to be a key factor in tropical deforestation, and the loss of forests was projected to result in widespread woodfuel shortages. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that woodfuel production is seldom a direct cause of deforestation (although it may be a by-product), and that most woodfuel demand is met by trees and shrubs growing outside of forest areas. In addition, earlier predictions of serious woodfuel shortages have not materialized. But in some regions, including the Philippines, woodfuel use is still regularly pointed to as a primary cause of deforestation, and woodfuel shortages are still predicted for the immediate future. In particular, commercial woodfuel demand for household and commercial use is said to be contributing to over-exploitation of forest resources. This paper examines the connections between commercial woodfuel demand and deforestation on the Island of Cebu in the central Philippines. Cebu is widely perceived as an environmental disaster area on the brink of ecological collapse, and tree cutting for woodfuel production is often blamed for contributing to this condition. In contrast, this paper will argue that environmental conditions on Cebu are improving, that tree planting and management is widespread among smallholder farmers and other landowners, and that commercial demand for woodfuel and other wood products is one of the main factors driving increased reforestation on the island.

"AGRIS:US201301565532";"Erosion modelling approach to simulate the effect of land management options on soil loss by considering catenary soil development and farmers perception";"";"The prevention of soil erosion is one of the most essential requirements for sustainable agriculture in developing countries. In recent years it is widely recognized that more site-specific approaches are needed to assess variations in erosion susceptibility in order to select the most suitable land management methods for individual hillslope sections. This study quantifies the influence of different land management methods on soil erosion by modelling soil loss for individual soil-landscape units on a hillslope in Southern Uganda. The research combines a soil erosion modelling approach using the physically based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)-model with catenary soil development along hillslopes. Additionally, farmers' perceptions of soil erosion and sedimentation are considered in a hillslope mapping approach. The detailed soil survey confirmed a well-developed catenary soil sequence along the hillslope and the participatory hillslope mapping exercise proved that farmers can distinguish natural soil property changes using their local knowledge. WEPP-model simulations show that differences in soil properties, related to the topography along the hillslope, have a significant impact on total soil loss. Shoulder and backslope positions with steeper slope gradients were most sensitive to changes in land management. Furthermore, soil conservation techniques such as residue management and contouring could reduce soil erosion by up to 70 percent on erosion-sensitive slope sections compared to that under tillage practices presently used at the study site. The calibrated model may be used as a tool to provide quantitative information to farmers regarding more site-specific land management options.

Considering that heritage is an important aspect of oyster production and also a factor of sustainable territorial governance issues – as Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) supposes–, we set out to establish which forms of oyster farming tourists in this coastal area value. The choice experiment method is applied in order to analyse individual preferences. This method has been used extensively in research on environmental issues (such as landscape preferences) and multi-functionality of agriculture but until now has never been applied to oyster farming. By implementing a latent class logit model, it allows us to bring to light, in the Arcachon Bay area, the fact that the heterogeneity of tourists is important and needs to be taken into account by decision makers. Our results also highlight the fact that the amenity dimension is valued as much as the productive dimension of this industry, but differently, depending on the class of tourist concerned. These findings have implications for decision makers of this territory, who are faced with complex issues of coastal management and productive sector survival.";"Dachary-Bernard, Jeanne

"AGRIS:US201500004456";"Identifying the potential wintering sites of the globally threatened Aquatic Warbler Acrocephalus paludicola using remote sensing";"";"The Aquatic Warbler is a threatened Afro-Palaearctic migrant with a largely unknown distribution in the winter (non-breeding) season. Protection of wintering sites may be crucial for the conservation of the species. Previous studies have identified extensive areas of north-western sub-Saharan Africa that could potentially be occupied by the species during winter. However, these studies have not necessarily differentiated between potentially suitable and unsuitable habitat types at a spatial resolution appropriate for targeting field surveys. To identify specific sites that could be occupied by non-breeding Aquatic Warblers at a scale appropriate for targeted field surveys, we adopted a modelling approach that combined recent sightings from Djoudj, Senegal, with land cover and climate data. We produced maps of potential distribution using three maximum entropy models. While a paucity of sightings prevented a full test of these maps on independent records, the areas that were predicted to be potentially occupied included areas around which there are historical records. We suggest field surveys should be targeted towards sites in the Inner Niger Delta and a number of marshes along and away from the Niger River in Mali, and to sites in southern Mauritania.";"Buchanan, Graeme M

"AGRIS:US2016211636";"Maize boom in the uplands of Northern Vietnam : economic importance and environmental implications";"";"In Vietnam, the demand for meat products has grown dramatically due to rapid economic growth and urbanisation and is expected to further increase in the future. Being the primary source of feed for the country’s livestock and poultry industry, maize has become the second most important crop after rice. While this maize boom has the potential to reduce rural poverty, it promotes the expansion of agricultural cultivation into fragile agro-ecological zones, often leading to deforestation and soil degradation, especially in the uplands. Using empirical evidence from mountainous Yen Chau district in north-western Vietnam, the objective of this paper is to investigate the current economic importance and environmental implications of maize cultivation. Furthermore, particular emphasis is placed on the identification of factors influencing farmers’ decision how much area to allocate to maize in order to derive research and policy recommendations. Maize is the dominant crop in Yen Chau, covering most of the uplands and generating the lion’s share of households’ cash income. Although farmers are well aware of soil erosion on their maize plots, effective soil conservation measures are rarely practiced. Maize is attractive to farmers from all social strata, notably the poor, and through marketing arrangements with traders its cultivation is also not constrained by poor infrastructural conditions. Access to low-interest credit should be enhanced to mitigate farmers’ risk of being caught in a poverty trap when maize revenues plummet due to pests, diseases, price fluctuations, or adverse weather conditions. To address the problem of soil degradation in the maize-dominated uplands, research is needed on soil conservation options that are economically more attractive than those promoted thus far.";"Keil, Alwin

"AGRIS:US201500082412";"How pastoralism changes savanna vegetation: impact of old pastoral settlements on plant diversity and abundance in south-western Kenya";"";"For centuries, pastoralists have influenced savanna ecology through their construction of settlements, traditional movement patterns in search of forage, water and safety for their livestock. Construction of settlements initiates localised changes in the vegetation due to clearance of vegetation at construction and collection of construction materials. During the occupation period a lot of dung is deposited in and around settlements. When pastoral families abandon settlements and move away, they leave behind mud huts and livestock corrals surrounded by fences. These sites become nutrient-rich patches supporting a different abundance and diversity of plants and large mammals compared to the rest of the savanna. This study aimed to broaden our understanding of how pastoral land use influences plant diversity in East African savannas. Past work on the effects of settlements has been done in dry places (<600 mm rainfall) with relatively poor soils. To complement and extend these studies, we selected a contrasting site with high rainfall and rich soils in the Mara ecosystem of south-western Kenya. We sampled the occurrence of different plant species along transects radiating from 28 settlements abandoned by pastoralists and ranging in age from 2 months to 48 years on two different soil types. Mean plant species richness and abundance peaked at intermediate distances, 12.5 and 25 m from the edges of settlements. We recorded a total of 210 plant species during the study, 65 of which occurred only within the impact ring of the abandoned settlements. The effects of settlements on plants were stronger on shallow sandy soils than on deep clay soils. Our findings show that abandoned settlements were key sites for regeneration and replenishment of shrubs harvested by the Maasai, but support few other plants of biodiversity value. These unique habitat patches in the savanna ecosystem are under threat as pastoral Maasai become increasingly sedentary and as wildlife conservancies are established, thus reducing the number of abandoned settlements. In essence, the Maasai, by changing their traditional lifestyle, will reduce these nutrient hotspots and hence landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity.";"Vuorio, Ville

HRUs are a set of discontinuous land masses that are spatially located in the watershed but their responses are not tied to any particular field. Field_SWAT, a simple graphical user interface (GUI)-driven tool, was developed to map SWAT simulations from the HRU layer to a user-defined field boundaries layer. This stand-alone tool ingests spatial and nonspatial SWAT outputs and helps in visualizing them at the field scale using four different aggregation methods. The tool was applied for mapping the SWAT model's annual runoff and sediment outputs from 218 HRUs to 89 individual field boundaries in an agriculturally dominated watershed in Northeast Arkansas. The area-weighted spatial aggregation method resulted in a most suitable mapping between HRU and field outputs. This research demonstrates that Field_SWAT could potentially be a useful tool for field-scale targeting of conservation practices and communicating model outputs to watershed managers and interested stakeholders.";"Pai, Naresh

The proposed system, instead of using a single classifier, builds an ensemble of classifiers with the hope that the ensemble system will have a lesser generalization error than any of its members. Each component classifier is trained independently using the proposed self-training approach on different training sub-sets and their predictions on test samples are combined using a new instant run-off voting (IRV) based classifier combination method. Each training subset consists of a few labeled samples and a comparatively large number of unlabeled data items. The cluster-and-label method for self-training has been adopted here considering the support vector machines (SVM) as the supervised learner and minimum spanning tree based clustering. A normalized histogram intersection kernel has been proposed which has shown to outperform the state-of-the-art kernel functions in terms of the SVM generalization accuracy. A novel cluster validity index specifically for graph based clustering has also been introduced to access the quality of the clustering. The proposed training method has the advantage that it can find classes for which the labeled training data are unavailable initially. A number of multi-spectral images have been considered for the experimental evaluation and a comparison with some of the well-established techniques from the literature has confirmed the superiority of the proposed classifier system.";"Banerjee, Biplab

For instance, artificial sample collection cannot achieve an automatic remote sensing imagery classification. Based on this, this paper resorts to the technologies of change detection and transfer learning, and further proposes a prior knowledge-based automatic hierarchical classification approach for detailed land cover updating. To establish this method, an automatic sample collection scheme for object-oriented classification is presented. Unchanged landmarks are first located. Prior knowledge of these categories from previously interpreted thematic maps is then transferred to the new target task. The knowledge is utilized to rebuild the relationship between landmark classes and their spatial-spectral features for land cover updating. A series of high-resolution remote sensing images are experimented for validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in rapidly updating detailed land cover. The results show that, with the assistance of preliminary thematic maps, the approach can automatically obtain reliable object samples for object-oriented classification. Detailed land cover information can be excellently updated with a competitive accuracy, which demonstrates the practicability and effectiveness of our method. It creates a novel way for employing the technologies of knowledge discovery into the field of information extraction from optical remote sensing images.";"Wu, Tianjun

By using the remote sensing images and with the support of GIS the spatial pattern of land use change of Vaal Harts Irrigation Scheme for 15 years was extracted and interpreted for the changes of scheme. Results showed that the spatial difference of land use change was obvious. The analysis reveals that 37.86% of additional land area has been brought under fallow land and thus less irrigation area (18.21%).

"AGRIS:US201400151441";"Mapping Soil Erosion Prevention Using an Ecosystem Service Modeling Framework for Integrated Land Management and Policy";"";"Current spatially explicit approaches to map and assess ecosystem services are often grounded on unreliable proxy data based on land use/cover to derive ecosystem service indicators. These approaches fail to make a distinction between the actual service provision and the underlying ecosystem capacity to provide the service. We present an integrative conceptual framework to estimate the provision of soil erosion prevention by combining the structural impact of soil erosion and the social–ecological processes that allow for its mitigation. The framework was tested and illustrated in the Portel municipality in Southern Portugal, a Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system that is prone to desertification and soil degradation. The results show a clear difference in the spatial and temporal distribution of the capacity for ecosystem service provision and the actual ecosystem service provision. It also shows that although the average actual ecosystem service provision in the region is sufficient to mitigate the existing structural impact, vulnerable areas can be identified where significant soil losses are not mitigated at present. This becomes more significant when comparing different land management intensities. Considering these results, we argue that the general assumption that there is an almost direct relation between the capacity for ecosystem service provision of a given area and the actual ecosystem service provision is wrong. We also discuss how the framework presented here could be used to support land management and policy, and how it can be adapted for other regulating services.";"Guerra, Carlos A.

"AGRIS:US201400151442";"Long-term Impacts of Contrasting Management of Large Ungulates in the Arctic Tundra-Forest Ecotone: Ecosystem Structure and Climate Feedback";"";"The arctic forest-tundra ecotone (FTE) represents a major transition zone between contrasting ecosystems, which can be strongly affected by climatic and biotic factors. Expected northward expansion and encroachment on arctic tundra in response to climate warming may be counteracted by natural and anthropogenic processes such as defoliating insect outbreaks and grazing/browsing regimes. Such natural and anthropogenic changes in land cover can substantially affect FTE dynamics, alter ground albedo (index of the amount of solar energy reflected back into the atmosphere) and provide important feedbacks into the climate system. We took advantage of a naturally occurring contrast between reindeer grazing regimes in a border region between northern Finland and Norway which was recently defoliated by an outbreak of the geometrid moth. We examined ecosystem-wide contrasts between potentially year-round (but mainly summer) grazed (YRG) regions in Finland and mainly winter grazed (WG) regions in Norway. We also used a remotely sensed vegetation index and albedo to quantify effects on local energy balance and potential climate feedbacks. Although differences in soil characteristics and ground vegetation cover were small, we found dramatic differences in the tree layer component of the ecosystem. Regeneration of mountain birch stands appears to have been severely hampered in the YRG regime, by limiting regeneration from basal shoots and reestablishment of individual trees from saplings. This has led to a more open forest structure and a significant 5% increase in spring albedo in the summer grazed compared to the winter grazed regions. This supports recent suggestions that ecosystem processes in the Arctic can significantly influence the climate system, and that such processes must be taken into account when developing climate change scenarios and adaptation strategies.";"Biuw, Martin

"AGRIS:US201500163212";"possible combined effects of land-use changes and climate conditions on the spatial–temporal patterns of primary production in a natural protected area";"";"Multifunctional landscapes are characterized by various functions and values that sustain directly or indirectly the quality of human life, through the provision of natural capital flow. Primary production (PP), representing a measure of the solar energy captured by the system and available to drive its functioning, is recognized as a fundamental supporting service. Several biophysical modification and conversion altering the primary production are due to land-use change. Natural protected areas with a sustainable management of land-use could be able to guarantee the persistence of structure and processes (primary production) fundamental for the provision of natural capital. In this context, the aims of this paper are to investigate the spatial–temporal patterns of PP variability (1986–2010) in the Natural Protected Area of “Torre Guaceto” (southern Italy), taking into account land-cover change and climate conditions and looking at PP as a supporting service able to guarantee natural capital flow. In dealing with this issue, this paper aims at testing whether NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) integrated with NDII (Normalized Difference Infrared Index) can be suitable surrogates for the assessment of shifts in the spatial–temporal dynamics of PP, useful to explore possible feedbacks related to conservation management choices in supporting natural capital flow. Therefore, the assessment of the complex spatial–temporal dynamics of natural vegetation has been performed by using NDVI and NDII. The results showed that after the establishment of the Natural Protected Area of “Torre Guaceto” in 2000, there has been an increase of NDVI that could represent an increase of PP. However, since PP depends also on water content, measured by NDII, a Pearson correlation analysis between NDII and land Surface Temperature (TS) has been carried out, demonstrating that low level of PP in 2005 was not imputable to climate conditions but to the worse quality of vegetation associated to the wetland due to aging phenomenon. In conclusion, to make the conservation management more effective it is not enough to identify and quantify the major landscape transformations and the underlying causes, but rather to detect the capability of new landscape patterns, in terms of configuration and composition, to sustain ecosystem services. The analysis of conservation management based on NDVI and NDII, used as surrogate to detect the maintenance of PP, appears to be very promising in order to develop better strategies for the adaptive management of natural protected areas.";"Petrosillo, Irene

However, such an approach can miss significant biodiversity by ignoring smaller forest fragments scattered throughout the landscape, many of which exist on small farms. Here, I evaluate the method used to define a set of natural reserves in Southern Brazil to assess if it captures and preserves the significant biodiversity that exists in this unique biome. I used a relatively simple field sampling methodology and statistical analyses to evaluate floristic and structural parameters, comparing tree species diversity within a large forest fragment (with and without A.Â angustifolia dominance) to smaller fragments in the surrounding landscape. While stands dominated by A.Â angustifolia showed primary forestâlike physiognomy, they did not have the levels of diversity expected for oldâgrowth forests. Traditional forestry parameters, especially basal area and number of individuals, are useful for differentiating forest types in terms of structure. While no single diversity index provides a complete picture of the composition and variation of diversity in forest fragments, when taken together and assessed using extrapolation and comparative statistics, they provide a meaningful method for comparing and identifying high priority areas for conservation.

In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of land rental activities in China. Large differences exist, however, both between regions and within regions in the share of households participating in land renting activities. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the development of land rental markets in one of the poorest regions within China, namely Puding County in Guizhou Province. Data from 792 households in three villages are used to analyze the participation in land rental markets. For renting out of land, a binary probit model is used that corrects for missing observation caused by migrated households. We find that the land rental market is mainly driven by off-farm employment; land-labor ratios do not play a significant role in land renting out. Other important findings are that households belonging to minority groups are significantly more inactive in the land rental market, and that the age of the household head shows an inverted U-shaped relationship with land renting in. Participation in off-farm employment is relatively low in the research area. With further increases in off-farm work, the land rental market is expected to develop further. Households belonging to minority groups, however, are unlikely to participate much. Appropriate measures taken by local governments to stimulate land rental participation by minority groups can be an important way to stimulate agricultural productivity and total household incomes of such minority groups.";"Tu, Qin

"AGRIS:LV2011000801";"Problems and perspectives of land consolidation projects in the Republic of Lithuania";"Проблемы и перспектива проектов консолидации земель в Литовской Республике";"Since the year 2000 with the help of the specialists from the Land Consolidation Division of the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, pilot land consolidation projects have been started. Besides the simple territorial readjustment of land parcels, these projects aimed to encourage local initiatives as well as to develop the land consolidation mechanism as an essential tool for the development of the integrated rural development including environment protection, development of infrastructure together with the creation of competitive farms. Experience gained during these pilot projects (cadastral areas of Dotnuva and Akademija in Kedainiai district, cadastral areas of Puskelniai in Marijampole municipality and cadastral area of Pabaiskas in Ukmerge district) was used when preparing legal acts regulating land consolidation. In Lithuania, already fourteen land consolidation projects (which were finished in October of 2008) have been started since the year 2006 following the provisions of the legal acts regulating land consolidation. The total area of the consolidated land covered 4827 ha, 380 landowners with 731 land parcels took part in this process. During the time of the fulfilment of these projects, in order to form land parcels of rational size and form as well as to expand agricultural land holdings, the number of projected land parcels has reduced by 219. Best results were achieved in the land consolidation project of Deguciai cadastral area in Telsiai district (which covered the largest territory). After the enlargement of the land-ownership, 67 land parcels were formed instead of 115. According to the National Land Consolidation Strategy approved by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania in 2008, it will be necessary to carry out the land consolidation gradually in the area of about 900.000 hectares. During the period of 2008-2013, it is aimed to increase the average size of the project from 300 up to 600 hectares, and the average size of the land holding – from 12 up to 20 hectares.

В 2000 г. начата разработка экспериментальных проектов консолидации земель по совместному решению Министерства Дании и национальной земельной службы при Министерстве сельского хозяйства Литвы. В проектах кроме переустройства и укрупнения территорий земельных участков, решались вопросы: поощрение местной инициативы, стремление развивать механизм консолидации земель, как инструмент интеграции развития села, в том числе охрану окружающей среды, развитие инфраструктуры, одновременно создавая конкурентабельные хозяйства. Во время составления пилотных проектов (кадастровых местностей Дотнува и Академия Кедайняйского района, кадастровой местности Пускяльняй Мариямпольсого самоуправления и кадастровой местности Пабайска Укмяргяйского района) приобретëнный опыт был использован при разработке правовых актов, регламентировающих консолидацию земель. 2006–2008 г.г. в Литве согласно положениям правовых актов, регламентирующими консолидацию земель, разработаны и осуществлены 14 проектов консолидации земель. Общая площадь консолидируемых земель заняла 4827 га, участвовали 380 собственников земли, имеющих 731 земельный участок. После консолидации на 219 земельных участков стало меньше. Наилучший результат проекта консолидации по занимающей наибольшей территории достигнут в кадастровой местности Дегайчяй Тельшяйского района. Укрупнив землевладения, вместо 115 землевладений будет сформировано 67 земельных участков. Руководствуясь Национальной стратегией консолидации земель, потверждëнной руководством Литовской Республики, консолидация земель постепенно охватит площадь около 900 тыс. га. В период 2008–2013 г.г. увеличится средний размер земли, от 300 до 600 га, а средний размер землевладения – с 12 до 20 га.";"Kavaliauskiene, B., Lithuanian Univ. of Agriculture, Akademija, Kauno reg.

Балтийские страны Латвия, Литва и Эстония в XVII-XIX вв. носили другие названия и размещались в других границах. Так, Лифляндия занимала южную часть Прибалтики, населенной Лифляндия была завоевана немецкими рыцарями и вошла в состав владений Ливонского ордена. В годы Ливонской войны Лифляндия была занята войсками Ивана IV и уступлена в 1582 г. Польше. Латышские и эстонские крестьяне восставали против немецких феодалов. Разгром Ливонии усилил антирусскую политику Польши и Швеции. Сигизмунд II Август, желая захватить большую часть Прибалтики, навязал Ливонии в 1561 г. договор о ее подчинении Польше, который был в 1562 г. подписан в Риге. На основании договора Рига оставалась самостоятельной до 1581 г., Швеция подчинила себе Таллин (Ревель) и Северную Эстонию с островами Харюмаа, Вирума и Ерва. Россия была вынуждена вести войну за выход к Балтийскому морю с Польшей, Литвой и Швецией. В 1558 г. русское войско заняло Дерптский район, Восточную Ливонию, Нарву и Тарту. Попытки Ливонии опереться на помощь прибалтийских стран успеха не имели: Швеция после неудачной войны не хотела выступать против России. Дания, заинтересованная в получении Курляндии и островов Сааремаа и Сарема, согласилась лишь на посредничество. В 1621 г. Лифляндия была захвачена Шведским королем Густавом и позднее включена в состав Российской империи, что позволило ей получить широкие возможности для экономического развития, в частности, по земельной политике.";"Kosinskij, V., State Univ. of Land Use Planning, Moscow (Russian Federation).

The defects of land reclamation system cause the rise of deserted lands. Dampness and bagged up soils are a large obstacle for the proper use of deserted lands. One more reason is lands of low productivity. The third reason of the rise of deserted lands is the shortage and default of perspective farmers and agricultural companies who are able to lease and cultivate land. Analysis of suburban territories development has also been fulfilled and the decrease of farmland due to the increase of built on territory has been established. After analysis it is established that forests area mostly increased in a period of 1945 – 1966 because farmland of poor productivity were planted with trees. After analysis of built-up territory alteration it is established that alteration of built-up territory in a period of 11 years from 1996 to 2007 the greatest tendency had buildings in arable land - 4.5 ha, in settlement territory - 2.4 ha and the least part was in homestead - 1.6 ha.

В статье анализируется сельский ландшафт южной части Литвы и его использование. Установлено, что в исследуемой части Литвы произошли большие изменения ландшафта. В представленной работе обсуждаются тенденции и причины этих изменений. Также проводится анализ причин не использования заброшенных земель. Одна из них – дефекты мелиоративных систем. Сырая и начинающая заболачиваться земля сильно затрудняет ее использование надлежащим образом. Другая причина – малая производительность земли. Третьей причиной, из-за которой земли забрасываются, является отсутствие или недостаток предприимчивых, перспективных фермеров или сообществ, способных арендовать землю и работать на ней. Проведен анализ развития пригородных территорий. Установлено сокращение обрабатываемых земель за счет увеличения застроенных территорий. В результате проведенных исследований выявлено, что наибольшую долю в структуре сельского ландшафта анализируемой части Литвы составляют пахотные земли (51 %), часть территорий этих сельскохозяйственных угодий – залежные земли (2 %). Лесные массивы существенно расширились в 1945-1966 годах, так как обрабатываемые, но малопродуктивные площади сельскохозяйственных угодий были засажены лесом. На основе проведенного анализа изменений ситуации застроенных территорий установлено, что за одиннадцатилетний период (с 1996 г. по 2007 г.) в наибольшей степени тенденция строительства зданий проявилась на территории обрабатываемых земель и составила 4,5 га, на территории населенных пунктов – 2,4 га, а в наименьшей степени была застроена территория усадеб – 1,6 га.

Continuous simulation for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2000 was conducted using the regional climate model, with NCEP-FNL reanalysis data as the driving fields. The study focused on the ability of the model to simulate precipitation in the HRB. The analysis results showed the following: (1) For precipitation, the model could reproduce well the spatial pattern and seasonal cycle in different regions of the HRB, simulated precipitation was overestimated in the upper reaches of the HRB and underestimated in the lower reaches of the HRB, and seasonal precipitation biases were mostly in the range of −39.9%–9.6% of observations, which is mostly consistent with the IPCC report (2001). (2) The model could reproduce reasonably temporal evolution of pentad precipitation in different regions. Correlation coefficients between the simulated and observed pentad precipitation were 0.8123, 0.5064, and 0.7033 in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the HRB, respectively. They reached a significance level of 1%. (3) Dynamical downscaling of a high-resolution regional climate model was used to overcome the deficiency of long-term, high-temporal/spatial-resolution meteorological dataset in the HRB, and to drive directly the integrated model that coupled ecological-hydrological and socioeconomic processes in the HRB.";"Xiong, Zhe

Wind observations have been collected through a 6-year period (January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2002) by wind mast recording at the same two sensor heights (i.e., 10 and 50m AGL), thus enabling a proper wind profile analysis. WSC overall mean values were found to be 0.271 at BR, 0.232 at PS, and 0.150 at TI. In addition, a detailed analysis has been carried out to describe the WSC yearly, monthly and diurnal variation, as well as by wind direction. The characteristics of z₀ surface roughness length have been also investigated as an estimate for neutral stability conditions only, resulting in overall mean values of 0.526m at BR, 0.287m at PS, and 0.027m at TI. The z₀ variation by year, month and hour of the day, as well as by wind direction, has been analysed, too. The European “Corine Land Cover 2000” classification of the study areas has been employed to deeply investigate the land use influence on both WSC and z₀ characteristics as a function of wind direction. Based on temperature and pressure surface measurements, the computation of site-specific mean air density as well as monthly variation has been also performed. Site-related 50-m wind resource has been assessed by means of wind roses and wind speed frequency distributions, as well as Weibull’s parameters. The potential turbine-converted wind energy yield has been also investigated, enabling to detect, for each site, the most suitable 50-m hub height turbine model regardless of its rated power. Furthermore, a number of comparisons have been made to assess the discrepancy in 50-m energy yield resulting if using data extrapolated from 10m, both with 0.143 default and overall mean WSC value, instead of actually 50-m measured data.";"Gualtieri, Giovanni

The study area includes the whole distributional area of mountain pine in the Catalan Pyrenees (north-east Spain). This represents more than 80 municipalities, covering a total area of 6018 km². Forest cover was obtained by image reclassification of more than 200 pairs of aerial photographs taken in 1956 and 2006. Encroachment and densification were determined according to changes in forest cover, and were expressed as binary variables on a 150 x 150 m cell-size grid. We then used logistic regression to analyse the effects of several topographic and socio-economic variables on forest expansion. In the period analysed, mountain pine increased its surface coverage by 8898 ha (an increase of more than 16%). Mean canopy cover rose from 31.0% in 1956 to 55.6% in 2006. Most of the expansion was found on north-facing slopes and at low altitudes. Socio-economic factors arose as major factors in mountain pine expansion, as encroachment rates were higher in municipalities with greater population losses or weaker primary sector development. The spatial patterns of mountain pine expansion showed a good match with the main patterns of land-use change in the Pyrenees, suggesting that land-use changes have played a more important role than climate in driving forest dynamics at a landscape scale over the period studied. Further studies on forest expansion at a regional scale should incorporate patterns of land-use changes to correctly interpret drivers of forest encroachment and densification.";"Améztegui, Aitor

Twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in December and March, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. Salmonella, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus were widespread —12 of 22 O’ahu streams had all five pathogens. All stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean ± standard deviation densities of 2.2 ± 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 ± 0.7 Escherichia coli, 1.1 ± 0.7 Clostridium perfringens, 1.2 ± 0.8 F⁺ coliphages, and 3.6 ± 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. Bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. Higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of Campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive to sunlight. Multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical–chemical water quality showed positive associations between Salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between S. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. Further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical–chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. Results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. Future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterborne illness related to O’ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.";"Viau, Emily J.

Income and institutions influence mortality only indirectly, through their impact on the intensity and frequency of floods. Population exposure affects the number of deaths both directly and indirectly. Higher population exposure results in more deaths once the flood has occurred, but it is associated with smaller floods.

This raises issues about the possibilities of reusing these areas as well as on the conservation of industrial heritage they often entail. Conjoint Analysis (CA) can shed light on these issues as it can elicit the preferences of inhabitants for different scenarios of reuse. So far, only a limited number of applications of CA have been made on this topic. In this article, we present the results of a CA experiment on the reuse of a large, mainly abandoned, port area in Trieste (Italy) featuring buildings with some historical and industrial heritage value. Three hundred computer assisted interviews have been made on a representative sample of Trieste inhabitants, eliciting their preferences for different reuse hypotheses and building conservation scenarios. The survey explores two original topics: the impact of the time horizon of the payment (single or decennial special purpose tax) and the consideration of various mixes of future uses. The collected data have been processed using latent class and mixed logit models to explore heterogeneity among interviewees' preferences. Our findings show that, while preferences clearly emerge in favor of tourism and leisure oriented uses, preferences in terms of conservation and the impact of cost are much more difficult to measure. This difficulty persists even when specified or non specified heterogeneity is taken into account, although Mixed Logit estimate provides more convincing results.";"Massiani, Jerome

Focal means are calculated at different ranges for immediate and neighborhood-wide assessment of surrounding cover. Community variables designed to describe neighborhood composition are included. Class, the measure of average size and Density, the average distance between nearby homes, are calculated at same neighborhood ranges as Focal means. Regressors also include distances to Schools, Hospitals, Airports, and Highways.Pooled Ordinary Least Squares performed with data normalized by log-transformation yields practical, statistically significant results.

In recent years, the role that vegetation heterogeneity plays in regulating arthropod populations has received particular attention in both conservation science and agricultural ecology. Numerous observational studies have demonstrated that herbivores and their natural enemies are sensitive to vegetation heterogeneity, but the individual effects of percentage land cover, degree of fragmentation and patch size remain little understood. We present here the results of a manipulative field experiment that explicitly incorporates both habitat heterogeneity and the degree to which that heterogeneity is fragmented in order to determine the effects of each factor on parasitism in an agroecosystem. We deployed combinations of broccoli (crop) and weedy vegetation (non-crop) in linear arrays that varied in their percentage devoted to crop and in the degree at which crop patches were fragmented with weeds, and recorded parasitism rates on two aphid species multiple times during two years. Parasitoids responded to the percentage of crop in plots, but not to the spatial scale at which they were fragmented.

We derive our regression equation from a spatial reaction function to allow for spatial transmission of rental prices. Results from a general spatial model show that a € 1 per hectare higher rental price in a farmer’s neighbourhood coincides with a € 0.57 higher rental price he has to pay. For policy evaluation we estimate the marginal incidence of regional EU per-hectare premiums. We find a value significantly above one and propose an explanation for this counterintuitive result based on the long-running nature of rental contracts, simultaneity of premium introduction and intervention price cuts as well as assumed stickiness of rental prices. Regional livestock density, which is indirectly influenced by different policies, is also a major determinant of rental prices.";"Breustedt, Gunnar

"AGRIS:US201400106113";"Improving Farming Practices in Municipality of Gazi, Crete, Greece";"";"A soil survey and mapping program financed by the municipality of Gazi located on the north–central part of Crete was carried out. The studied area is characterized by a moist meso-Mediterranean climate and different degrees of land degradation from human activities. Surface soil horizons are eroded, resulting in fertility decline for olive trees, the dominant crop. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture classification, the soils at higher altitudes are classified as Entisols xerorthents and those at lower altitudes as E. xerofluvents. Using a geographical information system (GIS), all spatial data from the soil survey were organized to facilitate its storage, management, and analysis. Based on topographic–geological maps and aerial photographs, other derivative data layers were calculated. Sampling points were determined using GIS. This information, and all results pertaining to the sample, was entered into a graphical database, designed to store all relevant data for each point. Data layers describing the spatial distribution of key parameters such as soil texture, pH, CaCO₃, and nutrient status were produced using geostatistical methods. Soil classification and the evaluation of soil suitability for various activities were greatly facilitated by visualization of the data as various thematic maps. Our study demonstrates the ability of GIS as an administrative tool that can assist farmers in improving farming practices.";"Charoulis, A.

"AGRIS:US2016200751";"THE DECLINE (AND REVIVAL?) OF BLACK FARMERS AND RURAL LANDOWNERS: A REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH LITERATURE";"";"African-Americans as a group went from owning almost no land in the United States after the Civil War to peaking at 15 million acres by 1920. In that year, 14% of all US farmers were black. Of these 926,000 black farmers, all but 10,000 were in the South. By 1997, fewer than 20,000, or 1% of all farmers, were black, and they owned only about two million acres. The loss of landownership and farming operations has contributed to the poverty of many rural communities in the South. This paper consists of a review of 74 journal articles, reports, chapters, and books on African-Americans and farming, comprising most of the scholarly literature on the issue published since 1971. One of the commonalities in the literature is the sense of hopelessness in stemming the tide of black land loss. On the other hand, another commonality is the view that the black farmer and rural landowner must be sustained, even brought back. Among the studies are those claiming that landowners make up the backbone of civic and political life in rural black communities. Other advantages of landownership include increased personal pride, higher educational achievement of children, and an overall better sense of wellbeing. Most of the works offer similar perspectives of the decline of blacks in farming, and suggested solutions also are often repeated in these works. But there are differences in the works, and together they cover a wide range of issues that differentiate black farmers by sub-region, state, farm size, tenure, crops raised, and social and economic situation.";"Gilbert, Jess

An 11-yr-old field experiment on a sandy loam soil in Denmark was used to compare several crop rotations with respect to a range of physical, chemical and biological characteristics related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) flows. Four organic rotations and an inorganic fertilizer-based system were selected to evaluate effects of fertilizer type, catch crops, of grass-clover used as green manure, and of animal manure application. Soil was sampled from winter wheat and spring barley plots on 19 September 2007, 14 April 2008 and 22 September 2008, i.e. before, during, and after the growth season. The soils were analyzed for multiple attributes: total soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, microbial biomass N (MBN), potentially mineralizable N (PMN), and levels of potential ammonium oxidation (PAO) and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA). In situ measurements of soil heterotrophic carbon dioxide (CO₂) respiration and nitrous oxide emissions were conducted in plots with winter wheat. In April 2008, prior to field operations, intact soil cores were collected at two depths (0-5 and 5-10cm) in plots under winter wheat. Water retention characteristics of each core were determined and used to calculate relative gas diffusivity (D P/D o). Finally, crop growth was monitored and grain yields measured at harvest maturity. The different management strategies between 1997 and 2007 led to soil carbon inputs that were on average 18-68% and 32-91% higher in the organic than inorganic fertilizer-based rotations for the sampled winter wheat and spring barley crops, respectively. Nevertheless, SOC levels in 2008 were similar across systems. The cumulative soil respiration for the period February to August 2008 ranged between 2 and 3t CO₂-C ha⁻¹ and was correlated (r =0.95) with average C inputs. In the organic cropping systems, pig slurry application and inclusion of catch crops generally increased soil respiration, PMN and PAO. At field capacity, relative gas diffusivity at 0-5cm depth was >50% higher in the organic than the inorganic fertilizer-based system (P <0.05). Crop yields in 2008 were generally lower in the low-input organic rotations than in the high-input inorganic fertilizer-based system; only spring barley in rotations with pig slurry application and incorporation of a catch crop prior to sowing obtained grain yields similar to levels achieved in the system where inorganic fertilizer was applied. These results suggest that within organic cropping systems, both microbial activity and crop yields could be enhanced through inclusion of catch crops. However, the timing of catch crop incorporation is critical.";"Chirinda, Ngonidzashe

The spatial analysis of environmental data offers multiple advantages for studying soil contamination and HHR assessment, facilitating the decision making process. The aim of this study was to explore the possibilities and benefits of spatial implementation of a quantitative HHR assessment methodology for a planning case in a typical urban environment where the soil is contaminated. The study area is located in the city of Grugliasco a part of the Turin (Italy) metropolitan area. The soils data were derived from a site specific soil survey and the land-use data from secondary sources. In the first step the soil contamination data were geo-statistically analysed and a spatial soil contamination data risk modelling procedure designed. In order to spatially assess the HHR computer routines were developed using GIS raster tools. The risk was evaluated for several different land uses for the planned naturalistic park area. The HHR assessment indicated that the contamination of soils with heavy metals in the area is not sufficient to induce considerable health problems due to typical human behaviour within the variety of urban land uses. An exception is the possibility of direct ingestion of contaminated soil which commonly occurs in playgrounds. The HHR evaluation in a planning case in the Grugliasco Municipality confirms the suitability of the selected planning option. The construction of the naturalistic park presents one solution for reducing the impacts of soil contamination on the health of citizens. The spatial HHR evaluation using GIS techniques is a diagnostic procedure for assessing the impacts of urban soil contamination, with which one can verify planning options, and provides an important step in the integration of human health protection within urban planning procedures.";"Poggio, Laura

The concomitant large-scale transformation of landscapes can have profound social impacts and trigger political conflict that hampers resource management. This paper explores the link between landscape transformations and political conflict using the example of the bark beetle epidemic in Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany. For a significant part of the local population, the bark beetle represented a threat to their homeland and the post-disturbance landscape of dead wood reflected the dominance of outside interests in land management. This resentment sparked the formation of a local political movement, which was successful in pressing for changes in the current land management policy that were based on the ideal of a green forest landscape that needed to be protected by human intervention. An alternative interpretation of the post-disturbance landscape, however, welcomed it as a step towards authentic wilderness and opposed interventions to control the bark beetle. These contrasting understandings of the post-disturbance landscape underpin the protracted political conflict over the appropriate management of natural disturbance that has been smouldering for more than 20 years. The article concludes that it is vital to understand the cultural meaning of landscapes before adopting a disturbance management policy in order to avoid paralysing political conflict and social unrest.";"Müller, Martin";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"DEU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400180143";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.05.004";"";"";"";"935-946"

We believe that maintaining Delaware's agriculture as a viable land-use alternative depends on the success in addressing three critical challenges. First, will residential, commercial, and industrial land uses be forced to bear the full costs that their land-use decisions visit on Delaware agriculture? Alternatively, will agriculture be fully compensated for its contribution to Delaware's economy and quality of life? An associated, second challenge, is whether state, county, and local governments will institute incentive-based policies to achieve socially desirable land-use outcomes? It is particularly important that there exist policies to protect and to promote diverse land uses within all three counties. Finally, will spatial land-use patterns evolve, which ensure that agriculture maintains the critical masses necessary for the industry's economic viability and which insulate producers from the complaints and threats of nonagricultural neighbors? This paper expands on these three challenges and then reviews data on trends in agricultural land use to draw conclusions.";"Duke, Joshua M.

To assist conservation planners in the future management of these habitats, this study outlines the changes that have occurred in these environments using data for the years 1900, 1956, 1984 and 2007. Multiple logistic regression models allowed the accurate projection of locations of wetlands that need to be restored or regenerated. These models were developed using a combination of 19 explanatory variables including: data related to historic lakelets, variations in the surfaces of wetlands, soil physicochemical and weather data, and socioeconomic and spatial planning data, as depicted by thematic mapping. The landscape used for projecting the wetlands in the study area was classified into five categories based on the probability of the presence of lakelets: very low, low, medium, high and very high. These generated maps show that the spatial extent of the wetlands of the Tierra de Campos district was 2.78Â % in 1900â1933 and decreased to 0.65Â % in 2007â2008. Accordingly, a dramatic decrease in the spatial extent covered by these ecosystems is observed over the twentieth century according to these maps; consequently these results highlight the effects of positive (protective) or negative (desiccative) policies implemented in the area.";"SÃ¡nchez-GonzÃ¡lez, S.

"AGRIS:US201500010162";"Land tenure and REDD+: The good, the bad and the ugly";"";"A number of international donors, national governments and project proponents have begun to lay the groundwork for REDD+, but tenure insecurity – including the potential risks of land grabbing by outsiders and loss of local user rights to forests and forest land – is one of the main reasons that many indigenous and other local peoples have publicly opposed it. Under what conditions is REDD+ a threat to local rights, and under what conditions does it present an opportunity? This article explores these issues based on available data from a global comparative study on REDD+, led by the Center for International Forestry Research, which is studying national policies and processes in 12 countries and 23 REDD+ projects in 6 countries. The article analyses how tenure concerns are being addressed at both national and project level in emerging REDD+ programs. The findings suggest that in most cases REDD+ has clearly provided some new opportunities for securing local tenure rights, but that piecemeal interventions by project proponents at the local level are insufficient in the absence of broader, national programs for land tenure reform. The potential for substantial changes in the status quo appear unlikely, though Brazil – the only one with such a national land tenure reform program – offers useful insights. Land tenure reform – the recognition of customary rights in particular – and a serious commitment to REDD+ both challenge the deep-rooted economic and political interests of ‘business as usual’.";"Larson, Anne M.

In fire-prone landscapes, vegetative change may be especially rapid and cause significant local stream temperature increases but the importance of these increases relative to broader changes associated with air temperature and hydrology are not well understood. We linked a spatially explicit landscape fire and vegetation model (FireBGCv2) to an empirical regression equation that predicted daily stream temperatures to explore how climate change and its impacts on fire might affect stream thermal conditions across a partially forested, mountainous landscape in the western U.S. We used the model to understand the roles that wildfire and management actions such as fuel reduction and fire suppression could play in mitigating stream thermal responses to climate change. Results indicate that air temperature increases associated with future climates could account for a much larger proportion of stream temperature increases (as much as 90� % at a basin scale) than wildfire. Similarly, land management scenarios that limited wildfire prevalence had negligible effects on future stream temperature increases. These patterns emerged at broader spatial scales because wildfires typically affected only a subset of a stream’s network. However, at finer spatial and temporal scales stream temperatures were sensitive to wildfire. Although wildfires will continue to cause local, short-term effects on stream temperatures, managers of aquatic systems may need to find other solutions to cope with the larger impact from climate change on future stream warming that involves adapting to the increases while developing broad strategies for riparian vegetation restoration.";"Holsinger, Lisa

The concept of potentially mineralisable N (N ₀) and its determination procedures were re-appraised in this study. Leaching soil before incubation removed considerable amounts of soluble organic N. But the leached soils had higher rates of net N mineralisation than the unleached controls during a subsequent 2-week incubation, suggesting that using the total amount of leached- (organic + inorganic) N for calculating N ₀ may not be warranted. N ₀ and the mineralisation rate constant k estimated with the conventional model-fitting technique varied significantly with soil, incubation time, temperature and moisture, without consistent trends. To obtain an N ₀ value that is unequivocally indicative of soil N mineralisation capacity, the incubation should be conducted under standardised temperature (35°C) and moisture (55–65% water holding capacity or –30 to –10 kPa) conditions, and a standard mineralisation rate constant (k̄=0.054 week–¹) should be used for all soils. Assuming that N ₀ for a soil does not change with environmental conditions, its value was then fixed as a constant when fitting the first-order kinetic model to estimate k under non-standard conditions. This technique eliminated the confounding relationship between N ₀ and k, which is inherent in the conventional curve-fitting procedure, and thus basically precluded the effect of incubation time on N ₀ estimation. The resultant N ₀ represents not only the quantity, but also the quality of substrates and their interaction with the soil matrix. The k values showed close and consistent relationships with temperature and moisture.";"Wang, W. J.

This study explores the environmental factors controlling the spatial and temporal variation of DOC in terrestrial ecosystems of a watershed southeast of Boston, Massachusetts. Our hypothesis is that environmental factors: stream flow, land cover type, vegetation density, and drainage area are significant in estimating DOC export from an urban watershed. The hypothesized environmental factors were statistically correlated to the variation of the sampled in-stream DOC concentrations at annual, seasonal, and daily scales. For the purpose of scaling up to a large watershed that lacks dense gauged hydrological data or for projection of future scenarios, we examined the effectiveness of using simulated stream flow for studying terrestrial DOC dynamics. Our results demonstrated that all hypothesized environmental factors except vegetation density were particularly strong predictors in watersheds with a large proportion of developed (urban) area. The resulting linear model is able to explain about 76% (R²=0.76) and 64% (R²=0.64) of the variance of in-stream DOC concentrations at seasonal and annual scales respectively. Results suggest that more frequent DOC sampling than once each month is required to establish the quantitative relationship between simulated stream flows from a Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and in-stream DOC concentrations at daily scale. Using a hydrological model is effective for studying the impacts of climate and human activities on DOC export to aquatic ecosystems at appropriate scales.";"Tian, Yong Q.

(2)Proper fiscal planning is essential. (3) Potentially successful farmers must be selected and given special support, including extension and adult education. Existing extension services are generally not adequate, particularly in the fields of finance and marketing. (4) Complementary services and infrastructure are needed in the form of improved access to financial services, markets and inputs and also improved transport, health, communications and other infrastructure.

"AGRIS:US201500204636";"Voluntary Nonmonetary Conservation Approaches on Private Land: A Review of Constraints, Risks, and Benefits for Raptor Nest Protection";"";"Biodiversity conservation on private land of the developed world faces several challenges. The costs of land are often high, and the attitudes of landowners towards conservation are variable. Scientists and practitioners need to scan for and adopt cost-effective solutions that allow for the long-term sustainability of conservation measures on private land. In this study, we focus on one of such possible solutions: Working with landowners to implement voluntary nonmonetary conservation. We restrict our focus to protection of raptor nests, but the ideas can be applied to other taxa as well. Through a literature review, we show that a voluntary nonmonetary approach for protecting raptor nests has been so far largely neglected and/or rarely reported in the scientific literature. However, results of a questionnaire sent to BirdLife partners across Europe indicate that this approach is more widely used than it appears from the literature. We show that voluntary nonmonetary approaches may represent useful tools to protect raptor nests on private land. We provide a workflow for implementation of such an approach in raptor nest protection, highlighting benefits, potential risks, and constraints in the application of the strategy. We suggest that a voluntary nonmonetary approach may have great potential for cost-effective conservation, but the risks it may entail should be carefully assessed in each case. There is an urgent need to consider and evaluate novel approaches, such as the one described here, which may constitute missed opportunities for cost-effective conservation.";"Santangeli, Andrea

"AGRIS:US201400162972";"Does landscape composition affect pest abundance and their control by natural enemies? A review";"";"Landscape management could contribute to sustainable pest control. Landscape composition, in particular, could either directly impact a pest abundance by affecting its dispersal, mortality or reproduction, or indirectly by affecting its natural enemies. We performed an analysis of the scientific literature to assess how the proportion of different land covers at the landscape level is related to the abundance of pests or to their control by natural enemies. Of 72 independent case studies, 45 reported an effect of landscape composition. Results confirmed the suspected suppressive effect of landscape scale amounts of semi-natural areas on in-field pests: landscapes with higher proportions of semi-natural areas exhibited lower pest abundance or higher pest control in fields. Contrarily, there was no clear direction in relationships between pests and pest control and landscape when the latter was described as the overall proportion of cultivated area or as that of crops host to particular pests. The analysis of original articles indicates that this lack of direction may be due to the diversity of land use intensity in the studied landscapes and to a too rough categorizing of land covers. This pleads for a better consideration of the functionality of crops and of their management in landscapes.";"Veres, Andrea

There are a number of empirical valuation methods that may contribute to that assessment. These methods involve several steps: data acquisition, model specification and estimation. In this paper, this approach is illustrated in the context of a survey regarding alternative management strategies for a forest area in Central Portugal by implementing a contingent valuation experiment where an advanced landscape visualisation technique is employed to generate the visual information conveyed in the valuation scenarios. Several econometric model specifications are considered as well as alternative approaches to handle zero willingness to pay values and protest responses. The results obtained suggest the potential of the proposed approach for an effective comparison of alternative forest management strategies.";"Madureira, Lívia

"AGRIS:US201500217855";"sustainable model for the management of olive orchards located in semi-arid marginal areas: Some remarks and indications for policy makers";"";"Traditional olive growing can survive only by improving olive farmer income and recognizing its multifunctional role. In this study, we propose a sustainable management model which entails the recycling of urban wastewater and its distribution by drip irrigation and the use of soil management techniques based on the recycling of polygenic carbon sources internal to the olive orchard (cover crops, pruning material). The model was applied for a 8-year period in an olive orchard located in a semi-arid marginal area of Southern Italy. An analysis is performed to evaluate the economical sustainability of the proposed model in comparison to the conventional management system (rainfed conditions, tillage, empirical fertilization, biennial pruning and pruned material burning). Furthermore, the study assesses the environmental benefits coming from the application of the examined orchard management systems focusing especially on CO₂ stocks in plants and soil, and anthropogenic and natural CO₂ emissions. The sustainable model appears productive and profitable, socially and environmentally sustainable. The significant income received every year by olive growers can persuade them to remain in the territory limiting the urgent phenomena of orchard abandonment, preserving typical landscape, and carrying out an ecological control role against land degradation processes.";"Palese, Assunta Maria

The objective of this study was to quantify the spatio‐temporal land cover/land use changes across the Lake Hayq closed drainage basin in north‐east Ethiopia over a 50‐years period, using multitemporal remote sensing and geospatial data. Two historical occasions of aerial photographs (1957 and 1986) and one satellite image (2007) were examined with image analysis tools: Leica Photogrammetric Suite (LPS 9.2) Project Manager, ArcGIS10.0, and ERDAS EMAGINE 9.2. Seven aerial coverage of land use/land cover categories were identified and mapped for the past three historical times. The results indicated that farmlands/settlements and shrublands/degraded lands increased by 43.1% and 136.9%, at an annual rate of 27.4 and 13.5 ha year⁻¹, respectively, between 1957 and 2007. In contrast, bushlands, grasslands, forestlands and lake surface area were diminished by 68.8%, 62.7%, 90.5% and 7.6%, at a rate of 24.0, 7.6, 6.1 and 3.7 ha year⁻¹, respectively, over the past five decades. The basin had undergone significant transformation in land use/land cover over the past half century, affecting the lake's biophysical stability by accelerating soil erosion in the basin, sediment accumulation, and a reduced quantity and quality of cumulative stream flow into the lake.";"Yesuf, Hassen M.

Based on a method combining surveys, interviews, observation, and a meta-analysis of the literature, this study explored the roles of science in institutional changes associated with desertification control in northern China. There are five major results of this study: (1) the application of science significantly improved the outcome of desertification control by influencing several aspects of institutional changes; (2) the major aspects of the institutional changes were identified (major actors in desertification control, desertification control methods, types of property rights, and laws and regulations); (3) the effects of applied scientific desertification control measures (SDCM) had more impacts on institutional changes than the extents of adoption and implementation of the measures; (4) six scientific areas had the greatest effects on institutional changes of desertification control were observed (agricultural science and technology, land development and construction planning, agricultural pest control, knowledge of forestry, knowledge of combating desertification and dust storms, and general knowledge of climate); and (5) the most important factors influencing the application effects of science on institutional change in desertification control were governmental behaviors, governmental attitudes toward the application of science, understanding of local knowledge, local conditions, local people, and effectiveness in science and technology transformation and extension. These findings shed new light on the influence of scientific measures on institutional changes by addressing large-scale, chronic environmental problems, such as desertification control in China and in other arid lands around the world.";"Yang, Lihua

"AGRIS:US201400173779";"Is Eating Locally a Moral Obligation?";"";"Advocates of eating locally offer a wide range of arguments in favor of the practice, but their ethical import is not always clear. Some locavore statements and arguments seem to imply a strong form of moral obligation; that eating locally is not merely instrumental to some other good, but has intrinsic value in its own right. This article examines standard arguments on behalf of eating locally, including arguments linked to the value of small farms and agrarianism, the environment, taste and health, trust, and relational markets. Most arguments put forward on behalf of eating locally value it instrumentally, the main exception being arguments based on relational markets. Although these arguments provide important motives for eating locally, the strength of obligation varies widely, and even the strongest arguments possess significant qualifications. While eating locally can play a role in reducing environmental impacts, this is not necessarily so, and once removed from instrumental considerations, eating locally is more likely at best an imperfect duty.";"Peterson, Gregory R.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400173779";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-012-9397-8";"";"";"";"421-437"

This paper introduces a number of post disaster coastal villages/settlements, which are in future coastline hazard risk, mainly in a future tsunami event. These include their location risk, land uses and housing designs defects and shortcomings of other safety measures. Furthermore few tsunami risk mitigation measures through land use planning strategies, which could be applied more easily in community level, are introduced.

The analysis employs a frequently used behavioural economics method, namely structural equation modelling (SEM). Central to the empirical analysis in this paper is a cross-section database containing data collected in May to June 2009 through telephone interviews of 600 land managers in Scotland. The model tests and estimates the relationships between land use behaviour, i.e., behavioural intentions to change the size of business/holding, and several of its a priori determinants found significant in the scientific literature. The results indicate that a stronger propensity to change size of their businesses is exhibited by younger land managers who intend to pass their land on to family, with larger land size and stronger attitudes towards increasing it, with lower percentage of their income made up from Government support, who are less likely to have perceived changes in regulation and input/output prices as having an impact on their business, who discuss and plan changes in size of business with their banks/building societies, and frequently access sources of information to help with their strategic decisions.";"Toma, Luiza

Members of WTO, including India are taking earnest efforts to protect the sovereign rights over crop genetic resources and biodiversity by enacting specific Acts. A deep knowledge about these Acts and their implications is essential for achieving their specific goals. India has implemented Protection of Plant Varieties & Farmers Rights Act, 2001 to protect IP rights over unique farmer cultivars, traditional cultivars, extant cultivars and new cultivars in crops. The Biodiversity Act provides protection of germplasm available in the country by regularizing access to biodiversity, its sustainable use, conservation and benefit sharing arising from use of biodiversity. The Geographical Indications (Registration and Protection) Act-1999 provides for the protection and management of IP rights of communities over unique cashew products. Fenny is a unique product of cashew from Goa and this has been accepted as a Geographical Indication (GIs) from our country. Similarly, there are other cashew products in different parts of our country that can be protected and marketed as GIs in national and international markets.

In this study, we investigated changes in ecosystem C stocks (ECS) after establishing exclosures on degraded communal grazing lands, and identified easily measurable biophysical and management-related factors that can be used to predict ECS restoration in the highlands of Tigray, Ethiopia. We selected replicated (n = 3) 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-yr-old exclosures and paired each exclosure with an adjacent communal grazing land. All exclosures displayed higher ECS than the communal grazing lands. Differences in ECS between exclosures and grazing lands varied between 29 (±4.9) and 61 (±6.7) Mg C ha−1 and increased with exclosure duration. In exclosures, much of the variability in ECS was explained by a combination of the following variables: precipitation, clay content, vegetation canopy cover, woody biomass, and exclosure duration (R 2 = 0.77–0.90). Precipitation and vegetation canopy cover also explained much of the variability of ECS in communal grazing lands (R 2 = 0.48–0.55). Our results help to establish baseline information for C sequestration projects and to predict the expected ecosystem C sequestration under exclosures. Expansion of exclosures would increase grazing pressure on the remaining communal grazing area. Therefore, the decision to establish additional exclosures should also include an economic analysis and an evaluation of the social consequences.";"Mekuria, Wolde

The 'region' of tropical and sub-tropical South and Southeast Asia stretches from the Himalayas and the southern border of China in the north, to Sri Lanka and Indonesia in the south, and from Pakistan in the west to the islands of New Guinea in the far east. The regional land-cover map is based on sub-regional digital mapping results derived from SPOT-VEGETATION satellite data for the years 1998-2000. Image processing, digital classification and thematic mapping were performed separately for the three sub-regions of South Asia, continental Southeast Asia, and insular Southeast Asia. Landsat TM images, field data and existing national maps served as references. We used the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for coding the sub-regional land-cover classes and for aggregating the latter to a uniform regional legend. A validation was performed based on a systematic grid of sample points, referring to visual interpretation from high-resolution Landsat imagery. Regional land-cover area estimates were obtained and compared with FAO statistics for the categories 'forest' and 'cropland'. The regional map displays 26 land-cover classes. The LCCS coding provided a standardized class description, independent from local class names; it also allowed us to maintain the link to the detailed sub-regional land-cover classes. The validation of the map displayed a mapping accuracy of 72% for the dominant classes of 'forest' and 'cropland'; regional area estimates for these classes correspond reasonably well to existing regional statistics. The land-cover map of South and Southeast Asia provides a synoptic view of the distribution of land cover of tropical and sub-tropical Asia, and it delivers reasonable thematic detail and quantitative estimates of the main land-cover proportions. The map may therefore serve for regional stratification or modelling of vegetation cover, but could also support the implementation of forest policies, watershed management or conservation strategies at regional scales.";"Stibig, H.-J.

In spite of the biological and ecological relevance of this biome, there is little information about how land use changes affect the chemistry of low-order streams in the Cerrado. To evaluate these effects streams that drain areas under natural, rural, and urban land cover were sampled near Brasília, Brazil. Water samples were collected between September 2004 and December 2006. Chemical concentrations generally followed the pattern of Urban > Rural > Natural. Median conductivity of stream water of 21.6 (interquartile: 22.7) μS/cm in urban streams was three and five-fold greater relative to rural and natural areas, respectively. In the wet season, despite of increasing discharge, concentration of many solutes were higher, particularly in rural and natural streams. Streams also presented higher total dissolved N (TDN) loads from natural to rural and urban although DIN:DON ratios did not differ significantly. In natural and urban streams TDN was 80 and 77% dissolved organic N, respectively. These results indicate that alterations in land cover from natural to rural and urban are changing stream water chemistry in the Cerrado with increasing solute concentrations, in addition to increased TDN output in areas under urban cover, with potential effects on ecosystem function.";"Silva, José Salomão Oliveira

This growth chamber experiment subjected intact plant–soil cylinders from a Wyoming, USA, prairie to a 3‐way factorial of CO2 (370 vs. 720 μL L−1), defoliation (non‐clipped vs. clipped) and soil nitrogen (control vs. 10 g m−2 added N) under simulated natural climatic conditions. Above‐ and below‐ground biomass and N dynamics of the functional groups C3 grasses, C4 grasses and forbs were investigated. CO2 and defoliation had independent influences on biomass and N parameters of these rangeland plants. Growth under CO2‐enriched conditions enhanced above‐ground biomass 50% in C3 grasses alone, while shoot N concentration declined 16% in both C3 and C4 grasses. Plant‐soil 15N uptake was unaffected by CO2 treatment. In contrast, defoliation had no effect on biomass, but increased tissue N concentration 29% across all functional groups. Without additional N, forage quality, which is in direct relation to N concentration, will decline under increasing atmospheric CO2. Increased dominance of C3 grasses plus reduced forage quality may necessitate changes in grazing management practices in mixed‐species rangelands.";"LeCain, D. R.

"AGRIS:US201600126780";"Economic development, institutions, and biodiversity loss at the global scale";"";"Current accelerating biodiversity loss is by many conservationists regarded as a result of economic development. Some economists agree on this viewpoint but argue it is valid at low income levels because of the need to secure a minimum living standard. On the other hand, economic development at higher income levels can instead mitigate biodiversity loss because of improved willingness and affordability to implement measures such as protected areas. This so-called environmental Kuznets relation is tested in this study by econometric analysis of cross-sectional data on a global scale. However, the results do not support this relation. Instead, we found a relation between economic and institutional development where economic development decreases biodiversity loss at a minimum level of institutional quality, i.e. minimum capacity to implement and secure property rights for the citizens. Our results thus question policies that neglect institutional quality for reversing biodiversity loss. Further, it was found that biodiversity loss increases with invasive species, high average temperature and precipitation, and spatial autocorrelation.";"Gren, Ing-Marie

"AGRIS:US201500217583";"Legal barriers to 3D cadastre implementation: What is the issue?";"";"The ways society use and occupy space occur in multiple dimensions; however, the ways we manage and administer space relies on two-dimensional information representations (2D). The legal ambiguity and administrative limitations inherent in such practices are becoming increasingly pronounced within land administration especially for urban areas. In response, a research domain has emerged – termed by specialists as ‘3D Cadastres’ – to seek greater correspondence between the administration of legal land and property (parcel) boundaries and the reality of physical bounds of structures themselves. Within this corpus of literature, advances in the technical domain are evident. However, other areas of research have not experienced the same degree of attention, with a particular lag in analysis of legal issues: this apparently explains the lack of progress in the realisation of operational 3D cadastres. However, given many countries actually already administer ownership of 3D property within current statutory frameworks, is the continued concentration on legal issues a red herring? Are legal issues significant barriers to implementation, and if not, what other considerations are there? This position paper, comprising two main sections, aims to consider, clarify and reconceptualise the significance of the law as an obstacle to implementation of 3D cadastres. It does this by firstly reviewing the legal issues articulated within the literature and examining the extent of its impact using current practical examples. This leads to the conclusion that finding alternative methods and processes to overcome perceived legal issues actually facilitates progress towards 3D property registration and therefore, 3D cadastre implementation. This challenges the dominant assumption that legal issues are a significant barrier. The paper then proposes to consider the influence of legal issues through an institutional lens, as a way of gaining other insights into how legal issues can influence 3D cadastre implementation. The introduction of institutional theory and a theoretical framework provides a way to reconceptualise the role of legal issues in 3D cadastre implementation. The framework is further used as a sensitising mechanism for discussing broad-based institutional issues that have as yet, not been given significant consideration in the literature. The paper concludes with a response to the main research question and the proposition that significant barriers to 3D cadastre implementation lies not in technological or legal issues, but the more fundamental social and cultural issues that make up the institutional framework underpinning cadastral systems.";"Ho, Serene

"AGRIS:US201500217587";"Will urban farming survive the growth of African cities: A case-study in Kampala (Uganda)?";"";"Despite the fact that urban farming is widespread in many African cities there is not yet a clearly defined view on how to deal with these activities in urban planning and management. On the basis of field interviews in the rapidly expanding metropolitan area of Kampala (Uganda) three different urban farming types were identified: subsistence farming, garden farming and commercial farming. These three urban farming types have their own spatial organisation logic and each interact in a specific way with urban expansion. In this paper the possible outcome of three alternative urban management strategies for Kampala (urban sprawl, urban infilling and a combination of both) were translated into spatially explicit land use scenarios for the years 2020 and 2030. This allowed to evaluate the spatial impact of each scenario on the future viability of the different urban farming practices. Urban sprawl fragments large open spaces thereby reducing the space for subsistence farming with 80% by 2030. Urban infilling, on the other hand, decreases the opportunities for small to medium scale garden and commercial farming by a possible reduction of 62% of the available farming land by 2030. The results of the analysis are useful for urban planners as they give insight in the potential future effects of proposed planning strategies on urban farming.";"Vermeiren, Karolien

"AGRIS:US2016204647";"Localizing Demand and Supply of Environmental Services: Interactions With Property Rights, Collective Action and the Welfare of the Poor";"";"Payments for environmental services (PES) are increasingly discussed asappropriate mechanisms for matching the demand for environmental services with theincentives of land users whose actions modify the supply of those environmentalservices. While there has been considerable discussion of the institutional mechanismsfor PES, relatively little attention has been given to the inter-relationships between PESinstitutions and other rural institutions. This paper presents and builds upon theproposition that both the function and welfare effects of PES institutions depend cruciallyon the co-institutions of collective action (CA) and property rights (PR).Experience from around the developing world has shown that smallholder landusers can be efficient producers of environmental services of value to larger communitiesand societies. However, experience also shows that the international and nationalinstitutions that govern PES are often designed in ways that entail transaction costs thatcannot be feasibly met by individual smallholders. Collective action can provide amechanism for farmers to coordinate actions over large areas to provide environmentalservices such as biodiversity and watershed protection. Collective action also offers thepotential to reduce the costs of monitoring and certification usually required to obtainpayments for the services. However, the nature of the environmental services willinfluence the scale and type of collective action needed, the bargaining power ofsmallholders, and the investment or reinvestment requirements.The relationships between property rights and environmental services are morecomplex. The creation of PES institutions itself actually represents the creation of newforms of property and responsibility, with all of the tensions and tradeoffs that areentailed. How are balances struck, for example, between people’s responsibilities not topollute and the need to compensate people for foregoing polluting activities? What aboutbalances between constitutional rights to safe environment and the right to earn alivelihood?In carbon sequestration arrangements, secure property rights are often seen as anecessary pre-condition for binding contracts, even though collective forms of propertymay generate high quality environmental services. On the other hand, environmentalservices can influence property rights, notably where land or water tenure are given asrewards for certain types of services, land use, or stewardship. The type ofenvironmental service, and the possibility of exclusion it provides, is also likely toinfluence the type of property rights.This paper presents a conceptual framework that clarifies the inter-linkagesbetween property rights, collective action, payment for environmental services, and thewelfare of smallholder land users. The framework is centered on concerns of functionand welfare effects of PES. The functional perspective clarifies the effects of collectiveaction and property rights institutions on the supply of environmental services. Thewelfare perspective considers smallholders as one of several potential sources of supply, sometimes directly competing against large landowners and public sector providers.Using this conceptual framework can help to identify conditions under whichsmallholders are likely to be able to participate in payment for environmental servicesschemes. Greater consideration of the linkages between PES and other rural institutionscan lead to more equitable outcomes, particularly by 1) suggesting how collective actioncan be used to overcome transaction costs and barriers to participation by smallholders,and 2) identifying mechanisms through which managers of small private parcels or areasof common property can be rewarded for environmental stewardship through PES.";"Swallow, Brent M.

The goal of this paper is to dispute this claim and describe a particular feedback mechanism through which the foreign land ownership can become a barrier for growth and development. The main result of this paper suggests that a policy proposal to enhance the process of growth and development through foreign land ownership accompanied by the transfer of agricultural technology may not always succeed. It is important to recognize that apart from benefits, foreign land ownership can sometimes become an impediment for growth.

Lessons from mining and forestry and their implications for REDD+";"";"The principle of “Free, Prior and Informed Consent” (FPIC) is promoted through international agreements and safeguards in order to strengthen social equity in resource management by requiring consent from indigenous and/or local communities prior to actions that affect their land and resource rights. Based on early experiences with implementing FPIC standards in mining and forestry, we examine how FPIC has impacted social equity and why. In both sectors FPIC was first operationalized through non-governmental standards that revealed ambiguities surrounding its definition and implementation. In mining, FPIC was first codified in the standards of financial investors, while in forestry FPIC emerged within competing market-based certification schemes, resulting in contrasting definitions. In both sectors, contextual factors such as government laws and policies, the socio-political environment and the overall distribution of rights and resources strongly shape the impacts of FPIC on equity particularly for actors without strong legal rights. These findings are significant for emerging arenas such as REDD+, where there is much debate around the role of governments, financial institutions and market-based actors in applying FPIC for social equity outcomes.";"Mahanty, Sango

Against this background, it has long been recognized that clarifying property rights to land can enhance economic growth through a number of channels: 
- The mean macroeconomic view is that the land has to be provided and used by government and non-governmental institutions, local community and the private sector for a wide range of purposes. Enforced property rights and security will also increase incentives for land-demand related to investment and thus overall economic output. In that way, the enforcement of property rights to land will provide incentive for good natural resources management
- Efficient mechanisms for enforcing the land access and property rights exchange or transfer, are a precondition to promote the land productivity, increase agriculture output and can be used for credit as collateral in the transaction.

In this regard, the government of Ghana introduced a modified taungya system as a mechanism to restore degraded forest reserves under the National Forest Plantation Development Programme to allow landless farmers access to land for temporary crop production and secured tree tenure rights. However, there is an information gap concerning the role of individual farmers residing in the off-reserve areas that are dominated by agricultural landscapes in this national reforestation drive. The objective of this paper is to determine the socioeconomic factors influencing farmers' decisions to participate in voluntary tree planting projects in rural communities in Ghana. Two hundred twenty farm households from four communities in Wenchi District, Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression modelling was employed to understand the socioeconomic factors influencing a farmer's decision to participate in voluntary tree planting. The results suggest that secured land tenure rights, large landholdings and on-farm conservation of remnant forest tree species by farmers and the dynamics of soil erosion are key variables that significantly and positively influence farmers' decision to engage in voluntary tree planting. However, large household size and increasing cultivated land area under crop production decrease the likelihood that a farmer will be involved in voluntary tree planting in the target communities. Thus, policy-makers, planners and project designers should incorporate these findings into participatory forest management strategies in Ghana.";"Danquah, Jones Abrefa";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"deforestation;farmers;land ownership;land tenure";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"GHA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600100631";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14728028.2015.1025862";"";"";"";"176-189"

Cadastre text and spatial data regarding cadastre objects, which are located in the territory of Latvia, are registered and maintained in the Cadastre information system. In order to specify the value of particular cadastre object, four models of cadastral assessment are developed. These models provide cadastral assessment of all cadastre objects registered in the Cadastre information system. Cadastral assessment models are approved by regulations of Cabinet No.305, adopted 18 April 2006 ''Regulations regarding Cadastral Assessment'', and they are:  (1) model of the cadastral value for building land; (2) model of the cadastral value for the rural land of the rural area; (3) model of the cadastral value of a building; (4) model of the cadastral value of an engineering structure. For calculation of the cadastral value the following data registered in the information system of Cadastre are used - cadastral value base, data characterising cadastre object, purposes of use and encumbrances. Main conclusion of the research is - in models of cadastral assessment cadastre data are very important. Because cadastral value have to be calculated for 1.3 million cadastre objects, the quality and actuality of cadastre data is very important.

The resimulatedbaseline model was used to make projections based on the various trends ofexogenous variables in 2000. This means that the model generated an artificial data set basedon what the maize market would have looked like under a set of the pre-2000 existent policyconditions. The ‘fast track’ land reform policy was thus assessed based on the performanceof the baseline model using a range of “what if” assumptions. Commercial area harvestedwas 39 % less than what could have been harvested in 2001, and declining by negative80.57 % in 2007. Results showed total maize production was 61.85 % and 43.88 % less thanwhat could have been produced in the 2002 and 2005 droughts, respectively. This may implythat droughts would have been less severe if the ‘fast track’ land reform was notimplemented. Therefore, the ‘fast track’ land reform had a negative effect on maize production. Thus, the econometric model system developed provided a basis through whichthe effects of the FTLRP on the maize market may be analyzed and understood.";"Kapuya, T.

The protocol was applied in rural land planning at Balcarce, a department representative of the Southeast Pampas Region (Argentina). The ecosystem services approach was used as valuation criteria of the 14 principal ecosystems classified in the studied area, where agricultural is the predominant economic activity. The provision of seven principal ecosystem services related to regulation functions or food production was estimated for each ecosystem using a set of indicators integrating climatic, vegetation and terrain variables. The assessment of land use changes showed a significant increase in agriculture in the past 20 years, which affected mainly natural grasslands. The environmental impact of this replacement varied according to the ecosystem and the area. Hills and riparian zones were identified as key areas for grassland conservation in order to provide regulation ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. On the basis of this analysis, a preliminary zoning was proposed, aimed to retain critical support and regulation ecosystem services without significantly sacrificing food production for humans. Strategic environmental assessment based on ecosystem services appears as a powerful tool to prevent negative environmental costs of land use plans which can remain unnoticed under traditional environmental impact assessment techniques.";"Barral, María Paula

Agricultural land sales, land areas and market prices are observed and evaluated under the size structure of the sold sites and their anticipated further utilization in the counties Dunajska Streda, Topolcany, Rimavska Sobota, Liptovsky Mikulas, Michalovce and Svidnik and for all observed counties as a whole. The average price of the sold land sites is to a large extent influenced by their size, location and the purpose of further utilisation. The land sites of small area characterized as agricultural land are sold for the highest prices. They already figure in the development studies and the land-use plans of the villages or they are regarded as future building sites. Therefore, the sold sites were divided into two categories in accordance with the expected further land utilization as follows: 1) area above 1 ha of agricultural land for further agricultural utilization; 2) area smaller than 1 ha for building, recreational or other utilization.";"Buday, S.,Vyskumny Ustav Ekonomiky Polnohospodarstva a Potravinarstva, Bratislava (Slovak Republic)";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-01-31";"en";"land policies;farmland;land markets;land economics";"Land & Investments";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"SVK";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=CZ2011000279";"http://www.agriculturejournals.cz/web/AGRICECON.htm";"";"";"";"1-10"
"AGRIS:US201400184490";"Flora biodiversity change detection: a case study";"";"Changes in flora biodiversity are a dilemma facing managers in order to cope with challenges of extinction or endangering plant species as well as replacement by invasive species. Such problems can occur in the region as disruption of ecosystem balance. The first step of proper management of a watershed is obtaining accurate information about plant communities and their dominance and biodiversity status. Such information will help decision makers to adopt an appropriate management approach. Accordingly, the current study was conducted to detect various types of plant species in Zanjanrood Watershed. For this porous, quadrate and transect methods were applied to determine available plant species in the region. Afterwards, Shannon and Simpson’s Reciprocal indices were used to specify the biodiversity status of the identified communities. The calculation results revealed 3.19 and 5.98 for Shannon and Simpson’s Reciprocal indices, respectively. As the results suggested, there has been a downward trend in biodiversity status over the last 20� years. Such a deteriorating condition has been accelerated rise in recent years so that the non-palatable species are rapidly replaced by the palatable ones due to uncontrolled overgrazing of livestock. If management is not based on principles of sustainability in the region, the watershed will experience an extreme poverty of land cover. The findings would be so helpful to achieve an appropriate strategy in order to conserve the biodiversity in a sustainable manner.";"Madani, Nooshin

"AGRIS:US201300881379";"Water use and productivity of two small reservoir irrigation schemes in Ghana's Upper East Region";"";"To examine the impact of small reservoir irrigation development in Africa, the performance and productivity of two small reservoirs and irrigation schemes in the Upper East Region of Ghana were investigated in this study. Hydrologic data measured included daily irrigation volumes and daily evaporation. Farmer cost inputs, excluding labor, and harvest data were also recorded. There was a strong contrast in water availability between the two systems, the Tanga system having a higher amount of available water than did the Weega system. The concept of relative water supply was used to confirm this disparity; Tanga was an inefficient system with a relative water supply of 5.7, compared to a value of 2.4 for the efficient Weega system. It was also concluded that the dissimilar water availabilities resulted in the evolution of very different irrigation methods and coincided with different management structures. Where there was more water available per unit land (Tanga), management was relaxed and the irrigation inefficient. Where there was less water available per unit land (Weega), management was well structured and irrigation efficient. The productivity of water (US$ m⁻³) of the Tanga system was half that of the Weega system, when analyzed at a high market price for crops grown. In terms of productivity of cultivated land (US$ ha⁻¹), however, the Tanga system was 49% more productive than the Weega system. The difference in the productivity of land is primarily a result of increased farmer cash inputs in the Tanga system as compared to the Weega system. The difference in the productivity of water can be attributed to the varying irrigation methods and management structures, and ultimately to the contrasting water availability.

"AGRIS:US201500225240";"Analysis of Rural Landscape and Land Fragmentation Through GIS in the Gjocaj Commune, Albania";"Analyse der Landnutzung und Landparzellierung über das GIS in der Gemeinde GJOCAJ, Albanien";"After the downfall of the socialist economic system in 1990, Albania underwent an agriculture reform in 1992. After the reform execution, all agricultural land was redistributed among village residents. The subsequent land segmentation lead to extreme agriculture production implications.Gjocaj Commune is located in the centre of Albania at the Peqin District part of the Elbasan Region, which is a typical agricultural area, very close to Tirana and not far from the Adriatic seashore. An analysis of the rural landscape and land fragmentation dynamics is very important in terms of sustainable management of land resources. Our main study objective was the identification of the rural landscape and land fragmentation changes that occurred during the last 20 years through the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS). This work not only provides a spatial database at the municipal level, but collects data on land use, analyzes changes in land use and tracks urbanization of agricultural land. For this purpose we build a land management database for the Gjocaj municipality.In this study we identify changes in land surfaces used by agriculture and other categories of land resources. Land use changes are analyzed based on information of land use before and after the year 1991. Major changes have occurred on this agricultural land. Transformations from agricultural to non-agricultural classes have been identified. Results show that the surface of agricultural land has been reduced by 127.2 ha or about 5 % of the agricultural land fund, which is destined to become largely non-agricultural land of 76.6 ha or 3 %. Changes are identified also within agricultural land, where 31.6 ha or 1.7 % of the land suitable for agriculture is left without cultivating. The data show that 67 ha (3.6 %) of all available agriculture land has been occupied by new buildings.At the same time we registered, an increased cultivation of work intensive plants e.g. vegetables and fruit. This phenomenon is due to the extreme segmentation of the agricultural area. The results of this study suggest a rapid intervention to protect agricultural land from further fragmentation and uncontrolled urban development.";"Doko, Adrian

Particularly, transitions between tree- and herbaceous-dominated covers, which are taking place at increasing rates in South America, may have the greatest impact on the water balance. Based on Landsat imagery analysis, soil sampling and hydrological modeling, we evaluated vapor and liquid ecosystem water fluxes and soil moisture changes in temperate Argentina and provided a useful framework to assess potential hydrological impacts of vegetation cover changes. Two types of native vegetation (grasslands and forests) and three modified covers (eucalyptus plantations, single soybean crop and wheat/soybean rotation) were considered in the analysis. Despite contrasting structural differences, native forests and eucalyptus plantations displayed evapotranspiration values remarkably similar (∼1100mmy⁻¹) and significantly higher than herbaceous vegetation covers (∼780, ∼670 and ∼800mmy⁻¹ for grasslands, soybean and wheat/soybean (Triticum aestivum L., Glycine max L.) system, respectively. In agreement with evapotranspiration estimates, soil profiles to a depth of 3m were significantly drier in woody covers (0.31m³m⁻³) compared to native grasslands (0.39m³m⁻³), soybean (0.38m³m⁻³) and wheat/soybean rotation (0.35m³m⁻³). Liquid water fluxes (deep drainage+surface runoff) were at least doubled in herbaceous covers, as suggested by modeling (∼170mmy⁻¹ and ∼357mmy⁻¹, for woody and herbaceous covers, respectively). Our analysis revealed the hydrological outcomes of different vegetation changes trajectories and provided valuable tools that will help to anticipate likely impacts, minimize uncertainties and provide a solid base for sustainable land use planning.";"Nosetto, M.D.

This research demonstrates a Bayesian Network (BN) approach to integrating environmental modelling with economic valuation. The model incorporates hydrological, ecological and economic models for the George catchment in Tasmania.

Higher milk yield per cow, more family labour, and highermilk prices increase the growth rate of growing farms, ceteris paribus. Older growing farmers tend to grow at lower rates. In line with Weiss’ findings (1999) for Austrian farms, Gibrat’s Law of relative firm growth being independent of initial firm size does not hold for our subsample of farms growing in milk production, either: the growth rate is quite high for small farms and has a minimum for farms around 325,000 kg of initial quota. For the 16% ofgrowing farms that have more initial quota the growth rate increases up to some out-of-sample maximum. We corrected for selection bias by means of a multinomial logit modelwhich explains the choice among different growth regimes in more detail than the well-known Heckman procedure. In our case, e.g. age impacts the choice between growth and stagnation but not between growth and exiting from milk production; crop subsidies only influence the decision between growth and exiting from milk production but not the decision between growth and decline or stagnation.";"Breustedt, Gunnar

"AGRIS:US201301887825";"Using the ecosystem services approach for better planning and conservation of urban green spaces: a Finland case study";"";"Ecosystem services are vital for humans in urban regions. However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO₂ emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO₂ emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for land-use planning.";"Niemelä, Jari

Four benefits have been used to warrant farmland preservation programs: food security and local food supply, viable local agricultural economy, environmental and rural amenities, and sound fiscal policy and orderly development. We explore the available evidence of how well farmland preservation programs have provided these benefits. Research suggests that people clearly desire farmland preservation programs and express a willingness to pay for the environmental and rural amenities provided. Some evidence has been found that farmland preservation programs can benefit the local economy and/or have no negative impacts relative to other economic development opportunities. The programs appear to slow farmland loss and thus may be having an impact on local government expenditures and orderly development, but the evidence here is limited due to methodological issues.";"Lynch, Lori

"AGRIS:QY2016600205";"Adoption of maize conservation tillage in Azuero, Panama";"";"An aggressive research and validation program launched in 1984 in Azuero, Panama, yielded a recommendation advocating zero tillage for maize production. Ten years later, maize farmers in Azuero use , land preparation methods: conventional tillage, zero tillage, and minimum tillage (an adaptation of the zero tillage technology). This study aimed to quantify the adoption of a zero and minimum tillage for maize in Azuero; identify factors influencing adoption of the different land preparation practices; and analyze the implications of the findings for future maize research and extension. Between 1985 and 1994, farmers in Region I of Azuero changed from conventional tillage to zero (33%) and minimum tillage (43%). In Regions II and III, most farmers still practiced conventional tillage in 1994, although 34 % had switched to minimum tillage. Across regions, adoption of conservation tillage was motivated by potential cost savings rather than longer term considerations such as reduced soil erosion. The factors that limit adoption of conservation tillage vary by region. In Region I, adoption of conservation tillage is limited by land rental rather than ownership and by lack of conservation tillage planting equipment. In Regions II and III, lack of information about conservation tillage technology limits the probability of adoption. Future research should examine soil compaction, a key variable for understanding differences between the adoption of minimum and zero tillage. Another area that merits further research is the link between weeds and conservation tillage: several farmers reported using the technology to obtain better weed control. The long-term effects of conservation tillage should also be assessed. Extension in Regions II and III should seek to accelerate adoption of conservation tillage. In Region I, extension should steer the change process from minimum to zero tillage.";"Pereira, A.

Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to determine the countries that are the main drivers of ecological change. This study provides rankings of countries according to their impact on global natural resource consumption and ecological degradation, based on aggregate impact (across categories/variables) and ranking within each category/variable separately. Rankings for impact on resource consumption are based on eight variables in five major categories: energy, marine fisheries, forestry, freshwater and agriculture; rankings for global ecological degradation are based on seven ecological variables in four major categories: biodiversity, carbon emissions, forest losses, agricultural land use change/land degradation. The total ecological impact is based on all 15 variables. The study also ranked countries on each of the natural resource consumption and ecological degradation variables separately. In no individual resource consumption category did countries ranking in the top 20 account for less than 70% of global consumption, and for three ecological degradation variables the top 20 nations account for more than 74% of global ecological degradation. In addition, the study considered how the relative share of global resource consumption and ecological degradation are distributed between and among countries when they are classified by income level.

Implementing this practice could sequester large amounts of carbon (C) over the long-term, potentially offsetting anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide, and mitigating climate change. On a global scale, this practice could sequester between 2 and 109.2 Pg biochar-C in 1.75 billion ha of degraded and deforested lands and agroforestry systems. An additional considerable amount could be sequestered in the soil of fruit tree orchards and bio-energy plantations. The anticipated improvement in the quality of the biochar-amended soils is expected to enhance resilience to these land uses, increasing their adaptation capacity to climate change. Yet, specific questions still need to be addressed, for example, the impact of biochar on the availability of nitrogen and potassium for plants in acidic soils and under humid conditions, as well as the impact of biochar on soil and trees in alkaline soils and under Mediterranean or drier conditions. Also, a full assessment of health hazards and environmental risks related to the production of biochar and its application in soil is required. Other questions relate to the environmental and economic costs of biochar application. Therefore, life cycle assessments and economic calculations should be conducted on a site-specific basis and include the practices of feedstock collection, transportation, processing, and spreading. International actions should regulate biochar practice as an eligible means for funding under the C finance mechanism.

"AGRIS:CL2010A00007";"Deforestación en ecosistemas templados de la precordillera andina del centro-sur de Chile";"";"A multitemporal analysis to determine the land cover change was conduced in the pre-Andean range of Maule region of Chile. We used satellite imagery from the year 1989 and 2003 to analyze the likely causes of native forest change. In this period, there was a reduction in native forest area of 44% in the study area, which is equivalent to an annual forest loss rate of 4.1%. The native forest area is replaced by shrublands (29%) and exotic forest plantations (27%). A great proportion of current exotic forest plantations are established on lands that were native forest in 1989 (63%). Most forest loss was associated with intermediate elevation and less distance to road network, where native forest area dominated. Native forest replacing by shrublands was associated to selective forest logging and firewood, which leads to degradation of these forests. Native forest replacing by exotic forest plantations was the result of the forestation incentive and an increase in the demand for forest products such as wood and pulp. Because of multiple impacts of the forest loss, we propose to focus the government incentives. Priority areas for incentives must be characterized by high forest loss rate and poverty, presence of threatened species and low availability of water from catchments. Moreover, we propose to prioritize the connectivity of the current network protected areas and to develop an effective forest management monitoring system using advanced technologies.

La mayor pérdida de bosque nativo se concentra en niveles de elevación intermedia, donde se encuentra la mayor superficie de bosque nativo, asociándose también a una menor distancia de la red de caminos. El reemplazo del bosque nativo por matorrales se asocia principalmente a prácticas de floreo y extracción de leña, lo cual produce la degradación del bosque. La sustitución de bosque nativo por especies exóticas se explica por el incentivo a la forestación y por la creciente demanda de productos derivados de la madera y pulpa. Debido a los múltiples impactos que produce la deforestación se propone focalizar los incentivos estatales en áreas con altos niveles de deforestación y pobreza, presencia de especies amenazadas y menor disponibilidad de agua desde las cuencas. Adicionalmente, se propone priorizar la conectividad de las actuales áreas protegidas y el desarrollo de un sistema de fiscalización eficaz para el manejo de los bosques, el cual considere un monitoreo permanente con uso de tecnologías avanzadas.";"Altamirano, Adison(Universidad de La Frontera Departamento de Ciencias Forestales)

"AGRIS:US2016213468";"Credit Markets for Small Farms: Role for Institutional Innovations";"";"Indian agriculture is characterized by the predominance of smallholders. This paper seeks to examine the access of small holders to agriculture credit in the context of financial sector reforms in India in the nineties. It explores the role of institutional and non institutional agencies in extending agriculture credit to the smallholder and the ground realities as revealed by recent data sets. The nineties also saw the unfolding of the largestmicrofinance programme in the world in India. While this was very successful inbringing micro enterprises under the credit purview, it was unable to cater to the need for agriculture credit. This paper examines the reasons for this and suggests that newer kinds of institutional innovations in the Pilot stage like, Joint Liability Groups, VDC- Farmers Club Model, SHG-Contract Farming Linkage model which seek to overcome the difficulties faced by smallholders in accessing agriculture credit are effective. They need to be upscaled and mainstreamed in order to bring about vibrancy in the rural credit market in India.";"Pillarisetti, Satish

"AGRIS:US201400133047";"Evo Morales and the MST in Bolivia: Continuities and Discontinuities in Agrarian Reform";"";"There is a widespread understanding in critical scholarly literature that the government of Evo Morales is fundamentally challenging the neoliberal order in Bolivia. The empirical record of Morales' first five years in office, however, illustrates significant neoliberal continuities in the country's political economy. At the same time, the most important social movements that resisted neoliberalism prior to Morales' election have been considerably demobilized in its wake. This gives rise to the critique that the Morales government has merely implemented a more politically stable version of the model of accumulation it inherited. This paper draws on recent field research in Bolivia to make a contribution to this broader research agenda on reconstituted neoliberalism. Our focus is twofold. On the one hand, the paper examines the continuities of agrarian class relations from the INRA law at the height of neoliberalism in 1996 to the various agrarian reform initiatives introduced since Morales assumed office in 2006. On the other hand, the paper traces the mobilization of the Bolivian Landless Peasants' Movement (MST) in response to the failure of the 1996 neoliberal agrarian reform, followed by the movement's demobilization after Morales' 2006 agrarian reform initiative. The paper explores this demobilization in the context of agrarian relations that have remained largely unchanged in the same period. Finally, the paper draws on recent reflections by MST members who, to varying degrees, seem to be growing critical of Morales' failure to fundamentally alter rural class relations, and the difficulties of remobilizing their movement at the present time.";"Brabazon, Honor

In this article, I discuss the significance of quilombo in its diverse social, political and historical contexts, demonstrating how changes in the uses and meanings of the term reveal broader trans-historical, juridical, political and metaphorical processes. I argue that quilombola communities should not be conceptualized as a racial category, but rather as a system of social organization and a right. Specifically, I show how the term quilombola is currently a way actors identify with Afro-descendants in order to achieve political recognition. I also describe how contemporary practices involving quilombos reveal historical tensions over land conflicts between historically marginalized rural black communities, private interests and governmental authority. I draw on evidence from field research in southern Brazil to illustrate my understanding of how quilombos work.";"Leite, Ilka Boaventura";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land conflicts";"Land Conflicts";"";"BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001880";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2015.1016919";"";"";"";"1225-1240"
"AGRIS:US201500217327";"Vegetation change and land tenure in Mexico: A country-wide analysis";"";"There is an ongoing debate on the effect different property regimes have on the use of natural resources and land conversion (i.e., deforestation or reforestation). Much of the discussion has been centered on the two main forms of tenure regime: common-pool system and private property. Case studies around the world have provided evidence on whether one is more effective at preventing deforestation than the other, but there is not a clear pattern. Part of the problem is that evidence comes from theoretical models or isolated case studies instead of comparative studies across large areas. This paper helps to fill this gap by analyzing the association between land cover change (2001–2010) and land tenure regimes including private and two types of common-pool systems (communal and ejido) in Mexico at the municipality level. The analyses were conducted for each of the four major biomes (i.e., moist forest, dry forest, coniferous forest, and desert) to control for differences in environmental factors. Municipalities dominated by communal land tenure had the largest increase in woody cover (classified as >80% cover) in the moist forest, dry forest, and coniferous forest biomes, and municipalities classified as private also had an increase in woody cover, particularly in the desert biome. In contrast, municipalities classified as ejidos (common-pool tenure system resulting from the land reform) lost woody cover mostly in moist forest and desert biomes, but gained woody cover in dry forest and coniferous forest biomes. In modeling analyses, environmental variables were the most important variables associated with woody cover change for private and most communal municipalities, while socioeconomic variables were the most important in ejido regimes. These results highlight the importance of land tenure on land cover change, and show that differences in woody cover change between types of common-pool systems can be larger than their differences with private land tenure. During the last 10years, virtually all deforestation has occurred in areas dominated by ejidos; in contrast, communal and private regimes seem to ameliorate the deforestation process.";"Bonilla-Moheno, Martha

"AGRIS:US201400159910";"negative approach to urban growth planning of Beijing, China";"";"Among other issues, the degrading environmental and ecological situations, the low performance scrambled city form and the loss of cultural identity in Beijing City have proved that the conventional ‘population projection-urban infrastructure-land use’ approach and the architectural urbanism approach to urban growth planning failed to meet the challenges of swift urbanisation and sustainability issues in China in general, and Beijing in particular. The ‘negative approach’ is proposed that defines an urban growth and urban form through the identification and planning of Ecological Infrastructure (EI). This approach has evolved from the pre-scientific model of Feng-shui as the sacred landscape setting for human settlement, the nineteenth century notion of greenways as urban recreational infrastructure, the early twentieth century idea of green belts as urban form makers, and the late twentieth century notion of ecological networks and EI as a biological preservation framework. EI is composed of critical landscape elements and structure that are strategically identified and planned to safeguard natural assets and ecosystems services, essential for sustaining human society. EI is strategically planned and developed using less land but more efficiently preserving the ecosystems services. Using Beijing City as an example, this paper demonstrates how to use EI as a tool to guide and frame sustainable urban development.";"Yu, Kongjian

The recommended procedure for the recovery of the characteristic poor soils of the Southern region of Portugal is the installation of grazed permanent pastures and increase of soil fertility. The objectives of this study were: (i) to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of soil nutrients at four points in time over a 10-year period in a perennial pastureland; (ii) to test new tools for survey of the spatial variability of soil nutrients; (iii) to evaluate the potential for differential organic management. A 6Â ha permanent bio-diverse pasture field, grazed by sheep and improved by annual application of super phosphate fertilizer, was installed on a shallow soil in Mediterranean conditions. Spatial variability and temporal stability of topsoil macronutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium), SOC and pH were measured. The results indicate that SOC and pH have great potential for implementing differential management. In the case of SOC, the management classes map shows that over 80Â % of the area has temporal stability, while more than 50Â % of the area has low levels of SOC (<10Â gÂ kgâ»Â¹), justifying the potential for differential application of C-rich organic soil amendments. The geospatial measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECâ) and NDVI index showed significant correlation between these parameters and soil properties, revealing the potential of these tools for producing detailed soil maps, decisive for understanding the changes in soil properties under sustainable management systems.";"Serrano, J.

"AGRIS:US201301872115";"Marine protected areas in spatial property-rights fisheries";"";"Marine protected areas (MPAs) and spatial property rights (TURFs) are two seemingly contradictory approaches advocated as solutions to common property failures in fisheries. MPAs limit harvest to certain areas, but may enhance profits outside via spillover. TURFs incentivize local stewardship but may be plagued by spatial externalities when the TURF size is insufficient to capture all dispersal. Within a numerical model parameterized to a California marine species, we explore the economic and ecological effects of imposing MPAs on a TURF-regulated fishery. Whether MPAs can enhance or diminish profits (or fish abundance) hinges critically on the level of coordination already occurring between TURF owners. If coordination is complete, private MPAs may already emerge in some TURFs; implementing additional MPAs reduces profits. However, to the extent that coordination is incomplete, strategically sited MPAs may be an effective complement to spatial property rights-based fisheries, increasing both fishery profits and abundance.";"Costello, Christopher

"AGRIS:US2016213683";"Linkages between poverty and sustainable agricultural and rural development in the uplands of Southeast Asia";"";"Most of the upland areas of Southeast Asia are characterized by insufficient infrastructure, low productivity in smallholder crop and animal production, mounting environmental problems such as soil and forest degradation and loss of biodiversity, increasing population pressure, and widespread poverty, particular in rural areas. While some upland areas in South East Asia have been experiencing considerable progress during the past twenty years, others have stagnated or even declined with respect to economic, social and environmental objectives of development. The purpose of the paper is to describe major trends regarding sustainable development in the upland areas of selected countries in South East Asia, and review explanatory approaches for the observed trends based on case studies from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The conceptual framework for this paper builds on the critical triangle of sustainable rural development. Here, equity or poverty alleviation, economic growth, and the protection of the environment are the three major policy objectives. We further distinguish three explanatory approaches for land use change and agricultural and rural development. Apart from the market approach and the population approach, we suggest that future studies should focus more on governance issues as a major driving force of land use change. The governance approach appears particularly relevant for upland areas which are often politically and institutionally marginalized. The paper begins with a review of definitions of sustainability, and proceeds with a conceptual analysis of the two-way linkages between poverty and the environment, and poverty and economic growth in rural areas. This is followed by empirical findings from research on agriculture and forestry as the major land uses in upland areas of selected South East Asian countries. Based on the results of different case studies from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia, we seek to contrast stories of relative success with those of failure. The paper concludes with implications for rural and agricultural development policies, and suggests future areas of research.";"Zeller, Manfred

Typically the impacts of hydrological and land use changes are examined separately, with hydrological determinants used to explain the distribution of species in water dependent and aquatic habitats and land use factors used to examine terrestrial species. However, given the connectedness of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, stressors originating in one domain may be important in the other. To explore the importance of integrating both hydrological and land use factors, we tested the relative contribution of hydrological factors and land use context as determinants of the dominant riparian tree species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn. throughout wetlands of the Condamine catchment, southern Queensland, Australia. The occurrence of E. camaldulensis was modelled against hydrological and land use factors using generalized linear models (GLMs) and validated using internal bootstrapping procedures. Validated models which included both hydrological (distance from weir, wetland–river connectivity and groundwater depth) and land use factors (agricultural land cover and grazing intensity) performed better than those developed using only hydrological factors. The study results highlight the importance of an integrated perspective which considers both hydrological and land use factors in order to understand occurrence patterns of riparian and floodplain tree species in a range of settings. This approach could be especially important when assessing changes to hydrology and land use which may be triggered by climatic changes.";"Kath, Jarrod

The study area was in Cimarron County, Oklahoma, where land use is dominated by row crop agriculture, livestock grazing, and Conservation Reserve Program grasslands. Ferruginous Hawks (B. regalis) were uncommon and nested primarily in and around the Rita Blanca National Grassland (NG). Swainson’s Hawks (B. swainsoni) were common and nested throughout the study area. Ferruginous Hawks territories contained more sandsage and less cropland and CRP than random sites, whereas Swainson’s Hawk territories mirrored the available landcover. Our results suggest that the availability of sandsage habitat is an important factor in determining nesting density (Ferruginous Hawks) and reproductive success (Swainson’s Hawks) on the Southern High Plains. Nest site availability also may have constrained the distribution of Buteos in our study area and is probably a major factor limiting Ferruginous Hawk nesting density. Ferruginous Hawks typically nest on man-made platforms (nest platforms and windmills) that were most common in and around the Rita Blanca National Grasslands. Our results suggest that conversion of native grasslands to cropland has had negative consequences for Ferruginous and Swainson’s Hawks. This relationship has been previously demonstrated in several studies of Ferruginous Hawks, but not for Swainson’s Hawks. In particular, loss of sandsage habitats on the southern High Plains may have contributed to range declines in Ferruginous Hawks and decreased breeding success for Swainson’s Hawks.

"AGRIS:US2016203626";"Enhancing Land-Use-Efficiency through Appropriate Land Policies in Ethiopia";"";"The land tenure system has been a controversial issue in Ethiopia: The advocates of the existing land policy believe that if the farmers are given the right to own land privately and are allowed to sell, many farmers will become landless and exposed to various hardships. The critics argues that the existing land tenure arrangements has contributed towards increased degradation of farmers' land resulting in soil erosion and poor productivity level of various crops. Farmers with ownership right and secure land tenure are more likely to make long-term investment in their land. The meager land productivity is not because of the poor soil fertility rather as a result of ill management of the limiting factor of production i.e. land. Programming model was developed using primary information, collected from 110 farmers' households (82 High income group + 28 Low income group) from 4 peasant associations in Meket District of north wollo region of Ethiopia in order to study the potential of land productivity enhancement through better land management and land use planning in the country. The optimal solutions brought out that land productivity increased by 9.4 percent on high-income group and 8 percent on low-income group farmers with an overall improvement of 8 percent in the region if farmers cultivate their land with more vigor and long-term commitments. Thus there is an urgent need to revisit the government policies especially with regard to land use planning, land tenure and ownership right etc for achieving the long term agricultural development.";"Grover, D.K.

"AGRIS:LV2016005240";"Categorising farming practices to design sustainable land-use management in mountain areas";"";"In European mountain areas, shrub encroachment resulting from farmland abandonment is most often managed by mechanical operations such as roller chopping or controlled burning, which have proved to be ineffective and unsustainable. Recent agroecological findings highlight the potential impact of grazing on long-term shrub dynamics. We thus explored the potential contribution of livestock farms to the management of shrub encroachment. We studied the diversity of livestock practices and strategies on the scale of a small mountain valley in France where a land-use management plan was initiated. We interviewed 33 livestock farmers with a comprehensive approach and analysed the data in partnership with local land-use managers. To categorise farming practices, we used an innovative constructivist method based on knowledge engineering techniques and tools such as repertory grids. Our results show that the diversity of land-use practices can be summed up by ten practices related to three management domains: (i) livestock management, that is, splitting herds into batches, leading animals to pasture and breeding choices; (ii) the feeding system, including indoor feeding during the year, the hierarchy between haymaking and grazing in spring and the system’s forage autonomy; and (iii) farmland utilisation and maintenance, which comprises hillside use, spatial configuration of grazed areas, maintenance practices and technical choices to cut meadows. We also show that farmers combine these practices within six types of strategies: ensuring feeding security and simplifying labour (type A), maintaining farmland heritage (type B), taking advantage of hillsides (type C), focusing on animal care (type D), combining areas, periods and batches (type E), or selling on local markets (type F). This makes it possible to identify: (1) farmers’ strategies that have the greatest impact on shrub encroachment; and (2) practices that may develop into more sustainable management of shrub encroachment. Our work is thus a first step in developing sustainable land-use management plans in rural areas threatened by shrub encroachment. In return, this deep understanding of farmers’ strategies allowed us to address socially pertinent scientific issues related to the dynamics of grazed plant communities.";"Girard-Fourty, Nathalie

"AGRIS:US2016203623";"How Effective is the Invisible Hand? Agricultural and Food Markets in Central and Eastern Europe";"";"Since the seminal work of Adam Smith, markets have been considered an efficienttool for co-ordinating the behaviour of economic agents. The basic characteristicof a market economy is that the complex system of interaction amongindividuals is not centrally coordinated. Under the assumption of profit and utilitymaximisation (and a whole set of assumptions about the institutional framework),relative prices and their change over time provide the signals that guide,like an invisible hand, the allocation of resources, i.e., the structure of productionand the intensity of input use in the various production processes. They dothis by co-ordinating the activities of economic agents, i.e., of resource owners,producers, intermediaries, traders, and consumers.After system change in the former Soviet Union and in Central and EasternEurope (CEE) central economic planning had to be replaced by other forms ofco-ordination. The general direction in all transition countries was towards amarket economy, but the speed and depth of reforms towards an environment inwhich markets can evolve differed largely between countries, sectors and betweendifferent phases during the past 15 years. IAMO Forum 2005 focuses onthis development and discusses the functioning of markets, the requirements forthis, and the advantages and disadvantages of other co-ordination mechanismsunder different environments in the agricultural and food sectors in Central andEastern Europe.CEE agri-food markets deserve researchers' and policy makers' attention forseveral reasons. Two of them regard the high demand for support to policy decisionsthat aim to stimulate economic and social development in the region.In most CEE countries, the significance of the agricultural and food sector isrelatively high with respect to income and employment. In particular, rural areas can benefit from the development of this branch of the economy. Also, there ismarked indication that agri-food markets in CEE are not ensuring exchange asfrictionless as possible. This means that large benefits can be expected if potentialimprovements of the economic environment are implemented and if individualagents adapt optimally to that environment.Another motivation for economic research on transition countries is that we arelooking at a huge region that started almost as a vacuum with regard to institutionalsettings. This means that a wide range of substantially different settingswere introduced in the respective countries, and were only weakly confined bypolitical rigidities or path dependencies. From a distant perspective, the repeatedfundamental shifts in recent economic policies almost evoke the impression of atrial and error approach. The consequences of distinctively different options(across countries and periods) can be observed in a way almost similar to a laboratorysituation. Such unique opportunity has attracted economists, particularlythose interested in institutional economics, to conduct research on CEE. However,this also means that the experiences made in CEEC can enhance the generalunderstanding of what markets can do and what the limitations of market coordinationare.This volume contains selected contributions presented at IAMO Forum 2005and gives an overview of the major topics discussed there.Partial analyses of specific economic problems usually abstract from the generaleconomic framework which is assumed to be more or less constant as expressedin ceteris paribus clauses. Oftentimes, the set of institutional conditions is evenassumed to be sufficiently well-described by the framework used in neoclassicalmodels. Particularly for transition countries, this has frequently led to spuriousresults because crucial aspects of the framework actually in place were not considered,and sometimes were not even thought of. An extreme and very obviousexample is the neglect of the effects of the replacement of monetary by nonmonetaryexchange in phases of a barter economy. There is no generic approachto avoid unintended omission of crucial framework conditions, but it must generallybe emphasised that a broad look at the various interdependent markets andat the entire socioeconomic context of a country is needed before going into detail.Descriptive analyses of the situation in various markets form part of such abroad look. The contributions of POPP, FERTÖ et al., WILKIN et al., and HEIN inthe chapter Selected analyses from CEEC provide excellent examples, and focuson market developments in new EU member countries. On the one hand, thepapers show the heterogeneity of problems e.g. due to largely differing farmstructures. On the other hand, several common patterns can be observed: Themarket shares and power of large processors and retailers (hypermarkets, etc.)are increasing. Also, international (especially intra-EU) trade in commoditieshas increased in response to CAP-induced price harmonisation. Both tendenciesweaken the market position of farmers, particularly small entities which cannotsupply in volumes sufficient for large processing and trade firms. Within the food industry concentration increased as many smaller firms could not complywith EU processing standards and had to quit the market. The increased size andspecialization of large producers, as well as of large processors, made many ofthose firms co-ordinate business with each other through long-term contractualagreements rather than by relying on spot markets. This tendency is very distinctin the fruit and vegetable sector, as WILKIN’s contribution describes.Two contributions draw attention to the institutional framework itself, mainlyby looking at circumstances which prevent market allocation from leading to anoptimal outcome. HOBBS describes factors that impede investment and growthby drawing on transaction cost economics. Situations typical for transition countriesare highlighted where e.g. transparency is not sufficient or the existence andreliable enforcement of contract or corporate law are not guaranteed. NUPPENAUstresses the need for the appropriate and precise formulation of land propertyrights, which should evoke a balance between governance and exclusion. Theimportance of appropriate and reliable institutions to avoid flaws is emphasised.But even with suitable institutions, transaction costs cannot be reduced to zero.The main reason for this is that since agents may gain form a head start of information,incentives to reveal their knowledge are quite restricted. Furthermore,some of the information required to make correct decisions is not available. Thisespecially concerns information regarding all future contingencies. An uncertainfuture and the asymmetric distribution of information impose special problemswhen decisions have long-term effects and agents are linked together throughinvestment decisions. This offers possibilities for opportunistic behaviour, i.e.,when an agent behaves in a way that allows him to extract rents from the partners'activities. The friction induced in such situations may result in a marketoutcome that is biased by transaction costs. Mitigating this bias should be a goalof public policy but it is also in the interest of (at least some of the) privateagents involved. This issue is discussed in more detail in the papers dealing withalternative governance structures.A number of contributions to IAMO Forum highlight approaches for measuringthe well-functioning of markets. While studies that aim to directly measuretransaction costs are very rare and are necessarily limited to comparing onlyvery specific portions of transaction costs, most studies focus on indirect indicators.These usually start from the idea that in a well-functioning, competitivemarket any supply or demand shocks are reflected in price changes, not only inthe particular market where the shock occurs but also in other, related markets,i.e., in different locations or at different stages of the production and marketingchain. Consequently, an approach for assessing the functioning of markets is tocompare price differentials with processing-, marketing- or transfer-costs, or –since these costs are usually difficult to quantify – to observe price differentialsover time. Accepting the assumption that the costs reflected by price differentialsare more or less constant (or stationary) over the observed time span, any additionalprice changes or a lack of price co-movement is interpreted as an indication for insufficiently connected or insufficiently functioning markets. Three contributionsin the chapter Analytical approaches for measuring market efficiencydescribe analyses which mainly focus on the vertical dimension, i.e., between marketstages. BOJNEC, in his descriptive price analysis for several agriculturalproducts in Slovenia since 1991, finds a heterogeneous development of the farmgate/consumer price spread: The processing and marketing margins increasedfor wheat and beef while they declined for grapes (processed to wine), sugar andpoultry. BRÜMMER and ZORYA, as well as BAKUCS and FERTÖ, use cointegrationanalysis to describe the degree and nature of vertical price integration in theUkrainian wheat market and the Hungarian pork market, respectively. Bothstudies find that price changes are transmitted vertically, that there is a tendencyto ""correct"" any deviations from some underlying equilibrium price-relationship.However, such error correction mechanisms are found not to be a constant, universalforce. In the Hungarian paper, it could only be found for a sub-period ofthe observed time span, excluding the highly volatile early 1990s. Also, equilibriumwas found to be achieved by adjustment of farm gate prices only while theretail prices were found to be exogenous, i.e., not responding to any disequilibrium.The paper on Ukraine shows that adjustment processes between wheat andwheat flour prices cannot be sufficiently described by a constant error correctionmechanism for the period 2000 to 2004. In fact, four different regimes of adjustmentprocesses were found to have been in force, reflecting particular phasesof largely differing market situations and political interventions.The functioning of markets depends on several crucial conditions. One of theseconditions concerns the availability of information. Only if agents have perfectand complete information will the exchange lead to an outcome in which no individualcan be better off without reducing the welfare of others. However, inthe real world this condition regarding information is not fulfilled. Informationis not perfect, since the future cannot be predicted with certainty. Incompleteinformation results from, first, not all information being revealed, and second,individuals not possessing the mental capacity to collect and process all information.Moreover, because of its asymmetric distribution, information can beregarded as a resource that can be exploited by agents. This means that there areincentives to hamper the diffusion of information to the public domain. In general,the more uncertain the future is and the more information is tacit, the worsemarkets will function, and the more beneficial become alternative mechanisms ofcoordination. Three papers dealing with this issue of organisational choice.HANF focuses on governance structures within supply chain networks that areappropriate for allowing an optimal flow of information between the involvedindividuals while retaining the necessary hierarchy for efficient implementationof strategic decisions. MAACK’s analysis shows that there is strong mutual interestbetween producers and processors of berry fruits to reduce marketing andprocurement risk, respectively. This can be achieved by switching from spotmarket exchange to contractual supply agreements. A prerequisite for such agreements is that a well-balanced distribution of risks and risk premiums betweenthe farmer and processor is implemented. This means that processors, who – facinga multitude of small producers – are used to opportunities for exerting marketpower, have to agree to cover part of the production risk through appropriatecontractual clauses. Finally, BALINT looks at the various marketing channelsused by Romanian farmers and finds that a self-enforcing dualism exists. Forcommercially-oriented farmers who can supply large quantities, marketing directlyto traders, wholesalers and processors is most favourable and involvesrelatively low transaction costs. Although this form of supply-relationship isusually not based on contractual agreements, it can still be characterised by acertain stability over time. In contrast, small farmers whose production does notconsiderably exceed the subsistence level incur relatively high (per unit) transactioncosts in selling their produce on local markets and to other farmers.Another aspect of organisational choice is the question of whether ownership ofproduction factors is transferred or only the right to use them temporarily. Theuncertainty of future developments implies that the possession of resources cannotbe only regarded from the point of view of income generation at a certainpoint in time. With perfect foresight, there is no difference whether a factor isrented or purchased, because the remuneration would be the same. This perfectsubstitutability is no longer given when the future is uncertain. Income generation,then, is only one feature of ownership. Additional aspects such as insurance,wealth, and speculation as motivations for possession affect the value of ownershipand thus shift the demand and supply curves of the factor. HURRELMAN picksup this issue in her analysis of the Polish land market and shows the impact ofadditional grounds for valuing property on the decision to rent or to buy land.Uncertainty may also affect the specialization of factor use. Allocating a factorof production to different production activities reduces the risk of income instabilities,but at the cost of specialization gains through economics of scale.Moreover, the decision on income combination is – besides risk – affected by acomplex interaction of other determinants. GLAUBEN et al., analyse these interactionsfor the case of part-time farming in China and show how the decision ofincome combination is affected by household characteristics, human capital andother variables.Incomplete and imperfect information not only causes individuals to chooseoptimal governance modes, often it is also understood as a call for governmentintervention. The selected papers in the chapter on policy intervention pleadfor careful selection and coherent implementation of policy instruments. BENNER,as well as KUHN, highlight the significance of information diffusion and arguein favour of government intervention in this area. However, both emphasisethat these interferences should be used carefully and be adjusted to specific marketfailures. Both argue that setting up information systems would improve the functioning of markets. BENNER also discusses possible negative impacts ifgovernments that engage in setting up and enforcing product and process standardstry, at the same time, to foster a sector like agriculture through support inmarketing. The latter activity affects the government’s (crucial) credibility in thefirst activity. KUHN points to negative welfare effects and budgetary requirementsof an intervention system which is implemented to increase price stability.Moreover, when a government intervenes in market allocation or intends to providerules that should facilitate the exchange on markets, it has to take into accountthat the new regulation has to be implemented in a coherent manner. Thisrequires the various policy regulations and institutional settings to be complementaryand not cause frictions which hamper the functioning of the system.LERMAN and SHAGAIDA highlight this aspect in their discussion of the Russianland market, where bureaucracy and high costs for the registration of propertyrights can be regarded as a major cause of the low number of land transactions.However, since economic activities take place in a dynamic environment, thecomparative static point of view may lead to inappropriate policy formulation.WANDEL discusses this aspect in the context of competition policy. From a comparativestatic point of view, market power has to be assessed negatively becauseof the distortions of resource allocation. However, monopoly profits arean indicator of extra rents and thus provide incentives for market entry. On theone hand, this thread may lead to special pricing schemes and/or to the accelerateddevelopment of technological change so that a monopolist can consolidateits market position. But it is possible, on the other hand, that market entry mayin fact happen. In this case, one would observe structural change, which wouldbe accompanied by an improved use of resources. This in turn means that competitionpolicy should not be oriented towards an optimal market structure buttowards the facilitation of market entry so that competition can discover marketopportunities and determine the optimal structure of the market.The present volume shows the wide range of interesting and controversial topicsthat are concerned when looking at co-ordination, particularly on markets inCEE agri-food sectors. It remains a hope that the heterogeneity and dynamics ofthe developments will decrease as successful constellations of framework conditions,organisational choices and individual behaviour become more and moreobvious and widespread in the region. Conversion to sustainable, balanced patternsmight take place, but this cannot be taken for granted. However, chancesfor such development are better the more stable and balanced political developments,as well as international co-operation, become. We hope that the academiccommunity will contribute towards such goal.";"Hockmann, Heinrich

"AGRIS:US2016218916";"New Producer Strategies: The Emergence of Patron-Driven Entrepreneurship";"";"Abstract—Existing research treats the cooperative structure as relatively homogeneous. The proposed paper argues that all cooperatives are not created equal – and consideration of organizational structure is critical when analyzing the economic impact of cooperation. In recent empirical work, we observe cooperatives forming as single- or multi-purpose; generating equity capital passively, quasi-passively, or proactively; vertically integrating in a centralized, federated, or a hybrid fashion; governing through fixed or proportional control rights; and instituting open, closed or class-varying membership criteria. The emergence of multiple-level rent-seeking cooperatives challenges our traditional rent dispersion models of collective action. We call these multi-level, patron, rent-seeking entities a form of collective entrepreneurship. This paper develops a set of criteria enabling us to distinguish between traditional forms of cooperation and collective entrepreneurship. We employ these characteristics to analyze and contrast these two extreme forms of collective action. We propose a continuum from single-level rent seeking, traditional, patron, user-driven cooperative forms; through forms of hybrids and macrohierarchies; to multiple-level rent seeking, patron, user-investor-driven collective entrepreneurship.";"Cook, Michael L.

Although new programs can increase the number of acres being preserved, they might have unintended impact on land preservation due to interaction with existing land preservation programs.  The Maryland Rural Legacy program began in 1997 by designating large contiguous blocks of land and focusing its preservation efforts only in those areas. The program’s could attract existing programs to shift their preservation effort into this designated rural legacy areas if there exist economy of scale or they subsidized existing programs’ effort through matching funds. Alternatively, it could crowd out the others’ preservation efforts in these areas if the RL program raises the cost of preserving there. Using parcel level data and a property score matching method, we find: 1) parcels in designated RL areas are more attractive to preservation programs, 2) the RL program crowds in the preservation effort of the other programs, and 3) RL program preserves more parcels and acres of land in these areas due to increased funding.";"Liu, Xiangping

"AGRIS:US2016209704";"WOODLOT DEVOLUTION IN NORTHERN ETHIOPIA: OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPOWERMENT, SMALLHOLDER INCOME DIVERSIFICATION, AND SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT";"";"This paper explores the patterns and determinants of empowerment, income generation, and environmental sustainability under varying degrees of woodlot management in Tigray, Ethiopia. Our analysis is based upon a survey of 120 collectively managed woodlots, devolved to varying degrees, and 66 households that have recently received small plots of community land for tree planting. We find that more devolved woodlot management empowers resource users by providing greater autonomy regarding the management of woodlots, and in particular the ability to make decisions about the harvest of woodlot products. Our economic analysis indicates that grass is by far the most important product being harvested from woodlots. There has been very limited harvesting of higher value products such as poles and fuelwood, which are in very short supply in the region. Labor inputs declined, and average annual net benefits improved as woodlots were more devolved, indicating that devolved woodlots are more economically efficient. Woodlots were generally perceived to be associated with positive changes in environmental conditions such as the slowing of erosion and gully formation, and the maintenance of biodiversity. However, greater environmental benefits were associated with less devolved woodlots. This study highlights the trade-offs inherent in varying levels of woodlot management. Though woodlots are perceived to provide significant environmental functions, restrictions regarding harvesting high value products are limiting the potential for smallholder income diversification and empowerment, two critical components of poverty alleviation in Ethiopia.";"Jagger, Pamela

"AGRIS:US201400048985";"survey-based exploration of land-system dynamics in an agricultural region of Northeast China";"";"Understanding the complexity of agricultural systems requires insight into the human–environment interactions. In this paper we used survey data to analyze land system change and its relation to farmer’s attitudes in a typical agricultural region of Northeast China, focusing on land tenure, crop choice and intensification. Our survey shows that land transfer was fairly common across the study area: average farmland acreage per household almost doubled from 1.3ha by early 1980s to 2.6ha by early 2010s, especially due to urban migration of farmers. The survey indicates an increase in land transfers over time with a sharp decrease of the average period of land transfer contracts. Crop choice displays a trend of decreasing diversity as several cereal crops are no longer grown in the study region and the majority of bean cultivation has been replaced by maize and tobacco. Land transfers can explain part of these changes, butnot necessarily the full change to a dominance of a smaller number of crops at the region level. Irrigation intensity is related to the locations of rivers, while agricultural inputs, along with land transfer and crop allocation, show a spatial pattern which is related to road accessibility. Survey results show that two family characteristics (education level and the initially allocated land rights) and two socioeconomic factors (infrastructure and crop prices) are important in making land transfer decisions, while external factors such as market, policy, local cropping system, and agricultural disasters have substantially influenced crop choice decisions. The survey approach is very valuable to analyze land system changes from a stakeholder’s perspective, especially in the absence of statistical data atfarm level.";"Yu, Qiangyi

"AGRIS:US2012202664";"Wheat Landrace Cultivation in Turkey: Household Land-use Determinants and Implications for On-Farm Conservation of Crop Genetic Resources";"";"The continued cultivation of landraces by household farms in centers of domestication and diversity is considered to be an in situ means of conservation of crop genetic resources. However, because in situ conservation has continued into the present does not ensure that this de facto strategy for conserving crop genetic resources will continue into the future. Whether or not traditional varieties continue to be cultivated rests primarily on factors influencing the crop decisions of these household farms. This paper focuses on two questions: 1) what are the significant determinants influencing the household cultivation of traditional wheat varieties; and 2) how do those determinants affect on-farm levels of diversity and the stability of on-farm conservation? To address these questions, we incorporate socioeconom ic/household characteristics, as well as information on agroecological heterogeneity, market access, and perceptions of variety attributes into a household land-use decision model to examine plot-level decisions to cultivate wheat landraces. The results of this research have policy implications at several levels. If policy makers support in situ conservation, information on the househo lds most likely to continue to cultivate landraces, as well as the landraces cultivated by those households, can provide an idea of the likelihood of maintaining the current in situ conservation of crop genetic resources without intervention. Information on these households and on the significant determinants of their landrace cultivation can also provide guidance on the types and levels of intervention necessary, as well as the potential costs.";"Kruzich, Tyler J.

"AGRIS:US201600063595";"Development of efficient and cost-effective distributed hydrological modeling tool MWEasyDHM based on open-source MapWindow GIS";"";"Many regions are still threatened with frequent floods and water resource shortage problems in China. Consequently, the task of reproducing and predicting the hydrological process in watersheds is hard and unavoidable for reducing the risks of damage and loss. Thus, it is necessary to develop an efficient and cost-effective hydrological tool in China as many areas should be modeled. Currently, developed hydrological tools such as Mike SHE and ArcSWAT (soil and water assessment tool based on ArcGIS) show significant power in improving the precision of hydrological modeling in China by considering spatial variability both in land cover and in soil type. However, adopting developed commercial tools in such a large developing country comes at a high cost. Commercial modeling tools usually contain large numbers of formulas, complicated data formats, and many preprocessing or postprocessing steps that may make it difficult for the user to carry out simulation, thus lowering the efficiency of the modeling process. Besides, commercial hydrological models usually cannot be modified or improved to be suitable for some special hydrological conditions in China. Some other hydrological models are open source, but integrated into commercial GIS systems. Therefore, by integrating hydrological simulation code EasyDHM, a hydrological simulation tool named MWEasyDHM was developed based on open-source MapWindow GIS, the purpose of which is to establish the first open-source GIS-based distributed hydrological model tool in China by integrating modules of preprocessing, model computation, parameter estimation, result display, and analysis. MWEasyDHM provides users with a friendly manipulating MapWindow GIS interface, selectable multifunctional hydrological processing modules, and, more importantly, an efficient and cost-effective hydrological simulation tool. The general construction of MWEasyDHM consists of four major parts: (1) a general GIS module for hydrological analysis, (2) a preprocessing module for modeling inputs, (3) a model calibration module, and (4) a postprocessing module. The general GIS module for hydrological analysis is developed on the basis of totally open-source GIS software, MapWindow, which contains basic GIS functions. The preprocessing module is made up of three submodules including a DEM-based submodule for hydrological analysis, a submodule for default parameter calculation, and a submodule for the spatial interpolation of meteorological data. The calibration module contains parallel computation, real-time computation, and visualization. The postprocessing module includes model calibration and model results spatial visualization using tabular form and spatial grids. MWEasyDHM makes it possible for efficient modeling and calibration of EasyDHM, and promises further development of cost-effective applications in various watersheds.";"Lei, Xiaohui

"AGRIS:US201301584568";"Drought-induced tree death in savanna";"";"Increasing densities of woody plants in savannas has been attributed to both elevated atmospheric CO₂ and reduced burning with grazing management, such that the biome could represent a substantial carbon sink. However, we show that extreme droughts (less than two-thirds expected rainfall over 3 years) occur in the drier half of the savanna biome and can cause substantial tree death. An Australian case study reveals that a net increase in tree cover over five decades of above-average rainfall was offset by sudden tree death during drought. The relationship between woody cover change and rainfall is moderated by competition with growth being facilitated by low woody cover and drought-induced death more likely as the woody component of savanna increases. The results are not supportive of a sustained increase in the woody component of xeric savannas resulting from CO₂ fertilization or land management. Extensive tree death in savanna regions will become a stark consequence of climate change if predictions of increasing severity and frequency of drought are realized.";"FENSHAM, R.J.

For these reasons hydrogels (Stockosorb) and novel humus substitutes (NOVIHUM), serving as long lasting fertilizer (LLF), were recently tested successfully. At the beginning of this multiyear study, those LLFs were administered to the root zone of young sessile oaks (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.), growing in test trials on a uranium mine dump in Schlema (Germany). To quantify the effect of LLFs on plant vitality, chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements and JIP test analyses were used. The results revealed up to 49% higher average photosynthetic vitality (PIABS) of the LLF treated plants compared to controls. Particularly in the first test year, the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport was strongly increased. This stimulation of photosynthetic activity was supported by direct measurements showing up to 129% increased diameter growth of the treated plants after a four year experimental period. Furthermore an increase of the maximum water holding capacity of the dump soil was attained by using LLFs. Overall, the findings reported here represent a feasible, ecologically justifiable reforestation method with a low environmental hazard potential.";"Lange, Christian A.

"AGRIS:US201500008521";"Deforestation and fragmentation of natural forests in the upper Changhua watershed, Hainan, China: implications for biodiversity conservation";"";"Hainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. The Changhua watershed is a center of endemism for plants and birds and the cradle of Hainan’s main rivers. However, this area has experienced recent and ongoing deforestation and habitat fragmentation. To quantify habitat loss and fragmentation of natural forests, as well as the land-cover changes in the Changhua watershed, we analyzed Landsat images obtained in 1988, 1995, and 2005. Land-cover dynamics analysis showed that natural forests increased in area (97,909 to 104,023 ha) from 1988 to 1995 but decreased rapidly to 76,306 ha over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily throughout the study period while pulp plantations rapidly expanded after 1995. Similar patterns of land cover change were observed in protected areas, indicating a lack of enforcement. Natural forests conversion to rubber and pulp plantations has a general negative effect on biodiversity, primarily through habitat fragmentation. The fragmentation analysis showed that natural forests area was reduced and patch number increased, while patch size and connectivity decreased. These land-cover changes threatened local biodiversity, especially island endemic species. Both natural forests losses and fragmentation should be stopped by strict enforcement to prevent further damage. Preserving the remaining natural forests and enforcing the status of protected areas should be a management priority to maximize the watershed’s biodiversity conservation value.";"Zhai, De-Li

"AGRIS:US201600123251";"Landscape genetics of a tropical rescue pollinator";"";"Pollination services are increasingly threatened by the loss and modification of natural habitats, posing a risk to the maintenance of both native plant biodiversity and agricultural production. In order to safeguard pollination services, it is essential to examine the impacts of habitat degradation on the population dynamics of key pollinators and identify potential “rescue pollinators” capable of persisting in these human-altered landscapes. Using a landscape genetic approach, we assessed the impact of landscape structure on genetic differentiation in the widely-distributed tropical stingless bee Trigona spinipes (Apidae: Meliponini) across agricultural landscape mosaics composed of coffee plantations and Atlantic forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. We genotyped 115 bees at 16 specific and highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, developed using next-generation sequencing. Our results reveal that T. spinipes is capable of dispersing across remarkably long distances, as we did not find genetic differentiation across a 200 km range, nor fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Furthermore, gene flow was not affected by forest cover, land cover, or elevation, indicating that reproductive individuals are able to disperse well through agricultural landscapes and across altitudinal gradients. We also found evidence of a recent population expansion, suggesting that this opportunistic stingless bee is capable of colonizing degraded habitats. Our results thus suggest that T. spinipes can persist in heavily-altered landscapes and can be regarded as a rescue pollinator, potentially compensating for the decline of other native pollinators in degraded tropical landscapes.";"Jaffé, Rodolfo

In this study we have assessed the performance of these two approaches. We surveyed 256 bird communities in an agricultural landscape in southwest France at the same locations in 1982 and 2007. We compared the ability of CQO (canonical quadratic ordination; a method of community-level GLM) and GLMs (generalized linear models) to i) explain species distributions in 1982 and ii) predict species distributions, community composition and species richness in 2007, after land cover change. Our results show that models accounting for shared patterns between species (CQO) slightly better explain the distribution of rare species than models that ignore them (GLMs). Conversely, the predictive performances were better for GLMs than for CQO. At the assemblage level, both CQO and GLMs overestimated species richness, compared with that actually observed in 2007, and projected community composition was only moderately similar to that observed in 2007. Species richness projections tended to be more accurate in sites where land cover change was more marked. In contrast, the composition projections tended to be less accurate in those sites. Both modelling approaches showed a similar but limited ability to predict species distribution and assemblage composition under conditions of land cover change. Our study supports the idea that our community-level model can improve understanding of rare species patterns but that species-level models can provide slightly more accurate predictions of species distributions. At the community level, the similar performance of both approaches for predicting patterns of assemblage variation suggests that species tend to respond individualistically or, alternatively, that our community model was unable to effectively account for the emergent community patterns.";"bonthoux , Sébastien(auteur de correspondance)

Detecting land use-water quality relationships is of significance for both urban sustainable development and environmental risk management. We first selected suitable landscape metrics at landscape and class levels as well as productivity as land use indicators; second, we integrated ten water quality indicators into a comprehensive pollution index (CPI) that serves as the primary water quality indicator for measuring the effects of diffusive pollution in an urban area; finally, taking water quality indicators as dependent variables and land use indicators as independent variables, we detected land use-water quality relationships using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. The main findings are (1) the CPI is a good water quality indicator for detecting land use-water quality relationships and the performance of the GWR model is superior to that of the OLS model and (2) landscape metrics have potential for predicting water quality; however, improving the productivity of natural vegetation is a more tangible and reliable way to promote water resources restoration than rearranging the configuration of land use types.";"Yu, Deyong

Private amenity benefits to landowners have been suggested as an explanation for high land prices and the persistence of such rangeland enterprises despite apparently marginal cash returns. In this study, private amenity values are estimated using a contingent valuation technique in surveys of private woodland owners as part of five case studies, using a design developed to separate landowner amenity income and capital values. Nonindustrial private landowners were asked about the maximum amount of money that they were willing to give up (to pay) before selling their property to invest in more commercially profitable assets, and the proportion of the market price of their woodland that they think is explained by privately consumed amenities. Amenity values were found to be relevant because, in all cases, landowners were willing to pay > euros 120·ha-1·yr-1, at 2002 prices, and attributed >30% of land market price to amenities. These values represent an amenity profitability rate >2% in all case studies.

We use a listing of more than 90,000 households in some 200 villages in West Bengal to highlight the impact of the state's 1978 land reform program on human capital accumulation and current productivity of land use. While we ascertain a highly significant positive effect on long-term accumulation of human capital, our analysis also suggests that, partly because land that had been received through land reform is still operated under share tenancy arrangements, productivity on such land is significantly lower than the average. The combination of lower productivity of reform land relative to own land and land rental and sale's restriction of reform land is associated with significantly lower purchase and sale's price of reform land compared to own land. Programs to allow land reform beneficiaries to acquire full ownership could thus have significant benefits.";"Deininger, Klaus W.

"AGRIS:US201400049166";"Assessing rural landholders diversity in the Wet Tropics region of Queensland, Australia in relation to natural resource management programs: A market segmentation approach";"";"Government agencies in many countries are encouraging rural landholders to improve their land management practices in order to improve the health of the natural environment. The level of adoption of improved practices by landholders is, however, highly variable. Understanding the diversity of rural landholders is an important step in increasing the uptake of improved land management practices. In this study, we investigate the factors that influence landholders to adopt recommended practices and use this to provide insights into how to encourage greater adoption of these practices. A mail based survey of rural landholders in the Wet Tropics region of north eastern Australia was used to gather data. Adapting a ‘prime prospects analysis’ approach used in social marketing, we used this data to develop a typology of landholders based on their attitudes to environmental health and adoption of currently recommended practices in agriculture. Five landholder types were identified: the ‘concerned but unengaged’ who are interested but not engaged in using best management practices (BMPs); the ‘multiple objective’ landholders with moderate levels of interest in natural resource management (NRM) and engagement activities; the ‘production orientated’ landholders who are engaged in the use of BMPs but not greatly concerned about NRM issues; the ‘disconnected and conservative’ landholders who have low levels of interest in or engagement with NRM activities; and the ‘well-connected and progressive’ who are highly motivated and engaged in using BMPs. Profiles of the groups were developed through examining differences in their management objectives, trust in others, communication behaviour and management practices of the group members. Each of the groups will require different strategies to encourage adoption of recommended management practices including a mix of information campaigns, training and incentive programs provided by varying organisations that have the trust of landholders. While some types of landholders will be best targeted through industry associations, many of these landholders have already adopted many of the recommended practices. Other types of landholders have little contact or affinity with these associations and would be better served by other types of organisations and separate communication strategies that better match their management aspirations and circumstances.";"Emtage, Nicholas

"AGRIS:US201400049163";"Impact of Seed Policy Reforms and Intellectual Property Rights on Crop Productivity in India";"";"The growth of private investment in developing‐country agriculture, new advances in the biological sciences, and rapid integration of developing countries into the global trading system has heightened interest in the topic of seed market and intellectual property rights’ (IPRs) policies among public policy‐makers, corporate decision‐makers and other actors in the agricultural sector. But there are still unanswered questions about whether emerging and evolving seed policy reforms and IPR regimes in developing countries will contribute to increasing crop productivity and improving food security. This paper attempts to answer some of these questions by focusing specifically on the case of India, the regional leader in implementing seed policy reforms and IPRs in agriculture. Findings indicate that maize and pearl millet yields grew significantly during the last two decades due partly to the combination of (1) public policies that encouraged private investment in India’s seed industry during the 1980s, and (2) biological IPRs conferred by hybridisation that conveniently married the private sector’s need for appropriability with the nation’s need for productivity growth. Although past lessons are not an indication of future success, this convergence of policy solutions and technology opportunities can be replicated for other crops that are vital to India’s food security.";"Kolady, Deepthi Elizabeth

"AGRIS:US201500010312";"Livestock greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation potential in Europe";"";"The livestock sector contributes considerably to global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Here, for the year 2007 we examined GHG emissions in the EU27 livestock sector and estimated GHG emissions from production and consumption of livestock products; including imports, exports and wastage. We also reviewed available mitigation options and estimated their potential. The focus of this review is on the beef and dairy sector since these contribute 60% of all livestock production emissions. Particular attention is paid to the role of land use and land use change (LULUC) and carbon sequestration in grasslands. GHG emissions of all livestock products amount to between 630 and 863 Mt CO₂e, or 12–17% of total EU27 GHG emissions in 2007. The highest emissions aside from production, originate from LULUC, followed by emissions from wasted food. The total GHG mitigation potential from the livestock sector in Europe is between 101 and 377 Mt CO₂e equivalent to between 12 and 61% of total EU27 livestock sector emissions in 2007. A reduction in food waste and consumption of livestock products linked with reduced production, are the most effective mitigation options, and if encouraged, would also deliver environmental and human health benefits. Production of beef and dairy on grassland, as opposed to intensive grain fed production, can be associated with a reduction in GHG emissions depending on actual LULUC emissions. This could be promoted on rough grazing land where appropriate.";"Bellarby, Jessica

"AGRIS:US201400049169";"Which policy would work better for improved soil fertility management in sub-Saharan Africa, fertilizer subsidies or carbon credits?";"";"Why do many smallholder farmers fail to adopt improved land management practices which can improve yields and incomes? The reason is not always because these practices are uneconomical but sometimes it is because resource poverty prevents farmers from taking advantage of yield and income enhancing agricultural practices. In this study we examine the relative merits of using a carbon payment scheme compared to a subsidy policy to help reduce the cost of specific land management practices with productivity and ecosystem benefits such as carbon sequestration. Using a 30-year crop simulation model, we examine the impacts of different soil fertility management treatments (SFTs) on yields and soil carbon and proceed to compute discounted incremental revenue streams over the same period. We find that the SFTs simulated are on average profitable given the conditions assumed in our DSSAT simulations. When carbon was priced at $8 or $12/t CO₂e, the increase in incremental incomes generated from a carbon payment were invariably higher than those imputed from a 50% fertilizer subsidy. When carbon was priced at $4/Co₂e, the increase was almost similar and sometimes higher than that from the imputed income transfer from a 50% subsidy. If these indications hold in further research, it could imply that using fertilizer subsidies as the sole mechanism for stimulating adoption of improved soil fertility management practices may unnecessarily forgo other complementary and possibly superior alternatives. Depending on the specific economic equity considerations, we conclude that either of these instruments can be used to help farmers break through resource barriers that prevent them from adopting productivity-enhancing and environmentally beneficial agricultural practices. However, given the fiscal burden on public finances and possible opportunity costs of any substantial subsidy program, it is possible that a carbon payment system can be a reasonable alternative assuming the range of carbon prices used in this study and especially if accompanied by measures to ameliorate the costs of fertilizer to farmers.";"Marenya, Paswel

Evidence from the Karapiro Catchment Freshwater streams";"";"In environmental valuation studies with stated preference methods researchers often provide descriptions of status quo conditions which may differ from those perceived by respondents. Ignoring this difference in utility baselines may affect the way attributes are attended to in choice tasks and further affect the magnitude of utility changes and hence bias the implied estimates of benefits from the proposed environmental policies. We investigate this issue using data from a choice experiment on a community’s willingness to pay for water quality improvements in streams. About 60% of respondents perceived the description of the quality of water in streams to be better than the one we provided in our scenario. Our results show some differences in serial attribute non-attendance between respondents who were provided with our baseline description of the status quo and those who used their own perceived baselines. The results further reveal some differences in attribute non-attendance in the two split samples within respondents who used their own descriptions of the status quo conditions. Generally we note that non-attendance to cost was higher in respondents who reported lower levels of water quality than those who perceived water quality to be higher. However, we find mixed results in terms of the willingness to pay for water quality improvements.";"Marsh, Dan

"AGRIS:US201300759411";"Implementing Participatory Decision Making in Forest Planning";"";"Forest policy decisions are often a source of debate, conflict, and tension in many countries. The debate over forest land-use decisions often hinges on disagreements about societal values related to forest resource use. Disagreements on social value positions are fought out repeatedly at local, regional, national, and international levels at an enormous social cost. Forest policy problems have some inherent characteristics that make them more difficult to deal with. On the one hand, forest policy decisions involve uncertainty, long time scales, and complex natural systems and processes. On the other hand, such decisions encompass social, political, and cultural systems that are evolving in response to forces such as globalization. Until recently, forest policy was heavily influenced by the scientific community and various economic models of optimal resource use. However, growing environmental awareness and acceptance of participatory democracy models in policy formulation have forced the public authorities to introduce new participatory mechanisms to manage forest resources. Most often, the efforts to include the public in policy formulation can be described using the lower rungs of Arnstein's public participation typology. This paper presents an approach that incorporates stakeholder preferences into forest land-use policy using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). An illustrative case of regional forest-policy formulation in Australia is used to demonstrate the approach. It is contended that applying the AHP in the policy process could considerably enhance the transparency of participatory process and public acceptance of policy decisions.";"Ananda, Jayanath";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300759411";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-006-0031-2";"";"";"";"534-544"

In Paraguay, changes in environmental policy, extension practices, and public perception of eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) have promoted a boom in plantation production of these species over the last 20 years. Smallholders, faced with the dilemma of accelerating environmental degradation juxtaposed with persistent economic need, have widely adopted eucalypt forestry due to the quick growth, low establishment cost and high commercial value of eucalypt plantations. The consequences of this recent, rapid change for smallholder land management remain uncharacterized. Mixed methods analysis of a multiple-case study of 45 families was employed to describe the evolving ecological context of small-scale eucalypt forestry in Eastern Paraguay. This study suggests that eucalypts play a complex, potentially sustainable role in the study area. Producers have integrated agroforestry into eucalypt management and report replacing crop and cattle production with eucalypts in the mosaic of regional land-use. Eucalypts are also integral to participants’ views on reforestation of deforested land and fit ambiguously into their concepts of reforestation and species’ nativeness. Understanding the evolving role of eucalypts in Eastern Paraguay is of critical importance to policymakers and foresters promoting sustainable management.";"Grossman, Jake J.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"PRY";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500160004";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-014-9272-8";"";"";"";"39-57"

"AGRIS:US201301898279";"Effects of carbon sequestration rewards on forest management—An empirical application of adjusted Faustmann Formulae";"";"This paper assesses the effects that different economic instruments to reward carbon sequestration services might have on forest management, especially on the optimal rotation period. Three different carbon crediting schemes are considered, which are based on different accounting rules. The schemes are different with respect to the question whether and how to account for carbon emissions. The forest valuation method used for calculation is based on the land expectation value (LEV), which was adjusted for the value of carbon sequestration services. Changes in the LEV and optimal rotation are expected to be induced by the amount and interactions of carbon and timber prices, harvesting and regeneration costs, and interest rates. The optimal economic rotation period is calculated for single stands as well as for whole forest enterprises (fully regulated “normal” forests). Crediting the carbon sequestration of single stands—starting from the time of regeneration—is comparable to rewarding afforestation projects. When crediting forest enterprises with existing timber and carbon stocks, additional carbon sequestration compared to a reference is rewarded. The findings reveal that, depending on the carbon price level, the optimal rotation period is increased in all considered crediting schemes, but with different intensity. If wood removals have to be accounted as carbon emissions this has the most significant effect on the optimal rotation period for forest stands and enterprises. In this case the increase of the optimal rotation period by rising carbon prices is boosted additionally by rising interest rates. Different thinning regimes, however, have only little impact on the time of maximum LEV under carbon crediting schemes.";"Köthke, Margret

"AGRIS:US201301898278";"Factors influencing nonindustrial private forest landowners' policy preference for promoting bioenergy";"";"Woody biomass has gained considerable attention in the U.S. as a feedstock for producing renewable bioenergy. Though these resources are generally not cost competitive with fossil fuels under current technology and market conditions, they are likely to generate numerous socioeconomic and environmental benefits to the entire nation. Since the positive externalities associated with wood-based bioenergy production are not fully accounted for in the market place, policy incentives could play an important role in its promotion in the future. Nonindustrial private forests (NIPFs) of the southern United States, representing a large percentage of timberlands in the nation, are often viewed as potential sources of woody biomass for future bioenergy production. It is therefore critical to understand landowners' policy preferences for promoting wood-based bioenergy. This study examines policy alternatives preferred by landowners for promoting wood-based bioenergy and utilizes binary logit models to identify the factors influencing these policy preferences. The results indicate that landowners in general prefer tax based policies over direct subsidy support. A significant relationship was observed between landowners' decision to support or not to support different policy instruments and their income, age, distance of residence from the forest, size of the forest owned, size of trees in the forests, forest management objectives, and previous experience of using government cost-share programs.";"G.C., Shivan

From these analyses, reduced in-stream biological integrity and habitat quality are commonly associated with increasing amounts of anthropogenic LUC. However, very few studies have examined the influence of landscape condition, relative to studies using LUC, on water quality parameters. Landscape condition indices use remote sensing-based data to quantify biophysical land surface condition. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationships between LUC class proportions and indices of land surface condition (LSC) and macroinvertebrate-based water quality metrics. These relationships were examined at three spatial scales (reach, stream network, and catchment). Strong correlations were observed between both LUC class proportions and LSC indices with macroinvertebrate-based metrics, although there was almost twice the number of significant correlations for LUC as compared with LSC. Similar to previous research, relationships between landscape variables and macroinvertebrate metrics were not consistent across spatial scales. Overall, results suggest that LUC class proportions are better indicators of water quality conditions in the study area. Future work will expand this analysis and include additional water quality parameters and landscape variables with the goals of deepening the understanding of landscape impacts on stream water quality and providing resource managers with valuable information that will to help guide planning and assessment activities.";"McMichael, Christine E.

The primary data were obtained from 85 soil samples collected from tree depths (0-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm); the secondary information was acquired from the remotely sensed data from the linear imaging self-scanner (LISS-III) receiver of the IRS-P6 satellite. Ordinary kriging and simple kriging with varying local means (SKVLM) methods were used to identify the spatial dependency of soil important parameters. It was observed that using the data collected from the spectral values of band 1 of the LISS-III receiver as the secondary variable applying the SKVLM method resulted in the lowest mean square error for mapping the pH and electrical conductivity (ECe) in the 0-30-cm depth. On the other hand, the ordinary kriging method resulted in a reliable accuracy for the other soil properties with moderate to strong spatial dependency in the study area for interpolation in the unstamped points. The parametric land suitability evaluation method was applied on the density points (150 × 150 m²) instead of applying on the limited representative profiles conventionally, which were obtained by the kriging or SKVLM methods. Overlaying the information layers of the data was used with the GIS for preparing the final land suitability evaluation. Therefore, changes in land characteristics could be identified in the same soil uniform mapping units over a very short distance. In general, this new method can easily present the squares and limitation factors of the different land suitability classes with considerable accuracy in arbitrary land indices.";"Emadi, Mostafa

"AGRIS:US201600194256";"Ecological homogenization of urban USA";"";"A visually apparent but scientifically untested outcome of landâuse change is homogenization across urban areas, where neighborhoods in different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas, and aquatic features. We hypothesize that this homogenization extends to ecological structure and also to ecosystem functions such as carbon dynamics and microclimate, with continentalâscale implications. Further, we suggest that understanding urban homogenization will provide the basis for understanding the impacts of urban landâuse change from local to continental scales. Here, we show how multiâscale, multiâdisciplinary datasets from six metropolitan areas that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ; Miami, FL; Baltimore, MD; Boston, MA; MinneapolisâSt Paul, MN; and Los Angeles, CA) can be used to determine how household and neighborhood characteristics correlate with landâmanagement practices, landâcover composition, and landscape structure and ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales.";"Groffman, Peter M

"AGRIS:US2012207040";"USING A CHOICE EXPERIMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NON-USE VALUES OF WETLANDS: THE CASE OF CHEIMADITIDA WETLAND IN GREECE";"";"Despite wetlands being amongst the Earths most productive ecosystems, they have been degraded and lost at an unprecedented rate globally, especially throughout the last century. In recognition of the importance of the crucial ecological functions and economic benefits they provide, international efforts, such as the Ramsar Convention, and European Union level efforts, such as the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), are now in place to ensure conservation, sustainable management and improvement of the remaining wetlands. This paper aims to assist policy makers in formulating efficient, effective and sustainable wetland conservation and management policies by providing them with the results of a valuation study using the Cheimaditida wetland in Greece as a case study. A choice experiment is employed to estimate the benefits of the non-use values of the Cheimaditida wetland that accrue to the Greek public. Results from this choice experiment reveal that there are positive and significant non-use values of this wetland for whose conservation the public is willing to pay. These results can be combined with private use values of wetlands, and weighed against the costs of alternative wetland management scenarios in order to carry out a comprehensive cost benefit analysis. Thus they can aid in the design of socially optimal policies for conservation and sustainable management of the Cheimaditida wetland, with implications for other wetlands in Greece and the rest of Europe.";"Birol, Ekin

This method differs from the usual land evaluation procedures in its use of weight for different land characteristics and in its method of determining land suitability index. The results were compared with those from parametric land evaluation method. The correlation between land indices and observed yield was higher for the fuzzy set method (r=0.35) as compared to the parametric method (r=0.14).

The socio-economic factors are not considered in such evaluations. This study was carried out to assess the qualitative land suitability for irrigated wheat, barley, maize and rice in northern Baraan. Five soil series and 25 different phases were first delineated. Land utilization types commonly practiced in the region with intermediate input levels were considered. Physical requirements of the crops were determined and ranked using the available information. FAO framework and the proposed method of Sys were used for the evaluation. Qualitative evaluation was carried out according to both simple limitation and parametric methods by comparing land and climatic characteristics with crop requirements. It was shown that in addition to climatic factors, soil salinity, drainage and some soil physical properties such as texture, gravel and lime are the most limiting factors. Land physical suitability for rice production was very low in most land units. The results from physical evaluation by parametric method were very close to those from the simple limitation approach.";"S. Ayoubi

"AGRIS:US201301624787";"Land management as a factor controlling dissolved organic carbon release from upland peat soils 1: Spatial variation in DOC productivity";"";"The importance of soil storage in global carbon cycling is well recognised and factors leading to increased losses from this pool may act as a positive feedback mechanism in global warming. Upland peat soils are usually assumed to serve as carbon sinks, there is however increasing evidence of carbon loss from upland peat soils, and DOC concentrations in UK rivers have increased markedly over the past three decades. A number of drivers for increasing DOC release from peat soils have been proposed although many of these would not explain fine-scale variations in DOC release observed in many catchments. We examined the effect of land use and management on DOC production in upland peat catchments at two spatial scales within the UK. DOC concentration was measured in streams draining 50 small scale catchments (<3 km^2) in three discrete regions of the south Pennines and one area in the North Yorkshire Moors. Annual mean DOC concentration was also derived from water colour data recorded at water treatment works for seven larger scale catchments (1.5 - 20 km^2) in the south Pennines. Soil type and land use/management in all catchments were characterised from NSRI digital soil data and ortho-corrected colour aerial imagery. Of the factors assessed, representing all combinations of soil type and land use together with catchment slope and area, the proportion of exposed peat surface resulting from new heather burning was consistently identified as the most significant predictor of variation in DOC concentration. This relationship held across all blanket peat catchments and scales. We propose that management activities are driving changes in edaphic conditions in upland peat to those more favourable for aerobic microbial activity and thus enhance peat decomposition leading to increased losses of carbon from these environments.";"Yallop, A.R.

The objective of this study was to evaluate qualitative and quantitative land suitability for the north-west of Iran on the basis of a FAO model for sunflower and maize crops. Growing cycle was determined using the CDBm (Monthly Climate Database) model and soils were classified in two orders of Mollisols and Vertisols, which consisted of seven soil families based on soil data and Keys to Soil Taxonomy 2010. Qualitative evaluation was carried out using the square root of parametric (SRP) method and quantitative evaluation was performed on the basis of observed yields under an average management level. The results showed that in the surveyed area, the climatic class had moderate suitability (S2) for maize and sunflower due to limitations imposed by the relative humidity of the growing cycle. The most important land limitation factors were soil parameters like pH, CaCO₃ content, texture and coarse fragments, as well as topography and drainage in the area of study. Based on qualitative evaluation with SRP, 24.69 and 17.71% of land had non-suitable class (N1) for maize and sunflower, respectively. Quantitative land suitability for maize and sunflower showed that 24.69 and 9.81% of land had non-suitable class (N1), respectively.";"Rabati, A. Pakpour

This paper reports very preliminary results, using the introduction of apomixis into rice as a case study. Apomixis is a natural, asexual method of plant reproduction resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the mother plant. Apomixis promises to revolutionize plant breeding by providing a system for crop improvement that allows any desired variety, including hybrids, to breed true. This ability will make both breeding and seed production more efficient. It offers the opportunity for plant breeders to more readily develop varieties that are specifically adapted to local conditions, using, and thus conserving, greater genetic diversity. Apomixis will also allow resource-poor farmers to replant the seed they produce from locally bred varieties year after year, a strategy not possible with today's commercial hybrid varieties. Global changes in aggregate welfare, resource allocation, production and price levels are calculated using the global economy-wide computable general equilibrium model known as GTAP. Preliminary modeling results suggest that the overall welfare gains associated apomictic rice could be substantial.";"Frisvold, George B.

"AGRIS:US2016210082";"SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN RURAL LAND MARKETS WITH EMPHASIS ON A FLEXIBLE WEIGHTS MATRIX";"";"Empirical research has shown that location and economic development are important factors in rural market.  With more and more rural land being converted at the urban fringe, buyer, sellers, planners, appraisers, tax assessors, and others are expected to have an increasing need for information related to the effect of location on rural land values.In econometric land value estimation, misspecification of the variance-covariance matrix results in loss of efficiency, predictive accuracy, and biased inference.  The form of the weight matrix is also important.  Additional flexibility can be introduced by including a decay parameter, along with different number of neighbors to provide improved estimates.  The general objective of this paper is to develop an empirical rural land value model.  Specifically, this study emphasizes the use of a more flexible spatial weight matrix by including a decay parameter along with different number of neighbors.Data for this study are based on rural land market sales from the southeast area of Louisiana that were collected using mail survey techniques for the period January 1993 through June 1998.  Hedonic models are estimated by SAR using two types of weight matrices: the Delaunay, a rigid form of a weight matrix, and a flexible nearest neighbor asymmetric matrix that includes a decay parameter   that lies between 0.4 and 1, along with different number of neighbors m ranging from 6 to 30.  Likelihood ratio tests are used to test for statistical fit between spatial and OLS models.  Results also suggest that the SAR model based on the Delaunay matrix and nearest neighbor matrix performed better than the OLS model.  We also found that this particular set of data, one cannot conclude that the flexible nearest neighbor matrix outperforms the use of a more rigid spatial weight matrix.  Further research should continue to test for other forms of spatial weight matrices.";"Soto, Patricia

The area was divided into two regions as follows: region I representing the area situated less than 5 km from the coastal line and region II representing the area situated more than 5 km from the coastal line. Both regions differed especially in the average size per farm (1.46 vs 2.48 ha in the regionI and II, respectively) gross and net income per ha (Rs. 14,228.50 and Rs. 1,385.49 in the region I and Rs. 19,326.00 and 2,100.69 in the region II. Rice production was more profitable in the region II than in the region I. This was mainly due to the availability of groundwater and use of higher quantities of fertilizers. Soil salinity is the major problem affecting rice yields in the region I.";"Nandhini, U.S.

The germination, growth and yield of the three test crops were suppressed under both tree species. The reduction, however, decreased when the cultivation of test crops was continued for three years. The inhibition potential generally is in the order of P. deltoides < U. wallichiana for maize and sunflower and P. deltoides > U. wallichiana for beans. Available soil N, P and K increased under the canopy of the selected tree species. The soils under U. wallichiana were more fertile than those under P. deltoides. Chromatographic investigation of extracts showed that the soils under P. deltoides and U. wallichiana differed in their composition of phenolic acids and phenolic glycocides. Except for caffic acid, all other allelochemicals disappeared and were no longer recovered in soil samples obtained after the second or third year of cultivation.

What the greening trend means on the ground, however, has not yet been explored. This research focuses on a region in central Senegal to examine changes in woody vegetation abundance and composition in selected sites by means of a botanical inventory of woody vegetation species, repeat photography, and perceptions of local land users. Despite the greening, an impoverishment of the woody vegetation cover was observed in the studied sites, indicated by an overall reduction in woody species richness, a loss of large trees, an increasing dominance of shrubs, and a shift towards more arid-tolerant, Sahelian species since 1983. Thus, interpretation of the satellite-derived greening trend as an improvement or recovery is not always justified. The case of central Senegal represents only one of several possible pathways of greening throughout the region, all of which result in similar satellite-derived greening signals.";"Herrmann, S.M.

During the last 20 years, the number of goats around the world increased (by about 60%) not only in the countries with low income (75%) but also in those with high (20%) or intermediate (25%) income. This situation is due to the capacity for adaptation by goats to very different environments, to the development of goat farming in developing countries where subsistence farming, barter economy and community culture are important, and where the market economy is relatively limited, and to the ecological image of goat farming and products in developed countries. Goat farming is in a good position to pursue its development in the 21st century, if a satisfactory policy is applied tactfully. For that, the factors explaining goat farming success during the end of the 20th century must be maintained and developed as the social aspects of goat farming in developing and developed countries, particularly in land management and the sociological integration into an economically sustainable life. Moreover we have to improve or maintain the good image of goat products. The two main improvements to bring into goat farming in the 21st century concern research organisations, which must encounter the needs of goat farmers and be well adapted to different production systems in order to lower the research deficit in the goat sector, and investments for better supplies particularly to the poor goat farmers.";"Morand-Fehr, P.

The effective approach of regulating and controlling independent circulation is to optimize game structure and the utility functions by implementing demand management of construction land, strengthening land space control, reinforcing the construction of rural land market system, and improving profit distribution mechanism.

Remotely sensed data are used to detect spatial and temporal changes from 1979 to 2009 in the land use/land cover (LULC) across three study sites. Areas of natural vegetation have been reduced from 26.1% in 1979 to 12.6% in 1999 and further to 9.4% in 2007. The majority of this reduction went into agricultural land. Local knowledge of pastoralists on their perceived changes in plant species is obtained. Major LULC trends are progressive degradation and loss of grazing areas, loss of biodiversity and depletion of other ecological support provided by natural vegetation. Declining rainfall, land clearance due to agricultural expansion, overgrazing and herbicide applications by crop farmers are identified as underlying forces changing plant species in the region. The study revealed that pastoralists have considerable knowledge and experience in dealing with degradation and climate variability. However, pastoralists are marginalized in decisions concerning expansion of large-scale agriculture at the expense of pasture land. Their lack of education and other basic services restricts the pastoralists' potential to adapt to the new situation.";"Sulieman, Hussein M

We note that recognizing the latter dimension is only possible when analyzing rare long‐term panel data. We estimate a model for land ownership using a version of the correlated random effects estimator to uniquely identify the determinants of both dimensions amongst Kenyan smallholders. We find life cycle effects are a key determinant of both distributions, and identify important ways in which initial conditions such as inheritance and off‐farm income relate to the dynamics of ownership. We find that population density is a key determinant of differences between households, but also that a given household's land ownership is not affected in the short term as population density increases around them. Controlling for population density, households own more land when they are closer to road networks where the economic value of land is higher. We find important vulnerabilities for the land security of widows, but this vulnerability is geographically heterogeneous.";"Burke, William J.

Based on those evidences, a set of eco-friendly rice farming practices raised by SRI principles are proposed from exploratory SRI trials conducted in Taiwan. The trials show that even with less exact leveling in the SRI field than is ideally provided, the average yield for SRI was higher than for CP; with an aerobic soil situation, the combination of biocontrol agent application and SRI management was seen to give better rice blast control; and the highest paddy yield was obtained from single-seedling transplants from potted nursery trays which protect the young seedlings’ roots from shock or twisting, compared with the planting of more numerous seedlings grown on flat nursery trays by a mechanical rice transplanter. In conclusion, a conceptual framework for eco-friendly paddy farming is formulated to encourage farmers to practice SRI principles. Among the participants in this collaboration, a co-operating group of SRI farmers is organized under investor sponsorship to guarantee the quality and safety of food, integrating an inspection service and food-source traceability from field to market with the production process. It is seen that in Taiwan, SRI principles can be adopted by local farmers without need for additional premiums through eco-friendly collaboration that can raise simultaneously the productivity of land, capital, and irrigation water. In addition, this collaboration can take advantage of increasing consumer demand for safe food with fewer chemicals and for supporting a greater level of biodiversity.";"Chang, Yu-Chuan

Temporal changes in vegetation gradients in relation to water points and thicket conditions within the botanical reserves were also assessed. The thicket condition was noted to have deteriorated, as the AENP had expanded. An expansion of degraded vegetation away from the water points was identified during the study period. The thicket condition in botanical reserve 1 had fluctuated, whereas it remained constant in reserves 2 and 3. Landscape spatial-metric analyses revealed evidence of increased vegetation fragmentation, as new areas of the AENP had been opened for elephant activity. A progressive decline in intact thicket and an increase in degraded thicket were observed. Remote-sensing techniques can assist with thicket-clump restoration by applying “target monitoring” for the timeous identification of potential-degradation hotspots.";"Kakembo, Vincent

In this article, we focus on the following two main objectives: (i) to quantitatively assess the extent of vegetation change over the past two decades for more accurate eco-climatic impact analysis; and (ii) to clarify the causes to the changes in this state, with special focus to agro-pastoral activities and roads networks. A set of four 5-year digital vegetation model maps was created for the 1981–2001 period, using the first components of the principal components analysis of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) multispectral data (Channels 1, 2 and 4). Vegetation and land cover changes are characterized by destruction of primary forests in the north and large-scale broad areas with intensive human activity and vast grasslands expanding from the south. Large-scale soybean production spreading over the central areas and vast herds of cattle in the north can be pointed to as the main causes of vegetation change in these areas. It is shown that 76.1% of the changes in land cover types occur within 30 km of paved and unpaved roads. This emphasizes the role not only of road building, but also of navigable rivers, in accelerating deforestation, especially over the sparsely populated and road-less north.";"Yoshikawa, S.

"AGRIS:US201301937625";"contribution of the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory to developing an understanding of long-term (1934-2008) changes in managed and unmanaged forests";"";"Long-term records from USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests and Ranges (EF&Rs) are exceptionally valuable scientific resources and common ground for research in natural resource management. Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, Southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina, is one of 82 EF&Rs located throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Since its establishment in 1934, the wealth and breadth of scientific knowledge gained from Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory research has provided both public and private land managers information on forest land management and has added to the knowledge base of natural resource science. We described the early watershed research at Coweeta and used long-term measurements and inventories (from 1934 to 2008) to: (1) explore the influences of large-scale disturbances and vegetation responses on ecosystem processes and (2) assess the long-term and short-term impacts of an exotic, invasive species on a southern Appalachian deciduous forest. We focused on changes in vegetation patterns influenced by natural and managed disturbances and then described the linkages between long-term vegetation measurements and water yield and quality responses. For natural disturbances, we used a network of over 900 permanent vegetation plots established in reference watersheds and unmanaged areas; first measured in 1934 and a subset re-measured in 1969-1972, 1988-1993, and 2003-2008. For the managed disturbances, clearcuts and species conversion experiments, vegetation was measured in permanent plots within treated watersheds before and after treatment. By the time of the 1934 survey, the forest had only 10 years to recover from logging before chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) induced mortality of virtually all remaining Castanea dentata trees. With the loss of C. dentata as the dominant species, Acer rubrum and Quercus montana became the dominant species and Liriodendron tulipifera and Tsuga canadensis increased in coves and along riparian corridors. T. canadensis is currently threatened by another invasive species, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae), with 33% tree mortality between 2003 and 2008. Smaller-scale disturbances, such as drought and windthrow, have created canopy gaps and the disturbance agent, gap size, and species-specific demography (dispersal, survival, growth, and mortality) affected colonization and recruitment. In general, the composition of species recruiting into canopy gaps was a reflection of the vegetation already in place at the time of disturbance, because regeneration occurred primarily through saplings or sprouts. In managed forests, where gaps were much larger (9-59ha), early successional species recruit and become established and the long-term vegetation patterns are different than in unmanaged forests. The vegetation data provide a description of changes in forest structure and composition through time and space, and they have been used to develop process-based models to scale-up to the catchment level. Long-term climatic, hydrologic, biogeochemical, and vegetation databases coupled with process-based ecohydrology and ecophysiology models are essential to understanding broader- and more complex environmental issues such as climate change, carbon cycling, atmospheric deposition, and water supply and quality.";"Elliott, Katherine J.

"AGRIS:US201600092301";"EDITOR'S CHOICE: Coho salmon spawner mortality in western US urban watersheds: bioinfiltration prevents lethal storm water impacts";"";"Adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch return each autumn to freshwater spawning habitats throughout western North America. The migration coincides with increasing seasonal rainfall, which in turn increases storm water run‐off, particularly in urban watersheds with extensive impervious land cover. Previous field assessments in urban stream networks have shown that adult coho are dying prematurely at high rates (>50%). Despite significant management concerns for the long‐term conservation of threatened wild coho populations, a causal role for toxic run‐off in the mortality syndrome has not been demonstrated. We exposed otherwise healthy coho spawners to: (i) artificial storm water containing mixtures of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or above concentrations previously measured in urban run‐off; (ii) undiluted storm water collected from a high traffic volume urban arterial road (i.e. highway run‐off); and (iii) highway run‐off that was first pre‐treated via bioinfiltration through experimental soil columns to remove pollutants. We find that mixtures of metals and petroleum hydrocarbons – conventional toxic constituents in urban storm water – are not sufficient to cause the spawner mortality syndrome. By contrast, untreated highway run‐off collected during nine distinct storm events was universally lethal to adult coho relative to unexposed controls. Lastly, the mortality syndrome was prevented when highway run‐off was pretreated by soil infiltration, a conventional green storm water infrastructure technology. Our results are the first direct evidence that: (i) toxic run‐off is killing adult coho in urban watersheds, and (ii) inexpensive mitigation measures can improve water quality and promote salmon survival. Synthesis and applications. Coho salmon, an iconic species with exceptional economic and cultural significance, are an ecological sentinel for the harmful effects of untreated urban run‐off. Wild coho populations cannot withstand the high rates of mortality that are now regularly occurring in urban spawning habitats. Green storm water infrastructure or similar pollution prevention methods should be incorporated to the maximal extent practicable, at the watershed scale, for all future development and redevelopment projects, particularly those involving transportation infrastructure.";"Spromberg, Julann A.

"AGRIS:US201301102181";"Impact of land levelling on soil moisture and runoff variability in vineyards under different rainfall distributions in a Mediterranean climate and its influence on crop productivity";"";"This paper deals with the effects of land levelling on soil hydrological properties and spatial variability of soil moisture at different depths in bare vineyard fields under different rainfall distributions over the year. The research was carried out in a levelled vineyard in the Penedès region (NE Spain), which is representative of the land management practices in that area. Twelve locations were instrumented in the selected plot to control soil moisture periodically at different depths (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 cm, using a TDR tube probe), and runoff (using Gerlach collectors located at the same positions) during the period April 2002-March 2004. Rainfalls were recorded at one-minute intervals in the experimental field using a pluviometer linked to a data-logger. The vine yield and its relationship with the rainfall distribution over the year was evaluated in this levelled vineyard vs. a less transformed vineyard. The land levelling works carried out in the plot before the establishment of the vineyard led to major differences in soil depth (ranging from 50 to 110 cm) and in soil layer characteristics along and across the plot. This helps to generate different soil moisture conditions at the same depth at different positions of the plot. The areas located at the top of the plot showed soil moisture conditions in the surface layer that were up to 5% lower than down slope, although with high variability across the plot. Soil moisture in the whole profile depends on the intensity of rainfall more than total rainfall. At high intensities, soil moisture increases only occur in the surface layer, but no significant increases are observed in deeper layers, where vines have most of their roots. On the other hand, under low intensity rainfalls the soil water content increases in the whole profile. Levelled plots showed a yield reduction in comparison with those undergoing less transformation, which was exacerbated by a very irregular rainfall distribution: for a similar total rainfall, but with dry periods during the stages in which the water requirement for vines is higher, grape production was up to 50% lower in areas with high land transformation, where Chardonnay was planted, and up to 16% lower at the bottom areas, where Macabeo was planted.";"Ramos, M.C.

"AGRIS:US201600126958";"Rangeland responses to pastoralists’ grazing management on a Tibetan steppe grassland, Qinghai Province, China";"";"Livestock grazing is the principal land use in arid central Asia, and range degradation is considered a serious problem within much of the high-elevation region of western China termed the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Rangeland degradation on the QTP is variously attributed to poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, changing land tenure arrangements or socioeconomic systems, climate change, and damage from small mammals. Few studies have examined currently managed pastures using detailed data capable of isolating fine-scale livestock–vegetation interactions. The aim of the study was to understand how differences among livestock (primarily sheep) management strategies of pastoralists during winter affected subsequent rangeland condition and productivity. Plant species composition, annual herbage mass, and indicators of erosion were quantified during four summers (2009–2012) on winter pastures managed by 11 different pastoralists on QTP steppe rangeland in Qinghai Province, China. Data came from repeated-measurements on 317 systematically located permanent plots, as well as pastoralist interviews and the use of GPS-equipped livestock. Relationships between annual weather variation and herbage mass were modelled using an independent set of vegetation measurements obtained from livestock exclosures. Account was taken of inherent site differences among pastures. Annual variation in herbage mass was found to be best fitted by a model containing a negative function of winter-season temperature and a positive function of spring-season temperature. Accounting for annual and site effects, significant differences among pastoralists were found for most response variables, suggesting that individual heterogeneity among management approaches had consequences, even among neighbouring pastoralists. Annual herbage mass of preferred plant species was positively associated, whereas that of unpreferred species was negatively associated, with mean sheep density and intensity of use. However, the proportion of bare soil, an index of erosion, and annual herbage mass of unpreferred forbs were found to have positive relationships with sheep grazing pressure during the preceding winter, whereas live vegetation cover and annual herbage mass of preferred grasses were negatively related. Thus, on a spatial scale, pastoralists responded adaptively to the cover of preferred plant species while not responding to total annual herbage mass. Pastoralists stocked pastures more heavily, and livestock used regions within pastures more intensively, where preferred species had a higher cover. However, where sheep grazing pressure was high, downward temporal trends in the herbage mass of preferred species were exacerbated. Pastures that were stocked at a lower density did not experience the negative trends seen in those with a higher density.";"Harris, Richard B.

"AGRIS:US201301799881";"Confronting water in an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement";"";"Trans-boundary water agreements are usually conceived as allocation agreements. In other words, water is treated as if it were a pie to be divided among the riparian states. The treatment of water as if it were as immobile as land may be useful in the short term, but it is fundamentally flawed as a means to avoid conflict as well as to ensure efficient, equitable, and sustainable management of water over the long term. This article proposes to avoid quantitative allocations within international water agreements, whether they be presented as percentage or fixed allocations or whether or not accompanied by a periodic revision clause. It proposes instead an ongoing joint management structure that allows for continuous conflict resolution concerning water demands and uses in a manner that effectively de-nationalises water uses. As well, it builds on existing, functioning institutions that are already active over a variety of scalar levels. It disaggregates what is usually perceived as a national water demand into its component institutions and re-aggregates them within an international institutional context. Though this approach for building trans-boundary water agreements can prove useful in any geographical situation, this article uses the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a model. It proposes to respect the existing differences in the institutional management of water between the two entities and to reach four general objectives: economic efficiency, social and political equity, ecological sustainability, and the ability to implement the agreement in practice. The institutional design and proposed mechanisms follow five key principles for shared management: water allocations that are not fixed but variable over time; equality in rights and responsibilities; priority for demand management over supply management; continuous monitoring of water quality and quantity; and mediation among competing uses of fresh water. This institutional structure balances water quantity and water quality issues and economic and environmental goals in a de-securitised fashion. Though specifically applied to water shared by Israelis and Palestinians, the objectives, principles and institutional structure are relevant to any place in the world where trans-boundary water divides rather than unites two or more peoples.";"Brooks, David

"AGRIS:US201500163005";"Performance evaluation and cost assessment of a key indicator system to monitor desertification vulnerability";"";"A number of studies have dealt with the assessment of potential and actual desertification risk using composite indices. The Environmental Sensitivity Areas (ESA) approach, developed in the framework of MEDALUS project funded by the European Community, is one of the most used procedures to monitor land vulnerability to degradation in the Mediterranean region. The final output of this procedure is an index (ESI) composing four indicators of climate, soil, vegetation, and land management based on 14 elementary variables. Although applied to a number of case studies throughout southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East, the performance of this monitoring system has never been assessed. The present study evaluates the robustness of the ESI through an original procedure incorporating sensitivity analysis and data cost analysis. For each variable, the standard error of the estimate, the correlation coefficient with the ESI, the sensitivity score, and the estimated costs of data collection and handling were calculated in order to evaluate the stability of the final index and the relative importance of each composing variable. The overall performance of the ESI was computed by averaging the score of the four indicators. Variables such as vegetation cover, climate aridity, rainfall, and the degree of land protection provided the largest contribution to the ESI. The illustrated approach is suited to evaluate the overall performance of a set of variables composing a synthetic index. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider explicitly the monetary costs of data collection and handling within a composite index evaluation procedure.";"Ferrara, Agostino

Optimal management of bamboo-based mixed species production systems, however, requires an understanding of bamboo spacing, root activity and distribution of bamboo roots, and the soil nutrient capital of the site. We examined the performance of turmeric as an understorey crop in 7-year old bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus (Roxb.) Nees) stands of varying spacing treatments (4 × 4, 6 × 6, 8 × 8, 10 × 10 and 12 × 12 m) at Kerala Agricultural University Campus, Thrissur, Kerala, India. In order to better understand turmeric and bamboo growth parameters, soil physico-chemical properties, understorey light availability and turmeric root activity by soil injection of ³²P were determined in mixed (turmeric + bamboo) and sole turmeric situations. To characterize root activity, ³²P was applied at 10 cm depth to the turmeric plants in raised beds established between the two central rows of bamboo in all experimental plots. Growth attributes of bamboo were recorded and the soil was analyzed for physico-chemical properties before intercropping. Results revealed that spacing treatments exerted profound influence on bamboo growth. For instance, clump height decreased by 19 % in the widest (12 × 12 m) bamboo spacing compared to that of the closest (4 × 4 m) spacing. However, widely spaced bamboo exhibited better clump diameter, crown coverage and turmeric rhizome yield, whereas, closest (4 × 4 m) spacing of bamboo plot recorded least rhizome yield of 8 Mg/ha; this was 58 % less compared to widest spacing of 12 × 12 m (19.32 Mg/ha). Soil N, P and K at widest spacing was 56, 45 and 33 % less compared to that of the closest spacing. NPK uptake by turmeric also increased in the wider spacing treatments. Factors contributing to reduction in growth of turmeric in the denser bamboo stands may be the high LAI (6.77 in 4 × 4 m spacing) as compared to widest spacing (0.44 in 12 × 12 m spacing) of bamboo, low understorey PAR (107 µmol/sec/m²) and high root competition. Due to competition by bamboo, 89 % decline in ³²P absorption by turmeric at closest spacing of bamboo was observed compared to the bamboo-less plot. On a final note, turmeric, although a shade tolerant Zingiberaceae crop, may perform better if light transmittance is between 66 and 86 % and for optimal performance of the understorey turmeric in mixed species systems, wider bamboo spacings beyond 8 × 8 m are recommended.";"Kittur, B.

Also, such impacts can occur over long time frames by altering successional vegetation trajectories. Removal of domesticated herbivores to protect native biota can therefore lead to unexpected consequences at multiple trophic levels for native and non-native species. In the eastern South Island of New Zealand large areas of seral grassland–shrubland have had livestock (sheep and cattle) removed following changes in land tenure. The long-term (>10� years) outcomes for these communities are complex and difficult to predict: land may return to a native-dominated woody plant community or be invaded by exotic plants and mammals. We quantified direct and indirect effects of livestock removal on this ecosystem by comparing plant and invasive mammal communities at sites where grazing by livestock ceased c.10–35� years ago (conservation sites) with paired sites where pastoralism has continued to the present (pastoral sites). There was higher total native plant richness and reduced richness of exotic plants on conservation sites compared with pastoral sites. Further, there were differences in the use of conservation and pastoral sites by invasive mammals: rabbits and hedgehogs favoured sites grazed by livestock whereas house mice, brushtail possums and hares favoured conservation sites. Changes in the relative abundance of invasive mammal species after removal of domesticated livestock may compromise positive outcomes for conservation in successional plant communities with no evolutionary history of mammalian grazing.";"Whitehead, Amy L.

I used landscape-scale ecological modeling of geographically referenced data on stream location, stream and valley slope, watershed surficial geology, air temperatures, riparian and watershed land cover, watershed road and population densities, and watershed nutrient and wastewater inputs to classify Wisconsin stream sites based on water temperature, flow, and degree of environmental degradation. Fish data from sites classified as perennial coolwater were then analyzed with objective standardized procedures to develop coolwater indices of biotic integrity (IBI). Because of substantial differences in their fish assemblages, separate IBI's were formulated for cool-cold transition (20.7–22.5°C) and cool–warm transition (22.6–24.6°C) streams. The cool–cold transition IBI had five metrics: numbers of darter, madtom, and sculpin species, of coolwater species, and of intolerant species, and the percentages of individuals as tolerant species and as generalist feeders. Scoring criteria differed between northern and southern Wisconsin (boundary at 44.6°N latitude) for the coolwater species metric. The cool–warm transition IBI also had five metrics: numbers of native minnow, of intolerant, and of benthic invertivore species, and percentages of individuals as tolerant species and as omnivores. Scoring criteria differed between small and large streams (boundary at 200km² watershed area) for the intolerant species, benthic invertivore species, and percentage tolerants metrics. In validation tests, scores for both IBI's were significantly related to independent measures of human disturbance, indicating that the IBI's would be useful tools for assessing the environmental quality of coolwater streams. However, for any given level of human disturbance, scores for both IBI's varied substantially, suggesting that multiple IBI samples from multiple sites would be needed to provide a reliable evaluation of a particular stream segment.";"Lyons, John";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"021;USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500163001";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.04.026";"";"";"";"402-412"

Here we provide the first assessment of effects of global change on threatened spiders using a red-listed vulnerable spider, Dolomedes plantarius (Clerck, 1757) as an example. We aim at applying this assessment to assist two conservation actions for this species, including a translocation program. We compiled all the available data on D. plantarius and modelled its current and future distributions on the basis of both climate and land cover variables at a fine resolution (0.1°). We applied an ensemble modelling procedure on the basis of eight modelling techniques, and forecasted the future distribution ranges for two emission scenarios (A1 and B2) and three general circulation models. Despite uncertainty regarding the predictions, the models performed very well, and consensus emerged for models and climate scenarios to predict significant negative effects on the current distribution range of this species. In the UK, the translocated population and one out of three natural populations were predicted to remain in highly suitable environmental areas. In France, one out of six locations was predicted to remain suitable in the future. Given the phylogeographic background of this species, the predicted effects of environmental changes should be considered seriously, especially for the long-term viability of conservation programs.

"AGRIS:US201500163008";"Integrating forest biomass and distance from channel to develop an indicator of riparian condition";"";"Living and detrital biomass in a riparian buffer zones ameliorate diffuse-source pollution originating from adjacent landscapes, with higher nutrient removal potential, particularly with respect to nitrogen and sediments, associated with more biomass (i.e., older forests). Pollution removal is mediated by sediment trapping and uptake of nitrogen by plants and by denitrification by microbial communities in root zones using organic matter and root exudates as energy sources. However, as a consequence of various land management activities, the amount of biomass of most forest riparian zones is much lower than its potential, which is mature forest. This makes restoration of riparian buffer zones to mature forest an ideal way to both improve water quality and increase carbon sequestration. This study measures the amount of biomass aboveground and in soils for a variety of common, age-related condition-types associated with riparian buffer zones along low order (headwater) streams in agricultural landscapes of Coastal Plain North Carolina. The data are used to determine pollution removal potential in relation to stand age and distance from channel and a basis for developing an indicator of riparian condition. Mean biomass for common riparian cover types were Mature Forest (>50 y old): 483Mg/ha; Young Forest (25–50 y old): 257Mg/ha; Regenerating Forest (5–25 y old): 205Mg/ha; recently Harvested Forest (0–5 y old): 165Mg/ha; Perennial Herb: 67Mg/ha; Shrub/Sapling: 63Mg/ha; and Annual Rowcrop: 36Mg/ha. Trees contained >96% of all aboveground biomass and >58% of total biomass present in the forested conditions. Biomass in recently harvested forests were >97% detrital, mostly due to the large amount of slash left after harvesting and the mostly intact soil organic matter. Most (>80%) of the biomass in non-forest cover types was stored in the detrital pool. By partitioning the riparian zone into inverse distance-weighted subzones based on distance from stream channel, we developed an indicator for determining riparian condition based on both biomass and proximity of biomass to channel.";"Rheinhardt, Richard

"AGRIS:US201400157986";"Brave new green world – Consequences of a carbon economy for the conservation of Australian biodiversity";"";"Pricing greenhouse gas emissions is a burgeoning and possibly lucrative financial means for climate change mitigation. Emissions pricing is being used to fund emissions-abatement technologies and to modify land management to improve carbon sequestration and retention. Here we discuss the principal land-management options under existing and realistic future emissions-price legislation in Australia, and examine them with respect to their anticipated direct and indirect effects on biodiversity. The main ways in which emissions price-driven changes to land management can affect biodiversity are through policies and practices for (1) environmental plantings for carbon sequestration, (2) native regrowth, (3) fire management, (4) forestry, (5) agricultural practices (including cropping and grazing), and (6) feral animal control. While most land-management options available to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions offer clear advantages to increase the viability of native biodiversity, we describe several caveats regarding potentially negative outcomes, and outline components that need to be considered if biodiversity is also to benefit from the new carbon economy. Carbon plantings will only have real biodiversity value if they comprise appropriate native tree species and provide suitable habitats and resources for valued fauna. Such plantings also risk severely altering local hydrology and reducing water availability. Management of regrowth post-agricultural abandonment requires setting appropriate baselines and allowing for thinning in certain circumstances, and improvements to forestry rotation lengths would likely increase carbon-retention capacity and biodiversity value. Prescribed burning to reduce the frequency of high-intensity wildfires in northern Australia is being used as a tool to increase carbon retention. Fire management in southern Australia is not readily amenable for maximising carbon storage potential, but will become increasingly important for biodiversity conservation as the climate warms. Carbon price-based modifications to agriculture that would benefit biodiversity include reductions in tillage frequency and livestock densities, reductions in fertiliser use, and retention and regeneration of native shrubs; however, anticipated shifts to exotic perennial grass species such as buffel grass and kikuyu could have net negative implications for native biodiversity. Finally, it is unlikely that major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions arising from feral animal control are possible, even though reduced densities of feral herbivores will benefit Australian biodiversity greatly.";"Bradshaw, Corey J.A.

"AGRIS:US201400157985";"Changing spatial patterns of conservation investment by a major land trust";"";"While numerous scientific publications have used biological data and sometimes decision theory to identify where conservation funds should be invested, studies that examine where money for conservation actually has been spent and how investment patterns have changed through time are scarce. We analyze changing spatial patterns of spending on land protection, using investments by a major conservation organization, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), in the conterminous United States as a case study. We focus on investments in land protection made by TNC in four decades (1970–2009) using fee simple and easement acquisitions. During this period, TNC expanded and accelerated its investments in land conservation. We compare patterns of conservation investment in different states via two metrics: (1) the amount TNC spent to acquire land for protection, and (2) the overall area protected. The two metrics, while correlated, reveal different information about TNC’s investment patterns. The amount of conservation activity TNC undertook in different states shows pronounced variation when measured either by the overall area protected or the cost of acquiring that area. We used a regression approach to relate variation in investment levels across states in each decade to a suite of biological and socioeconomic factors relevant to the effectiveness of conservation resource allocation decisions. Through time, these variables are able to explain greater spatial variation in the levels of investment into different states. The richness of native species per state showed the strongest association with overall investment levels. However, land costs also influenced investment patterns in recent decades but in ways that differed when measured by the overall area protected and by the money spent to protect it.";"Fishburn, Isla S.

"AGRIS:US2016223097";"Integrating Multifunctionality of Agriculture in Regional Land Use Concepts";"";"Because of high population density in Europe agriculture cannot define its aims on its own but has to take account of quite a number of demands from different actors. For instance, agriculture is expected to produce food and at the same time to contribute to the protection of cultural landscapes and the maintenance of ecological services. However, land use concepts are often formulated ecology-oriented neglectingsocio-economic objectives and potential production responses of farmers. The present paper is aimed to illustrate how multi-criteria analysis can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented land use concept for an ecologically very sensitive region into a more integrative and comprehensive one that makes due allowance for socio-economic objectives and farmers' response. The results of our study show that production responses of farmers decisively influence the utility society obtains from land use. Multi-criteria analysis helps to assess the trade-off between 'ecology' and 'economy' and shows how the integration of socio-economic objectives can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological objectives. Our results clearly suggest which farmer production responses should be supported by private organisations and government bodies. Consequently the results can serve as a basis for a local policy programme and can thereby contribute to a regionalisation of agri-environmental measures.";"Ahrens, Heinz

We used a compilation of avian point‐count data, collected over 1990–2008 from nearly 36 000 locations, to model the abundance of individual forest songbird species within the Canadian boreal forest. We evaluated 30 vegetation and 101 climatic variables, representing most of the widely‐used dimensions of climate space, along with less usual measures of inter‐annual variability. Regression tree models allowed us to calculate the relative importance of climate and vegetation variable classes according to avian migration strategy without the need for a priori variable selection or dimension reduction. We tested for hierarchical habitat selection by formulating hypotheses on the locations of variables within the model tree structures. Climate variables explained the majority (77%) of deviance explained over 98 species modelled. As may be expected at high latitudes, we found energy availability (temperature, 65%) to be more important than moisture availability (precipitation, 12%). The contributions of inter‐ and intra‐annual climate variability (28%) were about half that of mean conditions. The relatively large contribution of remotely‐sensed vegetation metrics (23%) highlighted the importance of local vegetation heterogeneity controlled by non‐climatic factors. The two most important vegetation variables were landcover type and April leaf area index. When selected, these generally occurred in a model's right subtree, consistent with predictions from hierarchical habitat selection theory. When occupying the root node, landcover effectively delineated the historical forest‐prairie ecotone, reflecting the current disequilibrium between climate and vegetation due to human land use. Our findings suggest a large potential for avian distributional shifts in response to climate change, but also demonstrate the importance of finer scale vegetation heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of boreal birds.";"Cumming, S.

We focus on value chains, trade volumes, prices, and recent developments for some of the most important raw materials derived from native palms. Trade in palm products takes place at local, regional, national, and international levels. For local communities and individual households palm products may play a key role as the most important or only source of cash income. Most of these palm products are inadequately or not at all captured in trade statistics at the local and regional economic levels. Only products such as vegetable ivory and palm heart are monitored statistically, mainly because they are exported. Most raw materials derived from palms are extracted from the wild, and mainly by destructive harvesting. Reduced availability and rising prices on local and regional markets reflect incipient resource depletion. Only in vegetable ivory more or less sustainable wild harvesting methods prevail. Palm heart is increasingly being harvested from orchards and non-sustainable exploitation of wild populations is loosing ground. The international market for native palm oils and pulp (esp. Euterpe oleracea or açaí) is currently served almost exclusively from Brazil. Due to low oil contents and high production costs palm oils are currently used mainly for cosmetics. Based on their content of protein, starch, tocols, and carotenoids palm fruits have high nutritional value and represent a considerable potential for the development of functional foods, food supplements and animal fodder. Palms could undoubtedly play a more important role in the socio-economic development of north-western South America. Sustainability and marketing potential of palm products are negatively affected by the low income obtained by primary producers which often represents no more than 0.01-3% of the retail value. Poor governance, insecurity of land tenure and unequal sharing of profits endanger a sustainable long-term development of these valuable resources.";"Brokamp, Grischa

In order to compare maximum likelihood and minimum distance to mean classifiers, LISS-III images from IRS-P6 satellite were acquired in August 2008 from the western part of Isfahan. First, the LISS-III image was georeferenced. The Root Mean Square error of less than one pixel was the result of registration. After creating false color composite and calculating transformed divergence index, the images were classified using maximum likelihood and minimum distance to mean classifiers into six categories including river, bare land, agricultural land, urban area, highway and rocky outcrops. The results of classification showed that the dominant land cover type is urban area, occupying about 6821.1 ha representing 38.86% of total area. The accuracy of maximum likelihood and minimum distance to mean classifiers was obtained using error matrix and Kappa analysis. According to the results, the maximum likelihood algorithm had an overall accuracy of 94.93% and the minimum distance to mean method was 85.25% accurate.

"AGRIS:US201301107604";"Agricultural land-use change and its drivers in mountain landscapes: A case study in the Pyrenees";"";"Research studies aimed at integrating socio-economic and geo-bio-physical factors are increasingly being used in order to improve our understanding of the causes and effects of land-use change and to support sustainable landscape development. In line with such approaches, the study reported in this paper addresses land-use change and its drivers in the peripheral area of the Pyrenees National Park (PNP), France. The focus is land-use change on private farmland currently utilised by the farmers. The method relies on a Geographic Information System (GIS), including a digital terrain model, a digital cadastre map and a farm survey addressing current and past land use. For every parcel of land, data on current land-use practices and land-use histories since 1950 were collected during interviews with the farmers. An increase in land-use intensity occurred on some of the parcels in the late 1980s and 1990s, in contrast with the global processes of abandonment or extensification since the early 1960s. This intensification process appears to be related not only to the application of agri-environmental policies but also to specific local factors, in particular to the building of an access road to the highest part of the village. The respective roles of bio-physical factors (slope and elevation) and farm socio-economic factors (farmland spatial pattern, land-tenure system) on land-use change at parcel level have also been investigated. The impact of slope and elevation on land-use type appears overall to have been greater in 2003 than in 1950. However, these factors impact differently according to the types of landscape unit: they are not determining factors in the units remote from the village, but they do have an important role in the units close to the village. The distances of the parcels from the farmstead and their access facilities appear to be the two major farm-related factors in the local context. These results confirm the important role of land-management units' spatial arrangement in land-use dynamics and landscape change, as has already been found in other regions. They are seen as a valuable addition to studies aimed at supporting sustainable management of traditional mountain landscapes for multifunctional purposes.";"Mottet, A.

The trap was made of 3-cm wide, opaque, plastic fiber, wrapped around willow tree trunks (Salix spp.) at a height of 1.5 m height. Traps were checked every two weeks. We collected a total of 45,074 weevils, of which 817 belong to five species unrecorded from China, i.e., Melanapion mandli (Schubert), Asperogronops inaequalis (Boheman), Dorytomus occallescens (Gyllenhal), Ellescus schoenherri (Faust), and Tachyerges pseudostigma (Tempère). Moreover, we collected 43,952 individuals of Melanapion naga (Nakane), Dorytomus alternans Faust, Dorytomus roelofsi Faust, and Dorytomus setosus Zumpt, which are new records for Beijing. The genera Asperogronops Solari and Ellescus Dejean are newly recorded for China. During their seasonal peak, we frequently and abundantly collected D. setosus and D. roelofsi with band-shelter traps, but never by sweeping, beating, or light trapping methods. A review of the biology of these species shows that all have a short active season and prefer shaded tree trunks. Band-shelter traps appear to effectively capture species with these characteristics and underline the importance of collecting methods that take into account the specific life strategy of target species.";"Su, Zhimin

In the Netherlands land subsidence, high population density and intensity of land use aggravate these problems. Increased awareness of these problems and civil society's participation in the discussions complicate these challenges. The Netherlands' Government Service for Land and Water Management (DLG), an organisation specialising in integrated land development, has tackled these problems at a regional/local scale. Land use planning for various different functions within the same territorial area require a special approach to reach sustainable and economically feasible solutions. Different functions of land and water require different hydrological/hydraulic conditions. Therefore regional, physical and socio‐economic characteristics determine the conditions for land and water management strategies. Projects are implemented while different interests such as agriculture, nature and water have to be met according to a participatory, multi‐stakeholder and integrated approach. Therefore the DLG developed special instruments, tested them in practice and applied them. Examples are ‘touch table’, ‘sketch match’ and ‘virtual reality’.

An examination of Wallowa County, Oregon’s implementation of House Bill 3326, a 2001 law giving counties the power to define certain agricultural lands as “marginal,” and therefore exempt from restrictions on subdivision and development, illustrates the ways in which these tensions become magnified as rural communities attempt to govern private land use in the context of rural restructuring. Implementation of HB3326 highlighted the tensions between landowners interested in capitalizing on development opportunities afforded by HB3326, neighboring producers concerned about interference from future amenity migrants, and existing amenity migrants with interests in protecting their rural idyll. Contestations over nonfarm development took place in the context of a strong agricultural community identity, concerns about the effects of economic restructuring on producers, and local resistance to the rural gentrification process.

It is unclear to what extent negative practices by people, such as inappropriate land use or persecution of crows, have contributed to this decline. We conducted a public opinion survey to document ongoing practices towards the crows on Rota, to assess residentsâ knowledge of and attitudes towards the birds, and to gauge potential responses to a government-instituted land incentive programme. Enumerators administered surveys in person during August 2011. Most of the 573 respondents were native Chamorro residents (75%) and more than half were landowners (62%). A majority of respondents (72%) considered environmental issues âvery importantâ and 76% knew of the Mariana crow's Critically Endangered status. Fewer respondents (55%) expressed concern about the bird going extinct. A number of respondents condoned shooting and chasing crows (17 and 52%, respectively), suggesting that residents may be harassing the birds. Chamorro landowners on the island were more likely to have negative attitudes towards the crows and to know people who persecute the crows than other island residents. Education was positively correlated with knowledge and concern about the crow and environmental issues, suggesting that new educational programmes on Rota may help improve residentsâ attitudes towards the species. In addition, we recommend a revision of current land-use regulations and implementation of a monetary compensation programme for owners of crow nesting habitat to improve landownersâ attitudes and practices.";"Sussman, Adrienne F.

"AGRIS:US201400159478";"Does land use change affect the interactions between two dry grassland species?";"";"Over the last 20 years, a change in traditional land use practices has taken place in central Germany. Formerly species-rich dry grassland communities have been converted into communities with greatly reduced diversity in many places. Whereas grass species have expanded, several forbs have declined in abundance. For the present study, plant–plant interactions were assessed between the expanding grass Festuca rupicola and the forb Dianthus carthusianorum – two typical, companion grassland species – to ascertain any associated effects of land use change. A competition experiment was set up with replacement design, in which pots were placed in the open field and monitored over two consecutive years. In order to assess the performance of both species in monoculture (D9, F9) and mixture (D3F6, D6F3) the parameters biomass, length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers per individual, or length of panicles, were analyzed. Positive and negative interactions were evaluated using the “Relative Neighbour Effect” index (RNE). To simulate land use by grazing or mowing, individuals in half of the pots were clipped in the first year after sowing. At this time, performance of D. carthusianorum – in terms of length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers – was significantly affected: whereas the first parameter increased, both of the other parameters decreased with increasing presence of the grass species. However, RNE indicated facilitation with a low number of F. rupicola individuals, and competition with a high number of F. rupicola individuals. In contrast, F. rupicola did not show any significant differences in performance with increasing presence of D. carthusianorum, and the RNE switched from neutral interaction to facilitation. In the second year after sowing, the performance of D. carthusianorum in the various treatments did not differ, except for the length of the flowering stems. The simulation of land use practices did not affect the performance of D. carthusianorum, but F. rupicola showed significant differences in biomass and in length of the panicles, as was the case also between monocultures and mixtures. The performance of the grass species was clearly improved in the unclipped treatments. The RNE reflected competition against D. carthusianorum which became reduced in unclipped treatments, while F. rupicola became facilitated. There were no interactions between the different treatments (monocultures and mixtures) and the simulated land use change (clipped and unclipped). Our data suggest that although traditional land use practices, i.e. grazing and mowing, do not affect the development of D. carthusianorum, the abandonment of these practices has improved F. rupicola performance, which has led to the increasingly invasive character of this grass species over the last 20 years.";"Partzsch, Monika";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"grazing;grazing lands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"DEU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400159478";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2010.09.010";"";"";"";"550-558"

Reindeer management has natural limits of growth. Consequently it should be managed to optimise both the use of reindeer pastures and herder income. Reindeer pastures should be grazed at the economic carrying capabity level. This gives the maximum sustained harvest from reindeer stock and also the maximum sustained foraging from pastures. How is this to be accomplished? First, reliable knowledge about reindeer pastures in time and place is necessary: to estimate the quantity and quality of specific reindeer pastures within each management district, as well as the productive capacity and the changes in condition and productivity of those pastures. Secondly, data is needed on the accurate productivity of reindeer stock and the production costs for each management district. Thirdly, study the relationships between pasture resources and productivity of reindeer stock together with the effects of long-term reindeer densities on pasture condition and productivity. Finally, knowledge is needed about the effects of herd structure on reindeer stock productivity as well as the factors which restrict the use of reindeer pastures. Models based on adequate data could provide a useful tool for optimising the use of reindeer pastures and herder income. First the economic carrying capacity of reindeer pastures should be studied. Subsequently the economy of reindeer husbandry could be modelled with respect to reindeer stock density. Also the economy of reindeer husbandry based on different levels of feeding, and the effects of this husbandry practice on pastures, should be modelled. Models should be accurate and flexible enough to use when looking for solutions to practical questions and challenges in reindeer management.";"Jouko Kumpula";"";"";"AGRIS";"1999-04-05";"";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012065817";"http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1604";"";"";"";"111-120"
"AGRIS:US201500199280";"On the use of remote sensing techniques for monitoring spatio-temporal soil organic carbon dynamics in agricultural systems";"";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics affect soil quality, agricultural productivity and atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Despite the need for spatial assessments of SOC content over time, reliable estimates from traditional field survey methods are limited by data availability; where measurements are often made at discrete point locations, at a coarse sample spacing or over a limited spatial extent. Remote sensing (RS) is in a strong position to provide spatially distributed, reproducible, scale-appropriate and resource-efficient measurements of SOC content and fluxes at field, landscape and regional scales. This paper provides a critical review of optical RS techniques for such applications. The first part of the paper reviews the methods, instruments and techniques used for developing predictive models for monitoring spatial SOC content. Secondly, sources of spatio-temporal SOC variations are examined, including the lateral transfer of SOC by erosion, soil structural breakdown and land management practices, in the context of RS data and techniques. The key challenges of using RS to monitor SOC contents are discussed along with opportunities for improving SOC predictions within a spatial framework. Such opportunities include the use of ancillary data, scale-specific methods, improved development of spectral libraries and better integration of RS technologies into empirical and simulation SOC models. This paper aims to provide a transparent assessment and practical guide to RS techniques and products in order to further advance and better incorporate the use of RS methods within soil science.";"Croft, H.

At local scale, habitat types explain the level of invasion much better than alien propagule pressure. Moreover, it has been shown that patterns of habitat invasion are consistent among European regions with contrasting climates, biogeography, history and socioeconomic background. Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe. European Union and some adjacent countries. We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class. We projected the levels of invasion on the CORINE land-cover map of Europe, extrapolating Catalonian data to the Mediterranean bioregion, Czech data to the Continental bioregion, British data to the British Isles and combined Czech-British data to the Atlantic and Boreal bioregions. The highest levels of invasion were predicted for agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes, low levels for natural and semi-natural grasslands and most woodlands, and the lowest levels for sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands. The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe. High level of invasion is predicted in lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe and low level in the boreal zone and mountain regions across the continent. Low level of invasion is also predicted in the Mediterranean region except its coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land.";"Chytrý, Milan

Previous research has suggested that springtime cropland burning in Eastern Europe, more specifically Russia, is a main contributor of BC in the Arctic atmosphere, acting as a short-lived climate forcer strongly influencing snow-ice albedo and radiation transmission. BC emissions from cropland burning were estimated for the Russian Federation for years 2003 through 2009 using three satellite fire products, the 1 km MODIS Active Fire Product, 0.5° MODIS Fire Radiative Power monthly climate modeling grid product, and the 500 m MODIS Burned Area Product, and a agricultural statistics approach based on a modified method developed and published by the All-Russian Institute of Organic Peat and Fertilizers to estimate farm- and regional-level residue loading from straw surplus left after grain harvesting, while accounting for agricultural management and agrometeorological inputs. The satellite-based emission calculations utilized several different land cover classification schemas for defining croplands in Russia for both the 1 km MODIS Land Cover Product and the 300 m MERIS GlobCover v2.2 data sets. In general, the peaks of BC emissions from cropland burning occurred during the spring (April–May), summer (July–August), and the fall (October). 2008 had the highest annual BC emissions. The range of average annual BC emissions from cropland burning calculated from the different satellite fire products was 2.49 Gg–22.2 Gg, with the agricultural statistics approach annual average equal to 8.90 Gg. The Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) version 3 reported an annual average of 11.9 Gg of BC from agricultural burning. The results from this analysis showed that the majority of BC emissions originated in European Russia, followed by smaller contributions from West Siberia, Far East Russia, and East Siberia macro-regions. An uncertainty assessment on data used to calculate the BC emissions found moderate uncertainty in some of the input data used in this first attempt to produce spatially and temporally explicit BC emission estimates from cropland burning in the Russian Federation.";"McCarty, Jessica L.

Over the years, many urban growth models have been developed and used in the developed countries for forecasting growth patterns. In the developing countries however, there exist a very few studies showing the application of these models and their performances. In this study two models such as cellular automata (CA) and the SLEUTH models are applied in a geographical information system (GIS) to simulate and predict the urban growth and land use change for the City of Sana’a (Yemen) for the period 2004–2020. GIS based maps were generated for the urban growth pattern of the city which was further analyzed using geo-statistical techniques. During the models calibration process, a total of 35� years of time series dataset such as historical topographical maps, aerial photographs and satellite imageries was used to identify the parameters that influenced the urban growth. The validation result showed an overall accuracy of 99.6� %; with the producer’s accuracy of 83.3� % and the user’s accuracy 83.6� %. The SLEUTH model used the best fit growth rule parameters during the calibration to forecasting future urban growth pattern and generated various probability maps in which the individual grid cells are urbanized assuming unique “urban growth signatures”. The models generated future urban growth pattern and land use changes from the period 2004–2020. Both models proved effective in forecasting growth pattern that will be useful in planning and decision making. In comparison, the CA model growth pattern showed high density development, in which growth edges were filled and clusters were merged together to form a compact built-up area wherein less agricultural lands were included. On the contrary, the SLEUTH model growth pattern showed more urban sprawl and low-density development that included substantial areas of agricultural lands.";"Al-shalabi, Mohamed

To obtain a comprehensive picture of the ecological status of the Domitia coastal zone (Campania, Southern Italy), a holistic methodology has been applied. Sedimentological, geochemical, and biological analyses of the surface sediments and water samples were performed along the submerged beach. The data were integrated using a geographical information system, together with information on past and present land use and human activities along the coast and in inland regions. Heavy metal concentrations in sediments plus As and Se (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) and their enrichment factors, which are important for identifying polluted areas in countries like Italy (where environmental legislation has not yet established intervention limits), indicate excesses Cd, Cr, Pb, and V of probable anthropogenic origin. A microbiological contamination of marine waters has been detected by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Campania. The Bacteriological Quality Index map shows that bathing areas must be classified as “contaminated” and “highly contaminated”. High levels of chemical and biological contamination are particularly common in both bathing seawater and sediments along the coastal zone south of the Volturno River, where the existing wastewater treatment plant is not properly working, to date. Factory farming, which is widespread in the area, is likely to be an additional important source of contamination.

Surprisingly, limited evidence is conceptualized from a gendered perspective despite widespread knowledge of men's and women's roles as resource users. This study unravels this puzzle by exploring the extent to which three schemes in Kenya integrate gender in design and implementation. We adopt a combination of in-depth intrahousehold interviews, gender-disaggregated focus-group discussions, and key informant interviews to collect data from scheme members. With the exception of REDD, results reveal widespread gender exclusion despite gender-differentiated costs and benefits incurred by community members living around conservation areas. Gender blindness is considered to reflect economic rationale, property rights, and perception biases.

Findings reveal that income diversification is the norm, that a higher degree of specialization does not characterize more remunerative livelihood strategies, that nonfarm income significantly contributes to higher income earnings, that environmental reliance does not vary across strategies, and that small‐scale farmers are the largest and poorest livelihood group. Some livelihood strategies are superior to all other strategies in terms of income earned; access to more remunerative livelihood strategies is determined by land ownership, education, and ethnic affiliation.

"AGRIS:US201500200310";"self-adapting fuzzy inference system for the evaluation of agricultural land";"";"The inference rules relating land characteristics to suitability class are crucial to the estimation of agricultural land suitability. In fuzzy logic modeling for agricultural land evaluation, the fuzzy inference, based on membership functions and rule aggregation, is constructed with predetermined evaluation criteria, including value ranges for fuzzy linguistic terms, and weights of land variables. However, most existing evaluation criteria systems are built on the basis of expert knowledge and can be highly subjective and contain uncertainty. This study integrates a genetic algorithm with a multi-criteria evaluation based fuzzy inference system (FIS) to construct a self-adapting system that calibrates its evaluation criteria by self-learning from land samples. In the proposed GA-optimized fuzzy inference model, the criteria for land evaluation are encoded into chromosomes, i.e., each chromosome represents a solution for the evaluation criteria system. The performance of the fuzzy inference system on a training set is used as the fitness of an individual chromosome. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of chromosomes through selection, crossover and mutation. To reduce the violation of the constraints for chromosomes and the destruction of excellent genes, the subsets in chromosomes are used as the basic units in crossover and mutation. Some transformations are implemented in mutation to ensure that the new individuals are accorded with the constraints in the evaluation criteria. Three-fold cross-validation (3 CV) is employed to prevent overfitting and to evaluate the performance of the model. The optimized evaluation criteria are produced by decoding the final best chromosome. In the application of the model to the case study area, the accuracy of the evaluation criteria system for the training set increased from 72.08% to 93.34%. The results show that the model is both effective and robust.";"Liu, Yaolin

"AGRIS:US2016213851";"IMPACTS OF EUROPEAN BIOFUEL POLICIES ON AGRICULTURAL MARKETS AND ENVIRONMENT UNDER CONSIDERATION OF 2ND GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE";"";"Even though recent discussions on food prices and indirect land use change point atpotential conflicts associated with the production of biofuels the appraisal of biofuels as an effective instrument to slow down climate change and reduce energy dependency still prevails. The EU Renewable Energy Directive (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2009) underlines this trend by setting a target of 10% share of energy from renewable sources in the transport sector by 2020. As economic competitiveness of biofuel production is still not given in most European countries, support policies are essential to achieve this target. Second generation technologies have still not attained marketability, wherefore biofuel consumption will continueto significantly affect agricultural markets. Furthermore, biofuel trade receives more attention. Apart from Brazil the USA has evolved to one of the key biofuel producer in recent years replacing the EU as the dominant biodiesel exporter. Those developments in regions outside the EU have to be considered within the evolution of biofuel markets. The primary objectiveof this paper is to analyse in detail impacts of future biofuel developments on agricultural markets under several assumptions regarding the availability of 2nd generation technologies, the EU support policy framework and the EU trade policy regime. Therefore, we developed an extended version of the comparative static agricultural sector model CAPRI which coversglobal biofuel markets with a detailed focus on Europe. The results supplement alreadyexisting model-based impact assessments while focussing on EU Member State level andintroducing global bilateral trade of biofuels based on the Armington approach. The results of our scenario analysis presented in this paper indicate that the European 2020 biofuel target will significantly affect global and European biofuel- as well as agricultural markets. Thereby, global biofuel trade will notably increase, especially flows of biodiesel from the USA and Argentina and of ethanol from Brazil into the EU will increase accentuating the net-importing position of the EU by 2020. On the agricultural markets, we can observe that additional demand caused by European biofuel production will be, on the one hand, partially compensated by substitution effects on the feed market and, on the other hand, mainly filled by increasing imports. Thus, effects on agricultural product prices will also be significant, while effects on EU agricultural production will only be marginal. This leads consequently toonly marginal environmental impacts within Europe and confirm the assumption that notable environmental effects caused by EU biofuel production and consumption will mainly take place outside Europe, especially in those countries which are important producers of biofuel feedstock.";"Becker, Arno

However, compared with other large-scale infrastructure in the landscape, there has been relatively little research on the perceptions of transmission lines. Consequently, the aim of this study was to analyse how transmission lines are perceived in comparison with other landscape elements and how the perceptions of existing transmission lines differ from those concerning new lines. Finally, the heterogeneity of the perceptions was examined with the aid of the latent class method. The study was based on survey data from an urban fringe community in southern Finland. The results confirmed the presupposition that transmission lines are generally perceived as negative landscape elements, both when long-established and when new. However, the perceptions among the residents were heterogeneous. This heterogeneity was explained with environmental attitudes and leisure activities as well as knowledge and land ownership. The results have implications for planning, public communication and participation related to transmission lines, as well as other visually dominating man-made structures in the landscape.";"Soini, Katriina

In the north of Rio de Janeiro State, the ""Mata do Carvão"" (1053 ha) is the largest remaining fragment. This study describes the structure and floristic composition of a remnant forest on tertiary tabuleiros and its main aim was to compare this forest with other ""tabuleiro"" and Atlantic forest remnants in the region. To carry out the inventory, four plots of 50 x 50 m were allocated in a selected area without vestiges of logging activities or fire. All trees  > or =  10 cm DBH were sampled and numbered with aluminium tags. Dead trees were measured but not tagged. A total of 564 trees was sampled being distributed within 34 families. The families with higher number of species were Leguminosae (18), Myrtaceae (8), and Euphorbiaceae (6). The most abundant families were Rutaceae (189), Leguminosae (97) and Euphorbiaceae (47). The species with higher cover index values were Metrodorea brevifolia, Paratecoma peroba and Pseudopiptadenia contorta. Although the ""Mata do Carvão"" showed lower tree diversity (H = 3.21) than those found for other semi-deciduous seasonal forests, it has a high species similarity between the tabuleiro forests of South Bahia and North of Espírito Santo. In the ""Mata do Carvão"", the occurrence of rare species at risk of extinction (e.g. Paratecoma peroba) was observed. Furthermore, these are new occurrences for the Rio de Janeiro State (Centrolobium sclerophyllum and Polygala pulcherrima).

As formações florestais sobre tabuleiros terciários ocorrem hoje na forma de pequenos fragmentos desde o Rio Grande do Norte até o Rio de Janeiro.

"AGRIS:US201500217130";"Exploring land use changes and the role of palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia";"";"This study compiles and analyses national-level data on land use change (LUC) and its causes in Indonesia and Malaysia over the past 30 years. The study also explores the role that palm oil has played in past LUC and that projected growth in palm oil production may play in LUC until 2020 and suggests strategies to minimize negative effects. Data collection for the study revealed that the quality and quantity of data on LUC on a national scale over time are low. Despite these uncertainties, the overview of past LUC indicates that large changes in land use have occurred in Indonesia and Malaysia. In Indonesia, LUC can primarily be characterized by forest cover loss on 40 million ha (Mha) of land, a 30% reduction in forest land. Deforestation in Malaysia has been smaller in both absolute and relative terms, with a forest cover loss of nearly 5Mha (20% reduction in forest land). Other large changes in Malaysia occurred in permanent cropland (excluding oil palm), which has decreased rapidly since the early 1990s, and in land under oil palm cultivation, which experienced a sharp increase. Projections of additional land demand for palm oil production in 2020 range from 1 to 28Mha in Indonesia. The demand can be met to a large extent by degraded land if no further deforestation is assumed. In Malaysia, expansion projections range from 0.06 to 5Mha, but only the lowest projection of oil palm expansion is feasible when only degraded land may be used. The role of palm oil production in future LUC depends on the size of the projected expansion as well as agricultural management factors such as implementation of best management practices, earlier replanting with higher yielding plants, and establishment of new plantations on degraded land. The current use of degraded land needs to be investigated in order to reduce possible indirect LUC, land tenure conflicts, or other social impacts. In addition to minimizing direct and indirect LUC by the palm oil sector, measures that reduce deforestation triggered by other causes must also be implemented. A key element for doing so is better planning and governance of land use, which entails more appropriate demarcation of forest land and protection of land that still has forest cover, improved monitoring of land use, and more research to uncover the complexities and dynamics of the causes and drivers of LUC.";"Wicke, Birka

"AGRIS:US201500217136";"Dynamic land use and land cover changes and their effect on forest resources in a coastal village of Matemwe, Zanzibar, Tanzania";"";"Recent land cover change estimates show overall decline of tropical forests at the regional and global scales caused by multiple social, cultural and economic factors. There is an overall concern on the prevailing land use practices, such as shifting cultivation and extraction of forest materials as agents of forests losses, but also new, emerging land uses are threatening tropical forests. Understanding of the long-term development and driving forces of forest changes are needed, especially at local levels where many decisions on forest policies and land uses are made. This paper addresses the importance of such information for improved estimates of forest dynamics by studying local level land cover and land use changes during the last 50–70 years in the Eastern African tropical island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The paper discusses the role of traditional and new land uses mainly subsistence farming, tourism and government interference through tree planting, in the long-term development of the forests at the village level. The material for the study is gathered from the interpretation of archival maps and aerial photographs combined with contemporary digital aerial photographs. The analyses are based on the mapping, spatial sampling and spatio-temporal change trajectory analysis (LCTA) of forest land cover, forest land uses and settlement patterns with GIS and statistics. Six distinct forest land cover change trajectories were identified and these illustrate dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the forests. Closed forest cover has dominated throughout due to cyclical land use patterns, but over 70% of the land area has been continuously transforming between closed, semi-open and open land cover conditions. Land use turnover rates indicate that hardly any forest areas are left untouched from the forces, which remove and re-establish forest vegetation in the long run. Land cover and land use change trajectories are spatially fragmented in the studied landscape. Majority of forest loss-gain dynamics is caused by shifting cultivation, while forest losses are most dramatic along the coast, where traditional and new land uses meet and land uses pressures are highest. The study suggests that landscape change trajectory analyses, where contemporary and historical information on land uses and land cover changes are spatially linked, can provide valuable aspects into local level forest land use planning and management strategies. For the case study, the findings suggest the following key forest management strategies for consideration: (1) establishment of a protected forest/scrubland in participation with the local stakeholders, especially the farmers, (2) promotion of areas for permanent agricultural practices, while simultaneously introducing management controls in the traditional slash-and-burn farming areas, and (3) promoting new livelihood opportunities for the farmers, who have traditionally been dependent on forest resources, meanwhile introducing alternatives for fuel wood for cooking.";"Käyhkö, Niina

Their prime functions, to control urban sprawl and preserve an encircling green girdle to separate the urban from the open countryside, have created ‘edgelands’ that have been remarkably dynamic despite relatively strong controls on certain types of development. A detailed case study of one part of London's Metropolitan Green Belt, drawing upon analysis of planning registers, reveals long-term trends in land-use change linked to the development controls operated within the context of the Green Belt and the adjacent built-up area. This paper also outlines the history of the Green Belt policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and discusses recently proposed policy changes that have provoked ongoing debate about this form of control on urban sprawl and its consequences for the land use of Green Belts and the edgelands.";"Gant, Robert L.

"AGRIS:US201500066607";"impact of a growing bioethanol industry on food production in Brazil";"";"The Brazilian production of major food commodities increased fivefold between 1961 and 2008. In the same time, the area cropped with sugar cane increased with high growth rates, currently covering 3% of the area dedicated to agricultural production in Brazil. In order to assess a possible competition between biofuel and food production, the development of agricultural productivity and area expansion in the past was analysed. Furthermore, the future situation of land resources for agricultural production was illustrated. The findings of this study indicated that area resources of more than 20 million hectare would be available for agricultural production in the upcoming years. A current constraint of food production throughout land dedicated to biofuels was not found. Three scenarios were investigated, simulating possibilities of future changes in Brazilian agriculture. The results demonstrated that primary food production could be enhanced by 1.5 times while bioethanol production was enhanced simultaneously by 1.8 times over the years 2007/2008 and 2020. The generated bioethanol volumes would meet 38% of the total energy demand in Brazilian transport sector, applied to the year 2007. The second scenario evaluated an agricultural development with a higher focus on biofuels. It was projected that the production of bioethanol could be increased by 3.0 times to 76.7 million m³ of bioethanol, while increasing at the same time primary food production with the factor 1.4 aligned to the projected population growth. This bioethanol volume represents 67% of the total energy demand in Brazilian transport sector in the year 2007. A third scenario demonstrated that food production could be increased even with no area expansion higher than the projected population growth, due to a continued increase of productivity. At the same time bioethanol production would rise to 32 million m³ without occupying more area.";"Gauder, Martin

"AGRIS:US201600057273";"Super-resolution mapping based on the supervised fuzzy c-means approach";"";"Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a process that provides land-cover spatial distribution with a spatial resolution finer than the size of a remotely sensed image pixel. Usually, the fraction images generated from soft classifiers are used as constraints in SRM, making the accurate estimation of fraction images an important task in SRM. Supervised fuzzy c-means (sFCM), which belongs to the fuzzy-set technology commonly applied for unmixing mixed pixels, is capable of providing accurate estimates of fraction images used for SRM. It can also generate more than one output of fraction images with a different degree of fuzziness, providing more flexible choices for the fraction images for SRM. However, unmixing errors of sFCM are carried over to SRM, which uses fraction images as a constraint. In this letter, a novel sFCM-based SRM (sFCM_SRM) model that incorporates the pixel-unmixing criterion of sFCM in its objective function is proposed. Without using fraction images as a constraint, sFCM_SRM can be directly applied to remotely sensed images and can eliminate the influence of pixel-unmixing errors on the resultant super-resolution (SR) map to some extent. Both synthetic multispectral and IKONOS images were applied, and the proposed sFCM_SRM model was evaluated by comparison with the SRM model in which sFCM was first used to generate fractions and then pixel-swapping algorithm (PSA) was applied to yield the final SR map. The sFCM_SRM model generates a more visually and quantitatively accurate SR map.";"Li, Xiaodong

"AGRIS:US201500055545";"Hybrid poplar yields in Québec: Implications for a sustainable forest zoning management system";"";"In the province of Québec, approximately 12 000 ha of fast-growing poplar plantations are managed by industrials, while small private landowners have planted only 1000 ha. Most of these poplar plantations are established on clearcut forest sites (approx. 11 000 ha). What are the yields of these hybrid poplar plantations? In this article, available yield data are presented and discussed in the context of a sustainable forest zoning management system. In southern Québec, three factors are highly correlated to yield for clones of various parentages: NO3 supply rate in riparian soils, elevation (or climate) and soil P availability in abandoned farmland soils. Many Québec forest sites, particularly in the boreal shield ecozone, have acidic soils and harsh climate, with low mineralization rates. They generally cannot fulfill the very high nutrient requirements of hybrid poplars. Within a forest zoning management system, hybrid poplar plantations and agroforestry should be located in priority in southern Québec landscapes, with low remaining natural forest cover, and where intensive agriculture is the dominant land-use. This strategy will increase biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. Elsewhere, intensive trembling aspen regeneration silviculture could be a sustainable alternative to forest conversion into hybrid poplar plantations.";"Fortier, Julien

We developed a conversion matrix to convert FEC ecosite classifications from the northeast and north-west to the provincial ELC system for the boreal forest region of Ontario. The conversion system is intended to apply at the scale of individual plots, with a special focus on PGP, PSP and TSP networks, and has been limited to forested ecosystems, as FEC systems were originally developed for the forest land base only. The conversion is primarily driven by canopy cover composition derived from plot-based individual tree data, with additional information required on substrate characteristics (e.g., substrate type, depth of mineral material, effective soil texture and moisture regime). It is possible to derive some of the soil variables from the broadly defined soil-type (S-type) categories of the original FEC systems; however, this approach requires making some assumptions that could reduce the accuracy of conversion. We anticipate that this conversion matrix will bridge the gap until active plot networks are re-typed in the field into the ELC system, provide a link to historical TSPs, and would be of general interest to a variety of new ELC users.";"Pokharel, Bharat

The 1935 plots are the earliest-known, sample-intensive, quantitative documentation of forest vegetation over a Southwest USA landscape. Findings documented that previously described increases in densities and basal areas attributed to fire exclusion were followed by decreases in 1935-2004 and 1984-2005. Decreases in MCF were attributable primarily to quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and white fir (Abies concolor), but there were differences between dry-mesic and moist-mesic MCF subtypes. Decreases in SFF were attributable to quaking aspen, spruce (Picea engelmannii + Picea pungens), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Decreases in QAF resulted from the loss of quaking aspen during succession. Changes in ponderosa pine forest (PPF) are described in a parallel paper (Vankat, J.L., 2011. Post-1935 changes in forest vegetation of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA: part 1 - ponderosa pine forest. Forest Ecology and Management 261, 309-325). Graphical synthesis of historical and modern MCF data sets for GCNP indicated tree densities and basal areas increased from the late 19th to the mid 20th century and then decreased to the 21st century. Changes began earlier, occurred more rapidly, and/or were larger at higher elevation. Plot data showed that basal area decreased earlier and/or more rapidly than density and that decreases from 1935 to 2004 resulted in convergence among MCF, SFF, and PPF. If GCNP coniferous forests are trending toward conditions present before fire exclusion, this implies density and basal area were more similar among these forests in the late 19th century than in 1935. Changes in MCF and SFF can be placed in a general framework of forest accretion, inflection, and recession in which increases in tree density and basal area are followed by an inflection point and decreases. Accretion was triggered by the exogenous factor of fire exclusion, and inflection and recession apparently were driven by the endogenous factor of density-dependent mortality combined with exogenous factors such as climate. Although the decreases in density and basal area could be unique to GCNP, it is likely that the historical study plots provided a unique opportunity to quantitatively determine forest trends since 1935. This documentation of post-1935 decreases in MCF and SFF densities and basal areas indicates a shift in perspective on Southwestern forests is needed.";"Vankat, John L.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301928194";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.09.015";"";"";"";"326-341"

Basin-wide net land use and land cover changes imply substantially different situations between distinct regions and states due to different agricultural policies. This research used eight landscape metrics to quantify and investigate the spatial patterns of cattle pasture and cropland throughout the states of Pará, Mato Grosso, Rondônia, and Amazonas. These metrics were patch density (DEN), mean patch size (MPS), largest patch index (LPI), mean edge density (MED), mean twist number (TWI), corrected perimeter-to-area ratio (CPA), fractal dimension (FDI), and fragmentation index (FRG). A total of 1852 patches were analyzed, originating from 86 samples in 71 different plots, covering a total of 177,500km² throughout all four states. Principal component analysis showed a partial overlap in the spatial pattern of agricultural patches between all states. The largest percentage of variance was explained by patch area metrics, which can be related to the different approaches in agricultural policies, but no clear division between the states was identified in this dimension. The metrics quantifying patch shape were de facto independent of deforestation area, and related to the second principal component axis. Although some overlap in this dimension was present as well, these metrics proved a possible measure for discerning the patterns of agriculture attached to a certain state. Different land use policies are hypothesized to lead to more heterogeneity in landscape patterns in an early stage, yet the increasing influence of both cropland and pasture agriculture eventually leads to more uniform landscapes in which spatial differences gradually disappear.";"Colson, Filip

However, it is plagued by a wide variety of pests. The cotton industry in Zimbabwe came up with sustainable pest management strategies which include within the season rotation of bollworm pesticides, a closed season and acaricide rotation scheme. The land reform programme brought new players in the cotton industry and it was critical to determine their knowledge on the pest management strategies. A survey was conducted to determine farmer knowledge, practice and perception on the resistance management strategy. Responses indicated that both communal and new farmers based their spray on egg counts. Communal farmers knew when to use pyrethroids compared to new farmers. Farmers observed the acaricide rotation scheme although they use some non acaricide pesticides. More than half of the new farmers could not say which acaricides were in the acaricide scheme. The majority of the farmers reported that they adhered to the closed season although field observation revealed otherwise. A significantly higher number of new farmers knew when to slash cotton compared to communal farmers. Knowledge of acaricides was not common among farmers. Use of pyrethroids was not limited to 1 February onwards as stipulated in the cotton pest resistance management strategy. The results suggest the need for training among the cotton farmers especially the new farmers or refresher courses among the communal farmers.";"Tibugari, H.

Successful future restoration should therefore increase both habitat area and connectivity. The first steps in a framework for doing so are addressed here, which involve the mapping of past habitat change. We present a method which is unique in: the large area covered (2500km²), the high resolution of the data (25×25m), the long period assessed (70years), and a system for translation of land use maps into Broad Habitat Types using soil surveys. We digitised land use maps from the 1930s for the county of Dorset in southern England. The resulting map was compared to the UK Land Cover Map of 2000. For our example area, land use shifted dramatically to more intensive agriculture: 97% of all semi-natural grasslands were converted into agriculturally-improved grassland or arable land as were large proportions of the heathlands and rough grasslands (−57%). The other important driver of change was afforestation (+25%). The larger habitat areas became fragmented, with average fragment size of different habitats falling by 31–94%. Furthermore, the connectivity between fragments dropped drastically, by up to 98%. Analyses such as those presented here not only quantify the scale and pattern of habitat loss, but are important to inform land-use planning to restore biodiversity by both increasing the available habitat and facilitating dispersal among habitat fragments. We discuss the possible steps for such a framework.";"Hooftman, D.A.P.

This study examined the Tedori River alluvial fan in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, where paddy fields occupy 45 % of the total area. A regional groundwater flow model simulated future groundwater levels in response to 38 climate change projections generated for each of three GCMs, using three GHG emission scenarios with the ELPIS-JP datasets. The numerical groundwater flow model consisted of a 1-D unsaturated water flow model (HYDRUS-1D) for estimating groundwater recharge and a 3-D groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Variable parameters consisted of daily air temperature, precipitation, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, which influence groundwater through infiltration, evapotranspiration, snowfall, and snowmelt. Groundwater levels had both decreasing and increasing trends, depending on climate change. There were more decreasing than increasing trends, and the maximum groundwater drawdown during 2010–2090 was ~1 m. Groundwater level was most sensitive to change in rate of precipitation during the non-irrigation period. Variations of relatively low-intensity precipitation days, when daily precipitation was <10 mm, had an effect on groundwater level. These results contribute to development of adaptive and sustainable groundwater managements (e.g. land use management and pumping strategies) in the future.";"Yoshioka, Yumi

This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides.

Misunderstanding this variation can influence land management and planning decisions, leading to poor implementation of biodiversity offsetting mechanisms, for example. We monitored plots (400 m²) grazed by livestock paired with adjacent ungrazed plots in derived native pastures four times a year over 2.5 years on the North‐West Slopes of New South Wales. Species density in plots varied greatly with season and interannual rainfall. Highest species density was recorded in spring, though species density in summer was not significantly lower, nor was a spring–summer peak in species density evident in the 2009 drought. Surveys in spring 2008 had the highest species density, and recorded only 60–72% of the total species recorded at each site over 2.5 years. Variation in the proportion of total site diversity represented in combinations of two or three surveys was large, though the best combinations comprised surveys from spring and summer in years of above‐average rainfall, either from the same spring‐summer, or from different years. Compositional differences among sites were much greater than within sites, showing that differences among sites related to broad environmental gradients were not overwhelmed by seasonal and interannual variability in site composition. When grazing was excluded, there was no evidence of competitive exclusion by the dominant grasses, and no directional shift in composition. The implications of these findings for ecological research depend on the question being addressed: if capturing a large proportion of site diversity is important, then surveys must be carefully timed, or repeat surveys must be conducted. Single surveys did not effectively capture site diversity for use in biodiversity offsetting, and the timing of repeat surveys was critical.";"Schultz, Nick L.

Landscape composition and configuration metrics, together with variables assessing the physical characteristics of the study area, were used. The analysis was performed using seasonal data from the years 2001 and 2006. The seasonal influence was included as a random effect to account for temporal correlations. Together, the fixed and the random factors explain 78% of the variance, whereas the fixed factors alone explain 10%. Urban, slope, elevation and aggregation index of urban class contribute to the differences found in the NO3â-N concentrations. Urban has the weakest effect, whereas slope and elevation show a conditioned negative effect on nitrate-N. The effect of slope gets stronger for higher standard deviations of elevation and the effect of the standard deviation of elevation, measuring the variation of elevation within a sub-watershed, gets stronger for steeper slopes. Of the configuration class level metrics included in the analysis, only aggregation index of urban played a significant role in the final model, and it revealed to be related to urban percentage. The influence of landscape configuration metrics, though observed by others, was not obvious in this study.

The possibility of kangaroo harvesting ever being economically viable, however, is often dismissed due to the impossibility of constraining these freely roaming animals to a particular property. In this paper, we explore the extent to which landholders do have control of their harvests regardless of the activities on neighboring land. Three scenarios are investigated: a property with a porous border that is surrounded by a reserve, like a national park, that is much larger and where harvesting is prohibited; a pair of properties with porous borders where harvesting is permitted and landholders act cooperatively; and finally two properties with porous borders where harvesting is permitted and landholders act competitively. The results indicate that despite the freely roaming nature of kangaroos, private property owners can obtain harvests proportional to the extent to which their land and grazing resources are utilized.";"Moloney, Paul D.

Nevertheless, fire is inherently dangerous and may impose risk upon humans, properties, and other natural resources. With the case of southern United States, the objective of this study is to assess the trend of administrative law reforms for forestry prescribed burning within the theoretical framework of management-based regulation. A key finding is that existing regulations focus on the production and management process of prescribed burning to identify and reduce risk. They demand moderate resource commitments, and many are related to the planning stage of a burn rather than the implementation stage. These results will assist the public in comprehending the rationale and trend of administrative law reforms for prescribed burning. Countries facing similar challenges in achieving a sustainable growth of forest resources can also learn from these legal reform experiences for forestry prescribed burning in the United States.";"Sun, C.

Olive tree groves in South-eastern Spain’s mountainous areas are subject to a high risk of soil erosion, which is the main environmental problem for this crop, and have to incur in high costs of soil conservation. This results in a greater difficulty to comply with the practices required to benefit from both the single payment and agri-environmental schemes. In many high-steeped areas, farmers have opted for non-tillage practices as an alternative to other conservation practices. Using our own data from a survey carried out in 2006 among 215 olive tree farmers from the Granada Province in Southern Spain regarding the adoption of soil conservation and management practices, we model the diffusion process of no tillage practices using several specifications (logistic, Gompertz and exponential). We also estimate an ordered probit model to analyse which socio-economic and institutional factors determine the adoption of no tillage. Our results show that 90% of farmers in the area of study perform no tillage with either localized (21%) or no localized (69%) application of weedicides. The diffusion process of no tillage has been very intense since the middle nineties, and has been based on the interactions among farmers in the area of study rather than in external factors such as EU policies or extension services. Among other relevant factors that positively affect the adoption of no tillage practices in general, such as farm size and irrigation, the probability of a farmer adopting no tillage with non-localized application of weedicides increases when there is a relative that will continue with the farming activity, what causes the farmer to incorporate long term effects in his farming decisions, when the farmer is only a manager or when he bought the farm rather than inherited it (i.e. on more professionalized farms), and with his educational level. These results confirm some findings from previous studies in other nearby areas.";"Franco, Juan Agustin

Kalman (Rosaceae) (henceforth called Prunus) that are harvested from the wild. Due to unsustainable bark harvesting practices, the European Union, which is Cameroon's main market for Prunus bark, banned its importation. To reduce pressure on existing natural stock, research and development organizations introduced innovations to encourage farmers to plant Prunus trees. The research reported in this article analyses farmer characteristics which influence their Prunus planting behaviour, and examines their main problems. Results from interviewing 154 farmers who have been trained on tree domestication techniques suggest that male farmers and those who bought their land have planted Prunus in their farms. We conclude that Prunus information and planting campaigns can be effective if they are accompanied with policies which influence better prices, supply of seeds and seedlings, and address land tenure issues.";"Gyau, A.

Despite hundreds of field studies and at least a dozen literature reviews, there is still considerable disagreement on the direction and magnitude of changes in soil C stocks with land-use change. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies that quantified changes in soil C stocks with land use in the tropics. Conversion from one land use to another caused significant increases or decreases in soil C stocks for 8 of the 14 transitions examined. For the three land-use transitions with sufficient observations, both the direction and magnitude of the change in soil C pools depended strongly on biophysical factors of mean annual precipitation and dominant soil clay mineralogy. When we compared the distribution of biophysical conditions of the field observations to the area-weighted distribution of those factors in the tropics as a whole or the tropical lands that have undergone conversion, we found that field observations are highly unrepresentative of most tropical landscapes. Because of this geographic bias we strongly caution against extrapolating average values of land-cover change effects on soil C stocks, such as those generated through meta-analysis and literature reviews, to regions that differ in biophysical conditions.";"Powers, Jennifer S.

"AGRIS:US201600007812";"Behavioural Responses of GPS-Collared Female Red Deer Cervus elaphus to Driven Hunts";"";"Precise knowledge of how game species react to different hunting practices is a prerequisite for sound management of intensively hunted populations. We compared behavioural and spatial behaviour of five GPS-collared female red deer Cervus elaphus in Denmark before, during and after exposure to 21 driven hunts (2––5 times each). In 53% of all hunts, deer left their normal home ranges within 24 hours, moving on average 4 km and remaining away for an average of six days. Compared to pre-hunt values, deer moved longer distances per unit time on the day of the hunt and during the following two nights. Diurnal activity (based on motion sensors) did not increase significantly on the hunting day, but was lower than normal the day after the hunt. Nocturnal activity was equal before and after hunts. Deer spent 96% of their time in (safer) forest habitats by day and 43% by night before and after hunts. No induced responses were conditional on distance to the hunters (0––1.5 km), hunt duration (1.3––6.4 hours) or the time elapsed since previous hunts (4 to >30 days). The inclination of deer to flee from areas following hunts might complicate attempts to optimise harvesting policies in landscapes with many landowners within a typical flight range.";"Sunde, Peter

However, indiscriminate harvesting of valuable timber resources for commodity-type products such as sawn-timber, charcoal and fuel-wood are the main drivers of forest depletion. Challenges related to customary-lands, land-tenure, lack of information about forest resources as well as the weak institutions is contributing factors that have accelerated to steady reduction of forest cover in the country. The need for investments in the forest products sector and an equitable sharing of benefits with local communities are pre-requisites to shift into higher value-added manufacturing. In the context, the implementation of the REDD+ initiatives, which aims to build capacity and technical knowledge on the ground together with improved monitoring, reporting and verifying of the forest resources data from a centrally planned command could help to arrest the depletion of the forest through better planning and management of the resources.";"Ratnasingam, J.

The empirical example is concerned with a hedonic price model for residential property values. The first bandwidth approach varies an a priori determined plug-in bandwidth criterion. The second method is a data driven cross-validation approach to determine the optimal neighborhood. The third approach uses a robust semivariogram to determine the range over which residuals are spatially correlated. Inference becomes more conservative as the plug-in bandwidth is increased. The data-driven approaches prove valuable because they are capable of identifying the optimal spatial range, which can subsequently be used to inform the choice of an appropriate bandwidth value. In our empirical example, pertaining to a standard spatial model and ditto dataset, the results of the data driven procedures can only be reconciled with relatively high plug-in values (n0.65 or n0.75). The results for the semivariogram and the cross-validation approaches are very similar which, given its computational simplicity, gives the semivariogram approach an edge over the more flexible cross-validation approach.";"Lambert, Dayton M.

"AGRIS:US2016208869";"Spatially-explicit scenarios on global cropland expansion and available forest land in an integrated modelling framework";"";"The pressure on land as required input in competing uses fuelled research on trade-offs in land use due to agricultural land expansion to meet food demand which is explicitly and implicitly treated in global land use modelling. Global land use studies rely on assessing the trade-offs by assuming policy, environmental, and economic constraints on the availability of land but do not base on consistent land use budgets. Commonly, they lack the focus on a holistic view on land use which employs different categories including trade-offs without mixing land use with land cover categories. We pursue a spatially-explicit land use budgeting approach in global available land assessment to overcome overlaps in classification. Objectives pertain to (a) identifying and integrating plausible environmental datasets in consistent land use datasets and (b) identifying and analysing the available land base and plausible exogenous land conversion rates in the agricultural land use optimization model MAgPIE. Methodologically, consistent spatially-explicit land use datasets and incorporated climate, physical and normative constraints are used in a static geographical approach to overcome overlaps in classification. In a second step, the generated available-land-input datasets from pre-processing are implemented in MAgPIE as constraint equations. Assumed environmental trade-offs are complemented by economic trade-offs in terms of costs of land conversion and technological change. The analysis of model behaviour until 2055 builds on joint land expansion scenarios including available land stocks and historical cropland conversion rates. Results and conclusions refer to the available stock for conversion and land use patterns including the trade off between expansion versus intensification, the average technological change and relative total costs of production for three regions in two scenarios.";"Krause, Michael

"AGRIS:US2016204544";"Determinants of land use change: evidence from a community study in Honduras";"";"This study investigates the micro-determinants of land use change usingcommunity, household and plot histories, an ethnographic method that constructs paneldata from systematic oral recalls. A 20-year historical timeline (1975-1995) isconstructed for the village of La Lima in central Honduras, based on a random sample of97 plots. Changes in land use are examined using transition analysis and multinomiallogit analysis. Transition analysis shows that land use transitions were relativelyinfrequent in areas under extensive cultivation, but more so in areas of intensivecultivation; and that most changes favored intensification. Econometric analysis suggeststhat land use intensification was influenced by plot level variables (especially altitude,slope, distance to a road and tenure), farm level variables (human capital, farm size, andownership of productive implements), and by community variables (especially presenceof technical assistance programs).To the extent these results are found to be more broadly representative, theysuggest that there may be good potential to promote income-enhancing horticulturaldevelopment through investments in technical assistance and education in similarcommunities elsewhere in Honduras. The study concludes that the plot history approachis a potentially valuable tool for investigating the underlying causes of change in land useat the micro-level. The method is particularly well adapted to situations where theavailability of data is poor. It is also suggested that the approach would have additionalbenefits when replicated over a large number of sites as this would allow integration ofhigher order determinants (e.g. national policies and market incentives) while expandingthe applicability and representativity of findings.";"Bergeron, Gilles

A bio-economic optimal control model is presented and its results calibrated with data from two farming communities from Yucatan (Mexico).  The ecological-economic model restates the validity of the neo-Malthusian 'Population Pressure Hypothesis' (PPH) as a major factor of land degradation.  It is pointed out that 'fallow crises' may be overcome when the production elasticity of total farm labour is sufficiently high compared to the elasticity of substituion between farm labour and soil quality.  Calibration of the model also suggests that the strategy by poor households is to allocate more labour to clearing forestland when population densities increase, hence adding to 'population pressure' on the forest commons.";"Pascual, Unai

"AGRIS:US201301086992";"Welfare effects of forestry best management practices in the United States";"";"State forestry best management practice (BMP) programs have been widely developed and implemented to prevent nonpoint source water pollution in the past three decades. The unanswered question is how forestry BMPs have affected the welfare positions of consumers, mills, loggers, and forest landowners. A Muth-type equilibrium displacement model was constructed to examine welfare changes of these stakeholders. The model considered a two-stage vertical production system with variable proportion production technology and imperfect market structure. Industrial mills experienced little welfare loss from forestry BMP regulation. Consumers had the largest absolute welfare loss, and loggers had the largest relative welfare loss in the base scenario. The supply elasticity of harvesting services had the greatest impact on the relative incidence of welfare losses between landowners and loggers, and in the long run their welfare losses were comparable. These results may help to improve future state forestry BMP guidelines and design incentive systems for increasing implementation rates.";"Sun, C.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"forestry;state forests;landowners";"Forest Tenure";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301086992";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X06-052";"";"";"";"1674-1683"

Such information is vital to monitor mangrove cover change and craft plans for their sustainable management. This study was conducted to provide some land use information about Banacon Island in Bohol province. The island is renowned for its vast mangrove plantations, community-initiated reforestation, and double reef system. To determine the different forest land uses therein, the study employed a maximum likelihood classification method using two Landsat images of different periods. Results revealed three distinct forest land uses, namely: dense mature stand; dense intermediate stand; and sparse mangrove area. Land use change detection analysis was also conducted. Findings suggest that mangrove cover has generally improved from 1993 to 2004, as seen in the expansion of dense plantations over sparsely vegetated areas. Such change is attributable to continuous reforestation activities by the local community. Minor deforestation was also recorded due to various natural and anthropogenic causes. Comparing the area of deforestation with the increase in plantations, the results suggest that reforestation has compensated or exceeded the rate of cover loss. In order to further improve the geospatial results, the study recommends the use of high resolution images covering other years for better analysis of land use change.";"Gevana, Dixon

Northern China suffered severe aeolian desertification during the past 50 years. Hulunbir grassland, the best stockbreeding base in Northern China, was also affected by aeolian desertification. To evaluate the evolution and status of aeolian desertification, as well as its causes, satellite images (acquired in 1975, 1984, 2000, and 2006) and meteorological and socioeconomic data were interpreted and analyzed. The results show there was 2,345.7, 2,899.8, 4,053.9, and 3,859.6 km² of aeolian desertified land in 1975, 1984, 2000, and 2006, respectively. The spatial pattern dynamic had three stages: stability during 1975-1984, fast expansion during 1984-2000, and spatial transfer during 2000-2006. The dynamic degree of aeolian desertification is negatively related to its severity. Comprehensive analysis shows that the human factor is the primary cause of aeolian desertification in Hulunbir grassland. Although aeolian desertified land got partly rehabilitated, constant increase of extremely severe aeolian desertified land implied that current measures were not effective enough on aeolian desertification control. Alleviation of grassland pressure may be an effective method.";"Guo, Jian

However, only limited data are available on the actual magnitude of soil erosion. The study site investigated was an agricultural field located in Marchouch (6°42′ W, 33° 47′ N) at 68 km south east from Rabat. This work demonstrates the potential of the combined use of ¹³⁷Cs, ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ as radioisotopic soil tracers to estimate mid and long term erosion and deposition rates under Mediterranean agricultural areas. The net soil erosion rates obtained were comparable, 14.3 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and 12.1 ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for ¹³⁷Cs and ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ respectively, resulting in a similar sediment delivery ratio of about 92%. Soil redistribution patterns of the study field were established using a simple spatialisation approach. The resulting maps generated by the use of both radionuclides were similar, indicating that the soil erosion processes has not changed significantly over the last 100 years. Over the previous 10 year period, the additional results provided by the test of the prediction model RUSLE 2 provided results of the same order of magnitude. Based on the ¹³⁷Cs dataset established, the contribution of the tillage erosion impact has been evaluated with the Mass Balance Model 3 and compared to the result obtained with the Mass Balance Model 2. The findings highlighted that water erosion is the leading process in this Moroccan cultivated field, tillage erosion under the experimental condition being the main translocation process within the site without a significant and major impact on the net erosion.";"Benmansour, M.

In view of the ability of a multi-agent system to simulate a complex spatial system and from the perspective of combining macroscopic and microscopic decision-making behaviors of agents, a spatiotemporal dynamical urban growth simulation model based on the multi-agent systems has been developed. In this model, macroscopic land use planning behaviors implemented by macroagents and microscopic land use selection behaviors autonomously generated by microagents interact within two-dimensional spatial cells. Furthermore, the urbanization process is promoted through joint decision-making by macroagents and microagents. Considering the central region of the coastal industrial city Lianyungang as the study area, we developed three target scenarios on the basis of current trends, economic development priorities, and environmental protection priorities. Moreover, the corresponding urban growth scenarios were simulated and analyzed. The simulation results show that by combining the macroscopic and microscopic decision-making behaviors of agents to simulate spatiotemporal dynamical urban growth based on the multi-agent systems, the proposed model can provide a useful spatial exploratory tool for explaining the driving mechanism of urbanization and providing decision-making support for urban management.";"Zhang, Honghui

Two simple limitation methods (referred to in the paper as the conservative and weighted methods) were used to interpolate soil map unit data for qualitative evaluation of the land. Land suitability was assessed based on a set of criteria developed in accordance with specific plant requirements and two policy scenarios regarding the use of arable land for saline agriculture.

This study aims to overcome this deficiency and to provide a framework for a global assessment based on a consideration of the costs of action versus inaction regarding desertification, land degradation, and drought (DLDD). Most of the studies on the costs of land degradation (mainly limited to soil erosion) give cost estimates of less than 1 percent up to about 10 percent of the agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) for various countries worldwide. But the indirect costs of DLDD on the economy (national income), as well as their socioeconomic consequences (particularly poverty impacts), must be accounted for, too.

Ezért létkérdés a haszonelvű birtokpolitikának a közérdekű, értékkövető földpolitikával való felváltása.Amikor a közérdeknek elkötelezett agrárértelmiség a nemzeti önvédelem eszköztárával keres kitörési pontot az értékalapú, a közjót és a fenntarthatóságot szolgáló birtokpolitikához, még a szakmai párbeszéd igényénél is gátakba ütközik. Az alapfogalmak tisztázásra szorulnak, csak ezután épülhet fel – társadalmi közmegegyezéssel – a közérdekű birtokpolitika cél- és intézményrendszere. Jelen írásom ehhez próbál szerény adalékot adni, részben néhány fogalom megvilágításával, részben az általam kidolgozott, nemzeti földprogram felvázolásával. -------------------------------------------------- For 20 years, land ownership in Hungary has been dominated by neoliberal land policy, which serves the private interests of cross-national capital investment. By its very nature, this policy has suppressed the community functions of land, such as its ability to sustain and recreate societies and communities. In the new era of history – which might even bring about the collapsing of civilisations – ownership of soil and water, these two ancient natural elements, is essential to survival. This is why replacing profit-oriented land policy with a value-oriented land policy serving common interests is indispensable.When agricultural intellectuals desiring to use the means of national self-defence to seek a point of breakthrough that will bring about a value-based land policy in the service of sustainability and the public good, even professional dialogue is hampered. Basic terms need to be clarified before the goals and institutions of a land policy based on our common interests can be set up, based on a nation-wide agreement. This paper intends to offer a humble contribution to this process by clarifying some terms and by outlining a national land scheme I have developed.";"Tanka, Endre";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204762";"http://purl.umn.edu/99129";"";"";"";""

Following the theory of overlay index method and with the aid of GIS technique and a statistical method, this study employed a modified DRASTIC model to assess the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate in Jilin City of northeast China. In order to reduce the subjectivity of the overlay index method, the model was optimized by rebuilding the index system, adjusting the rating scale of each index, reassigning the index weights and comparing grading methods for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate. The criteria for these optimizations were the correlation coefficient of each index with the nitrate concentration in groundwater. Net recharge (R), soil type (S), impact of vadose zone (I), groundwater velocity (V) and land use type (L) were picked up to compose the index system. And then the accuracy of vulnerability mapping was discussed by a group of integrated indicators, including the corresponding relationship between the extreme nitrate concentration and the vulnerability classes, F statistic and class difference between the groundwater vulnerability classification and concentration classification of NO₃-N. The optimized model graded by geometrical interval method improved the correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration to the order of 0.6698 which was 0.4098 higher than that by the DRASTIC model. By level difference calculation, the correct vulnerability regions accounted for 64.45% of the study area. Lastly, sensitivity analyses indicated that the soil media and groundwater velocity were the most critical factors affecting groundwater vulnerability to nitrate. In short, RSIVL model was suitable to assess the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate in the study area with readily available hydrogeological and hydrochemical data. Hence, the mapping of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate can be applied for sensible groundwater resource management and land use planning.";"Huan, Huan

This study utilises data from the highlands of Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda to examine the impact of land markets on various types of land investment and management practices, crop yield, and land quality. The results highlight the relative long-term versus short-term return to different types of investment and practices, where those with longer-term benefits such as trees, manuring, and composting are preferred on more tenure-secure plots, while those with immediate or season-to-season benefits such as drainage structures or chemical fertilizers are preferred on rented plots. The impact on agricultural productivity is mixed and context specific. Regarding land quality outcomes, there is reason to believe that plots traded on short-term markets in Kenya and Uganda tend to be of inferior quality, supporting the hypothesis of movement of land from households to those with higher capital/land ratios.";"Benin, Samuel

"AGRIS:US2016222225";"URBAN GROWTH AND LAND USE CHANGES IN TIRANA, ALBANIA: WITH CASES DESCRIBING URBAN LAND CLAIMS";"";"Tirana, Albania's capital city, grew rapidly in size and population following 1991 governmental reforms. Before the 1990s, Tirana was a compact city of 225,000 inhabitants. Most properties were state owned. Privatization of land and buildings opened the city to rapid development, heavy traffic, and booming construction of shops, houses, and squatter settlements. Tirana's metropolitan population grew to more than 600,000; city size increased fivefold. This study focuses on land and building claims, both legal and informal, in the context of emerging markets and newly organized land titling and land records systems. A land market action plan supported by the Albanian government, European Union, Land Tenure Center, and others aims to increase tenure security, facilitate property transactions, and strengthen public institutions. So far weak governments and poorly developed institutions still prompt many to invest in property as the only practical means to secure wealth and gain access to improved living. Five urban case studies and one peripheral settlement case are described showing how individuals and families apply a mix of traditional and official means to claim and secure land and building space. Land registration and mapping issues are discussed. Lessons include the role of customary land access and use rules, the need to resolve unclear claims, and the importance of public sector development-particularly infrastructure and government land management. These cases illustrate the difficulty in building public capacity within a private property system. In general within Albania, the public's role is yet to be defined.";"Felstehausen, Herman";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"1999-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"ALB";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016222225";"http://purl.umn.edu/12806";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400149341";"Scenario analysis for regional decision-making on sustainable multifunctional land uses";"";"Land-use patterns are influenced by both top-down and bottom-up (local) factors, with their interactions varying in both space and time. This provides a major challenge to decision-making for sustainable multifunctional landscapes. A cross-scale scenario structure has been developed to integrate top-down and bottom-up context based upon the familiar IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios framework. Qualitative scenario storylines are converted into multiple quantified simulations of regional land-use change using a series of rules, with information translated across scales using a hierarchical land-use classification. Land-use parcels (fields) are used as key landscape reference units representing the local dimension of regional changes. Biophysical limitations on land use are represented through land capability classes (climate, soils and topography). Socio-economic factors are characterised in reference to global drivers, policy targets or local preferences. A flexible stochastic software tool (LandSFACTS) ensures spatiotemporal coherence of land-use allocation simulations consistent with scenario storylines. Scenario development is designed to be interactive, bridging ‘problem-focussed’ and ‘actor-focussed’ approaches. A case study is presented from NE Scotland, where plans to enhance multifunctionality through new woodland are evaluated against drivers of globalisation and climate change. Competing priorities, such as food security, mean that in some scenarios, a policy objective for woodland expansion to occur on farmland cannot be met. Woodland expansion would then have to occur on uncultivated upland areas. Scenario analysis has highlighted specific sensitivity to change in ‘marginal’ agricultural areas, with the varying influence of different top-down or bottom-up factors leading to divergent potential outcomes.";"Brown, Iain

Using two, farm level surveys conducted in 1986 and 2010, some aspects of resilient farming systems were identified. Despite apparent hardship current farmers seemed more willing to take risks, with many more borrowing to invest in on farm developments than those in 1986. The main similarity between time periods was the greatest response to economic changes being the adoption of a low input policy.

Hence, mapping these gully features provides essential information needed on sediment production, identification of vulnerable areas for gully formation, land degradation, and environmental and socio-economical effects. This paper investigates the use of object-oriented image analysis (OOA) to extract gully erosion features from satellite imagery, using a combination of topographic, spectral, shape (geometric) and contextual information obtained from IKONOS and GEOEYE-1 data. A rule-set was developed and tested for a semi-arid to sub-humid region in Morocco. The percentage of gully system area indicated negligible overestimations between the reference area and the OOA area in two sub-watersheds (0.03% and 1.77%). We also observed that finer gully-related edges within the complex gully systems were better identified semi-automatically than was possible by manual digitization, suggesting higher detection accuracy. OOA-based gully mapping is quicker and more objective than traditional methods, and is thus better suited to provide essential information for land managers to support their decision making processes, and for the erosion research community.";"Shruthi, Rajesh B.V.

"AGRIS:US201400148356";"Classification of heathland vegetation in a hierarchical contextual framework";"";"Heathlands in Western Europe have shown dramatic declines over the last century and therefore have been given a high conservation priority in the Habitats Directive of the European Union (EU). Accurate surveying and monitoring of heathland habitats is essential for appropriate conservation management, but the large heterogeneity of vegetation types within habitats as well as the occurrence of similar vegetation across habitat types hinders a straightforward, automated mapping based on aerial images. In such a case, a context-dependent classification algorithm is expected to be superior to traditional classification techniques. This article presents a novel approach to map the conservation status of heathland vegetation by using a hierarchical classification scheme that describes the structural dependencies in the field between the basic vegetation and the land-cover types that habitats are composed of. These dependency relationships are included as contextual information in the classification process, using a tree-structured Markov random field (TS-MRF) technique with a tree that reflects the hierarchy of the classification scheme. Results of this approach for a heathland area in Belgium were compared with results from more conventional classification approaches. Validation of the results showed that the structure of the scheme contained important spatial relationships, which were further reinforced by using the contextual classification strategy, especially for the most detailed level of the classification scheme. Accuracy increased and the classification results were more suitable for visual interpretation.";"Thoonen, G.

From the point of view of the single farm this tax norm has an excellent effect. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the whole agricultural sector the advantage of this tax norm is rather questionable both with regard to agriculture in special as well as the national economy in general. The rising prices for land due to § 6b EStG can have a negative effect on highly efficient farming businesses which are willing to expand, but have to finance the expansion soleley with the business earnings. Still, further disadvantages may result from § 6b EStG.

The literature search was filtered by the tick’s species name and an unambiguous reference to the point of capture. Records from some curated collections were included. We focused on tick species of importance to human and animal health, in particular: Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, H. sulcata, Hyalomma marginatum, Hy. lusitanicum, Rhipicephalus annulatus, R. bursa, and the R. sanguineus group. A few records of other species (I. canisuga, I. hexagonus, Hy. impeltatum, Hy. anatolicum, Hy. excavatum, Hy. scupense) were also included. A total of 10,280 records was included in the data set. Almost 42 % of published references are not adequately referenced (and not included in the data set), host is reported for only 61 % of records and a reference to time of collection is missed for 84 % of published records. Ixodes ricinus accounted for 44.3 % of total records, with H. marginatum and D. marginatus accounting for 7.1 and 8.1 % of records, respectively. The lack of homogeneity of the references and potential pitfalls in the compilation were addressed to create a digital data set of the records of the ticks. We attached to every record a coherent set of quantitative descriptors for the site of reporting, namely gridded interpolated monthly climate and remotely sensed data on vegetation (NDVI). We also attached categorical descriptors of the habitat: a standard classification of land biomes and an ad hoc classification of the target territory from remotely sensed temperature and NDVI data. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed that a principal components reduction of the environmental (temperature and NDVI) variables described the distribution of the species in the target territory. However, categorical descriptors of the habitat were less effective.

In order to moderate the rising water table issues, a ground water component was introduced in the model, while still ensuring optimal resources allocation. Results of the model indicates a reduction in barley, gram, mustard, and rice production area while at the same time an increase in sugarcane, millets, wheat, and cotton cultivation areas under optimal conditions.

In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS), and used to evaluate the effects of different combinations of vegetative cover on soil erosion rates for Santo Domingo County in Central Chile. Implementing RUSLE in the GIS required a complete description of the countys soils, climate, topography and current land use/land cover. This information was compiled in rasters of 25 x 25 m cells. RUSLE parameter values were assigned to each cell and annual soil loss estimates were generated on a cell by cell basis. Soil losses were estimated for the current and for three alternate scenarios of vegetative cover. Under current conditions, 39.7% of the county is predicted to have low erosion rates (< 0.1 t ha-1 yr-1), 39.8% has intermediate rates (0.1-1.0 t ha-1 yr-1), and 10.4% has high erosion rates (> 1.1 t ha-1 yr-1). The remainder of the surface (10.2%) is not subject to erosion. Under the recommended alternate scenario, 89.3% of the county is predicted to have low erosion rates, and no areas are affected by high soil loss, reducing soil erosion to a level that will not affect long term productivity. This paper describes how RUSLE was implemented in the GIS, and the methodology and equations used to evaluate the effects of the land use/land cover changes.

La erosión hídrica es un problema creciente en la Zona Central de Chile, especialmente en el Secano Costero, donde reduce la productividad de los suelos agrícolas y forestales. En este trabajo se empleó la Ecuación Universal de Pérdida de Suelo Revisada (RUSLE) integrada a un Sistema de Información Geográfica (GIS) para evaluar el efecto de distintas combinaciones de cubierta vegetal en las tasas de erosión en la comuna de Santo Domingo, Chile. La implementación de RUSLE en el GIS requirió la caracterización de suelos, clima, relieve y uso actual del territorio. La información se compiló en grillas con celdas de 25 x 25 m y el valor de los parámetros de RUSLE se asignó en el GIS a cada celda. Se calculó la erosión en la condición actual y en tres escenarios posibles de cubierta vegetal. Bajo la condición actual, se estima que 39,7% de la superficie presenta niveles de erosión bajos (< 0,1 t ha-1 año-1), 39,8% niveles medios (0,1-1,0 t ha-1 año-1) y 10,4% niveles altos (> 1,0 t ha-1 año-1). El resto de la superficie (10,2%) son terrenos no erosionables. Se seleccionó uno de los tres escenarios para reducir la erosión y no amenazar el potencial productivo de los suelos. Bajo el escenario seleccionado, se estima que 89,3% de la superficie presenta nivel de erosión bajo, y no se registran áreas con niveles altos.

Its average population growth rate is 25% per decade, which recurrently alters the city's land-cover particularly the receding green-cover distressed the city's self-renewal capacity, in terms of groundwater recharge, pollution sequestration and microclimatic amelioration. This has been appraised by means of a GIS model. This model was developed using three sets of green-cover associated parameters, namely air quality amelioration, hydrological process regulation and microclimatic amelioration. The outcome confirms the difference in the city's environmental performance between the 1997 and 2001. At some parts of the city, due to the green-cover change, the extent of modification was 38%, in terms of mean percent change in all three sets of parameters mentioned earlier. Through coefficient of correlation (r) method, relationship between green-cover change and environmental performance change are checked.

"AGRIS:US201600038124";"Waterbird Use of Catfish Ponds and Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative Wetlands in Mississippi";"";"Aquaculture can provide important surrogate habitats for waterbirds. In response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the National Resource Conservation Service enacted the Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative through which incentivized landowners provided wetland habitats for migrating waterbirds. Diversity and abundance of waterbirds in six production and four idled aquaculture facilities in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley were estimated during the winters of 2011–2013. Wintering waterbirds exhibited similar densities on production (i.e., ∼22 birds/ha) and idled (i.e., ∼20 birds/ha) sites. A total of 42 species were found using both types of aquaculture wetlands combined, but there was considerable departure in bird guilds occupying the two wetland types. The primary users of production ponds were diving and dabbling ducks and American coots. However, idled ponds, with varying water depths (e.g., mudflats to 20 cm) and diverse emergent vegetation-water interspersion, attracted over 30 species of waterbirds and, on average, had more species of waterbirds from fall through early spring than catfish production ponds. Conservation through the Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative was likely responsible for this difference. Our results suggest production and idled Migratory Bird Habitat Initiative aquaculture impoundments produced suitable conditions for various waterbird species and highlight the importance of conservation programs on private lands that promote diversity in vegetation structure and water depths to enhance waterbird diversity.";"Feaga, James S.

"AGRIS:US201500209057";"influence of climate change on the soil organic carbon content in Italy from 1961 to 2008";"";"Soils are the biggest carbon store in the world (1500Gt, e.g. 1.5×10²¹g). The European Commission indicates the accounting of soil organic carbon (SOC) variations in space and time as the first step in the strategy for soil protection. It is indeed necessary in evaluating the risk of soil organic matter decline and soil biodiversity decline, and when evaluating the role played by soils in global CO₂ accounting. Previous maps of SOC variations in Italy did not consider the direct effect of climate. There is a marked inter-dependence between SOC and climate. SOC increases with the increase in precipitations and decreases with a rise in temperatures. It is also known that land use and management have a bigger impact on SOC than climate. The aim of this work is to understand to what extent the SOC variations occurring in Italy from 1961 to 2008 could be explained by climate change. The soil database of Italy was the source of information for SOC content: 17,817 observations (3082 before and 14,735 after 31 Dec 1990). SOC content was referred to the first 50cm of soil depth, one single data obtained by weighted horizon thickness. SOC content was expressed as percentage by weight (dagkg⁻¹) analyzed by the Walkley–Black procedure and converted to ISO standard. The CRA–CMA (Research Unit for Climatology and Meteorology Applied to Agriculture) database was the source of information for climatic data. We considered the mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean value of total annual precipitation (MAP) of the two periods 1961–1990 and 1991–2006, and we mapped them by regression kriging with elevation and latitude as predictors. The climate change between the two periods was characterized by a general MAT increase, which was greater at lower altitudes and higher latitudes. The precipitation generally decreased, with some local exceptions. Some linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between SOC content and climate/land use. Temperatures had most relevant impact on SOC with an inverse correlation. SOC content was directly correlated with precipitations on arable lands and inversely in forests and meadows. Two general multiple linear regression analyses considered all the pedogenesis factors and: either by time periods (1979–1990; 1991–2009), model 1; or by MAT and MAP, model 2. The two models both had low precision (multiple R-squared=0.26–0.27; RMSE=1.42; IoA=0.61), but very different accuracies. Model 1 correctly predicted the mean SOC values for the 3 land uses in the 2 periods, detecting a significative decrease in all three land uses. Model 2 was not accurate every time. SOC decreases estimated with model 2 were always significatively lower than the observed ones. Model 2 did not estimate a significative SOC decrease in forests. Climate change had a general low influence on SOC variations. The relatively higher climatic influence occurred in meadows and in agricultural areas with a moderate or high MAP decrease (<−100mm/y) and a moderate to high MAT increase (>0.62°C). Other changes, probably linked to land management, need to be investigated to explain SOC variations.";"Fantappiè, M.

Such incentives go a step beyond regulatory and fee simple approaches to conservation. The program is codified under Chapter 25B, Article II, of the Miami-Dade County Code as authorized by section 193.501, Florida Statutes. Under the EEL Covenant Program, landowners enter into a ten-year conservation agreement with the county, where owners agree to keep a portion of their land in its natural condition in exchange for a property tax reduction of 90%. The program creates protected areas where laws have not, sometimes in areas most vulnerable to development pressure. There are currently 85 properties in the program, encompassing 173 hectares of pine rockland, hardwood hammock, transitional ecotone, and wetland habitat. Pine rocklands are a globally imperiled ecosystem. Covenant sites can act as stepping stone reserves for some species, and several federally listed plant and animal species have been documented on multiple sites. These sites probably provide the most benefit to rare upland plant species, which often thrive in relatively small protected areas. Program successes have not come without challenges. By virtue of their location in an urban-agricultural matrix, several covenant properties experience fragmentation and edge effects, especially exotic plant species. Several covenant holders have participated in the program since its inception in 1979. The program fosters successful public/private partnerships whereby the government works directly with landowners, furthering public awareness and conservation.";"Giannini, Helena C.

This study clarifies the characteristics and regulation of reclaimed salinized farmlnd in a desert oasis. As a case study, we examined an alluvial fan oasis in the Manas River Valley using fixed position experiments, spacial substitutes, and a trend estimation model derived from principal component analysis. In this way, we analyzed the succession of plant and soil characteristics on farmland at the bottom of alluvial fan oasis. With increasing time following reclamation, perennial haloduric plants were replaced by annual plants. The area then entered a stable stage from 6 to 8 yr following reclamation. The total salt decreased gradually and then increased, while soil nutrients showed the opposite trend. The trend estimation model derived from principal components analysis revealed that the general soil quality improved over the first 10 yr before declining thereafter. By systematically analyzing the various indices of soil quantity, an early warning of changes in soil quality can be provided 10 to 15 yr in advance.";"Fan, H.

"AGRIS:US201301892831";"Uncertainty analysis as a tool for refining land dynamics modelling on changing landscapes: a case study in a Spanish Natural Park";"";"In this study we developed a methodology aimed at improving the assessment of inter-annual land cover dynamics from hard classified remotely sensed data in heterogeneous and resilient landscapes. The methodology is implemented for the Spanish Natural Park of Sierra de Ancares, where human interference during the last century has resulted in the destruction and fragmentation of the original land cover. We ran supervised classifications, with a maximum likelihood algorithm (Maxlike), on a temporal series of Landsat images (1991-2005), followed by an uncertainty assessment using fuzzy classifications and confusion indices (CIs). This allowed us to show how much (and where) of the resulting maps contained a substantial amount of error, distinguishing data that might be useful to measure land change from data that are not particularly useful when applying a post-classification comparison methodology. In this way, we can detect true changes not skewed by the effects of uncertainty. Even if patterns of change were always coherent amongst years, they were more realistic after reducing uncertainty, in spite of a substantial decrease in the number of available pixels (i.e. unmasked by the method). We then computed land cover dynamics by means of a model specifically designed to determine the frequency of disturbances (mainly fire events) and the vegetation recovery time during the study period. Model outputs showed correlated landscape patterns at a broad scale and provided useful results to explore land cover change from pattern to process.";"Álvarez-Martínez, Jose Manuel

The aim of this study was to explore whether there was a size-dependent pattern (in terms of resulting burned area) of fire ignitions in Portugal. For that purpose we characterised 71,618 fire ignitions occurring in the country in the period 2001-2003, in terms of population density in the local parish, land cover type and distance to roads. We then assigned each ignition into subsets of five classes according to the resulting burned area: >5 ha, >50 ha, >100 ha, >250 ha, >500 ha. The probability of an ignition resulting in different burned area classes was modelled using binary logistic regression, and the relative importance, strength and signal (positive or negative) of the three explanatory variables compared across the models obtained for the different classes. Finally, we explored the implications of land cover and population density changes during the period 1990-2000 in Portugal for the likelihood of ignitions resulting in wildfires >500 ha. Population density was the more important variable explaining the resulting burned area, with the probability of an ignition resulting in a large burned area being inversely related to population density. In terms of land cover, ignitions resulting in large burned areas were more likely to occur in shrubland and forest areas. Finally, ignitions farther away from roads were more likely to result in large burns. The current land cover trends (decrease of agricultural land and increase in shrublands) and population trends (decline in population densities except near the coast) are increasing the probability that ignitions will result in large fires in vast regions of the country.";"Moreira, Francisco

"AGRIS:US201400008581";"Representation of ecosystem services by tiered conservation strategies";"";"In human‐dominated regions, protected areas are complemented by other conservation strategies (e.g., restrictive zoning, incentive payments) to maintain biodiversity and other ecosystem services. These strategies are often not mutually exclusive, with many areas covered by multiple (tiered) management strategies. However, it is not known whether tiering increases (or decreases) representation of ecosystem services. Here, we compare the representation of four ecosystem services by areas protected by both tiered and single conservation strategies (protected areas, restrictive zoning, and incentive payments to landowners) in a human‐dominated region (England). Tiering always coincided with the highest levels of stored carbon, sometimes coincided with high biodiversity and agricultural production, but never coincided with high recreational value. We also show that tiering is common in England and biased towards upland areas. Future evaluations of the effectiveness of conservation strategies should consider the degree of overlap of the different strategies fully to understand which are most effective.";"Eigenbrod, Felix

"AGRIS:US201500002987";"time series for monitoring vegetation activity and phenology at 10-daily time steps covering large parts of South America";"";"It is widely accepted that natural resources should only be sustainably exploited and utilized to effectively preserve our planet for future generations. To better manage the natural resources, and to better understand the closely linked Earth systems, the concept of Digital Earth has been strongly promoted since US Vice President Al Gore's speech in 1998. One core element of Digital Earth is the use and integration of remote sensing data. Only satellite imagery can cover the entire globe repeatedly at a sufficient high-spatial resolution to map changes in land cover and land use, but also to detect more subtle changes related for instance to climate change. To uncover global change effects on vegetation activity and phenology, it is important to establish high quality time series characterizing the past situation against which the current state can be compared. With the present study we describe a time series of vegetation activity at 10-daily time steps between 1998 and 2008 covering large parts of South America at 1km spatial resolution. Particular emphasis was put on noise removal. Only carefully filtered time series of vegetation indices can be used as a benchmark and for studying vegetation dynamics at a continental scale. Without temporal smoothing, subtle spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation composition, density and phenology would be hidden by atmospheric noise and undetected clouds. Such noise is immanent in data that have undergone solely a maximum value compositing. Within the present study, the Whittaker smoother (WS) was applied to a SPOT VGT time series. The WS balances the fidelity to the observations with the roughness of the smoothed curve. The algorithm is extremely fast, gives continuous control over smoothness with only one parameter, and interpolates automatically. The filtering efficiently removed the negatively biased noise present in the original data, while preserving the overall shape of the curves showing vegetation growth and development. Geostatistical variogram analysis revealed a significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to the raw data. Analysis of the data also revealed spatially consistent key phenological markers. Extracted seasonality parameters followed a clear meridional trend. Compared to the unfiltered data, the filtered time series increased the separability of various land cover classes. It is thus expected that the data set holds great potential for environmental and vegetation related studies within the frame of Digital Earth.";"Atzberger, Clement

"AGRIS:US201400103524";"method to map riparian exotic vegetation (Salix spp.) area to inform water resource management";"";"Hydrological processes within riparian environments worldwide are impacted when introduced species invade. Monitoring and management at substantial expense, are subsequently required to combat deleterious effects on the environment and stream hydrology. Willow species (Salicaceae: Salix spp.) introduced into Australia have spread throughout many riparian systems causing adverse environmental impacts, with high rates of water extraction when located within stream beds (in‐stream willows) thus altering hydrology. Strategies exist to manage willows; however, simpler, more cost‐effective methods are required to map and monitor spatial and temporal distributions. A method is presented to discriminate willow stands from surrounding native riparian vegetation using a single, very high 2 m resolution multispectral WorldView‐2 satellite image. A combination of spectral bands ‘coastal blue’ (400–450 nm), ‘red’ (630–690 nm), ‘red edge’ (705–745 nm) and ‘near infrared2’ (860–1040 nm), minimum noise fraction transformation, median filtering and maximum likelihood supervised classification provided the highest discriminatory power within a 25 km² study area. Of the spectral bands, coastal blue, red edge and near infrared2 are new bands that are not available in other multispectral sensors. These bands proved critical to the success of discriminating willows from other land cover categories (overall accuracy of 97%). Stream channels were defined by incorporating a LiDAR‐derived digital elevation model to discriminate between willows on stream banks and within stream beds. Canopy area estimates of in‐stream willows, coupled with water savings estimates from willow removal, suggest removal of 10.4 ha of Salix fragilis canopy from within river channels in the study area will potentially return 41 ML year⁻¹ to the environment. The method presented improves our understanding of willow impacts on hydrology and aids decisions regarding willow removal for water resource management.

"AGRIS:US201400182452";"Participatory GIS Approach for Assessing Land Suitability for Rainwater Harvesting in an Arid Rangeland Environment";"";"The dry rangelands of West Asia and North Africa are fragile and severely degraded due to low rainfall and mismanagement of natural resources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) interventions are used to increase soil moisture content, vegetation cover, and productivity. However, adoption of rainwater harvesting by communities is slow. To understand adoption constraints and to develop options for sustainable integration of rainwater harvesting, a benchmark watershed was established in the dry rangelands of Jordan. The objective is to develop a methodology for identifying the suitability for different rainwater harvesting interventions using participatory GIS approach and field survey. The main biophysical parameters used to assess the suitability for rainwater harvesting were slope, soil depth, soil texture, and stoniness. Criteria for each parameter were integrated and a suitability map was produced using raster-based and polygon-based analysis. To integrate biophysical and socio-economic aspects, the land tenure was superimposed with the suitability map. Options for implementing different rainwater harvesting interventions were identified with the participation of the local communities. Field investigations indicated that the applied approach helped to select the most promising fields. Within two years, four types of rainwater harvesting were implemented in the fields of 41 farmers, covering 62.9 hectares, which helped to increase water productivity (kg/m³) four folds and reducing soil erosion five folds compared to fields without rainwater harvesting. The approach showed that participatory GIS approach may be used to integrate socio-economic and biophysical criteria and facilitate the participation of farmers to introduce rainwater harvesting interventions in dry rangeland systems to mitigate land degradation.";"Ziadat, Feras

This concept has been applied more successfully to native systems (primarily forest) than to managed systems where N inputs are greater and N cycling processes have potentially been modified. We analysed 210 New Zealand soils (0-100mm depth) from different land-use systems (increasing in intensity of land use management from indigenous, to plantation forestry, pasture under drystock, pasture under dairy, and cropping) for δ¹⁵N and measures of N availability (total N, C/N, and N mineralization) to determine whether increasing intensity of land use management would lead to increased soil δ¹⁵N values. Mean soil δ¹⁵N differed between land uses with intensively managed cropping having the highest mean soil δ¹⁵N (6.2‰) followed by dairy (5.4‰), drystock (3.8‰), forestry (2.8‰) and indigenous forests (2.1‰). Over all land uses there was a negative correlation between δ¹⁵N and the soil C/N ratio (ρ =−0.73) and regression analysis indicated a relatively strong linear relationship between δ¹⁵N and C/N (r ² =0.56, P <0.001) when cropping sites (where significant loss of soil C had occurred), and sites with C/N ratio >18 were excluded. Typical N balances for each land use showed that total N loss (and in particular fractionating N losses from ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching) also increased with increasing land-use intensity. Our results indicate that soil δ¹⁵N may be a useful tool in assessing potential N losses in different soils.";"Stevenson, B.A.

Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis), a keystone species in the Great Basin, has seen a 50% reduction in its distribution. For many dryland species, reestablishment efforts have focused on direct seeding but achieved only minor success due to irregular seed germination and poor survival. We investigated the effects of container volume and fertilization on the performance of nursery-grown Wyoming big sagebrush seedlings following outplanting. Additionally, to evaluate the impact of site preparation, one-year-old seedlings were outplanted into tilled and untilled field conditions. Initial seedling size increased with container volume; larger seedlings exhibited significantly higher root collar diameter (RCD) growth than smaller seedlings. As container volume increased from 108 to 251 and 336 cmÂ³, seedling survival on the tilled plot increased from 28 to 44 and 43%, respectively, whereas no influence was observed on the untilled plot (57 to 61, and 60%, respectively). Fertilization reduced seedling survival on tilled (by 25%) and untilled (by 14%) plots. Fertilizer increased RCD growth on the untilled plot but final nutrient status was unaffected. Thus, container volume may influence seedling morphology and optimize establishment, while field fertilization, especially during spring outplanting when planting sites have low moisture availability, may hinder first-year survival.";"";"";"Natural Areas Association";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600185555";"http://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.036.0212";"";"";"";"194-201"

It shows how the expanding corporate plantation and contract farming system has undermined the position and livelihood of indigenous women in this already patriarchal community. The shifting of land tenure from the community to the state and the practice of the ‘family head’ system of smallholder plot registration has eroded women's rights to land, and women are becoming a class of plantation labour. At the same time, as in other cases of expansion of agrarian corporate commodity production, we can discern a familiar pattern of ambivalence between, on the one hand, the attractions of regular cash income and, on the other, the loss of resource tenure and autonomy, which helps to explain the community's gendered experience of coercion, exploitation, intimidation, consent and resistance.";"Julia

"AGRIS:US201400056691";"Changing Human Landscapes Under a Changing Climate: Considerations for Climate Assessments";"";"Climate change is a fundamental aspect of the Anthropocene. Climate assessments are frequently undertaken to evaluate climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. Assessments are complex endeavors with numerous challenges. Five aspects of a climate assessment that can be particularly challenging are highlighted: choice of assessment strategy, incorporation of spatial linkages and interactions, the constraints of climate observations, interpretation of a climate projection ensemble, uncertainty associated with weather/climate dependency models, and consideration of landscape–climate influences. In addition, a climate assessment strategy that incorporates both traditional “top-down” and “bottom-up” methods is proposed for assessments of adaptation options at the local/regional scale. Uncertainties associated with climate observations and projections and with weather/climate dependency (i.e., response) models are incorporated into the assessment through the “top-down” component, and stakeholder knowledge and experience are included through the “bottom-up” component. Considerable further research is required to improve assessment strategies and the usefulness and usability of assessment findings. In particular, new methods are needed which better incorporate spatial linkages and interactions, yet maintain the fine grain detail needed for decision making at the local and regional scales. Also, new methods are needed which go beyond sensitivity analyses of the relative contribution of land use and land cover changes on local/regional climate to more explicitly consider landscape–climate interactions in the context of uncertain future climates. Assessment teams must clearly communicate the choices made when designing an assessment and recognize the implications of these choices on the interpretation and application of the assessment findings.";"Perdinan

"AGRIS:US201600014045";"Oligarchs, megafarms and land reserves: understanding land grabbing in Russia";"";"This paper seeks to unravel the political economy of large-scale land acquisitions in post-Soviet Russia. Russia falls neither in the normal category of ‘investor’ countries, nor in the category of ‘target’ countries. Russia has large ‘land reserves’, since in the 1990s much fertile land was abandoned. We analyse how particular Russia is with regards to the common argument in favour of land acquisitions, namely that land is available, unused or even unpopulated. With rapid economic growth, capital of Russian oligarchs in search of new frontiers, and the 2002 land code allowing land sales, land began to attract investment. Land grabbing expands at a rapid pace and in some cases, it results in dispossession and little or no compensation. This paper describes different land acquisitions strategies and argues that the share-based land rights distribution during the 1990s did not provide security of land tenure to rural dwellers. Emerging rural social movements try to form countervailing powers but with limited success. Rich land owners easily escape the implementation of new laws on controlling underutilized land, while there is a danger that they enable eviction with legal measures of rural dwellers. In this sense Russia appears to be a ‘normal’ case in the land grab debate.";"Visser, Oane

"AGRIS:US201400056694";"Assessing Degradation of Abandoned Farmlands for Conservation of the Monte Desert Biome in Argentina";"";"Land abandonment is a major issue worldwide. In Argentina, the Monte Desert is the most arid rangeland, where the traditional conservation practices are based on successional management of areas excluded to disturbances or abandoned. Some areas subjected to this kind of management may be too degraded, and thus require active restoration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether passive succession-based management is a suitable approach by evaluating the status of land degradation in a protected area after 17–41� years of farming abandonment. Soil traits and plant growth forms were quantified and compared between sites according to time since abandonment and former land use (cultivation and grazing). Two variables were calculated using the CORINE-CEC method, i.e., potential (PSER) and actual (ASER) soil erosion risk. PSER indicates the erosion risk when no vegetation is present, while ASER includes the protective role of vegetation cover. Results showed that land use history had no significant effect on plant growth forms or soil traits (p� >� 0.05). After more than 25� years since abandonment of farming activities, soil conditions and vegetation cover had improved, thus having a lower ASER. Nevertheless, the present soil physical crusts may have delayed the full development of vegetation, enhancing erosion processes. Overall, this study indicates that succession-based management may not be the best practice in terms of conservation. Therefore, any effort for conservation in the Monte Desert should contemplate the current status of land degradation and potential vegetation recovery.";"Yannelli, Florencia A.

We tested the Century ecosystem model for two long-term experiments in north-eastern Italy: one (SF) comparing nutrient management treatments in small confined plots containing widely contrasting soil types (i.e., sandy, clay and peat) and the other (CR) involving a field study with crop rotation, nutrient, and management intensity variables. The organic matter changes in the SF experiment, showed a strong, linear relationship with C inputs from crop residues and added manures in the sand and clay soils, which was closely mimicked by the model. There was a net loss of soil C for all treatments in the peat soil, but the rate and overall magnitude of C losses were accurately simulated by the model, which suggested that treatment effects on soil C inputs was the major determinant of SOC dynamics in all three soils. In the CR experiment the model reasonably simulated the large initial decline (averaging about 30% of initial levels) in SOC observed in all treatments, as well as mean treatment effects over the course of the experiment. The model predicted a general pattern of higher SOC in the high management intensity, high fertility treatment combinations and lower SOC in the low management intensity, low fertility treatments; however, observed soil C did not show a clear pattern related to the treatments. Simulated soil C contents were linearly related to C input levels in the different treatments while there was no significant relationship between measured soil C and C inputs based on observed data.";"Lugato, E.

Building on these earlier studies, I empirically model slippage using data derived from satellite imagery that provides information on land cover changes between 1992 and 2001. The study area consists of 1,053 counties located in the Northern Plains, Corn Belt and Lake States regions. Results support the existence of slippage effects from the CRP, but they are more conservative than the ones found by Wu (2000).

The method for land use assessing, which enables to determine the type of its environmental and economic status (EES), was developed. The method includes the calculation of performance indicators, drafting the scale and the determination of the cumulative EES for land. The indicators of land use state are: the Index of territorial forest extent, the factor characterized by the rate of land involvement for productive purposes, proportion of arable land in farmland, factor of ecological stability of a territory, factor of anthropogenic stress of a territory, degree of a landscape stability, factor of anthropogenic intensity, factor of ecological intensity of territory. The assessment is carried out by using the software ""Land Use Evaluation"", developed by the authors. The scale and the cumulative score enable to determine the type of EES of land use. The results of assessment of EES of the land use in Sovyetsky district of the Rostov region showed that cumulative score varied from 51 to 58, the average score for Sovyetsky district was 55 points. All land use types related to sustainable land use type, differing in the degree of manifestation. The schedule for distribution of the cumulative score of the land use and of the district was drafted. There were proposed: 1) the adjustment for the land use tax in Sovyetsky district, depending on the EES, 2) the measures for the rational use of agricultural land, 3) the limitation of the cultivation area of sunflower up to 15% of the total area of arable land. Thus, the results of EES assessment are the basis of the algorithm for substantiation of management decisions ensuring the sustainability of land use.

Устойчивость с.-х. землепользования определяется экономическими и экологическими характеристиками земельных ресурсов. Для оценки землепользования была разработана методика, позволяющая определить тип его эколого-экономического состояния (ЭЭС). Методика включает расчет оценочных показателей, составление шкалы и определение совокупного балла ЭЭС земель. Показатели состояния землепользования включают индекс облесенности пашни, коэффициент интенсивности вовлечения земли в хозяйственный оборот, удельный вес пахотных земель в с.-х. угодьях, коэффициент экологической устойчивости территории, коэффициент антропогенной нагрузки территории, коэффициент антропогенной напряженности, степень устойчивости ландшафта, коэффициент экологической напряженности территории. Оценка проводится с помощью программного продукта «Оценка землепользования», разработанного авторами статьи. Результаты оценки ЭЭС землепользований Советского района Ростовской области показали, что совокупный балл по землепользованиям изменяется от 51 до 58, в среднем по Советскому району он составляет 55 баллов. Все землепользования относятся к устойчивому типу, различающемуся по степени проявления. Составлен график распределения совокупного балла по землепользованиям и по району. Для землепользований Советского района в зависимости от типа ЭЭС предложена корректировка ставки земельного налога, а также мероприятия по рациональному использованию земель с.-х. назначения и ограничение площади выращивания подсолнечника до 15% от общей площади пашни. Таким образом, результаты оценки ЭЭС составляют основу алгоритма обоснования управленческих решений, обеспечивающих устойчивость землепользования.";"Tkacheva, O. A.

Information used in the analysis were obtained through a survey of 300 households, group discussion, key informant interviews, and field observation conducted during April–September 1999. Confronted with ever-decreasing landholding size due to a steadily growing population and scarcity of nonfarming employment opportunities, farmers in both watersheds have increasingly adopted assorted types of structural and biological measures to control soil erosion, landslides, gully expansion, and soil nutrient loss to maintain or even enhance land productivity. Adoption of gully control measures, construction of the retention walls, alley cropping, use of vegetative measures for landslide control, mulching, and use of green manure and chemical fertilizers are found significantly high in the project area due to the provision of technical and financial support, whereas composting is found significantly high in the nonproject area. Different from the traditionally held beliefs, population pressure on a finite land resource has brought positive change in land management. However, the experience from both watersheds indicates that there is limit to the extent that resource poor farmers can respond to land degradation without any external assistance. Required is the arrangement for appropriate polices and support services and facilities enabling farmers to adopt locationally suitable and economically attractive land management technologies.";"PAUDEL, GIRIDHARI SHARMA

"AGRIS:US201600101253";"Conservation Practices for Climate Change Adaptation";"";"The threat of climate change is a great challenge to sustainable land management (USDA-NRCS, 2010a). Several publications have reported that over the last few decades, rainfall intensities have increased in many parts of the world, including in the United States. Without good, productive soils and the ecosystem services provided by them, the survival of our species will be in jeopardy. The future changes in climate that will drive erosion processes will significantly impact soil erosion rates, with higher projected erosion rates for the United States. These higher erosion rates will significantly contribute to lower soil productivity, lower soil organic matter content, lower soil quality, and higher rates of nutrient loss that will contribute to a reduction in the inherent soil fertility that is so important for maintaining viable economic systems and sustainability. These same hydrological changes will also include the occurrence of occasional droughts, and for some regions, such as the southwestern United States, projections suggest that there will be a decrease in precipitation and a drier region, which will have negative effects on plant productivity and increase the potential for wind erosion. Farmer management adaptations and use of conservation practices to adapt to a changing climate (e.g., no-till practices, crop rotations, precision conservation, crop selection and dates of planting, harvest, and tillage) have the potential to greatly reduce soil erosion rates. Conservation practices will be key and must be used as strategies for adaptation to climate change impacts on the soil resource. Examples of key strategies are the use of conservation tillage, management of crop rotations and crop residue (including use of cover crops where viable), management of livestock grazing intensities, improved management of irrigation systems, use of technologies, and precision conservation. Many other conservation practices also have the potential to reduce much or all of the potential acceleration of soil erosion rates that may occur under a change in climate that will bring more total rainfall with higher intensity rainfall events, or a change to a drier climate that will potentially bring higher wind erosion rates. One important adaptation practice will be to consider projected spatial changes in the hydrological cycle, such as wetter and drier regions, and periods of drought. This could help in the development and/or implementation of soil and water conservation policies that consider temporal and spatial effects from climate change at the regional level. These policies should also consider conservation practices that contribute to increased water-holding capacity in the soil profile, improved drainage practices, and the development of new crop varieties and cropping systems that are more resistant to drought.";"Delgado, Jorge A.

Our hypothesis suggests that this process might be an important process in depleting nitrogen in dryland soils, based on the idea that the intensity of microbial respiration following infrequent rainfall events and floods, is high enough to deplete soil O₂ concentrations and allow denitrification to occur. We tested our hypothesis by analyses of soil surface samples, collected along a rainfall gradient. This enabled us to evaluate the relationship between rainfall amount and denitrification potential. Soils were collected from beneath dominant shrubs and from the biological soil crusts (BSC) in the spaces between them. In incubated soils respiration decreased rapidly after 12 h while denitrification peaked at 24 h. Both respiration and denitrification were higher in soils beneath shrubs than in the BSC. However, BSC account for up to 88% of the land cover at the drier end and 60% in the wetter end of the gradient and may therefore contribute the majority of soil gaseous emissions. Denitrification:respiration increased, in soil samples collected, as rainfall gradient decreased, suggesting that denitrification is an increasingly important component of microbial respiration as aridity increases.";"Zaady, Eli

This increase is due to a variety of factors including increased availability of all-terrain vehicles, infrastructure development (oil, gas, renewable energy, and ex-urban), and recreational activities. In addition to the direct impacts of road development, the presence and use of roads may alter resilience of adjoining areas through indirect effects such as altered site hydrologic and eolian processes, invasive seed dispersal, and sediment transport. There are few standardized methods for assessing impacts of transportation-related land-use activities on soils and vegetation in arid and semi-arid rangelands. Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (IIRH) is an internationally accepted qualitative assessment that is applied widely to rangelands. We tested the sensitivity of IIRH to impacts of roads, trails, and pipelines on adjacent lands by surveying plots at three distances from these linear disturbances. We performed tests at 16 randomly selected sites in each of three ecosystems (Northern High Plains, Colorado Plateau, and Chihuahuan Desert) for a total of 208 evaluation plots. We also evaluated the repeatability of IIRH when applied to road-related disturbance gradients. Finally, we tested extent of correlations between IIRH plot attribute departure classes and trends in a suite of quantitative indicators. Results indicated that the IIRH technique is sensitive to direct and indirect impacts of transportation activities with greater departure from reference condition near disturbances than far from disturbances. Trends in degradation of ecological processes detected with qualitative assessments were highly correlated with quantitative data. Qualitative and quantitative assessments employed in this study can be used to assess impacts of transportation features at the plot scale. Through integration with remote sensing technologies, these methods could also potentially be used to assess cumulative impacts of transportation networks at the landscape scale.";"Duniway, Michael C.

"AGRIS:QC2015600071";"Application of INSPIRE directive to water management on large irrigation areas";"";"The goal of this paper is to illustrate how INSPIRE can facilitate orientation and advice to calculate the water requirements of crops. These technologies can provide information adapted to specific conditions, updated daily and in an interactive way. These tools permit the integration and management of georeferenced agroclimatic data, soil maps, quality of waters, crop information and technical parameters of a farm. The final objective is to develop a decision support system to facilitate decision-taking processes in a comfortable and generic access on-line, incorporating different techniques and access into GIS data. The information technologies and in a more precise way, the new technologies, applied in different agriculture environments, can introduce important improvements in optimization of the agricultural production factors. Directive 2007/2/EC1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) entered into force on the 15th May 2011. INSPIRE lays down general rules to establish an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe for the purposes of Community environmental policies, and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. One of the aspects that INSPIRE regulates is the interoperability and harmonization of spatial data sets and services for 34 so-called data themes that are laid down in the three Annexes to the INSPIRE directive. These include land-cover, land-use and weather data.";"M., Erena

The 4-year old Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) aims to restore 15,000,000ha of tropical forest in 40 years. The approaches and lessons learned appear transferable, and could help achieve the global restoration targets. Fundamental prerequisites for success include: effective technology undergoing continuous improvement, ongoing teaching, outreach and capacity-building efforts, presence of local intelligentsia, maintaining a clear and transparent legal environment, and presence of effective economic instruments and incentives for landowners. These prerequisites can be achieved by expanding and strengthening the network of stakeholders both in public and private forums that must be aware of macro-economic and social/cultural shifts and trends which may provide opportunities and impose constraints to further restoration activities. Finally, environmental regulations imposing habitat protection and restoration are usually beyond individual land-owners’ possibilities and level of interest. Therefore, forest restoration, even in a biodiversity hotspot, must be approached as a potentially sustainable economic activity. Otherwise, private landowners, and most other stakeholders, will not persevere.";"Melo, Felipe P.L.

"AGRIS:US201500217957";"Certification and equity: Applying an “equity framework” to compare certification schemes across product sectors and scales";"";"This paper applies a comprehensive equity framework to compare the priorities and trade-offs of different environmental and social certification schemes. The schemes selected for comparison are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes (PEFC), the Fairtrade Labelling Organization (FLO), and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA). The framework considers how the parameters of equity are set in certification scheme governance, including who are the primary decision-makers and intended beneficiaries, and how this is reflected in the content of scheme standards and certification outcomes. Each of these parameters is assessed across the dimensions of procedural, contextual and distributive equity. Results reveal significant variation in the prioritization of the environment, non-commercial stakeholders or equity across the supply chain. In forestry, the FSC has placed primary emphasis on the procedural rights of non-commercial interests in standard-setting processes, the contextual rights of indigenous peoples, and the conservation of natural ecosystems, while the PEFC places more emphasis on procedural equity for producers and the legitimacy of sovereign governments as rule-makers. Both FLO and CCBA prioritize distributive equity regarding the sharing of material benefits with small-scale and/or community producers or workers, while FLO also emphasizes the contextual issue of “empowerment” and capacity-building. In all schemes, contextual factors related to capacity and access have disproportionately advantaged Northern and large-scale corporate actors. Scheme priorities are reflected in scheme standards. Schemes where producers are the primary subjects of equity are less prescriptive about safeguarding non-producer interests. A focus on non-producers, in contrast, leads to more prescriptive requirements to protect the environment and/or other actors not involved in production. Finally, there is a significant gap between the ways that schemes frame equity and the outcomes. Contextual factors such as land and resource ownership, supply chain structures, export dependence and the organizational capacity of different stakeholders play a key role in shaping certification uptake and benefit distribution. Hence, the distribution of certificates largely mirrors existing patterns of global trade. While envirosocial certification has likely increased the overall influence of Northern NGOs relative to industrial producers, the balance of power between these two interest groups has been a constant point of contention. Meanwhile, without further deliberative strategies aimed at addressing contextual barriers to participation, certification is likely to exacerbate inequalities among other stakeholders and regions.";"McDermott, Constance L.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"indigenous peoples";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217957";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2012.06.008";"";"";"";"428-437"

The zangjeras are highly vulnerable to climatic risks but has successfully managed to adapt steadily overtime. I argue that their ability to adapt is a function of transaction cost which is associated with some ingenious principles of institutional design such as: (1) clear allocation and tradability of rights and obligations; (2) fairness in the allocation of risks, costs and benefits; (3) reliance on prices and incentives as adaptation mechanisms; (4) adaptive efficiency, i.e. maximization of welfare at least adaptation cost; (5) reliable enforcement mechanisms; and (6) a polycentric structure of governance.

The assessment of six countries with good contemporary potential for expanding sugarcane cultivation described in this paper was part of their analysis. Its principal objective was to identify land where such production will not have detrimental environmental and/or socio-economic impacts. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used to interrogate 1km² resolution protected area, land cover, climate, elevation and soil data sets. To avoid detrimental impacts on biodiversity, all categories of protected areas, closed canopy forests and wetlands were excluded. To safeguard food security, all areas under food and/or cash crop production were excluded. Areas unsuitable because of climate, terrain and soil constraints were also excluded. The assessment found that almost 6 million hectares of suitable land is available in these countries, clearly suggesting that ‘land’ is unlikely to be a limiting factor in harnessing sugarcane’s bioenergy potential in the region.

Grazing exclosure practice is recommended to control the desertification by vegetation restoration. How the restoration improves the C and N storage needs to be answered to the policy makers for their future land use planning and decisions. This storage in a plant–soil system down to 100cm inside grazing exclosure after practice terms of 7, 12, and 25 years was measured as compared to active sand dunes referred as exclosure practice term of 0. Organic C storage in the system increased by 341, 822, and 1786gm⁻², respectively, after 7, 12, and 25 years of grazing exclosure, whereas the corresponding N storage increased by 30, 65, and 139gm⁻². Soil is the major reservoir in the system to store C and N. Temporally along the exclosure terms of 0, 7, 12, and 25 years, the soil C storage comprised 97, 88, 77, and 84% of total plant–soil system C storage, respectively, whereas the corresponding soil total N storage comprised 99, 97, 94, and 94% of total plant–soil system N storage. Our results provide land use policy makers with rationale how to manage the grazing practice to restore the vegetation for C and N sequestration.";"Li, Yuqiang

What are the likely problems that could emerge during the transition given a potential conflict between family notions of ownership and individual notions of ownership?

In order to assess human impact on soils soil quality, soil organic C (SOC), soil bulk density (BD), soil moisture content (SMC), soil mass, and SOC sequestration were measured from two Histosol cores in West Iceland. The cores cover a period from around 665 BC to present, capturing the initial human settlement of Iceland in AD 871. Tephrochronology allowed for a reliable correlation and comparison between the two cores. The initial settlement had profound impacts on the soil quality, causing decreased SOC concentration and SMC, and increased vegetation degradation, soil exposure, eolian deposition, and BD. The total SOC pool was 34.6kgCm² at one of the sites, of which 60.1% was formed during historic times, driven by increased soil mass deposition from surrounding eroded areas.

"AGRIS:US201400065947";"Human activities directly alter watershed dissolved silica fluxes";"";"Controls on chemical weathering, such as bedrock geology, runoff, and temperature, are considered to be the primary drivers of Si transport from the continents to the oceans. However, recent work has highlighted terrestrial vegetation as an important control over Si cycling. Here we show that at the regional scale (Southern New England, USA), land use/land cover (LULC) is an important variable controlling the net transport of Si from the land to the sea, accounting for at least 40% of dissolved Si (DSi) fluxes. A multiple linear regression model using average DSi fluxes from 25 rivers (>2,300 observations) shows the percent forest cover, as well as development and agricultural land use, to be significant (p < 0.05) drivers of DSi flux. This was true regardless of watershed size and lithology. Furthermore, forest cover is significantly negatively correlated, while development is significantly positively correlated, with Si concentrations and fluxes. We hypothesize that these relationships are due to several mechanisms, specifically the ability of terrestrial vegetation to store large amounts of Si within its biomass, the altered watershed hydrology that accompanies LULC change, and the capability of urban regions to serve as sources of Si to aquatic systems. Thus, we conclude that anthropogenic activities may be directly perturbing the global Si cycle through land use change and we offer a conceptual model which highlights a new approach to understanding the non-geochemical controls on Si fluxes.";"Carey, J.

"AGRIS:US201400139405";"Ecology of Prestige in New York City: Examining the Relationships Among Population Density, Socio-economic Status, Group Identity, and Residential Canopy Cover";"";"Several social theories have been proposed to explain the uneven distribution of vegetation in urban residential areas: population density, social stratification, luxury effect, and ecology of prestige. We evaluate these theories using a combination of demographic and socio-economic predictors of vegetative cover on all residential lands in New York City. We use diverse data sources including the City’s property database, time-series demographic and socio-economic data from the US Census, and land cover data from the University of Vermont’s Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL). These data are analyzed using a multi-model inferential, spatial econometrics approach. We also examine the distribution of vegetation within distinct market categories using Claritas’ Potential Rating Index for Zipcode Markets (PRIZM™) database. These categories can be disaggregated, corresponding to the four social theories. We compare the econometric and categorical results for validation. Models associated with ecology of prestige theory are more effective for predicting the distribution of vegetation. This suggests that private, residential patterns of vegetation, reflecting the consumption of environmentally relevant goods and services, are associated with different lifestyles and lifestages. Further, our spatial and temporal analyses suggest that there are significant spatial and temporal dependencies that have theoretical and methodological implications for understanding urban ecological systems. These findings may have policy implications. Decision makers may need to consider how to most effectively reach different social groups in terms of messages and messengers in order to advance land management practices and achieve urban sustainability.";"Grove, J.

When multiple organizations separately develop spatial data representations of protected areas, implicit error arises due to variation between data sets. We used boundary data produced by three conservation organizations (International Union for the Conservation of Nature, World Resource Institute, and Uganda Wildlife Authority), for seven Ugandan parks, to study variation in the size represented and the location of boundaries. We found variation in the extent of overlapping total area encompassed by the three data sources, ranging from miniscule (0.4� %) differences to quite large ones (9.0� %). To underscore how protected area boundary discrepancies may have implications to protected area management, we used a landcover classification, defining crop, shrub, forest, savanna, and grassland. The total area in the different landcover classes varied most in smaller protected areas (those less than 329� km²), with forest and cropland area estimates varying up to 65� %. The discrepancies introduced by boundary errors could, in this hypothetical case, generate erroneous findings and could have a significant impact on conservation, such as local-scale management for encroachment and larger-scale assessments of deforestation.";"Dowhaniuk, Nicholas

Data came from 7 years of point counts at elevations from 1,915 to 3,145 m. We focused on eight passerine species that in this region are associated frequently with Pinus monophylla-Juniperus spp. (pinyon-juniper) woodland. Mean elevation of species' presence differed significantly among mountain ranges for all species except Spizella passerina (Chipping Sparrow); all species except Spizella breweri (Brewer's Sparrow) occurred at the highest mean elevation in the Toquima Range. Observed patterns were consistent with the elevational distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands that provide nesting and foraging habitat for these species. Across the Great Basin, driven in part by climate change, pinyon-juniper woodland is increasing in density and expanding its distribution at lower elevations. However, breeding habitat for species dependent on mature trees may not be available in expansion woodlands for several decades, and increased tree densities may have negative effects on bird species that are dependent on shrubs within open pinyon-juniper woodlands. Responses of individual species to elevation differed from the response of assemblage-level patterns. Responses to biotic and abiotic variables within guilds of birds are sufficiently diverse, and responses of individual species sufficiently heterogeneous, that one management strategy is unlikely to meet the needs of all species in the group.";"Fleishman, Erica

"AGRIS:US201400186709";"Modeling regional variation in net primary production of pinyon–juniper ecosystems";"";"Spatial dynamics of carbon fluxes in dryland montane ecosystems are complicated and may be influenced by topographic conditions and land tenure. Here we employ a modified version of the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) ecosystem model to estimate annual net primary production (NPP) at a fine spatial resolution (30m) in pinyon–juniper (P–J) woodlands of the Colorado Plateau. NPP estimated by CASA was generally comparable to validation data from a statistical NPP model and field observations. We then compared modeled NPP results with spatial layers of topography and managed grazing to assess the influences of these factors on NPP. At the regional scale, there was a positive correlation between elevation and NPP (r²=0.20, p<0.0001), mainly due to an orographic effect, but slope and slope facing-derived dryness indices failed to explain modeled variation in NPP. Topographic analyses based on six terrain aspect classes showed that cooler and wetter north-facing slopes yielded higher NPP than did south-facing slopes. A multiple regression consisting of three numerical topographical attributes (elevation, slope and a dryness index) yielded the highest predictability for CASA NPP (adjusted r²=0.24, p<0.0001). Modeled NPP of a grazed site was significantly higher than that of an ungrazed site. Combining the results from this study and previous research efforts suggests that grazing may be correlated with higher woody vegetation cover, which elevates NPP in P–J woodlands of the Colorado Plateau. The findings reveal that the spatial pattern of NPP is complex, and can be strongly affected by topographic and/or anthropogenic factors even in relatively remote areas of this dryland region.";"Huang, Cho-ying

"AGRIS:US2016205583";"The Economics of Soil Erosion: A Model of Farm Decision-Making";"";"Soil erosion is widely considered to be a serious threat to the long-term viability of agriculture in many parts of the world. The problem is particularly serious in certain developing countries. This paper examines key factors affecting smallholder farmers, decisions about soil depletion and conservation. The analysis focuses exclusively on the on-site productivity losses due to soil erosion in an attempt to understand farmer behaviour, thus ignoring any externality effects or off-site costs. The physical processes of soil erosion are described and its economic effects are reviewed, drawing on theoretical and empirical studies to date. Contrary to arguments that farmers are not aware of the extent and effects of erosion, an economic rationale for them to deplete their soil may be found in relatively simple conceptual models. While much of the research focuses on the North American context, this paper emphasises the relevance of economic models for analysing the situation in developing countries. A simulation model is presented and used to describe the economic consequences of soil erosion for smallholder agriculture in Malawi. Simulation analysis indicates that few conservation measures will be attractive to smallholder farmers due primarily to the low productivity of this sector. The results highlight how incentives to invest in alternative cropping systems are influenced by a number of factors, including the initial and ongoing costs, the sensitivity of yields to erosion and the farmer's discount rate. The study also compares alternative measures of the benefit of different cropping systems to the farmer and explores the implications of the results for agricultural pricing policy.";"Eaton, Derek J.F.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"1996-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"MWI";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016205583";"http://purl.umn.edu/24134";"";"";"";""

A necessary step is to translate public views and expectations into forest management techniques. This study uses document analysis and in-depth interviews to understand the values and expectations of New Zealandâs indigenous people (MÄori) who have exotic species forests planted on their ancestral land. The two case studies involve long-term forest lease arrangements where MÄori families are the collective owners of the land but the forest is managed by third parties. The results suggest that the landownersâ overall view of forestry is more critically influenced by political frameworks than by forest management techniques. The structures of governance and tenure and the legislation affecting the land are viewed as complicated and constraining. However, after decades of experience, MÄori have successfully incorporated plantation forests into their sense of people and place. Despite difficulties and disappointments, the land use of forestry and forest regimes are, overall, viewed favourably by the landowners, consistent with environmental considerations and their culture and values.";"Rotarangi, Stephanie";"";"NRC Research Press";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land use;landowners;indigenous peoples";"Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NZL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600199789";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x2012-113";"";"";"";"1678-1686"

Accordingly, the new management strategies need to take into account the suitability of the resulting landscapes to produce the goods and services expected by society. • AIMS : The aim of the study was to assess the preferred landscape patterns by different groups of users. In focus were the relations between the landscape metrics of preferred patterns and the individual characteristics of respondents. • METHODS : A regional quantitative survey of both production and different consumption landscape users was conducted in the Alentejo region, southern Portugal. Respondents composed their preferred patterns on a block diagram representing an area of landscape seen from a single view according to the existing topographic conditions in the study area. • RESULTS : In general, the visually complex landscape patterns were preferred more than the homogeneous ones. However, the metrics of preferred patterns varied between the user groups. The montado was the only land cover class that was present in the majority of preferred patterns. • CONCLUSION : For landscape users in southern Portugal, the visually complex landscapes including the montado are essential to satisfy their expectations. This may be an important fact to be taken into account for policy and landscape management in the future.";"Surová, Diana

Such contracts are arranged by the state, which sometimes uses coercive mechanisms and interventionist strategies to encourage agricultural investment. The Rwandan government has adapted neo-liberal tools, such as ‘performance management contracts’, which make local public administrators accountable for agricultural development targets (often explicitly linked to corporate interests). Activities of international development agencies are becoming intertwined with those of the state and foreign capital, so that a variety of actors and objectives are starting to collaboratively change the relations between land and labour. The global ‘land grab’ is only one aspect of broader patterns of reconfiguration of control over land, labour and markets in the Global South. This paper demonstrates the ways in which the state is orienting public resources towards private interests in Rwanda, through processes that have elsewhere been termed ‘control grabbing’ [Borras et al. 2012, 402–416].";"Huggins, Christopher David";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"contract farming;development agencies;land grabbing;land acquisitions;land grabs;farm tenancy";"Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"";"RWA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014089";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2014.910765";"";"";"";"365-384"

It does so by analysing the case of the Comunidad Zona Lacandona (Lacandon Community; Chiapas, Mexico) and the land tenure disputes in which it has been involved during the period 1972–2012. The paper argues that the Lacandon Community (LC) has a micro-corporatist relationship with the state and that its creation has brought its beneficiaries (comuneros) into an ongoing dynamic of conflict and cooperation with the state, fellow landed communities, social and non-governmental organisations and guerrillas. By analysing its relationship with the state and the 40-year long conflict, the paper presents the way in which the LC has defended its land rights within institutional channels as well as by means of contentious action. The essay also shows how conflict has been dealt with within a political process and contributes to the theoretical understanding of the categories of micro-corporatism and political process as they are employed in those cases where indigenous peoples enter into conflict over land.

"AGRIS:US201500183957";"Assessing the long-term impact of climatic variability and human activities on the water resources of a meso-scale Mediterranean catchment";"";"This article addresses the critical need for a better quantitative understanding of how water resources from the Hérault River catchment in France have been influenced by climate variability and the increasing pressure of human activity over the last 50 years. A method is proposed for assessing the relative impacts of climate and growing water demand on the decrease in discharge observed at various gauging stations in the periods 1961–1980 and 1981–2010. An annual water balance at the basin scale was calculated first, taking into account precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, water withdrawals and water discharge. Next, the evolution of the seasonal variability in hydroclimatic conditions and water withdrawals was studied. The catchment was then divided into zones according to the main geographical characteristics to investigate the heterogeneity of the climatic and human dynamics. This delimitation took into account the distribution of climate, topography, lithology, land cover and water uses, as well as the availability of discharge series. At the area scale, annual water balances were calculated to understand the internal changes that occurred in the catchment between both past periods. The decrease in runoff can be explained by the decrease in winter precipitation in the upstream areas and by the increase during summer in both water withdrawals and evapotranspiration in the downstream areas, mainly due to the increase in temperature. Thus, water stress increased in summer by 35%. This work is the first step of a larger research project to assess possible future changes in the capacity to satisfy water demand in the Hérault River catchment, using a model that combines hydrological processes and water demand.

The following cross-sectoral green initiatives, combining the emerging trends in the North East region of the United Kingdom, have been considered – increasing the vegetation cover; decarbonising road transport; decentralising energy production through biomass plants. Two future scenarios are assessed – Baseline_2020 (projected emissions from realisation of policy instruments); Aggressive_2020 (additional emissions from realisation of green initiatives). Resulting trends from the Aggressive_2020 scenario suggest an increase in emissions of pollutant precursors, including biogenic volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide over the base case by up to 20% and 5% respectively. This has implications for enhanced daytime ozone and secondary aerosols formation by up to 15% and over 5% respectively. Associated land cover changes show marginal decrease of ambient temperature but modest reductions in ammonia and ambient particulates.";"Tiwary, Abhishek

Of the 15 variables tested, only five were significant predictors of a landowner's interest in enrolling in the program: compensation amount, intention to obtain a forest management plan, opposition to the program's land covenant, prior awareness of the program, and total acres of forest land owned. The estimated median minimum compensation required was approximately $24 per acre per year. One-fourth of the survey respondents were undecided about whether they would participate in the stewardship program, suggesting there may be potential to capture additional interest and participation.

This study focused on quantifying and assessing the changes in multiple ecosystem services in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), China in 2000â2012. Based on the widely used biophysical models including Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-Offs (InVEST), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) models, this study assessed the historical flow of regulating services, including soil conservation, water yield, and carbon sequestration, and provisioning service food provision. The soil conservation function of ecosystem was slightly enhanced as a whole, and water yield increased sharply, with both the soil conservation and water yield showing an increasing spatial homogenization. The net primary productivity (NPP) and food production increased substantially from 2000 to 2012. Ecosystem services are closely and complexly interlinked. The correlation analyses indicated a trade-off between the water yield and carbon sequestration, however, a synergy between soil conservation and carbon sequestration. Congruence between the three different ecosystem provisioning services, including pasture, meat, and grain, was found. There was also a synergy between food production and ecosystem carbon sequestration in the TRHR. Climatic variability and vegetation restoration are important for the ecosystem services flow. Correlation analyses showed that the increase in precipitation significantly enhanced the water yield (P<0.01) and soil erosion (P<0.01), while the temperature increase influenced positively the NPP (P<0.1). The experience of ecological rehabilitation and the change in key ecosystem services in the TRHR exemplified the positive effects of environmental policies and the necessity of adopting an adaptive management approach. Thus the ecological construction and policy making should take climate variability into account, and facilitate synergies on multiple ecosystem services in order to maximize human well-being and preserve its natural ecosystems.";"Jiang, Chong

"AGRIS:LV2011000429";"Research on the preconditions of land consolidation in rural districts";"";"The concept of land consolidation is new in Latvia. Its main tasks are to eliminate land fragmentation and to facilitate farms of optimal size. One of the most important preconditions of land consolidation is forming of optimal size farmland plots in property and use, and land fragmentation, which has a major impact on both the operating conditions and other rural development processes. Land fragmentation affects not only land management, but it also increases transport costs. Already during the land reform in rural areas, land plots in property and land in use were divided per several land units. The other factor contributing to the fragmentation of farmlands is the development of land market, since it is not always possible to find land next to the owner’s farmland for purchasing or leasing the land to increase the land area. Within the course of the research, the analysis of the areas and fragmentation of economically active farms was conducted as well as the land owners were surveyed on variety of land use related and various rural environment characterising issues in Vircava parish. It was found that the growth of farm areas increases the fragmentation, and the results of the landowners survey show that the majority of the landowners are willing to expand their land plots in property, thereby increasing production rather than selling the land or leasing it to other farmers. Consequently, preconditions for land consolidation are being formed in Latvia as well as in other countries. It is important to find the most appropriate and efficient methods for their implementation.";"Platonova, D., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia)

However, testing the applicability of models developed with data from one region to another region has rarely been done. Bird faunas were sampled along 3.0-km routes in southern Costa Rica (Coto Brus) to develop statistical models to describe the abundance and richness of groups as a function of land-cover characteristics. The relative value of the land-cover models was assessed by comparing them with null models. The generalizability of the models was tested with data from north-western Costa Rica (Monteverde) to determine whether the models were applicable to another area that has undergone significant land-cover change in the last 60 years. The richness and abundance of understory, open-country and edge non-insectivore groups showed clear relationships with land-cover variables, and the land-cover models had lower prediction errors than the null models for Coto Brus. With one exception, useful models for canopy birds, edge insectivores and hummingbirds could not be developed. The land-cover models of abundance of canopy insectivores, understory insectivores and non-insectivores, and edge non-insectivores were generalizable to Monteverde whereas the land-cover models of abundance of open-country birds and species richness for any of the groups were not better than null models for Monteverde. The results indicate that land-cover models that describe the abundance or richness of various bird groups provide useful predictions in the area where the data were collected and that models of abundance of some canopy, understory and edge birds may perform well in areas that are similar in elevation, life zones and land use to the area from which data were collected. Land-cover models of the abundance of other groups, and of the richness of the majority of groups, may be less generalizable to other areas, or it may be difficult to develop models at all.";"Lindell, C.A.

"AGRIS:US2016218566";"The Sustainability and Cost-Effectiveness of Water Storage Projects on Canterbury Rivers: The Opihi River Case";"";"There is an increasing demand for water resources in the Canterbury region. Theimpact of this demand has lead to unacceptable minimum river flows, which hasresulted in adverse affects to river ecology. In an effort to resolve this problem waterstorage projects have gained considerable attention. However, in order to consider allvalues of the impact of water storage projects, a systematic way of implementing anecosystem services approach is developed. This ecosystem services approachcoupled with various appropriate analytical methods are developed for the purposesof evaluating the cost-effectiveness of water storage projects and the sustainability ofriver systems impacted by water storage projects. For the purposes of evaluating thecost-effectiveness of water storage projects it is argued that cost utility analysisshould be applied through an ecosystem services index, which is constructed fromthe aggregation of normalized indicators that represent each ecosystem service andpreferential weights for each ecosystem service. The evaluation of sustainability isconsidered both according to its weak and strong definitions. Weak sustainability isevaluated by a non-declining ecosystem services index over time. Strongsustainability is evaluated by the elicitation of threshold levels or safe minimumstandards where an ecosystem service, as represented by an indicator, should notpass below. These analytical methods developed are subsequently applied to theOpihi River, which is a river system located in Canterbury that has beenhydrologically modified and impounded by the Opuha Dam scheme. The applicationof the analytical methods to the Opihi River provides a few preliminary results.Further data collection is required to fully determine the cost-effectiveness of theOpuha Dam and the sustainability of the Opihi River impacted by the dam scheme.";"Hearnshaw, Edward J.S.

"AGRIS:US201500013907";"impact of land management and abandonment on soil enzymatic activity, glomalin content and aggregate stability";"";"Selected environments ranging from cultivated soils under vines and olive groves to sequential abandonment with forest, meadow and scrub cover were investigated for their impact on relevant physical and chemical properties in the shallow soils of the Cap de Creus Peninsula (NE Spain). Both insufficient agricultural practices and periodical wildfire occurrence in abandoned areas were focused as components triggering degradation processes. Despite that, less fire affected soils under Erica scrubs or meadows were found to be more active in carbon preservation potential. Soil properties like moisture, bulk density, water holding capacity, pH, organic carbon (SOC), carbon dioxide emission (CO₂) and total nitrogen (TN) showed significant seasonal patterns within and between the investigated soil environments, but total phosphorus (TP) did not show a clear trending. Carbon loss (C–CO₂) was extremely variable along the seasons in soil under vines, ranging from 3% to 10% of SOC stocks on annual basis. Assessment of C–CO₂ losses allowed establishing soils and associated management or stage of abandonment more susceptible to organic compound depletion. Glomalin and organic carbon were found to be significantly more active in favoring structural stability in the 2.00–5.60mm aggregate class with respect to the 0.25–2.00mm aggregate class, indicating that stable organic compounds may enhance the formation of larger aggregates and a better organized soil crumb. Seasonally, β-glucosidase, protease and phosphatase activities were much lower in soils under vines in agreement with the lowest organic carbon content. Enzyme activity increased from soils under vines to soil under pasture and showed significant patterns within soil environments and between seasons. A three component factor structure showed component 1 to be positively and significantly related with variables favoring better soil conditions except the ratio C–CO₂/SOC and the bulk density. Soils under pasture and Erica scrub were scored as being more relevant to the first component–variable association especially in winter, spring and autumn, as opposed to the soils under vines (V) at each season. In the summer season the structural stability of 0.25–2.00mm aggregate class of all the soil environments but vines was loaded in the component 2 and resulted in opposition to CO₂ emission and soil moisture only at soils under pasture and Cistus scrub, suggesting that CO₂ emission increases at higher moisture content and both may cause disruption of smaller aggregates. Total phosphorus dynamics was found to depend by pH variation. The work showed the current trends of the soils under study underlying both susceptibility to degradation and potential for carbon storage and data should stimulate management plans for abandoned land aimed at recovering the landscape heterogeneity.";"Gispert, Maria

Evidence from micro panel data is alsoinline with this observation. In rice farming region of Java, average farm size has declined from 0.49 ha in 1995 to 0.36 ha in 2007. In the off-Java region, average farm size declined from 1.49 ha in 1995 to 1.35 ha in 2007. The increasing trend of small farm is due to several factors, namely: high population presure coupled with limited non-farm employment, persistent trend of land conversion to non-farm use, and traditional practice of landinheritance. Due to small farm size, rural farm household have to diversify their income to meet their family needs. In Java, 51.7% of household income in 2007 is accounted for nonfarm income. This observation implies that strategic policies to increase household income in rural areas are by increasing access to land resources coupled with promoting off-farm andnon-farm employment.";"Sudaryanto, Tahlim

"AGRIS:US201600027637";"Do Native Warm-season Grasslands Near Airports Increase Bird Strike Hazards?";"";"Bird aircraft collisions (bird strikes) are a recognized safety hazard and land uses that attract birds hazardous to aircraft should be avoided on and near airports. Many airfields contain large areas of anthropogenic grassland habitats, often dominated by cool season grasses. Land managed as native warm season grasses (NWSG) potentially could increase bird strike hazards on and near airports by attracting hazardous birds and harboring small mammals that are prey for hazardous raptors. We investigated bird and small mammal communities at three NWSG areas and three adjacent on airfield grassland areas in western Ohio, U.S.A. to determine whether NWSG increased bird strike hazards. Species specific differences in bird abundance and density were evident between the two landcover types, presumably the result of differences in plant community characteristics. Seven species of birds were found exclusively in NWSG or airfield grasslands. Birds of species categorized as ‘moderate’ to ‘extremely high’ in regard to hazard (severity) level to aircraft accounted for only 6% and 2% of all birds observed in airfield grasslands and NWSG areas, respectively. Small mammal capture success was approximately three times higher in NWSG areas, although raptor abundance did not differ between the two landcover types. Our findings suggest that NWSG might be considered a viable land use adjacent to airfields; however, similar research at additional locations, including larger NWSG areas, should be conducted.";"Schmidt, Jason A.

We conducted a study to quantify how housing development could affect estimates of forest carbon sequestration (FCS) in northern New England, where the percentage of WUI in relation to total land area is nearly double the national average. We found that housing development in the forested WUI could potentially reduce FCS by at least 4% for the region, ranging from 1.7 to 9.3% at the county level, compared with estimates without considering housing effects. This impact is expected to increase by 40% by 2030, based on predicted future increase in housing density within the study area. The majority of housing effect occurred in the intermix WUI where houses and forests intermingle. County-level differences between the approaches with and without considering housing effects decreased from coastal to inland areas because of a decrease in housing density. More than 99% of the difference on FCS estimation came from the low- and medium-density WUI. Although retaining the forest but allowing housing within it may be a good compromise for many reasons for local or regional planning, our results serve as a reminder that decisions related to such housing developments are not carbon neutral.";"Zheng, Daolan

Most of the forestland is privately owned and public access to private land is a time-honored tradition in the region. Residents fear this tradition of open access may be threatened by recent acceleration in land tenure change across the region. We surveyed those who own 1,000 ac or more in the four-state region and found that newer owners were not more likely to post their land. There was, however, a correlation between the owner's land-management priorities and recreational activities permitted on the parcel. Results indicated that timber/forest product companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts allowed more public access for traditional wildlife activities such as hunting and fishing, as well as trail-riding activities such as snowmobiling and all-terrain vehicle riding, than landowners managing for recreation or for nature conservation. Results also indicated that new landowners in the Northern Forest currently maintain the tradition of free public access to their lands.";"Daigle, John J.

In this paper, we develop an integrated economic – ecological spatial optimization model. The integrated model incorporates dynamic forest sector harvesting, oil and gas sector development, coarse filter or habitat based old-forest indicators, and a set of empirical forest bird models that predict bird abundance. Using our integrated model, economic tradeoff curves, or production possibility frontiers, are developed that illustrate the cost of achieving coarse filter targets by a set time (50 years) within a 100 year time horizon. We explore the production possibility frontier’s relationship to the natural range of variation of old growth habitat. Our analysis illustrates the use of ecological criteria like the natural range of variation in providing guidance for the choice of preferred location on the frontier.Keywords: Production possibility frontier, forest management, biodiversity, optimization, tradeoffs.";"Hauer, Grant

Interaction between global and local pressures makes it possible to use local actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To this end, managers and policy-makers are seeking to implement agricultural land management regimes that improve runoff water quality and thereby reduce risks to the Great Barrier Reef. Although components of the Great Barrier Reef Region have been researched for some time, a systemic approach capable of representing the Region's key functional relationships as a social–ecological system is lacking. Here we provide a conceptual framework of the Great Barrier Reef social–ecological system that identifies a range of complex socioeconomic tradeoffs that may be required to maintain resilient reefs under climate change. The conceptual framework is the first step toward development of a functional analytical tool that is capable of helping policy-makers choose between alternative management actions.";"Thomas, C. R.

This, in turn, makes land more susceptible to degradation. Mapping and monitoring land degradation are essential for designing and implementing post-conflict recovery plans and informed policy decisions. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of repetitive armed conflicts on land degradation along the coastal zone of North Lebanon using multi-temporal satellite data. The specific objectives were to (1) identify a list of indicators for use in conjunction with satellite remote sensing, (2) monitor land cover change throughout repetitive events of armed conflicts and (3) model the effect of repetitive armed conflicts on land degradation. The methodology of work comprised the use of multi-temporal Landsat images and literature review data in GEographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach. The work resulted in the development of (1) a list of indicators to be employed, (2) land cover change detection maps with the use of multi-temporal Landsat images and, consequently, a fire risk associated with changes in vegetation cover throughout repetitive armed conflict events, and (3) an integrated approach for modelling the effect of repetitive armed conflicts on land degradation with the use of a composite land degradation index (CLDI). The final synthetic map showed four classes of exposure to land degradation associated with repetitive armed conflicts. Data collected from field visits showed that the final classification results highly reflected (average of 90 %) the effect of repetitive armed conflicts on the different classes of exposure to land degradation.";"Mitri, George

Over the last 75 years, the Lake Issaqueena watershed has experienced a drastic shift in land use. This study was conducted to examine the changes in land cover and the implied changes in land use that have occurred and their environmental, water quality impacts. Aerial photography of the watershed (1951, 1956, 1968, 1977, 1989, 1999, 2005, 2006, and 2009) was analyzed and classified using the geographic information system (GIS) software. Seven land cover classes were defined: evergreen, deciduous, bare ground, pasture/grassland, cultivated, and residential/other development. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina (SC) Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they relate to land cover change. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4 % evergreen, +62.3 % deciduous, +9.8 % bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/grassland and cultivated land (−42.6 % pasture/grassland and −57.1 % cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5 % in residential/other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria levels remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decline in pH can be observed at both stations. Prior to 1938, the area consisted of single-crop cotton farms; after 1938, the farms were abandoned, leaving large bare areas with highly eroded soil. Starting in 1938, Clemson reforested almost 30 % of the watershed. Currently, three fourths of the watershed is forestland, with a limited coverage of small farms and residential developments. Monitoring water quality is essential in maintaining adequate freshwater supply. Water quality monitoring focuses mainly on the collection of field data, but current water quality conditions depend on the cumulative impacts of land cover change over time.";"Pilgrim, C. M.

"AGRIS:US201500155530";"Forest based biomass for energy in Uganda: Stakeholder dynamics in feedstock production";"";"Insufficient energy supply and low levels of development are closely linked. Both are major issues in Uganda where growing demand cannot be met by overstretched infrastructure and the majority still rely on traditional biomass use. Uganda's renewable energy policy focuses on decentralised sources including modern biomass. In this paper, stakeholder dynamics and potential socio-economic impacts of eight modern bioenergy feedstock production models in Uganda are considered, and key considerations for future planning provided. For these models the main distinctions were land ownership (communal or private) and feedstock type (by-product or plantation). Key social issues varied by value chain (corporate, government or farmer/NGO), and what production arrangement was in place (produced for own use or sale). Small, privately owned production models can be profitable but are unlikely to benefit landless poor and, if repeated without strategic planning, could result in resource depletion. Larger projects can have greater financial benefits, though may have longer term natural resource impacts felt by adjacent communities. Bioenergy initiatives which allow the rural poor to participate through having a collaborative stake, rather than receiving information, and provide opportunities for the landless are most likely to result in socio-economic rural development to meet policy goals. The structured approach to understanding stakeholder dynamics used was found to be robust and sufficiently adaptable to provide meaningful analysis. In conclusion; local, context-specific planning and assessment for bioenergy projects, where all stakeholders have the opportunity to be collaborators in the process throughout its full lifecycle, is required to achieve rural development objectives.";"Hazelton, Jennifer A.

The importance of land use and management systems to livelihood stability and economic growth is especially relevant in Rwanda, where eighty per cent of the population depends on subsistence agriculture in a rural system plagued by conflict over holdings and decreasing production. In response to increases in population pressure, soil erosion, and the desire for state-backed tenure security, in 2009 the Government of Rwanda implemented a series of large-scale land and agricultural reforms intended to transform the rural system away from subsistence production to a commercially oriented sector of professional farmers. Beyond the mandatory registration and formalization of informal tenure regimes, agricultural reforms require all farmers to consolidate their holdings and intensify agricultural production by planting only those seeds approved and provided by the Government. While introduced as ‘pro-poor’ policies aimed at increasing production and reducing conflict over holdings, this paper argues that the simultaneous and aggressive implementation of registration and crop intensification has significantly reduced the land tenure and food security of subsistence households. Although decreasing production and increasing conflict over holdings validate the need to reorganize land use and management systems throughout Rwanda, the rapid and forceful implementation of tenure and agricultural policies is unnecessarily undermining the livelihood stability of rural subsistence farmers, as well as the sustainability of government-led reforms.";"Pritchard, Matthew F.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use planning;food security;farmers;land tenure";"Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"RWA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217309";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.03.012";"";"";"";"186-196"

Land privatisation in Mongolia";"";"Land privatisation has been initiated in many transition countries to provide land ownership rights to citizens in order to facilitate the socio-economic development of the country through enhanced access to land. However, the implementation of land privatisation laws is still problematic in many transition countries because of the uncertainty involved. Mongolia is an example. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding uncertainty as it exists in land privatisation and to determine the best way to respond to this uncertainty. An extensive literature survey and a pilot study in Mongolia have shown that “transparency” is the key to understanding uncertainty and that increased transparency might be the solution required for successful implementation of land privatisation in transitional economies. The pilot study demonstrates that the current land privatisation process is incomplete and slow due to a lack of access to information, weak coordination between the organisations involved and considerable duplication in procedures. This paper concludes that access to information, participation and corruption are key elements to describe transparency with respect to uncertainty in data and processes and those elements are critical to test the following research proposition: “More transparent land allocation procedures will result in more efficient and effective implementation of land privatisation law in uncertain circumstances”.";"Bagdai, Naranchimeg

It is acknowledged that these goods and services underpin human well-being. The provision of water resources is amongst those services that have raised more attention, given its unquestionable value and global threats like climatic change. Nevertheless, the biophysical basis that determines the land-use/water interactions has been often ignored. For the formulation of sound decisions, it is necessary to extend the empirical basis that determines these complex relations. With this aim, the present paper analyses the effect of alternative types of land cover in the provision of water resources. In doing so, we compare hydrological, meteorological and land-cover data obtained in 15 watersheds located in the Basque Country (Northern Spain).

"AGRIS:US201500217303";"Impacts of 2003 CAP reform on land rental prices and capitalization";"";"Based on a graphical analysis, we investigate the impacts of the Fischler Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on land rental prices and the capitalization of single farm payments (SFP) into land values. The model shows that the degree of capitalization mainly depends on the scarcity/surplus of SFP entitlements relative to eligible hectares, the implementation model (historical versus regional) and the land supply elasticity. If there are more SFP entitlements than eligible hectares, the degree of capitalization into land values may not decline and may even increase due to the inclusion of other supports such as animal premiums in the SFP. We test this hypothesis with an empirical analysis of cross-section data on land rental prices in Bavaria for 2005. Empirical results indicate that decoupled SFP are capitalized into rental prices to a larger degree than the coupled direct payments of the time prior to the reform.";"Kilian, Stefan

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of rurality is, however, not capable of dealing with local and community definitions of rurality, which vary from study to study. In everyday life, physical planners, rural policymakers and local rural actors need a consistent definition of rurality. The reason is that structural reforms have led to larger administrative units that have less experience-based knowledge about the individual rural communities within a municipality than do local authorities. In this article, we propose a consistent definition of rurality that is easy for physical planners, rural policy makers and local rural actors to understand and apply in everyday use. In addition, our definition will be able to deal with both the regional and the community approach to rurality. This definition is based on an interdisciplinary literature review that starts with land cover and geographical mapping. The definition is then applied to the case of Denmark.";"Johansen, Pia Heike

"AGRIS:US201301704587";"Conceptual Model for Describing Processes of Crop Improvement in Database Structures";"";"Rising research costs, broadening goals, intellectual property rights, and other concerns increase the need for robust management of crop improvement data. The data model of the International Crop Information System (ICIS) allows breeding processes to be recorded unambiguously in a relational database. This paper describes this model, which underlies the Genealogical Management System (GMS) of ICIS. The model recognizes three classes of methods by which genetic material is advanced. Generative methods such as crossing or mutagenesis increase variation. Derivative methods usually involve selection, and maintenance methods conserve the genetic makeup of germplasm, such as in seed multiplications. Unlike systems that only track pedigrees, the model describes steps of selection. Applications are illustrated for self-pollinating, outcrossing, and clonally propagated crops. The ICIS GMS is in use for species including rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), lesquerella [Lesquerella fendleri (Gray) S. Wats.], and witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.). The International Rice Information System, based on ICIS, holds more than 2.6 million unique identifiers for germplasm accessions, crosses, populations, and lines, requiring about 900 megabytes of storage space, which can easily be managed on a personal computer. The GMS model appears suited for widespread use in managing data on crop improvement.";"DeLacy, Ian H.

The study was conducted to identify appropriate site for the farming of giant prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, in Companigonj of Noakhali, Bangladesh using GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation taking 20 base layers of water quality, soil characteristics and infrastructure facilities. ASTER image and thematic layers were analyzed using ENVI and ArcView capabilities to develop a series of GIS models and prioritize the most suitable areas for prawn farming.

We performed seeding and transplanting of native tree species 40 years after the abandonment of an arable field that became dominated by a dwarf bamboo (Pleioblastus chino (Franch. et Sav.) Makino) and by kudzu (Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi). By permutation tests, the removal of competing vegetation (gap creation) significantly increased the survival of three seeded species of Fagaceae and of eight transplanted species. In contrast, intact vegetation prevented most individuals of all species from surviving for 1 year after planting. The lack of natural recruitment of Fagaceae in the nonseeded subplots indicated that seed limitation was a cause of the slow afforestation. Although litter accumulation in gaps at the time of seeding slightly increased survival for late-germinating Quercus myrsinifolia Blume and Castanopsis sieboldii (Makino) Hatus. ex T. Yamaz. et Mashiba, the effect was not consistent among plots and was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that for successful afforestation using native trees in abandoned fields, it will be necessary to remove competitive native species to avoid severe limitations on microsite availability and that simultaneous tree establishment by seeding or transplanting should be implemented to accelerate the establishment of native tree species.";"Tokuoka, Yoshinori

The paper sketches historic and current trends in public resource administration to define what constitutes useful new ideas which might aid the agency in its present crisis. In spite of being this nation's oldest approach to public resource management, the state trust lands are an appropriate source of new ideas in an era in which, the paper suggests: (1) the courts are receding as a major source of executive accountability, (2) the legitimacy of federal agencies, particularly those whose authority is rooted in science, is declining, and (3) the institutional framework for public resource management is rapidly fragmenting and diversifying. The Forest Service could fruitfully explore (1) the trust standard of prudence, particularly requirements for trustee accountability and record keeping; (2) the role of the beneficiary in trust accountability and constituency building; (3) the state trust manager's adaptation of the trust notion of a portfolio and risk management; and (4) state trust land agency's different approaches to tying program funding to income without eliminating the legislature's role in appropriations. The trust mandate as embodied in western trust land management organizations also provides (5) examples of institutional flexibility that could be instructive to the agency in this new era of partnerships, and (6) a raft of experience doing the same thing the Forest Service does (e.g., leasing grazing and minerals) which ought to inform Forest Service consideration of alternative management tools.";"Fairfax, Sally";"";"";"AGRIS";"1999-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012202505";"http://purl.umn.edu/10780";"";"";"";""

It was revealed that the optimized dairy cow diet should be as following: hay – 13.4%, silage – 15.8%, root crops – 6.5%, green forages – 33.6%, and formula feeds – 30.7%. The dairy cattle herd under study consisted of 1163 cows which needed, taking into account reserve stocks, 1616.6 t of hay, 4541.3 t of silage, 10141.4 t of green forages, 2122.7 t of formula feeds and 3569.5 t of fodder beets. Such amount of forages ensures 5.19 t of fodder units per one cow a year, and 6035.97 t - for the herd. The average annual nutritional requirement of young dairy cattle was calculated. The young cattle annual diet structure is as following: formula feeds – 25%, green forages – 37.5%, hay of perennial and annual grasses – 15%, and maize silage – 22.5%. The prime costs of the forages (dairy cows of 600 kg live weight, average annual milk yield of 6000 kg, and young cattle average daily weight gain of 900-920 g) made as following: 42271.0 thous. rubles under extensive technology, 43067.3 thous. rubles under semi-intensive technology, and 40307.3 thous. rubles under intensive technology. The application of intensive crop cultivation technology reduces the prime costs of forages by 4.6%. In general, the application of regionally adapted intensive technologies of forage crop cultivation ensures substantial increase of the efficiency of forage production for dairy cattle farming. It considerably decreasing the prime costs of forages and obtaining the maximum notional net income of forage crops per one hectare – 6608.6 rubles, and the greatest output of fodder units per one hectare – 4367.0 fodder units at their minimum prime cost of 3631.6 rubles per ton.

В 2010-2013 гг. в Ростовской области изучали возможность интенсификация кормопроизводства на основе применения адаптированных к зональным почвенно-климатическим условиям, высокоэффективных технологий возделывания кормовых культур для обеспечения крупного рогатого скота (КРС) молочного направления кормами собственного полевого производства. Установлено, что в оптимизированный рацион кормления молочных коров должны входить сено – 13,4%, силос – 15,8%, корнеплоды – 6,5%, зелёные корма – 33,6%, комбикорма – 30,7%. Поголовье молочных коров в опытном хозяйстве насчитывало 1163 гол., которым было необходимо, с учётом страховых запасов, 1616,6 т сена, 4541,3 т силоса, 10141,4 т зелёной массы, 2122,7 т концентрированных кормов, 3569,5 т кормовой свеклы. Такое количество кормов обеспечит 51,9 ц к.ед. на 1 гол/год, а на все поголовье - 60359,7 ц к.ед. Определена усреднённая годовая потребность молодняка КРС в кормах и питательных веществах. В годовой структуре рационов для молодняка КРС доля концентрированных кормов составляет 25%, зелёных – 37,5%, сена многолетних и однолетних трав – 15%, силоса кукурузного – 22,5%. Для обеспечения молочных коров живой массой 600 кг со среднегодовой продуктивностью 6000 кг молока и среднесуточным приростом молодняка КРС 900-920 г при применении экстенсивной технологии себестоимость кормов составила 42271,0 тыс. руб., при полуинтенсивной – 43067,3, а при интенсивной – 40307,3 тыс. руб.

In the soil cover structure (SCS) the share of chernozem soils is from 65.8% to 68.0%, with prevalence of ordinary chernozems (40.1-48.0%) over lixivious chernozems (17.5-25.7%). Chernozem and meadow and meadow and chernozem soils takes from 13.4% to 18.3%, and the soil of the salted row - from 2.8% to 8.1%. The increasing percentage of ordinary chernozems, alluvial and saline soils in the SCS under agrogenic transformation increases the area of deflated soils. In the areas where leached chernozems predominate within the SCS, erosion processes intensify and the percentage of deflated soils decreases insignificantly. The increase of the relative content of gray forest soils in the SCS reduces the proportion of eroded soils, and a large proportion of alluvial, saline and semiterrestrial soils enhance the contrast range of the soil cover and the percentage of eroded and deflated soils in the structure of arable lands. The change in the properties of chernozems within arable lands is indicative of a significant change in the nature of the main sod pedogenesis. The decrease in humus content, humus horizon thickness and accumulative nature of most of the physical and chemical properties do not allow to assign most of those soils to chernozem type and requires a specific taxonomic unit in the classification system for agrogenically transformed chernozems. In the soils of natural landscapes of the forest-outlier steppe (dark-gray forest soils and meadow chernozems) the transformation of the pedogenesis is determined by the geochemical landscapes as following: in the trans-accumulative elementary landscapes the processes of stratification of pedogenic and erosion products are enhanced; in the trans-superaqual landscapes this process is not pronounced.

В 2013-2014 гг. были проведены полевые исследования, в ходе которых было заложено и проанализировано 56 полнопрофильных разрезов 5 почвенных районов подзоны умеренно засушливой и колочной степи Алтайского края. В структуре почвенного покрова (СПП) доля черноземных почв составляет от 65,8% до 68,0%, с преобладанием черноземов обыкновенных (40,1-48,0%) над черноземами выщелоченными (17,5-25,7%). Черноземно-луговые и лугово-черноземные почвы занимают от 13,4% до 18,3%, почвы засоленного ряда - от 2,8% до 8,1%. Увеличение доли чернозёмов обыкновенных, аллювиальных и засоленных почв в СПП при агрогенной трансформации способствует увеличению площади дефлированных почв. На участках, где в СПП преобладают чернозёмы выщелоченные, усиливаются эрозионные процессы и незначительно снижается доля дефлированных почв. Увеличение относительного содержания серых лесных почв в СПП снижает долю эродированных почв, а высокая доля аллювиальных, засоленных и полугидроморфных почв способствует повышению контрастности почвенного покрова и процентного отношения эродированных и дефлированных почв в структуре пахотных угодий. Изменение свойств чернозёмных почв, используемых в пашне, свидетельствует о существенном изменении характера основного (дернового) почвообразовательного процесса: снижение содержания гумуса, мощности гумусового горизонта и аккумулятивного характера большинства физико-химических свойств не позволяет отнести большинство из них к чернозёмному типу и требует определённой таксономической единицы в классификационной системе для агрогенно преобразованных чернозёмов. В почвах естественных ландшафтов колочной степи (темно-серые лесные, лугово-чернозёмные) трансформация почвообразовательных процессов определяется геохимическим ландшафтом – в трансаккумулятивных элементарных ландшафтах усиливаются процессы стратификации продуктов почвообразования и эрозионного материала, в транссупераквальных ландшафтах этот процесс не выражен.";"Pivovarova, E.G.

A factor analysis followed by a multiple linear regression showed 94% support for our occupancy ranking model.

Suitable areas for the species have higher incidence in northern regions, where undisturbed vegetation and temperature-related variables seem to make greater contributions. Additionally, these potentially suitable areas are strongly fragmented and only a few are under IUCN protection, increasing their vulnerability towards further degradation.";"Bernardes, Marta

In this paper we present a new Europe-wide, spatially-explicit typology and inventory of the diversity in composition, spatial structure and management intensity of European agricultural landscapes. Agricultural landscape types were characterized at a 1km2 resolution based on Europe-wide datasets that represent land cover, landscape structure and land management intensity. Two alternative approaches for typology development were used: an expert-based top-down approach, and a bottom-up approach based on automated clustering using Self Organizing Maps (SOMs). Comparison with available national and European landscape typologies showed that our typology deviates from existing biophysical and anthropocentric typologies relevant to agricultural landscapes as result of the inclusion of land management aspects. Concordance occurred between specific European typology classes, while the comparison with national landscape typologies showed a correspondence in agricultural landscape patterns. Our agricultural landscape typology can provide a basis for landscape assessment at a European-scale to help to identify agricultural landscape types prone to change and landscapes that may require policy response.";"van der Zanden, Emma H.

The study was conducted on a peninsula at the German North-Sea Coast. The cattle were stabled from November to April. During summer season, they were kept on pastures included in a nature protection program differentiating between three states of re-wetting. Faecal samples from randomly selected animals were analysed with routine diagnostic methods for the occurrence of Eimeria spp., nematode and trematode eggs and lungworm larvae. Samples were taken three times per year: before turning out, in the middle of the grazing season and at the end. After a diagnostic and plausibility check, a total of 692 samples could be used for statistical analysis. The overall prevalence was 29.5% for Eimeria spp. and 42.2% for nematodes. Eggs of the liver fluke and lungworm larvae were only detected at very low levels. Statistical analyses were performed with a generalized linear model including the fixed effects wetting status, farm, year, and if it was the first summer on pasture for the animal. Significant influences on nematodes were detected for the stage of re-wetting, while Eimeria spp. were significantly affected by the grazing period. These findings indicate that the important parasites liver fluke and lungworm have not hitherto been affected at all by re-wetting measures. Furthermore, the prevalence of nematodes and Eimeria spp. did not increase. In conclusion, no clinical signs for parasitic diseases and no significantly elevated infection levels were shown after the third year of re-wetting, but even longer observations are essential to evaluate long-term consequences.";"Kemper, N.

"AGRIS:US201600003818";"Revolutionary Land Use Change in the 21st Century: Is (Rangeland) Science Relevant?";"";"Rapidly increasing demand for food, fiber, and fuel together with new technologies and the mobility of global capital are driving revolutionary changes in land use throughout the world. Efforts to increase land productivity include conversion of millions of hectares of rangelands to crop production, including many marginal lands with low resistance and resilience to degradation. Sustaining the productivity of these lands requires careful land use planning and innovative management systems. Historically, this responsibility has been left to agronomists and others with expertise in crop production. In this article, we argue that the revolutionary land use changes necessary to support national and global food security potentially make rangeland science more relevant now than ever. Maintaining and increasing relevance will require a revolutionary change in range science from a discipline that focuses on a particular land use or land cover to one that addresses the challenge of managing all lands that, at one time, were considered to be marginal for crop production. We propose four strategies to increase the relevance of rangeland science to global land management: 1) expand our awareness and understanding of local to global economic, social, and technological trends in order to anticipate and identify drivers and patterns of conversion; 2) emphasize empirical studies and modeling that anticipate the biophysical (ecosystem services) and societal consequences of large-scale changes in land cover and use; 3) significantly increase communication and collaboration with the disciplines and sectors of society currently responsible for managing the new land uses; and 4) develop and adopt a dynamic and flexible resilience-based land classification system and data-supported conceptual models (e.g., state-and-transition models) that represent all lands, regardless of use and the consequences of land conversion to various uses instead of changes in state or condition that are focused on a single land use.";"Herrick, J.

"AGRIS:US201600003817";"How Can Science Be General, Yet Specific? The Conundrum of Rangeland Science in the 21st Century";"";"A critical challenge for range scientists is to provide input to management decisions for land units where little or no data exist. The disciplines of range science, basic ecology, and global ecology use different perspectives and approaches with different levels of detail to extrapolate information and understanding from well-studied locations to other land units. However, these traditional approaches are expected to be insufficient in the future as both human and climatic drivers change in magnitude and direction, spatial heterogeneity in land cover and its use increases, and rangelands become increasingly connected at local to global scales by flows of materials, people, and information. Here we argue that to overcome limitations of each individual discipline, and to address future rangeland problems effectively, scientists will need to integrate these disciplines successfully and in novel ways. The objectives of this article are 1) to describe the background, historical development, and limitations of current approaches employed by these disciplines; 2) to describe an integrated approach that takes advantage of the strengths and minimizes the weaknesses of these individual approaches; and 3) to discuss the challenges and implications of this integrated approach to the future of range science when climate and human drivers are nonstationary. This integration will be critical for applying range science to the management of specific land units; will contribute to and benefit from the development of general ecological principles; and will assist in addressing problems facing society at regional, continental, and global scales.";"Peters, Debra P.

"AGRIS:US201600202704";"Nature as capital: Advancing and incorporating ecosystem services in United States federal policies and programs";"";"The concept of nature as capital is gaining visibility in policies and practices in both the public and private sectors. This change is due to an improved ability to assess and value ecosystem services, as well as to a growing recognition of the potential of an ecosystem services approach to make tradeoffs in decision making more transparent, inform efficient use of resources, enhance resilience and sustainability, and avoid unintended negative consequences of policy actions. Globally, governments, financial institutions, and corporations have begun to incorporate natural capital accounting in their policies and practices. In the United States, universities, nongovernmental organizations, and federal agencies are actively collaborating to develop and apply ecosystem services concepts to further national environmental and economic objectives. Numerous federal agencies have begun incorporating these concepts into land use planning, water resources management, and preparations for, and responses to, climate change. Going forward, well-defined policy direction will be necessary to institutionalize ecosystem services approaches in federal agencies, as well as to guide intersector and interdisciplinary collaborative research and development efforts. In addition, a new generation of decision support tools are needed to further the practical application of ecosystem services principles in policymaking and commercial activities. Improved performance metrics are needed, as are mechanisms to monitor the status of ecosystem services and assess the environmental and economic impacts of policies and programs. A greater national and international financial commitment to advancing ecosystem services and natural capital accounting would likely have broad, long-term economic and environmental benefits.";"Schaefer, Mark

Satellite data is an essential tool for detecting and analyzing environmental changes. Many change detection techniques have been developed which have advantages or disadvantages. Change Vector Analysis (CVA) technique is one such a method. This method is based on radiometric changes between two dates of satellite imagery. Main advantage of this method is that it provides direction and magnitude image of change. The aim of this study was to describe change vector analysis technique and it applies to detect land cover change in Isfahan area during an 11-year period. The data used for this study were two images Landsat: TM 05 June 1987 and 03 June 1998. Correction radiometric was not carried out because of the similar sensor and acquisition time of the remote sensing data. After geometric correction, the study area was selected from Landsat images. Change vector technique was applied to analyze magnitude and direction of change. The change map showed Kappa and overall accuracy coefficient of 63.19% and 74.4%, respectively. The results showed that the changed land cover was 3340 ha during this period. Overall, the results show that 1325 hectares (especially agricultural lands) have been converted into urban areas, agricultural areas were increased up to1385 hectares, and 435 hectares of agricultural areas were converted to other land use over the period of study. This study showed that CVA is a robust approach for detecting and characterizing radiometric change in multi-spectral remote sensing data sets.";"A Soffianian";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-10-31";"";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012048282";"http://jstnar.iut.ac.ir//browse.php?a_code=A-10-314-3&slc_lang=en&sid=1";"";"";"";"153-164"

Such obligations require efficient compilation of accurate land-cover information in addition to detailed analysis of archival land-use changes over an extended time span. In this study, we applied a methodology for mapping land cover and monitoring change in patterns related to agricultural development and urban expansion in the desert of the Kom Ombo area. We utilized the available records of multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images to produce three land-use/land-cover maps for 1988, 1999 and 2008.Post-classification change detection analysis shows that agricultural development increased by 39.2% through the study period with an average annual rate of land development of 8.7 km² year⁻¹. We report a total increase in urbanization over the selected time span of approximately 28.0 km² with most of this urban growth concentrated to the east of the Nile and occurring through encroachment on the former old cultivated lands. The archival record of the length of irrigation canals showed that their estimated length was 341.5, 461.8 and 580.1 km in the years 1988, 1999 and 2008, respectively, with a 70% increase in canal length from 1988 to 2008. Our results not only accurately quantified the land-cover changes but also delineated their spatial patterns, showing the efficiency of Landsat data in evaluating landscape dynamics over a particular time span. Such information is critical in making effective policies for efficient and sustainable natural resource management.";"Faid, Abdalla M.

"AGRIS:US201301960796";"Modelling the effects of plastic mulch on water, heat and CO2 fluxes over cropland in an arid region";"";"Plastic mulches are often used to improve agricultural production by suppressing soil evaporation in the vast arid and semi-arid regions. As a special surface cover, plastic mulch evidently affects the surface albedo and prevents vapour exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, but these physical processes were not contained in the present land surface models. Therefore, simulations remarkably deviate from observations when land surface models are applied to areas with underlying plastic mulch covering. Investigating the effects of various plastic mulches assists in better understanding the atmosphere-land interaction. In this study, a detailed plastic mulch layer model, which considers the effect of plastic mulch on the radiation and heat transfer is constructed and incorporated into a land surface model Two-Big-Leaf-SHAW (TBLSHAW) to simulate the water (H2O), heat and CO2 (carbon dioxide) fluxes in an agro-ecosystem covered by plastic mulch. Data collected by Gulang Heterogeneous Underlying Surface Layer Experiment (GHUSLE) at a plastic mulch-covered cropland site in an arid region were employed to verify the model; simultaneously, the TBLSHAW model was run with the same atmospheric forcing as a comparison to investigate the effect of the plastic mulch. Results suggest that the model can appropriately simulate the water, heat and CO2 fluxes over an arid cropland. The model efficiency is high, and the mean bias error and root mean bias error between the simulated and the observed values are minor. Compared to TBLSHAW simulations, the plastic mulch with special optical properties obviously influenced the surface albedo and radiation balance. By limiting the underside soil evaporation, plastic mulch changes the energy and water transfer between the atmosphere and the land surface. The soil temperature and soil moisture are improved by the transparent plastic mulch, and the plastic mulch not only suppresses the CO2 generated by soil respiration but also affects CO2 budget as a result of the net assimilation controlled by the soil water and heat conditions.";"Yang, Qidong

Little land ownership together with high demographic growth lead to insufficient crop production. As a consequence, human pressure on S.

"AGRIS:US2016208981";"SOCIAL DILEMMAS AND PUBLIC RANGE MANAGEMENT: RESULTS FROM THE NEVADA RANCH SURVEY";"";"Since the late 1960s, the Nevada ranch community has come under increasing pressure from environmental groups regarding their use of public lands for livestock grazing, thus increasing tension between ranchers and public land managers and potentially reducing the social capital that facilitates action and cooperation in range management. In this paper, we use responses to a survey of all public grazing permit holders in Nevada to investigate thechanging relationships between ranchers and the public land agencies, and its potential implications. In particular, we investigate factors that affect ranchers' trust in the public land agencies, and then factors that influence the nature of the relationship between ranchers and the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service. Low levels of trust between ranchers and public managers were most significantly related to previous disagreements andthe belief in a poor future for ranching. The occurrence of wildfire on grazing land contributed most significantly to increased disagreement between ranchers and public agencies. Finally, as a response to conflict in the ranch community, community based initiatives, such as grass banking, are examined for their potential to bring stakeholders together to realize and address common goals. Community involvement in decision making may increase levels of social capital, reduce transaction costs, and thus allow for more effective and efficient use of the range resources";"van Kooten, G.

Valuation in these circumstances can best be described as fuzzy in terms of the amenity valued, perceptions of property rights, and the numbers chosen to reflect values. In this paper, we apply fuzzy logic to contingent valuation, employing a fuzzy clustering approach for incorporating preference uncertainty obtained from a follow-up certainty confidence question. We develop a Fuzzy Random Utility Maximization (FRUM) framework where the perceived utility of each individual is fuzzy in the sense that an individual’s utility belongs to each cluster to some degree. The model is then applied to a Swedish survey that elicited residents’ willingness to pay for enhanced forest conservation. The results from fuzzy models are generally ‘better’ than those obtained using the traditional random utility framework.";"Sun, Lili

Groundwater recharge (GWR) is critical to maintain the abundance of groundwater. In the present study, suitable areas for GWR in Jazan region have been identified by using a GIS-based decision support system (DSS). The DSS was implemented to obtain suitability maps and to evaluate the existing GWR in the study area. The DSS inputs comprised maps of rainfall surplus, slope, potential runoff coefficient, land cover/use and soil texture. The spatial extents of GWR suitability areas were identified by a hierarchical process analysis that considered five layers. The model generated a GWR map with four categories of suitability: excellent, good, moderate and poor and unsuitable. The spatial distribution of these categories showed that 50.5 and 31� % of the study area was classified as excellent and good for GWR, respectively, while 16 and 2.5� % of the area were classified as moderate and poor and unsuitable, respectively. Most of the areas with excellent to good suitability have slopes of between 4 and 8� % and are intensively cultivated areas. The major soil type in the excellent to good areas is loamy sand, followed by silt loam, and the rainfall in these areas ranges from 100 to 270� mm. The locations of existing GWR dams were compared with the locations indicated on the generated suitability map using the proximity analysis tool in ArcGIS 10.1. Most (75� %) of the existing GWR structures that were categorised as successful were within the excellent and good areas, followed by moderately suitable (25� %).";"Mahmoud, Shereif H.

Sustainability science (SS) is an attempt to bridge the natural and social sciences for seeking creative solutions to these complex challenges. In this article, we propose a research agenda that advances the methodological and theoretical understanding of what SS can be, how it can be pursued and what it can contribute. The key focus is on knowledge structuring. For that purpose, we designed a generic research platform organised as a three-dimensional matrix comprising three components: core themes (scientific understanding, sustainability goals, sustainability pathways); cross-cutting critical and problem-solving approaches; and any combination of the sustainability challenges above. As an example, we insert four sustainability challenges into the matrix (biodiversity loss, climate change, land use changes, water scarcity). Based on the matrix with the four challenges, we discuss three issues for advancing theory and methodology in SS: how new synergies across natural and social sciences can be created; how integrated theories for understanding and responding to complex sustainability issues can be developed; and how theories and concepts in economics, gender studies, geography, political science and sociology can be applied in SS. The generic research platform serves to structure and create new knowledge in SS and is a tool for exploring any set of sustainability challenges.

However, the extent to which land use influences land degradation has not been fully ascertained in the southwestern part of Nigeria (i.e. particularly in Ogun State). Thus, this study was designed to assess the extent to which land use influences crop productivity in Ogun State. Two major soil types identified at the site were Alfisols and Ultisols. Within these, three land use types (LUT) were identified: arable crop - Land Use 1, cash crop production - Land Use 2, and non-agricultural use – Land Use 3. Th ese were evaluated for three commonly cultivated crops in the area, namely: maize, cassava and oil palm, using the FAO framework for Land Sustainability Evaluation (LSE). Soil degradation levels were assessed under three LUTs using parametric approach. Descriptive statistics and rank ordered correlation were used for the data analysis. The results of the LSE showed that all the pedons were marginally suitable (S3) for maize, 60 % were of moderate (S 2) and 40 % of marginal (S 3) suitability for cassava respectively. However, for oil palm, 47 % of the lands were classified as being marginally suitable (S 3) while 53 % were not suitable (N). The major limitations identified were sub-optimal, poor soil (i.e. texture(s) and fertility), poor drainage/ wetness (w), steep topography (t), and sub-optimal climate (c) (i.e. annual rainfall, mean annual temperature and length of growing season). Parametric assessment revealed that chemical degradation was moderate within LUT 2, but ranged between slight to none in LUTs 1 and 3 respectively. Land uses 2 and 3 were slightly degraded physically, while 1 was moderate. Land use was found to be significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with land degradation (r = 0.47**) at all sites. The degradation level ranked from moderate to high due to inappropriate land uses. Thus, it is recommended that in all LUTs must be a careful choice of appropriate use of land in order to reduce degradation.";"Bolarinwa Ayoola Senjobi

Research result shows that downward trend of cultivated land quantity is inevitable in China in the future, showing a basic form of an exponential decline during a short period of time. However, situation will be improved with the implementing of a series of land-control policies and paying attention to the issue of rapid reduction of cultivated land.

"AGRIS:DJ2012032615";"Multiperspective analysis of erosion tolerance";"";"Erosion tolerance is the most multidisciplinary field of soil erosion research. Scientists have shown lack in ability to adequately analyze the huge list of variables that influence soil loss tolerance definitions. For these the perspectives of erosion made by farmers, environmentalists, society and politicians have to be considered simultaneously. Partial and biased definitions of erosion tolerance may explain not only the polemic nature of the currently suggested values but also, in part, the nonadoption of the desired levels of erosion control. To move towards a solution, considerable changes would have to occur on how this topic is investigated, especially among scientists, who would have to change methods and strategies and extend the perspective of research out of the boundaries of the physical processes and the frontiers of the academy. A more effective integration and communication with the society and farmers, to learn about their perspective of erosion and a multidisciplinary approach, integrating soil, social, economic and environmental sciences are essential for improved erosion tolerance definitions. In the opinion of the authors, soil erosion research is not moving in this direction and a better understanding of erosion tolerance is not to be expected in the near future.";"Sparovek Gerd

Auction theory has mostly focused on target-constrained auctions and is less welldeveloped for this type of auction. This paper examines a theoretical model specifically developed forbudget-constrained tenders and assesses its capacity to predict tendering performance under informationlimitations typical of those found in field applications. But this assessment cannot be done withoutcomplementing the model with controlled laboratory experiments. Subject to their external validity, we findthat the model is able to make the correct policy recommendation when comparing the tender to anequivalent fixed price scheme, even when the accuracy of its prediction is far from perfect. However, thestudy suggests that more than a single point estimate of bidders’ costs is needed for this to happen,indicating that it should be worthwhile for policy administrators to invest in some information acquisitionbefore deciding to run a tender.";"Schilizzi, Steven

Digital elevation models (DEM) of the agricultural and forested watersheds were generated from digitised topographic data. Based on the critical source area (CSA) and minimum source channel length (MSCL) specifications, the agricultural watershed was discretised into eight cells and three channel reaches, and the forest watershed into 12 cells and five channel reaches. The weighted curve numbers (CNs) were used for the cells with multiple land uses. The CN was observed to be the most sensitive parameter in the prediction of runoff and was adjusted during calibrations. The calibration runs of the AnnAGNPS resulted in errors between observed and simulated values of 0-33% for the agricultural watershed and 3.3-46.2% for the forested watershed for runoff prediction. The sediment yield prediction error percentage during the calibration run varied from 18.2% to 40.5% for the agricultural watershed and 9.1% to 50% for the forest watershed. However, validation of the calibrated model for different rainfall events resulted in errors of 6.7-36% and a value for the coefficient of prediction (C(P'A)) of 0.028 (agricultural watershed) and 3.4% to 36% with a value for the C(P'A) of 0.23 (forested watersheds) for runoff prediction. Validation of sediment loss for both the watersheds resulted in higher errors (23% to 55%) and C(P'A) value of 0.341 for both the watersheds. Also, the model prediction of average annual runoff and sediment loss revealed that the agricultural watershed sediment loss (73.3 t ha-1 year-1) was significantly higher than for the forest watershed (7.2 t ha-1 year-1). Further, the validated model was used to simulate the runoff and sediment losses under a recommended land management regime for the agricultural watershed, which resulted in an 18.5% reduction in runoff and a 63% reduction in sediment loss as compared to the current management practice. This study revealed that the AnnAGNPS can be successfully applied for assessment of runoff and sediment losses and subsequent land use planning to conserve the natural resources in the watersheds of St. Lucia.";"Sarangi, A.

As previous studies carried out in Central Europe and the US have shown, bee diversity and abundance is influenced by the structure and the composition of the surrounding landscape. Comparable studies have so far not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13 sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees’ abundance was impacted by landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales. The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove, while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land, rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and abundance in the Mediterranean.";"Tscheulin, T.

In a previous paper,we evaluated the incentives provided by some of these approaches. In this paper, weinvestigate further what we call the “ideal” accounting system, where the forest ownerwould be paid for carbon sequestration as the service is provided and redeempayments when the forest is harvested and carbon is released back into theatmosphere. We demonstrate how discounting affects the net present value of theforest when carbon sequestration is taken into account under this ideal system. Not allcarbon is released back into the atmosphere at harvest, however, since a largeproportion may remain fixed in forest products for many years. Here, we compare theprofitability of the forest under full redemption of credits at harvest, with partialredemption of credits at harvest followed by annual redemption post-harvest as thecarbon decays in a durable forest product. The analysis is based on simulation offarm-forestry systems in south-eastern Australia.";"Hean, Robyn L.

Family-specific effects are more importantin determining the pattern of investment in children within the nuclear family, whileindividual heterogeneity rather than family-specific unobservables dominates the extendedfamily results. Interactions between parent characteristics and child gender are importantdeterminants of both land transfers to, and educational investments in, children. Sons areclearly favored in terms of land inheritance, although daughters of better educated fathers,and with better educated grandfathers, may also have an advantage. The secular expansionof education has contributed much to the increased educational attainment of women. Bettereducated fathers favor daughters in terms of education, while mothers with more land favorsons.

In this perspective the behavioural analysis of land-use and land-ownership decision process seems to be a basic condition to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of those instruments, and to understand and to forecast the agents response to these stimuli.  The land-use and land-ownership behaviour differs according to various land managers, not only on the base of ""economic-productive"" conditions, but also on the base of exogenous and endogenous ""institutional"" conditions, such as the presence of formal or informal contracts, cultural values, intergenerational linkages, family-farm organisation and land-market imperfections and regulations.In this study an analytic methodology is presented together with an explanatory model which both try to show the role and the relationships between the various land-use and landownership driving factors at an agricultural agent level. It is also showed the different behavioural response to the exogenous stimuli coming from the ""economic-institutional"" environment, in which the agents operate.  The model was tested in a Southern Italian region case study. In the first part of the analysis the various ""economic-institutional"" environment typologies, in which the region is articulated, were detected, on the base of official census data at the communal administrative units level. The Factorial Analysis through the Principal Components Analysis and Groups Analysis, is the analytic methodology used for this aim.  In the second part of the analysis two specific ""environments"" were chosen in which the empirical survey was led at the agricultural agent level. The data coming from the survey were used to test the behavioural explanatory model.  The results showed not only some specific ""behavioural"" paths which may be detected in the two different environments, but also deep differences among the various typologies of agricultural agents inside the same environments, depending on the ""economic-productive"" size, the presence of strong familiar roles, informal contracts for hiring work and renting land, the specific history of the agricultural agent, the perception of land as a productive factor, an investment good or a ""social status symbol"".

Each parcel of land has a stationary geographic location, while its utilization is optional. The re-adjustment and optimization of land use patterns ought to be encouraged. Spatial reconstruction refers to the combination of various land elements, which can promote the rational and efficient allocation of land resources through a four-layer action framework: the development of unused land, urban renewal, ecological reconstruction, and spatial displacement. The feasibility and validity of these methods are illustrated by practical cases in different provinces in China. We thus propose that pursuing sustainable development and building an ecological civilization will be necessary for China in future decades.";"Hong, Wuyang

Here, we simulate deforestation in Peruvian Amazonia and evaluate different accessibility measures as LUCC model inputs. We demonstrate how the selection, and different combinations, of accessibility measures impact simulation results. Out of the individual measures, time distance to market center catches the essential aspects of accessibility in our study area. The most accurate simulation is achieved when time distance to market center is used in association with distance to transport network and additional landscape variables. Although traditional Euclidean measures result in clearly lower simulation accuracy when used separately, the combination of two complementary Euclidean measures enhances simulation accuracy significantly. Our results highlight the need for site and context sensitive selection of accessibility variables. More sophisticated accessibility measures can potentially improve LUCC models’ spatial accuracy, which often remains low.";"Salonen, Maria

Evaluation of this potential requires assessment of both pool sizes and their spatial patterns. We quantified SOC and TN, their relationships with soil and vegetation attributes, and their spatial scaling along a catena (hill-slope) gradient in the southern Great Plains, USA where woody cover has increased substantially over the past 100 years. Quadrat variance analysis revealed spatial variation in SOC and TN at two scales. The larger scale variation (40-45 m) was approximately the distance between centers of woody plant communities and their adjoining herbaceous patches. The smaller scale variation (10 m) appeared to reflect the local influence of shrubs on SOC and TN. Litter, root biomass, shrub, and tree basal area (a proxy for plant age) exhibited not only similar spatial scales, but also strong correlations with SOC and TN, suggesting invasive woody plants alter both the storage and spatial scaling of SOC and TN through ecological processes related primarily to root turnover and, to a lesser extent litter production, as mediated by time of occupancy. Forb and grass biomass were not significantly correlated with SOC and TN suggesting that changes in herbaceous vegetation have not been the driving force for the observed changes in SOC and TN. Because SOC and TN varied at two scales, it would be inappropriate to estimate SOC and TN pools at broad scales by extrapolating from point sampling at fine scales. Sampling designs that capture variation at multiple scales are required to estimate SOC and TN pools at broader scales. Knowledge of spatial scaling and correlations will be necessary to design field sampling protocols to quantify the biogeochemical consequences of woody plant encroachment at broad scales.";"LIU, FENG

Global environmental change has raised concerns over how urbanization and land use and land cover change affect ecosystem services. This study applied systems ecology theory and ecological energetic analysis to value the worth of natural environment and ecosystem services to a socioeconomic system. We begin with a general discussion of peri-urban areas and their ecosystem services. An emergy approach is applied to establish a framework for evaluating the ecosystem services by identifying systemic roles of each system components. The two-part framework includes: (1) an emergy evaluation of energetic flows of ecosystem services; and (2) an impact matrix to analyze systemic roles of services in the analyzed system. On the basis of the proposed valuation framework and land cover types in the greater Taipei area, this study analyzed ten ecosystems to determine how they interact, via energy flows, to contribute services to human society. By converting all stocks and flows into common emergy units, an impact matrix is constructed to analyze the systemic role of ecosystem components by classifying their status of being active, reactive, critical or indifferent. The analytical results indicate that the soil component of forest ecosystems, upstream rivers and agricultural productivity play critical role of ecosystem services in the study region. The effect of land cover change during 1971–2006 in the study region on ecosystem services is also analyzed. Finally, the implications of biophysical valuation of ecosystem service for spatial planning as related to adapting to global environmental change are discussed.";"Huang, Shu-Li

Drastic human activities may have caused the change of soil organic carbon (SOC) in anthropogenic oasis. This study employs the CENTURY model (Version 4.0) to investigate the effects of land reclamation and management practices in oasis agriculture on the dynamic of SOC at the lower part of Sangong river watershed, a typical anthropogenic oasis reclaimed at 50 years ago. Based on field investigation, history of crop rotations, and past farm practices in study area, land management practices were divided into five categories, corresponding five periods, 0–1958, 1959–1984, 1985–1992, 1993–1998 and 1999–2008. The model successfully simulated the SOC dynamics of the top layer soil (0–20cm) in the different periods. The state of equilibrium of total SOC and the active, slow, and passive carbon pools were built by CENTURY model in 0–1959. Over the 50 years’ cultivation (1959–2008), the mean change in total SOC exhibited complex ways. SOC increased rapidly in the first 2 years (1959–1960) after shrubland reclamation, and declined slowly during the period 1961–1984 and then decreased rapidly from 1985 to 1992. Between 1993 and 1998, it remained relatively stable, and climbed rapidly again during 1999–2008. The trend in total SOC showed “N” shape, i.e., increase, decrease, then increase. Finally, total SOC is greater (8.2%) in 2008 than the original level of SOC under the natural desert shrub. The improvements of land management practices such as ploughing being replaced with no tillage, straw being crushed before returning it to soil, and reasonable application of fertilizers, played a key role in the change in total SOC. Especially, soil carbon sequestration was obviously increased since protective management practices were implemented in 1993, such as no tillage, straw returning to soil, and the balanced fertilization technique. The results were different from the conclusions that loss of soil organic carbon would happen due to reclamation and continuous farming in tropical forests, semiarid grasslands of northern China and Nigerian semiarid Savannah.";"Xu, Wenqiang

This study tests whether there are any consistent messages on why some countries seem to be advancing adoption of the technology, while others are not. We consider the range of claims in existing literature on adoption tendencies and then use structural equation modelling to test and estimate these a priori determinants of GM adoption. We found that being an exporter of maize and soybeans, agricultural area, participation in the Responsible Care Program of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association, having the EU and/or Japan as main trading partners, and participation in international environmental agreements, significantly influence decisions about whether or not to adopt GM crops at the country-level. In addition, there are two variables that are indirectly related to adoption decisions at country-level, namely technological readiness and government effectiveness.";"Hall, Clare

"AGRIS:DJ2012041681";"Qualitative, Quantitative and Economic Land Suitability Evaluation for Wheat, Maize and Sesame Production in Mehran Plain, Ilam Province";"";"Extension of cultivation areas becomes gradually impossible due to ever-increasing population growth and urban area development in Iran. Therefore, it is very important to use the existing cultivated lands more efficiently. Land suitability evaluation makes the sustainable use of the lands feasible. The objective of this study was qualitative, quantitative and economic suitability evaluation of irrigated croplands for wheat, maize and sesame in Mehran plain, Ilam Province. Soil survey in the field, laboratory analysis of the soil samples, qualitative, quantitative and economic evaluation were different successive stages of this research. In qualitative evaluation, climatic, topographic and soil suitability classes were determined according to the degree of the matching with plant requirements, by parametric (square root) method. Quantitative and economic evaluations were done based on observed, potential and marginal yield analysis. Results of the qualitative land evaluation showed that most of the land units were classified moderately suitable for given crops because of soil limitations. Qualitatively, most of the land units were classified in the same classes as, or in lower classes than quantitative suitability classes for wheat and maize production, due to high management level at the farms. Whereas quantitative classes of sesame were determined lower than qualitative classes induced by low management level for this crop. Economic land suitability classification showed that the wheat production was the most economic land utilization type. Results of the economic assessment suggested that the cultivation of wheat in rotation with sesame would produce the most income for different units and could be increased in future using improvement in management level in the study area for sesame cultivation.";"A.

"AGRIS:US201500205252";"Characterizing rainfall‐runoff signatures from micro‐catchments with contrasting land cover characteristics in southern Amazonia";"";"On the basis of interactions between landscape characteristics and precipitation inputs, watersheds respond differently to different climatic inputs. The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize controls on runoff generation from two first order micro‐catchments in the Amazonia region. The study investigated the variation of hydrological signatures at micro‐catchment scale and related these to landscape and land cover differences and weather descriptors that control the observed responses. One catchment is a pasture cleared of all natural vegetation in the early 1980s, and the second catchment is a primary tropical forest with minor signs of disturbance. Water levels and meteorological variables were continuously monitored during the study period (December 2012–May 2013). Water level measurements were converted to discharge, evapotranspiration was quantified using Penman–Monteith equation and catchment pedohydrological properties were also determined. During the study period, mean total rainfall was 1200 mm, and direct runoff ratios were 0.29 and 0.12 for the pasture and forest catchments, respectively. Base flow index was relatively high in the forest catchment (0.76) compared with pasture catchment (0.63). Results from this study showed that the pasture catchment had a 35% higher mean stream flow. Analysis of selected individual rainstorm events also showed peak discharges, which were attained much faster in the pasture catchment compared with the forest catchment. At both sites, rainfall‐runoff responses were highly dependent on surface and subsurface flow generation. Overland flow was observed in the pasture site during intense rainfall events. The pasture catchment exhibited higher event water contribution than the forest catchment. Findings from this research suggest that shallow lateral pathways play a significant role in controlling runoff generation processes in the forest catchment, whereas infiltration excess runoff generation processes dominate in the pasture catchment. The findings in this study suggest that the conversion of forest to pasture may lead to important changes in runoff generation processes and water storage in these head water catchments.

An unsupervised classification scheme based on the use of entropy and alpha angle is widely used for land-cover classification using multi-polarization radar images. The polarimetric entropy and the alpha angle are used to characterize a target's randomness and scattering mechanism, respectively. Here, we replace the entropy by the Gini index. Evaluation of the Gini index is computationally efficient. It also overcomes the drawback encountered in entropy evaluation, namely, the use of logarithmic operation. We develop and validate an unsupervised classification technique based on the use of the Gini index and alpha angle and show that it performs better than the classic entropy/alpha classification technique. We have also used the Gini/alpha method with anisotropy and complex Wishart distribution to design a complete land-cover classification scheme. The proposed classification scheme performs better than the entropy/alpha land-cover classification scheme.";"Panigrahi, Rajib Kumar

For the data fusion, multiplicative method, Brovey transform, principal component analysis (PCA), Gram–Schmidt fusion, wavelet-based fusion and Elhers fusion are used and the results are compared. Of these methods, the best result is obtained by the use of the optical/synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wavelet-based fusion. The classification methods of multisource images, statistical maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and the knowledge-based method are used and the results are compared. The knowledge-based method is based on a hierarchical rule-based approach and it uses a hierarchy of rules describing different conditions under which the actual classification has to be performed. Overall, the research indicates that multisource information can significantly improve the interpretation and classification of land-cover types and the knowledge-based method is a powerful tool in the production of a reliable land-cover map.";"Amarsaikhan, D.

"AGRIS:US201301707107";"Bayesian calibration as a tool for initialising the carbon pools of dynamic soil models";"";"The most widely applied soil carbon models partition the soil organic carbon into two or more kinetically defined conceptual pools. The initial distribution of soil organic matter between these pools influences the simulations. Like many other soil organic carbon models, the DAYCENT model is initialised by assuming equilibrium at the beginning of the simulation. However, as we show here, the initial distribution of soil organic matter between the different pools has an appreciable influence on simulations, and the appropriate distribution is dependent on the climate and management at the site before the onset of a simulated experiment. If the soil is not in equilibrium, the only way to initialise the model is to simulate the pre-experimental period of the site. Most often, the site history, in terms of land use and land management is often poorly defined at site level, and entirely unknown at regional level. Our objective was to identify a method that can be applied to initialise a model when the soil is not in equilibrium and historic data are not available, and which quantifies the uncertainty associated with initial soil carbon distribution. We demonstrate a method that uses Bayesian calibration by means of the Accept–Reject algorithm, and use this method to calibrate the initial distribution of soil organic carbon pools against observed soil respiration measurements. It was shown that, even in short-term simulations, model initialisation can have a major influence on the simulated results. The Bayesian calibration method quantified and reduced the uncertainties in initial carbon distribution.";"Yeluripati, Jagadeesh B.

Mapping accuracy of burnt extent is highly variable between areas and from year to year within the same area. Where there are corresponding patches in the AVHRR and Landsat data sets, the fit is good. However, the AVHRR data set misses some large patches. Overall, 63% of the Landsat burnt area is also mapped in the AVHRR data set, but this varies from 0% to 89% at different sites. In total, 81% of the AVHRR burnt area data are matched in the Landsat data set, but range from 0% to 94%. The lower match rates (<50%) are generally when little area has burnt (0–500 km²), with figures generally better in the more northerly sites. Results of regressions analysis based on 10 km × 10 km cells are also variable, with R² values ranging from 0.37 (n = 116) to 0.94 (n = 85). For the Tanami Desert scene, R² varies from 0.41 to 0.61 (n = 368) over three separate years. Combining the data results in an R² of 0.60 (n = 1315) (or 0.56 with the intercept set to 0). The slopes of the regressions indicate that mapping the burnt area from AVHRR imagery underestimates the ‘true’ extent of burning for all scenes and years. Differences in mapping accuracy between low and high fire years are examined, as well as the influence of soil, vegetation, land use and tenure on mapping accuracy. Issues which are relevant to mapping fire in arid and semi-arid environments and discontinuous fuels are highlighted.";"Turner, Dorothy

Commercial use is increasing rapidly as derivatives of the fruit such as baobab seed oil and fruit pulp are being exported to Europe and North America. The cash derived from the sale of fruit support thousands of rural people. This study examines baobab fruit yields in an area being harvested for commercial use. It represents baobab populations and harvesting scenarios typically found in Southern Africa and is the first study in Africa to combine demographic and production data in determining baobab fruit yields. Fruit production was examined across five land-use types (nature reserves, rocky outcrops, plains, fields and villages) and over three consecutive years. Factors assessed included differences in life-stage, tree size, land-use type, inter-annual variation and quantifiable fruit predation. Results showed that adult trees produced 8 times more fruit than sub-adult trees. Fruit production fluctuated between size-classes and exhibited weak linear and logarithmic trends between fruit production and dbh and crown volume, respectively. There was high variation between trees with 41% of adult trees consistently producing <5 fruit per year, which we classed as ‘poor-producers'. Different land uses showed no significant differences in fruit production per tree, but where baboons were present, in nature reserves and rocky outcrops, predation of immature fruit resulted in up to 85% fruit loss. Villages and fields had the highest tree density and yielded the most fruit/ha. Inter-annual variation was significant with a two and a half fold difference between the highest and lowest year. The results of this study are important for economic planning and management and are key to determining sustainable harvesting levels of baobab fruit in Southern Africa.";"Venter, Sarah M.

This study examined growth, survival, biomass accumulation and allocation, and nitrogen concentrations following two growing seasons in American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) seedlings receiving irrigation, granular fertilization, and irrigation+fertilization compared with untreated controls. Fertilization increased basal diameter, height, and stem mass of American sycamore following two growing seasons. Increased stem production was attributed to accelerated development and not shifts in biomass allocation due to treatment. Irrigation and irrigation+fertilization treatments did not enhance growth or biomass accumulation of American sycamore. Similarly, black locust basal diameter, height, and stem mass did not differ among the treatments. Browse surveys showed that more than 76% of black locust seedlings experienced arrested or retrogressed growth due to browse; less than 3% of American sycamores were browsed. This intensive browse by ungulates, likely including reintroduced elk, may have affected growth differences among species and confounded the effects of treatments on black locust. Survival was unaffected by treatment in both species, but mean survival was greatest in American sycamore (80%) compared to black locust (58%). Per tree total nitrogen uptake was highest in fertilized American sycamore (7.9g) and lowest in irrigated American sycamore (0.9g). The results of our study suggest that granular fertilizer applications can accelerate seedling growth on reclaimed surface mines in the Appalachian region.";"Brinks, Joshua S.

Seedlings used for reforestation programs in Indonesia were based on the height of seedlings ready to be planted in the field without basic knowledge of seedling morphology. White jabon (Anthocephalus cadamba [Roxb.] Miq.), a potentially fast-growing multipurpose tree species, has been extensively planted for land rehabilitation and reforestation programs. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of seed viability and initial morphology (diameter and height classes) of A. cadamba seedlings on field survival and growth after planting at Parungpanjang Research Station, Bogor, Indonesia. Correlations were found between seedling characteristics at initial stages and survival or growth in the field: seed viability and seedling height; seedling diameter or survival rate in the field; and seedling height growth in both the nursery and field. Thus, more viable seeds may predict better seedling height growth, seedling diameter growth, and higher survival in the field after planting. The morphology class of H2D4 (height 20–< 30 cm, diameter > 4.5 mm) was a good diameter and height class because of good sturdiness quotient of 5.47 and also high total dry weight of 3.05 g.";"Budiman, Budi

This perspective can be applied in assessing the connections between action at one scale and effect at another, the spatial transferability of models, and the links between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Second, scientists and managers can benefit because they gain information about the geographic patterns in ecosystems. Consequently, they are in a better position to design sampling networks, transfer knowledge, and analyze ecosystem diversity.

The plans, which would be made by use of these algorithmsand based on the accurate information of the cultivation conditions, would result in the appropriateuse of time and capacity of the agricultural machines. In some sectors, such as agriculture or certainindustries, chance that certain event occurs plays a very important role. The influence of randomevents, however, can be significantly reduced if decision makers are counting on them, reveal theirnature and gather as much information about them as possible. Justification of new testing methodsapplied in the economy follows from the fact that, according to economic policy, the growingburden of risk that comes from the uncertainty is borne by farmers.The method that was used in the study is based on the Fuzzy mathematical modeling. Treatinguncertain, vague and linguistically described phenomena and situations is facing difficulties inclassical mathematics. In fact, a large degree of uncertainty is primarily resulting from uncertainexternal events. Fuzzy mathematical modeling can satisfactorily treat those parameters that areuncertain, vague and subjectively evaluated. The algorithm of risk assessment should be based onthe opinion of economic experts, on the experience of the makers of planned decisions and on allthe available data. Solving this problem can be approached in three ways: a) conventional method,b) applying the expert system, c) applying the theory of fuzzy sets.The main characteristic of the traditional way of solving the problem of evaluation is the almostexclusive reliance on measurable economic effects (time and money). Only in some rare cases,additional criteria are taken into account. Because of the importance of additional criteria, it ispossible to develop a prototype of an expert system. Modeling problems in which theinterdependence between the variables is very complex, fuzzy logic can be successfully applied.The complete review and analysis of the problem relying only on knowledge, experience of experts,without the fuzzy logic, would be impossible.";"Sedlak, Otilija

During the last decade in many European countries and in the United States, Integrated Crop Management guidelines have also been applied for fertilisation and reducing nitrogen inputs to crops has become compulsory. A large number of Best Management Practices, rules and tools have been developed to steer farmers toward sustainable farming practices. High-input crops, of which the processing tomato is one of the most important, now have to face new worldwide emergencies: water shortages and desertification. Moreover, consumers demand certified food quality and safety, nutraceutic foods and environmentally friendly production. Market and policies have changed. In this new context both farmers and industries must focus on a rational use of natural resources: preserving water and soil fertility will be part of a product’s new quality labels. ICM strategies must be applied and improved if these goals are to be reached. ICM improvement requires, above all, profound changes in technical/social/economic perspectives: Water and nutrient inputs must be no longer reasoned in terms of quantity but in terms of their efficiency in achieving a precise target (e.g. °Brix Water or Nitrogen Use Efficiency as °Brix kg ha-1 mm-1 or kg-1N). Nutrient supplies (amount and timing) must be based on the crop energy/biomass conversion ratio, not on the predicted yield. Physical and physiological-based DSS, rather than simplified approaches (tables, checkbook methods, etc.), must be incorporated into ICM. Extensive learning and Information Technology diffusion programs must be activated. Environmental laws reduce crop profitability: society must accept the responsibility of rewarding farmers for their role in safeguarding clean water, fresh air and bio-diversity. An integrated Production Chain approach is needed to correctly manage water and soil resources Non-conventional water and nutrient sources (brackish and reused water, compost) should be taken into account. The amount of water needed to produce 1 ton of peeled tomatoes decreases by 14.7 % if ICM rules are applied at a farm level only and by 19.3% if water use is optimised throughout the production chain. Applying improved ICM strategies which enhance water and nutrient efficiency could bring estimated water savings of about 25%.";"Battilani, A.";"";"International Society for Horticultural Science";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"farming systems;desertification;land use;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400115375";"http://www.actahort.org/";"";"";"";"63-73"

Therefore, there is a need to map the spatial and temporal distribution of the vegetation community in order to understand how climate and human activities affect the ecosystem in the arid and semi-arid region. Remote sensing provides a means to derive vegetation properties such as fractional green vegetation cover (fc) and green leaf area index (GLAI). However, to map such vegetation properties using multitemporal remote sensing imagery requires ancillary data for atmospheric corrections that are often not available. In this study, we developed a new approach to circumvent atmospheric effects in deriving spatial and temporal distributions of fc and GLAI. The proposed approach employed a concept, analogous to the pseudoinvariant object method that uses objects void of vegetation as a baseline to adjust multitemporal images. Imagery acquired with Landsat TM, SPOT 4 VEGETATION, and aircraft based sensors was used in this study to map the spatial and temporal distribution of fractional green vegetation cover and GLAI of the San Pedro River riparian corridor and southwest United States. The results suggest that remote sensing imagery can provide a reasonable estimate of vegetation dynamics using multitemporal remote sensing imagery without atmospheric corrections.";"Qi, J.

Snow-covered area (SCA) dynamics were assessed using the MODIS 8-day snow cover composite product MOD10A2 for the 2001–2005 snow seasons in northern Xinjiang, China. The results indicate that the snow-mapping agreement between MODIS daily snow maps and surface observations is high at 94.6% over the four snow seasons under clear-sky conditions. The snow classification accuracy in a mountainous area was lower than that in a plain area and caused higher omission errors, probably resulting in an underestimation of the SCA. The omission errors were mainly determined by snow depth, land cover types, the terrain and mixed pixels. The cloud agreement was 95.9%, and approximately 4.1% of cloud was misclassified as snow when the sky view at the climate stations was covered by clouds. An improvement was found in suppressing clouds using the 8-day products, with MOD10A2 reducing about 88.4% of the average cloud cover compared with MOD10A1. SCA in northern Xinjiang retrieved using MOD10A2 shows a clear seasonal trend. The air temperature plays an important role in the fractional SCA, and the spatial distribution of the snow cover differs considerably in the various areas in the northern Xinjiang region.";"Huang, Xiaodong

We use the double hurdle and Heckman models, which allow us to demonstrate that a number of variables has different effects on participation and income from nonfarm activities. For example, residing in remote areas and lack of capital are found to stimulate participation in nonfarm activities, but decrease nonfarm income. Results are robust, but using the Heckman model seems to produce more accurate results for returns to education and gender under the presence of selection bias. Overall, nonfarm activities are found to be most important for the poor, who are pushed out of agriculture due to limited and poor land resources. This indicates that equipping poor households to enable them to move towards better remunerative nonfarm activities should be a priority for Kyrgyz rural policy makers.";"Atamanov, Aziz

Monitoring occurred at regular intervals of two months over a two-year period to capture inter-annual variability.Herds of both species from the inland limestone plateau covered longer distances and were found further away from their home corrals than those from the coastal plain. Patterns of feeding behaviour and utilization of grazing areas mostly reflected the spatial occurrence of specific land cover classes around the villages and differed significantly between seasons and sites. Seasonal water shortage was one of the key factors affecting dry season livestock movements on the plateau but played a minor role in the coastal plain where livestock keeping proved to be more limited by feed availability.While on transhumance, mobile cattle herds were vulnerable to disadvantages such as limited access to pastureland and water sources nearby their temporary homesteads. The recent problem of armed cattle raids along with emerging land use conflicts compel livestock owners to utilize fewer grazing areas, which threatens to destabilize the region’s animal husbandry system.";"Feldt, Tobias

One project was a top-down approach, and the second was a grassroots, private effort by local citizens to conserve forestland. We gathered data via person interviews, mail surveys, and analysis of legislative testimony. Our findings indicate that early local involvement leads to less conflict and greater acceptance of the project. Important aspects of effective public involvement include shared learning and two-way dialogue.

Enforcement of IPRs, andpricing and adoption of the new technology are modeled as a sequential game betweenthe government that enforces the IPRs, a foreign innovating firm that prices the newtechnology, and the developing country’s producers who make the production andcheating decisions. Analytical results show that complete deterrence of IPR infringementis not always economically optimal. IPR infringement affects the welfare of the interestgroups and has important ramifications for the pricing and adoption of the newtechnology. The quantitative nature of the results depends critically on the existinglabeling regime. The analysis also shows that differences in the level of IPR enforcementprovide an alternative justification for (and explanation of) differences in the pricing ofthe new technology in different countries around the world – a strategy adopted byleading innovators in the sector. Finally, the results suggest that if the penalties for IPRinfringement under the TRIPs agreement follow the custom of retaliatory sanctions underthe GATT, enforcement of IPRs will remain imperfect and the innovators’ ability toobtain value for their biotech traits will still be limited.";"Giannakas, Konstantinos";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016201475";"http://purl.umn.edu/16063";"";"";"";""

Fifty-five sites in four different successional stages were sampled: (i) mown meadows, (ii) young abandoned meadows, (iii) old abandoned meadows, and (iv) young forests. Mown meadows and young abandoned meadows (3-5 years since the last cut) had the highest, young forests the lowest mean number of orthopteran species. The change in vegetation structure and the shading by woody plants are considered the most important drivers determining the orthopteran diversity response to abandonment. Well-targeted agri-environment schemes are needed to maintain extensive semi-natural hay meadows with the provision of compensation payments to support transitional stages (young and old abandoned meadows). A mowing regime with a supra-annual cycle (e.g. 3-5 years) could be a suitable management practice to reduce direct mortality due to mechanical mowing and to halt forest invasion.";"Marini, Lorenzo

"AGRIS:US201301709455";"Soil and carbon losses from five different land management areas under simulated rainfall";"";"The loss of soil and carbon (C) from erosional processes is of greater importance to agricultural productivity and sustainable resource management. Land management practices influence structural properties of soil aggregates, its size and stability, and the stabilization effect of soil organic carbon (SOC), and other cementing agents. Water erosion affects all these properties and consequently decreases productivity of land. Thus, relative significance of loss of soil and C from dry and wet aggregates was studied from soil sampled from the North Appalachian Experimental Watersheds (NAWEP). Aggregates of 2-8mm from a depth of 0-10cm were obtained from soils under five different land management areas (LMAs) including forest, pasture, no-till with manure (NT+M), no-till without manure (NT−M), and conventional tillage (CT). Soil and C losses and associated surface runoff, and percolation water were measured using a rainfall simulator at 5min interval for 1h using slope gradient (8.5%) under dry and wet runs. Soil and C losses under simulated rainfall conditions varied over time and among different LMAs in both dry and wet runs. In dry runs, highest soil loss of 1.55kg/m² was observed in NT−M, followed by 1.34kg/m² in CT, 0.96kg/m² in NT+M, 0.55kg/m² in pasture and 0.51kg/m² in forest. The soil loss from NT−M was significantly different from forest and pasture but not of NT+M and CT. General trends in soil loss were similar for dry and wet runs and were in the order NT−M>CT>NT+M>Pasture>Forest. While trends were similar, wet runs merely increased the amount of soil loss. However, the magnitude of soil loss differed significantly among time intervals (P <0.01). Highest soil loss (0.2kg/m²) was observed under CT and occurred much earlier in 15min of rainfall than under LMAs in dry runs. In comparison, the highest soil loss (0.17kg/m²) was observed in 20min for NT−M, 40min for forest, 45min for NT+M, and 55min for pasture. In the wet runs however, the highest soil loss commenced after 10min in all LMAs. In dry runs, highest C loss was in NT+M (0.045kg/m²), followed by NT−M (0.036kg/m²), CT (0.016kg/m²), pasture (0.014kg/m²), and least C loss was observed in forest (0.0085kg/m²). Total C loss among time interval in dry runs shows different trends compared to soil loss and highest C loss was observed in 40min in all LMAs. But in wet runs, C loss was the highest within 5min of rainfall for all LMAs. Surface runoff in dry runs, differed significantly (P < 0.01) among CT and other LMAs. There was no significant difference in the amount of surface runoff among LMAs from wet aggregates (P <0.05). Percolation loss also varied among LMAs. The CT treatment had the lowest percolation followed by that from forest, pasture, NT−M and NT+M. The results show that soil wetness is one of the important factors in erosional process, which accelerate higher soil and C loss. Forest, pasture, NT+M management practice areas indicated better possibility to mitigate soil and C loss because soil aggregates from these LMAs were characterized by comparatively higher percolation rate, lesser surface runoff, and longer time to incipient soil loss in comparison with CT and NT−M treatments.";"Rimal, Basant K.

"AGRIS:US201400048834";"Some observations about man-made features on natural terrain in Hong Kong";"";"Much of Hong Kong is currently undeveloped and consists of vegetated, relatively steep hillsides, which are considered to be natural terrain. However, in many of these areas there is evidence in old aerial photographs of man-made features, which for the last 30–40 years or so have been hidden by dense vegetation. Before the 1970s the vegetation was considerably less dense than today and much of the ground surface was bare and clearly apparent. Preliminary study of old aerial photographs indicates some 10 types of man-made features, including agricultural, military, mining, prospecting, and other activities. Some are fairly recent, but relatively surprising is the widespread evidence of old to ancient land management practices, particularly on the more remote, elevated steep terrain away from existing villages. These features include stone walls, stone structures and a variety of stone terraces and unsupported earthen step-form terraces, some of which may have their origins with pre-Chinese aboriginal hill tribes. Their distribution, nature and occurrence provide an insight into the history of human settlement in Hong Kong, which is generally unknown within the earth science and engineering communities. These man-made features occur over extensive areas, with many on steep slopes and in natural drainage lines, and with some stone walls and agricultural terraces in excess of 3 m in height. These features should be recognized during natural terrain landslide hazard assessments and other engineering geological and geotechnical studies.";"Styles, K. A.

"AGRIS:US201500184783";"Improved monitoring of urbanization processes in China for regional climate impact assessment";"";"Regional climate is influenced by land surface processes through energy exchange between land and atmosphere at various scales. The performance of climate model simulation is largely influenced by land cover parameterization, especially over areas that experience rapid change of land surface characterization. Accurate land cover datasets suited for climate modeling are urgently needed to improve model parameterization for better simulation. In this study, fused urban land cover datasets have been developed by combining multi-source urban land cover products based on cross-comparison and detailed validation from medium resolution images during recent decades. Fractional cover values at different spatial scales were aggregated from integrated land cover datasets to derive improved estimates of the urban extent of big cities in China. Urbanization in China as captured by the new dataset can be divided into steadily and rapidly increasing periods with the urban area increasing by 2.5 and 6.7 % per year, respectively. Rapid urbanization mostly happens in the urban fringe, especially in eastern China, with mass conversion of cropland and woodland to urban land. An improvement in climate model simulation could be achieved using the fused data applied in climate modeling for examining the impact of rapid urbanization on the regional climate.";"Hu, Yonghong

According to this regulation, a total of 16.000 ha hazelnut growing areas located below 750 m altitude and categorized as first and second class of agricultural land and third class agricultural land having less than 6% slope should be abandoned for alternative crops. The followings are aimed in this study: Determination of hazelnut growing areas by using supervised classification method and of topography effects on classification, Determination of more suitable areas for alternative crop farming, developing a new tool for automatic segmentation of hazelnut parcels. The results indicate that, 71% of the study area, which is 14.600 ha, is covered by hazelnut. The area of orchards in project region is found 1500 ha, whose elevation and slope is 750 m and 6% respectively. When evaluated, in terms of ARIP project, there is no agricultural area available for alternative cropping. The average accuracy of supervised classification method used for determining hazelnut growing areas is found 79.41%. In terms of topography, the accuracy of classification method is affected by aspect and slope. Classification accuracy is found 86.67% and 82.35% in north and South aspects respectively. The highest classification accuracy, in terms of slope, is found for the areas which have slope of more than 30 percent.

"AGRIS:US201500193945";"Invasive weeds in rangelands: Species, impacts, and management";"";"Rangeland and pastures comprise about 42% of the total land area of the United States. About three-quarters of all domestic livestock depend upon grazing lands for survival. Many ranges have had domestic stock grazing for more than 100 years and, as a result, the plant composition has changed greatly from the original ecosystems. Western rangelands previously dominated by perennial bunchgrasses have been converted, primarily through overgrazing, to annual grasslands that are susceptible to invasion by introduced dicots. Today there are more than 300 rangeland weeds in the United States. Some of the most problematic include Bromus tectorum, Euphorbia esula, Centaurea solstitialis, C. diffusa, C. maculosa, and a number of other Centaurea species. In total, weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of $2 billion annually in the United States, which is more than all other pests combined. They impact the livestock industry by lowering yield and quality of forage, interfering with grazing, poisoning animals, increasing costs of managing and producing livestock, and reducing land value. They also impact wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources, and reduce plant and animal diversity. Numerous mechanical and cultural control options have been developed to manage noxious rangeland weeds, including mowing, prescribed burning, timely grazing, and perennial grass reseeding or interseeding. In addition, several herbicides are registered for use on rangelands and most biological control programs focus on noxious rangeland weed control. Successful management of noxious weeds on rangeland will require the development of a long-term strategic plan incorporating prevention programs, education materials and activities, and economical and sustainable multi-year integrated approaches that improve degraded rangeland communities, enhance the utility of the ecosystem, and prevent reinvasion or encroachment by other noxious weed species.Nomenclature: Bromus tectorum L.

Three simulations performed with the fully coupled Parallel Climate Model (PCM) are compared: (1) a present day control run; (2) a simulation with present day land cover and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 greenhouse gas (GHG) projections; and (3) a simulation with SRES A2 land cover and GHG projections. Dimensionality of PCM data is reduced by projection onto a priori specified eigenvectors, consisting of Rossby and Kelvin waves produced by a linearized, reduced gravity model of the tropical circulation. A Hotelling T ² test is performed on projection amplitudes. Effects of LCC evaluated by this method are limited to diabatic heating. A statistically significant and recurrent signal is detected for 33% of all tests performed for various combinations of parameters. Taking into account uncertainties and limitations of the present methodology, this signal can be interpreted as a Rossby wave response to prescribed LCC. The Rossby waves are shallow, large-scale motions, trapped at the equator and most pronounced in boreal summer. Differences in mass and flow fields indicate a shift of the tropical Walker circulation patterns with an anomalous subsidence over tropical South America.";"Jonko, Alexandra Karolina

This paper documents our simulation methods and presents short term (up to 2015) simulations for moderate prices ($25 New Zealand dollars per tonne of CO2-e) where our current modelling techniques are most robust.";"Kerr, Suzi

"AGRIS:US201500163022";"satellite-based green index as a proxy for vegetation cover quality in a Mediterranean region";"";"To preserve land quality and mitigating land degradation represent an important task for regional planning and environmental management of the Mediterranean region. Since land cover dynamics directly affect the landscape characteristics, remote sensing represents an effective tool for land quality assessment at large scale. In particular, the use of satellite-based vegetation indices, like the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), can provide important information when evaluating Vegetation Cover Quality (VCQ) patterns in terms of vegetation productivity and status, which represents one of the most sensitive landscape component to environmental degradation. This paper proposes an approach for the large-scale assessment of VCQ by means of an NDVI-based (functional) indicator using freely available MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite imagery. As a case study, a complex semi-arid Mediterranean landscape (Attica, Greece) experiencing drought, land-use changes, increasing human pressure, and high vulnerability to degradation was chosen. As VCQ indicator, the NDVI-based vegetation cover classification was produced by means of unsupervised multivariate statistical techniques and compared with ancillary cartographic layers, statistical indicators, and field data related to land-use management observed in the study area. Results demonstrate that the obtained remotely sensed land characterization can be effectively considered as a proxy of the VCQ status of the examined region, especially for studies of actual land degradation. Due to the large availability over time and low cost of satellite images, the proposed approach can be applied to wider regions, e.g. covering the whole Mediterranean basin, to monitor diachronically vegetation quality and indirectly control land degradation.";"Bajocco, Sofia

Evidence shows that strong property rights to reservation and reserve land and natural resources, whether communal or individual, are and always have been important determinants of productivity. Political and legal institutions that are perceived as stable and predictable to tribal members and to non-Natives also improve economic opportunities for indigenous people living on reservations and reserves. Research reviewed here also shows that culture and acculturation are important in the development process. Although our emphasis is on North America, the findings are applicable to indigenous people in other parts of the world and shed light on growth questions that loom large for developing countries around the world.";"Anderson, Terry L.

"AGRIS:US201301573290";"Property rights and the public trust doctrine in environmental protection and natural resource conservation";"";"We examine the implications of the public trust doctrine in natural resource protection and conservation. A model of litigation and settlement among disputing parties suggests that the public trust doctrine introduces more costs and is more time consuming than would be the case with alternative approaches, such as the purchase of private rights through market transactions or application of eminent domain powers to reallocate the resource. Because the doctrine allows for uncompensated redistribution, it is resisted by current resource owners. Furthermore, by providing open standing to members of the public in challenging existing uses, public trust disputes encourage excessive demands, increasing the incidence of trial over settlement. This outcome is exacerbated if the plaintiffs derive utility from the 'cause' and provide litigation services at below-market rates, leading to greater investment in litigation. The costs of the public trust doctrine appear to have limited its application beyond the level anticipated by proponents. We present a case study of Mono Lake, part of the well-known 1983 litigation, National Audubon v. Superior Court to illustrate our arguments.";"Brewer, Jedidiah

"AGRIS:US201500077761";"Grazing management or physiography? Factors controlling vegetation recovery in Mediterranean grasslands";"";"Grazing intensification and abandonment are increasing the risk of degradation of Mediterranean grasslands. The development of techniques for monitoring grazing effects on herbaceous vegetation is an essential need for the management of these rangelands. However, the high variability of these systems make physiographical and management effects hard to disentangle and quantify. We present a methodology to support rangeland management and assess grazing effects on environmentally heterogeneous areas, and provide an example of its application in a Mediterranean rangeland in central Spain. We evaluated the difference in photosynthetically active vegetation cover between spring and summer using Spectral Mixture Analysis of very high spatial resolution (2.4m) Quickbird images. To analyze this difference, we developed Boosted Regression Trees models using grazing management (accumulated cost distance to points of livestock concentration and water points) and physiographical variables (slope, wetness, proximity to the closest tree and orientation). Results show that the main factor determining changes in vegetation cover is habitat type. The magnitude of this change was maximized at intermediate grazing pressures for humid habitats, suggesting the existence of an optimal level of grazing in this zones, while in dry habitats differences in vegetation cover increased consistently along with grazing pressure. Our models provided a valuable insight into how different variables and its interactions affect the observed recovery capacity of vegetation. Moreover, by identifying areas in which grazing-induced land degradation could be taken place, our methodology can be used as a powerful tool in the management of highly heterogeneous rangelands.";"Carmona, Carlos P.

Using Australia's Murray Darling Basin as an example, this paper attempts to reveal the adverse economic and water management consequences of entitlement and water sharing regime misspecification in regimes that allow water trading. Markets trade water products as specified. When entitlements and the water sharing system are not designed in a way that has hydrological integrity, the market trades the water management regime into trouble. Options for specification of entitlement and allocation regimes in ways that have hydrological integrity are presented. It is reasoned, that if entitlement and allocation regime are set up in ways that have hydrological integrity, the result should be a regime that can autonomously adjust to climatic shifts, changes in prices and changes in technology without compromising environmental objectives.";"Young, Michael D.

"AGRIS:US201600193599";"role of federal agencies in the application of scientific knowledge";"";"Environmental and ecological research has long been characterized as operating along a continuum, with âbasicâ â representing âinvestigatorâinitiatedâ research â at one end and âappliedâ â representing âmissionâinitiatedâ research â at the other. While federal agency science programs ideally occupy points along this continuum, the resulting science has not always been relevant to solving environmental problems. Here, we suggest that environmental problemâsolving by federal agencies has been less effective than it might have been, because of a need for more effective, longâterm strategic planning, cooperation across agencies, and incentives for scientists to participate in policy development and implementation. We make suggestions about what federal agencies can do to improve the integration of science, policy, and natural resource management. First, we refer to agency examples, using regulatory (acid deposition) and land management (national forest) issues to illustrate how environmental research intersects with policy development and its implementation. Second, we discuss the barriers that inhibit the application of scientific knowledge in developing and implementing policy â from the perspective of a federal agency and of an individual scientist.

"AGRIS:US201600189651";"Operationalizing ecosystem services for the mitigation of soil threats: A proposed framework";"";"Despite numerous research efforts over the last decades, integrating the concept of ecosystem services into land management decision-making continues to pose considerable challenges. Researchers have developed many different frameworks to operationalize the concept, but these are often specific to a certain issue and each has their own definitions and understandings of particular terms. Based on a comprehensive review of the current scientific debate, the EU FP7 project RECARE proposes an adapted framework for soil-related ecosystem services that is suited for practical application in the prevention and remediation of soil degradation across Europe. We have adapted existing frameworks by integrating components from soil science while attempting to introduce a consistent terminology that is understandable to a variety of stakeholders. RECARE aims to assess how soil threats and prevention and remediation measures affect ecosystem services. Changes in the natural capital's properties influence soil processes, which support the provision of ecosystem services. The benefits produced by these ecosystem services are explicitly or implicitly valued by individuals and society. This can influence decision- and policymaking at different scales, potentially leading to a societal response, such as improved land management. The proposed ecosystem services framework will be applied by the RECARE project in a transdisciplinary process. It will assist in singling out the most beneficial land management measures and in identifying trade-offs and winâwin situations resulting from and impacted by European policies. The framework thus reflects the specific contributions soils make to ecosystem services and helps reveal changes in ecosystem services caused by soil management and policies impacting on soil. At the same time, the framework is simple and robust enough for practical application in assessing soil threats and their management with stakeholders at various levels.";"Schwilch, Gudrun

"AGRIS:US201300816491";"Linking Land-use, Water Body Type and Water Quality in Southern New Zealand";"";"Land-use and vegetation cover have been linked to the nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus) of surface waters in several countries. However, the links generally relate to streams and rivers, or to specific types of standing water, for example shallow lakes in a geologically defined region. We measured physical variables and nutrient chemistry of 45 water bodies representative of the wide range of lentic wetland environments (swamps, riverine wetlands, estuaries, reservoirs, shallow lakes, deep lakes) in Otago, New Zealand, and related these to catchment variables and land-use in order to assess the potential influence of catchment modification on water quality of these diverse wetlands. Catchment boundaries and land cover were derived from maps using ArcView GIS software. Our predictions that concentrations of nutrients and other components of water quality would correlate positively with the nature and intensity of catchment modification were confirmed in multivariate analyses. Physical and chemical measures were positively related to the extent of modification in the catchment (percentage of the catchment in pasture, planted forest, scrub and urban areas), and negatively related to lack of catchment modification (more of the catchment in bare ground, tussock grassland and indigenous forest). The strong negative correlations between nutrient concentrations, suspended sediment, water colour and the percentage of tussock cover in the catchment imply that increased conversion of the native tussock grassland to pastoral farming in Otago will increase nutrient concentrations and reduce water quality of the diverse lentic ecosystems.";"Galbraith, Lisa M.

"AGRIS:US201300816495";"Improving land change detection based on uncertain survey maps using fuzzy sets";"";"In this paper we present a method for correcting inherent classification bias in historical survey maps with which subsequent land cover change analysis can be improved. We linked generalized linear modelling techniques for spatial uncertainty prediction to fuzzy set based operations. The predicted uncertainty information was used to compute fuzzy memberships of forest and non-forest classes at each location. These memberships were used to reclassify the original map based on decision rules, which take into consideration the differences in identification likelihood during the historical mapping. Since the forest area was underestimated in the original mapping, the process allows to correct this bias by favouring forest, especially where uncertainty was high. The analyses were performed in a cross-wise manner between two study areas in order to examine whether the bias correction algorithm would still hold in an independent test area. Our approach resulted in a significant improvement of the original map as indicated by an increase of the Normalized Mutual Information from 0.26 and 0.36 to 0.38 and 0.45 for the cross-wise test against reference maps in Pontresina and St. Moritz, respectively. Consequently subsequent land cover change assessments could be considerably improved by reducing the deviations from a reference change by almost 50 percent. We concluded that the use of logistic regression techniques for uncertainty modelling based on topographic gradients and fuzzy set operations are useful tools for predictively reducing uncertainty in maps and land cover change models. The procedure allows to get more reliable area estimates of crisp classes and it improves the computation of the fuzzy areas of classes. The approach has limitations when the original map shows high initial accuracy.";"Leyk, Stefan

The aims of this study were to evaluate seasonal and spatial variation in steroid estrogen loads, and (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic activity in a river catchment (upper Olifants River, South Africa), subject to a diversity of anthropogenic impacts. In addition, Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, was applied as African-endemic sentinel and source of in vivo biomarkers. In particular, the expression of selected genes linked with reproductive, thyroid and adrenal signalling were determined in juveniles exposed to organic compounds extracted from surface water. Estradiol and ethinylestradiol were detected at all locations, yet the highest concentrations were observed during summer at a waste water treatment plant (WWTP)-impacted site (30.8 and 10.83 ng.l⁻¹, respectively). Moreover, in vitro estrogenic and androgenic activity was detected solely at the aforementioned locality. Anti-androgenic activity was more widespread, and detected at four of the localities sampled, with the highest potency at WWTP-impacted sites. The expression of the aromatase coding gene, cyp19a1b, was significantly downregulated in O. mossambicus representing a site dominated by agricultural land use. Moreover, the thyroid-linked type 2 deiodinase (dio2) was upregulated in fish representing three of the five localities, although with no clear link to a specific land use area. The present study suggests that different land cover areas contribute differentially to endocrine disruptive activity, and that a combinational approach (in vitro and in vivo biomarkers) is required to screen for EDC risk.";"Truter, Johannes C.

"AGRIS:US201400063461";"Evaluation of trees indigenous to the montane forest of the Blue Mountains, Jamaica for reforestation and agroforestry";"";"The shortage of forest products and unsustainability of current land use practices experienced by many hillside farmers in the Caribbean is associated with increasing rates of conversion and degradation of remaining natural forests. This pressure could be alleviated by the establishment of trees in community/farm forests or more integrated agroforestry systems. Indigenous tree species are largely untried for these applications and represent an underexploited resource that may offer a good combination of tolerance of local environmental conditions, together with potential to restore degraded environments. These needs were addressed in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica in a study that combined: eliciting local people’s knowledge about the utility of tree species for a wide range of products and services, assessment of the ecological characteristics of the tree species, and testing the establishment and growth of selected species over three and a half years in on-farm environments. Detailed interviews were conducted with 16 male and 11 female local respondents. Together they reported on the uses of 80 taxa of trees and shrubs, 43 of them indigenous (each respondent naming, on average, 19 taxa). All but one of the trees already present on farmland were exotic, but the majority of respondents were interested in planting more trees. The overall local valuations of each of the species were calculated for 10 uses. Timber and fruit were the highest rated individual uses but, for planting, multipurpose tree species were valued most highly. The respondents were familiar with most, but not all, of the indigenous species that have been recognised as having high commercial timber value. Farm environments on the southern slopes of the Blue Mountains are subject to significant drought as well as frequent disturbance from fire. Fifty-eight tree species indigenous to the montane forests were assessed for their potential suitability for growing in this environment by two indices of their distribution and three of their ecology. Their potential for timber production was also assessed in terms of their maximum size and wood density. Twenty-four of these species (together with one other indigenous timber species and the most highly valued exotic multipurpose tree species) were selected for a species elimination trial with a blocked structure replicated in two sites. After 42 months the species were strongly differentiated in terms of their rates of survival (from 0 to 48%), diameter growth (from 1.7 to 5.1 cm increment over the 42 months for the montane forest species), height growth (84–258 cm increment) and crown and stem form. Performance of most species in the trial could be explained post hoc by selective reference to their distribution and ecological traits in the natural montane forests. However, none of the traits taken alone provided accurate predictions of species’ performance in the trial. The best prediction was provided by a classification of species’ regeneration type with pioneer species tending to do better and shade-tolerant species worse, however there were many exceptions. No relationship was found between species’ performance in the trial and their altitudinal range, abundance in southern slope forest, in secondary forests or on landslides, or their growth rate or maximum stem density in mature forest stands. From the combination of local valuation and trial performance 10 species are recommended for more detailed testing. Of the undomesticated indigenous species, Juniperus lucayana and Clethra occidentalis are particularly recommended, and it is suggested that Turpinia occidentalis, Cinnamomum montanum, Viburnum alpinum, Dendropanax arboreus, Podocarpus urbanii and Prunus occidentalis also be considered because of their good combination of establishment and utility. In addition, from the analysis of ecological characteristics a further 19 species (11 already known to be valued for their utility) are recommended for an additional trial.";"McDonald, M.A.

The effectiveness of protected areas in preserving suitable habitats for target species in the face of climate change is particularly concerning, as many protected sites may lose suitable conditions for those species. We investigate the potential effect of temperature increase on the regional distribution of pygmy and boreal owl, mountain forest specialists in the Italian Alps, and the relative effectiveness of the Natura 2000 network at the regional level. We modelled current and future distributions by MaxEnt, relating occurrence to climate and land cover, considering current and future climates (changes predicted for 2050 considering representative concentration pathways of +4.5 and +8.5 W/m²). The distribution of both species is affected by climate variables and by the availability of coniferous forests, and of a few other habitat types (such as grassland, bare soil, broadleaved forest, mixed forest). The potential regional distribution of the two species will undergo a significant reduction, more marked for boreal owl (52–54 %) than for pygmy owl (23–34 %). Although Natura 2000 covers (and will cover also in the future) more than 30 % of suitable sites of both species, 64 % of the sites suitable for both species now and in the two alternative future scenarios are not included in any Site of Community Importance or Special Protection Areas (SPAs). Those sites are ideal candidate for new SPAs. Network enlargement or adequate forest management also outside protected areas is required for the conservation of those and other forest-specialist species in a warmer future.";"Brambilla, Mattia

"AGRIS:US201600195194";"Interdependence in rainwater management technologies: an analysis of rainwater management adoption in the Blue Nile Basin";"";"In the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopian highlands, rainfall distribution is extremely uneven both spatially and temporally. Drought frequently results in crop failure, while high rainfall intensities result in low infiltration and high runoff causing soil erosion and land degradation. These combined factors contribute to low agricultural productivity and high levels of food insecurity. Poor land management practices coupled with lack of effective rainwater management strategies aggravate the situation. Over the past two decades, however, the Government of Ethiopia has attempted to address many of these issues through a large-scale implementation of a number of soil and water conservation measures. Despite the success of interventions, uptake and adoption remains low. The conceptual framework of this study is based on the premise that farmers are more likely to adopt a combination of rainwater management technologies as adaptation mechanism against climate variability and agricultural production constraints. This contrasts the previous work that typically examined a single technology without considering the interdependence between technologies. Data used in this study come from household survey in seven watersheds in the Ethiopian Blue Nile Basin. A multivariate probit model was used to account for the potential correlation and interdependence of various components of rainwater management technologies. Our results suggest that rainwater management technologies are related with each other; hence, any effort to promote the adoption of rainwater management technologies has to consider such interdependence of technologies, or failure to do so may mask the reality that farmers face a set of choices in their adoption decisions.";"Gebregziabher, Gebrehaweria

For the terrestrial‐to‐aquatic arthropod flux (i.e. inputs of terrestrial arthropods to the river from the land), urban development was positively related to density of inputs but negatively related to biomass, partially explained by shifts in community composition and body size. Riparian grassland, typical of rural (i.e. non‐urban) landscapes, was positively associated with both density (range: 2.8–18.9 individuals m⁻² day⁻¹) and biomass (range: 7.1–58.7 mg m⁻² day⁻¹) of inputs. For the aquatic‐to‐terrestrial flux of adult aquatic insects (i.e. emergent aquatic insects exported from the river), riparian grassland cover was positively associated with both density (R² = 0.61; range: 12.8–116.8 individuals m⁻² day⁻¹) and biomass (R² = 0.65; range: 1.4–27.9 mg m⁻² day⁻¹), with relatively larger‐bodied taxa dominating emergence at rural reaches. Riparian landscape composition relates to reciprocal fluxes of arthropods (aquatic insects out, terrestrial insects and other arthropods in) in river‐riparian systems as we found human landscape disturbances were associated with changes in the taxonomic composition of both aquatic emergence and terrestrial input, and an overall decrease in the magnitude of emergence and terrestrial input. Furthermore, landscape changes that alter arthropod fluxes may have broader consequences for linked river‐riparian biodiversity and food webs and should be taken into account in conservation, restoration and management of these systems.";"Kautza, Adam

"AGRIS:US201400182784";"Implementing GIS regression trees for generating the spatial distribution of copper in Mediterranean environments: the case study of Lebanon";"";"Soil contamination by heavy metals has become a widespread dangerous problem in many parts of the world, including the Mediterranean environments. This is closely related to the increase irrigation by waste waters, to the uncontrolled application of sewage sludge, industrial effluents, pesticides and fertilizers, to the rapid urbanization, to the atmospheric deposition of dust and aerosols, to the vehicular emissions and to many other negative human activities. In this context, this paper predicts the spatial distribution and concentration level of copper (Cu) in the 195 km² of Nahr el-Jawz watershed coastal area situated in northern Lebanon using a geographic information system (GIS) and regression-tree analysis. The chosen area represents a typical case study of Mediterranean coastal landscape with deteriorating environment. Fifteen environmental parameters (parent material, soil type, pH, hydraulical conductivity, organic matter, stoniness ratio, soil depth, slope gradient, slope aspect, slope curvature, land cover/use, distance to drainage line, proximity to roads, nearness to cities, and surroundings to waste areas) were generated from satellite imageries, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), ancillary data and/or field observations to statistically explain Cu laboratory measurements. A large number of tree-based regression models (214) were developed using (1) all parameters, (2) all soil parameters only, and (3) selected pairs of parameters. The best regression tree model (with the lowest number of terminal nodes) combined soil pH and surroundings to waste areas, and explained 77% of the variability in Cu laboratory measurements. The overall accuracy of the predictive quantitative copper map produced using this model (at 1 : 50,000 cartographic scale) was estimated to be ca. 80%. Applying the proposed tree model is relatively simple, and may be used in other coastal areas. It is certainly of significant interest to local governments and municipalities. It will serve several development projects concerned with improving the environmental conditions and the quality of living in coastal areas.";"Kheir, Rania Bou

"AGRIS:US2016201295";"DETERMINANTES DE ESTRATEGIAS COMUNITARIAS DE SUBSISTENCIA Y EL USO DE PRACTICAS CONSERVACIONISTAS DE PRODUCCION AGRICOLA EN LAS ZONAS DE LADERA EN HONDURAS";"";"In this paper we discuss the principal results of participatory surveys that were conducted between June 2001 and May 2002 in 95 communities (villages) in the rural hillside areas in Honduras. The principal objectives of the study were to determine the main income earning strategies at the community level; identify the most important determinants of these strategies; and analyze the principal factors that determine the use of conservation technologies and investments. A total of eight different income-earning strategies were identified that largely reflect differences in comparative advantages between different communities. We used a multinominal logit model to explain the choice of income earning strategy as determined by biophysical factors (elevation, rainfall); socioeconomic variables(population density, market access); social factors (land tenure, education) and institutional factors (community-based and external organizations). For example, communities located at relatively high altitudes and with good market access are more likely to specialize in coffee production or vegetable growing. Ownership of the land encourages working on the own farm while discouraging off-farm work.In addition, a probit model was used to establish that the adoption of conservation technologies and investments is determined not only by the type of income earning strategy but also by population density land tenure, and presence and type of organizations. Even though no specific information was collected regarding the costs and benefits of specific conservation practices, in many communities people expressed that the low profitability of many of these practices seriously hampers their wider diffusion.The results of this study have some important policy implication. First, since communities that grow cash crops can be expected to have earn higher incomes than communities that grow basic grains only, significant investments in extending and improving the road network are needed in order to achieve a better integration of many rural hillside communities into the market economy as a vehicle towards reducing transaction costs, thus contributing to a reduction in poverty. Second, even though the potential of profitable conservation technologies and investments depend on the type of income earning strategy pursued, other factors such as population density and assistance from local and external organizations play a crucial role as well. The positive impact of population on the adoption of agricultural intensification, but becomes only effective at relatively high levels of population density and most communities in the rural hillsides of Honduras have not reached that stage yet. Finally and despite the fact that the available information did not permit a quantitative analysis of the relationship between income earning strategies and income levels, the qualitative analysis suggests that in order to overcome the tremendous poverty in which the majority of the inhabitants of the rural hillside areas of Honduras live and to improve their access to basic public services, massive public investments are needed in the areas of public health, education, electricity and communication facilities.";"Jansen, Hans G.P.

"AGRIS:US201400168815";"Unfulfilled farmer expectations: the case of the Insect Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project in Kenya";"";"BACKGROUND: Maize is the most important staple food in Kenya; any reduction in production and yield therefore often becomes a national food security concern. To address the challenge posed by the maize stem borer, the Insect Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) agricultural biotechnology public-private partnership (PPP) project was launched in 1999. There were, however, pre-existing concerns regarding the use of genetic engineering in crop production and skepticism about private sector involvement. The purpose of this case study was to understand the role of trust in the IRMA partnership by identifying the challenges to, and practices for, building trust in the project. METHODS: Data were collected by conducting face-to-face, semi-structured interviews; reviewing publicly available project documents; and direct observations. The data were analyzed to generate recurring and emergent themes on how trust is understood and built among the partners in the IRMA project and between the project and the community. RESULTS: Clear and continued communication with stakeholders is of paramount importance to building trust, especially regarding competition among partners about project management positions; a lack of clarity on ownership of intellectual property rights (IPRs); and the influence of anti-genetic modification (GM) organizations. Awareness creation about IRMA’s anticipated products raised the end users’ expectations, which were unfulfilled due to failure to deliver Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-based products, thereby leading to diminished trust between the project and the community. CONCLUSIONS: Four key issues have been identified from the results of the study. First, the inability to deliver the intended products to the end user diminished stakeholders’ trust and interest in the project. Second, full and honest disclosure of information by partners when entering into project agreements is crucial to ensuring progress in a project. Third, engaging stakeholders and creating awareness immediately at the project’s inception contributes to trust building. Fourth, public sector goodwill combined with private sector technology and skills are necessary for a successful partnership. These findings may serve as a useful guide for building and fostering trust among partners in other agbiotech PPPs in sub-Saharan Africa.";"Mabeya, Justin

"AGRIS:US201600194860";"Riparian Vegetation Assemblages and Associated Landscape Factors Across an Urbanizing Metropolitan Area";"";"While diverse, native riparian vegetation provides important functions, it remains unclear to what extent these assemblages can persist in urban areas, and under what conditions. We characterized forested riparian vegetation communities across an urbanizing metropolitan area and examined their relationships with surrounding land cover. We hypothesized that native and hydrophilic species assemblages would correlate with forest cover in the landscape. For each of 30 sites in the Portland-Vancouver metro area, we recorded vegetation at 1-cm intervals along 3 transects using the line-intercept method. Land cover was characterized at 2 scales: within 500 m of each site and across the entire watershed. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate relationships between species composition and land cover patterns. A classification tree was created to determine landscape predictors of riparian community type. Results indicated a strong relationship between watershed land cover and vegetation diversity and structural complexity. Our hypothesis of native species association with landscape forest cover in urban riparian areas was supported, but we found no clear relationship between land cover and wetland indicator status. Our results suggest that high watershed forest cover (at least 15%) may enable the persistence of functionally diverse, native riparian vegetation communities in urban landscapes.

This study developed an approach for modeling and examining the impacts of future land-use and climate change scenarios on streamflow, surface runoff and groundwater discharge using an empirical land-use change model, a watershed hydrological model based on various land use policies and climate change scenarios in an urbanizing watershed in Taiwan. The results of the study indicated that various demand and conversion policies had different levels of impact on hydrological components in all land-use scenarios in the study watershed. Climate changes were projected to have a greater impact in increasing surface runoff and reducing groundwater discharge than are land use changes. Additionally, the spatial distributions of land-use changes also influenced hydrological processes in both downstream and upstream areas, particularly in the downstream watershed. The impacts on hydrological components when considering both land use and climate changes exceeded those when only considering land use changes or climate changes, particularly on surface runoff and groundwater discharge. However, the proposed approach provided a useful source of information for assessing the responses of land use and hydrological processes to future land use and climate changes.";"Lin, Yu-Pin

We investigated the temporal and spatial changes in macronutrient transport and loss after fertilization and precipitation in manure-fertilized eggplant farmland in an alluvial plain. Upon adding topical fertilizer, concentrations of most nutrients in runoff and groundwater increased, and nitrogen runoff increased from 22.11 to 35.81 kg/ha, although eggplant yield did not increase correspondingly. Incorporation of fertilizer by plowing reduced nutrient losses (nitrogen runoff/fertilizer decreased from 18.40 to 12.29 %). Measurements taken along the nutrient transport route (runoff, drainage ditch, groundwater, river water, and finally rainfall) revealed that concentrations of most nutrients declined at each stage. Nutrient characteristics varied by transport, and the forms of nitrogen and phosphorus differed greatly between runoff and groundwater (nitrate/nitrogen in runoff was ~43.49 %, while in groundwater ~5.41 %). Most nutrient concentrations in runoff decreased greatly during the planting season (total nitrogen decreased from 62.25 to 4.17 mg/L), correlated positively with temperature and stage of plant growth, but little temporal change was observed in groundwater. This field investigation during one planting season exemplifies the basic principles of nutrient loss and transport from manure-fertilized farmland in an alluvial plain.";"Wang, Yiyao

In this study, we show that the urban heat island (UHI) develops only at night and under certain weather conditions, and its intensity depends not only on the site's land cover but also on the meteorological setting. The urban heat island intensity was largest (6.6� °C) under lingering high-pressure conditions, milder (3.0� °C) under cold anticyclones and almost vanished (1.0� °C) during the passage of cold fronts. The cooling rates were calculated to monitor the growth and decay of the UHI over each specific synoptic setting. Over four contiguous days under the effect of a lingering high-pressure event, we observed that the onset of cooling was always at about 2� h before sunset. The reference site attained mean cooling rate of −2.6� °C� h⁻¹ at sunset, whilst the maximum urban rate was −1.2� °C� h⁻¹. Under a 3-day cold anticyclone episode, cooling also started about 2� h before sunset, and the difference between maximum rural (−2.0� °C� h⁻¹) and urban (−1.0� °C� h⁻¹) cooling rates diminished. Under cold-front conditions, the cooling rate was homogeneous for all sites and swang about zero throughout the day. The air temperature has a memory effect under lingering high-pressure conditions which intensified the UHI, in addition to the larger heat storage in the urban area. Cold anticyclone conditions promoted the development of the UHI; however, the cold air pool and relatively light winds smoothed out its intensity. Under the influence of cold fronts, the urban fabric had little effect on the city's air temperature field, and the UHI was imperceptible.";"Targino, Admir Créso

The experiments are accomplished using the Lagrangian particle transport and dispersion model FLEXPART coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model under different scenarios. Experiment results show that the maximum changes in daily mean air pollution concentration (as represented by SO₂ concentration) caused by land use change alone reaches up to 2 × 10⁻⁶� g� m⁻³, whereas changes in concentrations due to the anthropogenic emission distribution are characterized by a maximum value of 6 × 10⁻⁶� g� m⁻³. Such results reflect that, although the impacts of land use change on air quality are non-negligible, the emission distribution exerts a more significant influence on air quality than land use change. This provides clear implications for policy makers to control urban air pollution over the PRD region, especially for the urban planning in spatial arrangements for reasonable emissions.";"Chen, Bin

One effective approach, known as the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), has been promoted for identifying built-up areas based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data. The successful launch of the Landsat-8 satellite has made possible the continued acquisition of high-quality data that meet requirements for observing land use and land cover (LULC), and whether or not NDBI approach can be used with Landsat-8 data needs further verification. In this study, we researched the reflectance spectral characteristics of different land cover types in different bands of Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) data and found that the trend of some built-up areas in the OLI data from the near-infrared band to the shortwave infrared band is different from that in the TM/ETM+ data. This different trend made the conventional NDBI approach unsuitable for Landsat-8 OLI data. We propose a new index, called the build-up and bare land areas index, for transforming Landsat-8 OLI data to map built-up and bare land areas automatically. This new index was used to detect the built-up and bare land areas in Zhengzhou (Henan, China). The accuracy assessment indicates that our index has much higher accuracy (90.8%) than the conventional NDBI approach does (57.4%).";"Zhou, Yi

"AGRIS:US2012210446";"RURAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM IN NORTH DAKOTA";"";"The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), enacted in 1985, provides conservation benefits and agricultural supply control through voluntary, long-term retirement of crop land.  Large-scale, long-term land retirement programs produce, in varying degrees, negative effects on those businesses and economic sectors that provide agricultural inputs and services.  While the effects of the CRP on agriculture are well understood, economic assessments of the market-value of conservation benefits from the program accruing to rural economies remains largely undocumented.  One of the conservation benefits of the program is wildlife habitat, which has bolstered upland bird, waterfowl, and big game populations.  Growing wildlife populations have contributed to increased consumptive and non-consumptive wildlife-based recreation.  This study addressed the net economic effects of decreased agricultural activity and increased recreational activity associated with the CRP in six rural areas of North Dakota from 1996 through 2000.

	The negative effects of the CRP on agricultural revenues were based on the level of economic activity that would have occurred in the absence of the program.  The net change in revenues from CRP land returning to agricultural production in the six study areas was estimated at $76 million or about $56 per CRP-acre.  However, returning CRP lands to agricultural production was estimated to lower commodity prices and reduce agricultural revenues on non-CRP lands by $25.9 million.  The combined effect was estimated at $50.2 million annually or $37 per CRP-acre in the study areas.

	The CRP affects many types of outdoor recreation; however, hunting was identified as the most influenced type of recreation in North Dakota.  Recreational impacts were determined by comparing pheasant, waterfowl, and deer hunter numbers before and after the CRP, assigning the relative role the CRP has played in the change in hunter numbers, allocating a percentage of the change in hunter numbers to each study area, and applying seasonal hunter expenditure patterns to the change in hunter numbers.  Average annual CRP-related hunter expenditures in the six study areas were estimated at $12.8 million or $9.45 per CRP-acre.  Overall, recreational revenues averaged 26 percent of the agricultural losses. 

	The degree to which CRP-based hunting revenues in rural areas offset agricultural losses varied throughout the state.  In several cases, hunting expenditures offset a substantial portion of the agricultural losses, while in other areas, the net economic loss from the program remains high.  The net economic effects of the program in western and central North Dakota were the most favorable, whereas the effects were least favorable in eastern areas of the state.  In North Dakota, the net economic effect of losses in agricultural revenues and gains in hunting-based recreational expenditures indicated that several areas of the state are not as economically burdened by the CRP as previous research has suggested.";"Bangsund, Dean A.

"AGRIS:US2016202925";"LAND LEASING AND DEBT ON FARMS: SUBSTITUTES OR COMPLEMENTS?";"";"Theoretically, leasing and debt are thought to be substitutes. This assumes that a lease payment, which is a fixed obligation like a loan, displaces debt and reduces debt capacity, i.e., if firms have optimal debt to equity ratios, then, to the extent that it represents ""off-balance-sheet"" financing, leasing reduces debt capacity.  Ang and Peterson-the seminal work in the literature-fit Tobit models with 1976 to 1981 data from 600 firms in which a leasing to book value of equity ratio is the dependent variable and a debt to book value of equity ratio and other variables are the explanatory variables.  Contrary to expectations, their model results indicate that leasing and debt are complementary activities.  This study follows the Ang and Peterson methodology, but utilizes a set of firms which are distinct from those of earlier studies-non-corporate U.S. commercial farms-to test a land leasing-debt substitution hypothesis.  An advantage of the land lease example is that by focusing on a single industry -production agriculture- the problem of potential industry affects is substantially reduced.  In a departure from earlier studies, the issue of whether the leasing-debt relation is sensitive to heterogenous firm characteristics and shifting business conditions is examined. OLS leasing models corrected for heteroskedasticity are fit with 1977 through 1992 Kansas farm-level data in which a leasing ratio is the dependent variable and a debt ratio and other explanatory variables serve as independent variables.  The models account for fixed time and farm type effects.   Results strongly indicate that land leasing and debt are substitutes, albeit not dollar for dollar.  A coefficient estimate of about -0.43 on the total asset full sample model indicates that on average, leasing decreases by $0.43 for each dollar of debt incurred.  The rate at which farms substitute leasing for debt is sensitive to heterogenous farm characteristics and shifting farm business conditions.  The cross-section sample split results offer some evidence that farms which are thought to be a priori more credit constrained substitute debt for leasing at a higher rate than farms which are thought to be a priori less credit constrained. All of the sample split results however, are consistent, with the notion that in order to push the leasing ratio to higher levels, leasing must substitute for debt at increasingly higher levels.";"Ahrendsen, Bruce L.

"AGRIS:US201500014757";"CHANGES IN SOIL ORGANIC CARBON UNDER EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS IN BRAZIL: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS";"";"Proper assessment of environmental quality or degradation requires knowledge of how terrestrial C pools respond to land use change. Forest plantations offer a considerable potential to sequester C in aboveground biomass. However, their impact on initial levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) varies from strong losses to gains, possibly affecting C balances in afforestation or reforestation initiatives. We compiled paired‐plot studies on how SOC stocks under native vegetation change after planting fast‐growth Eucalyptus species in Brazil, where these plantations are becoming increasingly important. SOC changes for the 0–20 and 0–40 cm depths varied between −25 and 42 Mg ha⁻¹, following a normal distribution centered near zero. After replacing native vegetation by Eucalyptus plantations, mean SOC changes were −1·5 and 0·3 Mg ha⁻¹ for the 0–20 and 0–40 cm depths, respectively. These are very low figures in comparison to C stocks usually sequestered in aboveground biomass and were statistically nonsignificant as demonstrated by a t‐test at p < 0·05. Similar low, nonsignificant SOC changes were estimated after data were stratified into first or second rotation cycles, soil texture and biome (savanna, rainforest or grassland). Although strong SOC losses or gains effectively occurred in some cases, their underpinning causes could not be generally identified in the present work and must be ascribed in a case basis, considering the full set of environmental and management conditions. We conclude that Eucalyptus spp. plantations in average have no net effect on SOC stocks in Brazil. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Fialho, R. C.

The evidence shows that agricultural activity during the Bronze Age caused an increase in farmland and a decrease in the abundance of Artemisia grassland in the Hexi Corridor. Land degradation is probably the main cause for decreased agricultural activity and settlement abandonment. Agriculture- induced soil fertility loss and land salinization contributed to the process of land degradation. However, increasing climate aridity around 4000–3500 cal BP is probably the main initiating cause for the contraction of arable land and vegetation degradation in the Hexi Corridor.";"Xinying, Zhou

"AGRIS:US201500003884";"Does large-sized cities' urbanisation predominantly degrade environmental resources in China? Relationships between urbanisation and resources in the Changjiang Delta Region";"";"Outward expansion of urban lands in the developing nations is often associated with a substantial loss of environmental resources such as forests, wetlands, freshwater and cash crop fields. Yet, determining how different aspects of urbanisation – such as city population size and spread pattern of built-up lands – contribute to the cumulative loss of resources remains controversial. In this study, data sets were constructed describing changes to land cover across 65,200 grid cells at 1 km² spatial resolution for China's Changjiang Delta Region over the past 60 years. The results showed that the region lost 12.2% of total resource sites. The distribution of resource degradation showed a highly dispersed pattern and was not confined to a few intense areas associated with large cities. No empirical evidence was found that city population size alone accurately predicts the distribution of resource loss. Very large cities (N = 4) contributed 35% to the total loss, demonstrating impacts similar to those of much more scattered towns (N = 230). Urban expansion of large cities may lead to extensive resource loss; however, a set of non-linear mechanisms, such as the diminishing effects of per-unit area urban spread on resources and interactions between urban patterns and the size of urban spread, can also play a significant role in downsizing the negative effects of large cities on resource sites. Thus, effective urban policies should carefully weigh the cumulative urban spread mechanisms of both large and small cities responsible for spatially dispersed degradation of environmental resources.";"Kim, Saehoon

The objective of this study was to examine the land-use changes surrounding the reserve in the context of forest and nature reserve management with the aid of maps from Landsat MSS imagery of 1977 and Landsat TM imagery of 1991 and 2007. The total land area and its change over time for each land-use class were calculated and cell-by-cell change data were used to detect, quantify, and determine the trends in land-use conversions. Results showed that there were large increases in land area for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation land-use types, whereas the forest area decreased considerably. At the same time, the area under jurisdiction of townships has nearly doubled, with the largest increase in Manjiang. Land-use change was caused by regional population growth as a result of tourism development that triggered the expansion of township boundaries and contributed to shifts in forest management policy. Our study offers land and reserve managers within the CMBR and similar areas a basis for making more informed land-use and management decisions to potentially minimize detrimental ecological impacts of land-use change.";"Dai, Limin

Based on formal definitions of the expert system for Czech non-forest vegetation, 69% of the 255 samples analysed were classified as already described pioneer plant communities on shallow soils. Samples unsorted by the expert system exhibit local or transient species composition. Ordination and multiple linear regression methods were used to study the effects of adjacent habitats and environmental conditions (altitude, Direct Potential Annual Radiation Index, herb layer cover and landcover) on species richness, the cover of G. bohemica, and the cover of nitrophytes. The geographical component (i.e. two distribution centres: one in Bohemia and one in Moravia) explained more variability in species composition than local environmental conditions or the effect of adjacent habitats. The local species pool significantly enriched the species composition of plots close to artificial and non-forested areas, less so in species-poor forested areas. However, close to areas transformed by humans, the vegetation was invaded by numerous ruderal species. The low variability in species composition of one of the most species-poor grassland communities in the Czech Republic could be associated with the relic character of its habitats. The different impacts of landscape structure on habitat diversity in Bohemia and Moravia may be a result of contrasting historical processes acting in different parts of the Czech landscape.";"Černý, T.

Climate data sets at a grid cell of 0.5° × 0.5° for the entire state of Louisiana were collected from the HadCM3 model output for three climate change scenarios: B2, A2, and A1F1, that represent low, higher, and even higher greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Geo-referenced datasets including USDA-NRCS Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO), USGS Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), and the Louisiana watershed boundary data were gathered for SOC calculation at the watershed scale. A soil carbon turnover model, RothC, was used to simulate monthly changes in SOC from 2001 to 2100 under the projected temperature and precipitation changes. The simulated SOC changes in 253 watersheds from three time periods, 2001–2010, 2041–2050, and 2091–2100, were tested for the influence of the land covers and emissions scenarios using SAS PROC GLIMMIX and PDMIX800 macro to separate Tukey-Kramer (p < 0.01) adjusted means into letter comparisons. The study found that for most of the next 100� years in Louisiana, monthly mean temperature under all three emissions projections will increase; and monthly precipitation will, however, decrease. Under three emission scenarios, A1FI, A2, and B2, the mean SOC in the upper 30-cm depth of Louisiana forest soils will decrease from 33.0� t/ha in 2001 to 26.9, 28.4, and 29.2� t/ha in 2100, respectively; the mean SOC of Louisiana cropland soils will decrease from 44.4� t/ha in 2001 to 36.3, 38.4, and 39.6� t/ha in 2100, respectively; the mean SOC of Louisiana grassland soils will change from 30.7� t/ha in 2001 to 25.4, 26.6, and 27.0� t/ha in 2100, respectively. Annual SOC changes will be significantly different among the land cover classes including evergreen forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest, small grains, row crops, and pasture/hay (p < 0.0001), emissions scenarios (p < 0.0001), and their interactions (p < 0.0001).";"Zhong, Biao

From this region a total of 16,199 indigenous cases have been reported in recent years. The aim of this study was to determine the situation of the disease and provide the risk map for the area. ArcGIS9.2 was used for mapping spatial distribution of malaria incidence. Hot spots were obtained using evidence-based weighting method for transmission risk. Environmental factors including temperature, relative humidity, altitude, slope and distance to rivers were combined by weighted multi criteria evaluation for mapping malaria hazard area at the district level. Similarly, risk map was developed by overlaying weighted hazard, land use/land cover, population density, malaria incidence, development factors and intervention methods. Our results reveal that the disease mainly occurs in north and east of the study area. Consequently the district is divided into three strata. Appropriate interventions are recommended for each stratum based on national malaria policy.

"AGRIS:US201600064170";"GeoDMA—Geographic Data Mining Analyst";"";"Remote sensing images obtained by remote sensing are a key source of data for studying large-scale geographic areas. From 2013 onwards, a new generation of land remote sensing satellites from USA, China, Brazil, India and Europe will produce in 1year as much data as 5 years of the Landsat-7 satellite. Thus, the research community needs new ways to analyze large data sets of remote sensing imagery. To address this need, this paper describes a toolbox for combing land remote sensing image analysis with data mining techniques. Data mining methods are being extensively used for statistical analysis, but up to now have had limited use in remote sensing image interpretation due to the lack of appropriate tools. The toolbox described in this paper is the Geographic Data Mining Analyst (GeoDMA). It has algorithms for segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, landscape metrics and multi-temporal methods for change detection and analysis. GeoDMA uses decision-tree strategies adapted for spatial data mining. It connects remotely sensed imagery with other geographic data types using access to local or remote database. GeoDMA has methods to assess the accuracy of simulation models, as well as tools for spatio-temporal analysis, including a visualization of time-series that helps users to find patterns in cyclic events. The software includes a new approach for analyzing spatio-temporal data based on polar coordinates transformation. This method creates a set of descriptive features that improves the classification accuracy of multi-temporal image databases. GeoDMA is tightly integrated with TerraView GIS, so its users have access to all traditional GIS features. To demonstrate GeoDMA, we show two case studies on land use and land cover change.";"Körting, Thales Sehn

In particular, the error distribution and aggregation patterns of adult arboviral mosquitoes can vary significantly by species, which can statistically bias analyses of spatiotemporal-sampled predictor variables generating misinterpretation of prolific habitat surveillance locations. Currently, there is a lack of reliable and consistent measures of risk exposure based on field-sampled georeferenced explanatory covariates which can compromise quantitative predictions generated from arboviral mosquito surveillance models for implementing larval control strategies targeting productive habitats. In this research we used spatial statistics and QuickBird visible and near-infra-red data for determining trapping sites that were related to Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus species abundance and distribution in Birmingham, Alabama. Initially, a Land Use Land Cover (LULC) model was constructed from multiple spatiotemporal-sampled georeferenced predictors and the QuickBird data. A Poisson regression model with a non-homogenous, gamma-distributed mean then decomposed the data into positive and negative spatial filter eigenvectors. An autoregressive process in the error term then was used to derive the sample distribution of the Moran's I statistic for determining latent autocorrelation components in the model. Spatial filter algorithms established means, variances, distributional functions, and pairwise correlations for the predictor variables. In doing so, the eigenfunction spatial filter quantified the residual autocorrelation error in the mean response term of the model as a linear combination of various distinct Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus habitat map patterns. The analyses revealed 18–27% redundant information in the data. Prolific habitats of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus can be accurately spatially targeted based on georeferenced field-sampled count data using QuickBird data, LULC explanatory covariates, robust negative binomial regression estimates and space–time eigenfunctions.";"Jacob, Benjamin G.

"AGRIS:US201600059865";"assessment of the effectiveness of a random forest classifier for land-cover classification";"";"Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods which allow for the accurate mapping of complex land cover and land use categories. Random forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning classifier that is relatively unknown in land remote sensing and has not been evaluated thoroughly by the remote sensing community compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques. Key advantages of RF include: their non-parametric nature; high classification accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. However, the split rules for classification are unknown, therefore RF can be considered to be black box type classifier. RF provides an algorithm for estimating missing values; and flexibility to perform several types of data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning. In this paper, the performance of the RF classifier for land cover classification of a complex area is explored. Evaluation was based on several criteria: mapping accuracy, sensitivity to data set size and noise. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data captured in European spring and summer were used with auxiliary variables derived from a digital terrain model to classify 14 different land categories in the south of Spain. Results show that the RF algorithm yields accurate land cover classifications, with 92% overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.92. RF is robust to training data reduction and noise because significant differences in kappa values were only observed for data reduction and noise addition values greater than 50 and 20%, respectively. Additionally, variables that RF identified as most important for classifying land cover coincided with expectations. A McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model over a single decision tree at the 0.00001 significance level.";"Rodriguez-Galiano, V.F.

Remote sensing classification is a strictly incompatible problem, but the spectra distribution of remote sensing data has compatible attributes especially in mountainous regions, and such contradiction is one of the main reasons leading to uncertainties in remote sensing classification. In this paper, the remote sensing spectra feature compatible information is transformed into the probability of the association degree firstly, and then the matter-element theory is introduced to establish models to achieve the integrated classification of multi-source data to fuse knowledge-based geographical constrained condition probability. Taking the grassland–wetland fragile ecosystem in Ruoergai plateau of China as a case study, this paper selected the multi-source data including images of Landsat TM and CBERS, ASTER-GDEM and MODIS-NDVI to construct a comprehensive classifier, in which the relationship between topography and land cover, and the prior knowledge on vegetation growth difference were taken as constraints to support the decision-making. The classification accuracy was evaluated by a field investigation and existing land cover map. The test result shows that, the overall accuracy (89.89%) and Kappa coefficient (0.8870) are better than those derived by the Maximum Likelihood method. It indicates that the proposed classification method is not subject to the dimensionality and form of data sources, and it can integrate the data source information to improve the classification accuracy, so that it is very useful to apply multi-source data and prior knowledge to land cover classification in mountainous regions.";"Li, Ainong

"AGRIS:FR2016221951";"Stratégie des acteurs face à la multifonctionnalité : le cas de la Guadeloupe et de la Réunion";"";"The multifunctionality of agriculture promoted by the Agriculture Act is difficult to reconcile with the intensive models dominant in Guadeloupe and Reunion. This is made clear by an analysis of the management rules and practices for territorial farming contracts, intended to implement this Act. The difficulty of this reconciliation can also be observed by the impact that the statute’s application has had on its targets — production units. We conducted open or conversation interviews with institutional personnel and with farmers who have signed these contracts. Those signed so far have supported production for export from both places, markedly in Guadeloupe and less so in Reunion. In Guadeloupe, these contracts have rarely served to help develop the practices of participating farmers or to incite new projects. Technical, economic or even organizational innovations have remained more ad hoc than at Reunion. Although the objectives of these contracts have been ""deflected"", this learning process via diversion of the statute augurs well for a better adjustment to the new sustainable agriculture contracts by farmers and the institutions working with them.

La multifonctionnalité de l’agriculture promue par la loi d’orientation agricole (LOA) cohabite difficilement avec les modèles intensifs dominants en Guadeloupe et à la Réunion. L’analyse des règles et des pratiques de gestion des contrats territoriaux d’exploitation (CTE), instruments de la LOA, permet d’en rendre compte. La difficulté de cohabitation s’apprécie également par les impacts que l’application de la LOA a eus sur les unités de production, cibles de la loi. Des entretiens ouverts et non directifs ont été réalisés auprès des institutions d’une part, et auprès d’agriculteurs signataires des CTE, d’autre part. Les CTE signés ont appuyé la production pour l’exportation, de façon marquée en Guadeloupe, de manière plus nuancée à La Réunion. En Guadeloupe, ils ont rarement servi à faire évoluer les pratiques des exploitants signataires ou à susciter de nouveaux projets. Les innovations techniques, économiques ou encore organisationnelles y sont restées plus ponctuelles qu’à la Réunion. Si les objectifs des CTE ont été « détournés », le processus d’apprentissage via le contournement de la LOA augure d’une prise en main plus satisfaisante du contrat d’agriculture durable (CAD) par la profession agricole et les institutions d’accompagnement.";"Dulcire, Michel

"AGRIS:US201500217156";"Managing urban growth in a transforming China: Evidence from Beijing";"";"Managing urban growth in the current rapid urbanization process has become a key issue for land use policy in transformation China. This paper maps and assesses the performance of urban containment strategies in China, looking at the case of Beijing over a 19-year period (1990–2009). The analysis shows that to a large extent containment strategies perform well in terms of concentrating urban growth in planned suburban areas and promoting compact development. However, the unexpected growth in the rural–urban fringe and the decreased compactness of the fringes of the mixed urban areas and planned peripheral constellations caused by dispersed and illegal development suggest that the municipal containment strategies are being challenged by local development activities. Most sprawling developments at the local level are favoured by the new trend towards local autonomy and fiscal responsibility in the current transformation process. The results reveal that municipal growth control might not be achieved by all local jurisdictions when local economic motivations are involved. Particularly, urban sprawl has been fuelled by the development of urban real estate which can create significant revenues for local government and private developers. In the interest of future policy development, the management capacity of current containment strategies should be enhanced to mitigate the negative effects of market-led development in the present transformation context.";"Zhao, Pengjun";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land use planning;urbanization;urban areas";"Urban Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217156";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2010.05.004";"";"";"";"96-109"
"AGRIS:US201500217157";"Land restitution and communal property associations: The Elandskloof case";"";"Elandskloof was the first land restitution case in post-apartheid South Africa in which the government returned land to a community. The communal property association became dysfunctional, and the courts placed it under government administration. In its haste to return land to the community in the aftermath of the apartheid system the state did not set up comprehensive planning and consultative processes within government institutions, the beneficiary community and NGOs before returning the land. Consequently, the beneficiaries entertained expectations of resources that have not been met due to regulatory and institutional constraints, which have fuelled intense anger. In addition, internal community conflicts over membership eligibility and access to power and resources have bedevilled the project. The advantage of communal property associations is that they offer great flexibility in how a community can set up its land tenure system and the associated rules. However, lack of regulatory structure at the outset places great strain on a governing committee which has to create the rules, police them, judge them and administer sanctions. In Elandskloof, this occurred while the community was being reconstructed and the legitimacy of the governing committee itself was challenged. A major lesson is that the administrative structure, membership boundaries, and the land tenure rules should be established prior to land being returned to a community, and administrative powers need to be separated, at least until the community has settled. The case also raises policy questions about government administration of dysfunctional communal property associations.";"Barry, Michael";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land use planning;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217157";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2010.05.007";"";"";"";"139-150"
"AGRIS:US2012210196";"The Role of Soil Quality Criteria in Assessing Farm Performance";"";"The environmental impact of industrial agriculture is under close scrutiny, by Governments, concerned citizens, and farmers. This paper discusses the need to incorporate environmental factors in measures of farm performance, as part of the continuous review of long term sustainability. The concept of natural capital allows natural resources to be considered in similar ways to other assets of the farm business. It is suggested that soil quality criteria, selected to match the site characteristics and purpose of the landowner, be included in these measures, despite continuing disagreement about the concept and difficulties in its application. The intuitive appeal of a soil quality paradigm is the potential to integrate the many dimensions of sustainability, encouraging responsible land management. It is further suggested that soil structure is a key indicator of soil quality, and methods for its assessment are summarised.";"Southorn, Neil";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012210196";"http://purl.umn.edu/24301";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400191843";"Coherence and inconsistency of European instruments for integrated river basin management";"";"Large rivers are particularly under pressure due to multiple uses which often have severe impacts on ecosystems, or water quality and flow. Conflicting aims and a lack of integration and cooperation in planning and management are not beneficial to sustainable management. Important elements of integrated river basin management (IRBM) include both water quality aspects and floodplain and flood risk management. On the other hand, land use and land use planning are also both of great importance for sustainable river management. However, water management and land use planning are generally treated as two distinct issues in planning procedures and decision-making processes. Even water quality and flood risk issues are often handled by different authorities. Integrated management of transnational river basins is even more complicated and difficult. In Europe, there is a range of relevant Directives such as the Water Framework Directive, Floods Directive and Habitat Directive. This paper illustrates how these legal and planning instruments influence the IRBM of large rivers. It analyses the potential synergies of the goals outlined in the directives and various related measures. Coherent but also inconsistent aspects of IRBM are identified against six different dimensions: political intention, legal, geographical, management, socio-economic and sustainability. The analysis shows potentials for synergies but also potential inconsistencies. We show that directives must be carefully coordinated to ensure coherent management and that synergies and site-specific goals, such as target areas, are important for sustainable management. Possible methodologies are described. IRBM can be considered as one possible approach towards sustainable development by coordinating different policies.";"Evers, Mariele

"AGRIS:US201301891413";"Land clearing reduces gene flow in the granite outcrop-dwelling lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus";"";"An important question for the conservation of species dwelling in fragmented habitats is whether changes to the intervening landscape create a barrier to gene flow. Here, we make use of the spatial distribution of the granite outcrop-dwelling lizard, Ctenophorus ornatus, to compare inferred levels of gene flow between outcrops in a nature reserve with that between outcrops in the adjacent agricultural land. Genetic variation, relatedness and subdivision were compared within groups of individuals from different outcrops similar in size and distance apart at each site. In the agricultural land, we found significantly lower genetic variation within outcrops and greater genetic differentiation between outcrops than in the reserve. Further, the rate at which genetic divergence between outcrops increased over geographical distance was significantly greater in the agricultural land than in the reserve. We also found that individuals were more closely related within outcrops but more distantly related between outcrops in the cleared land. These effects occur over a small spatial scale with an average distance between outcrops of less than five kilometres. Thus, even though land clearing around the outcrops leaves outcrop size unchanged, it restricts gene flow, reducing genetic variation and increasing population structure, with potentially negative consequences for the long-term persistence of the lizards on these outcrops.";"Levy, Esther

"AGRIS:US201500052691";"Determination of ecosystem carbon-stock distributions in the flux footprint of an eddy-covariance tower in a coastal forest in British Columbia";"";"An important consideration when interpreting eddy-covariance (EC) flux-tower measurements is the spatial distribution of forest land surface cover and soil type within the EC flux-tower footprint. At many EC flux-tower sites, there is a range of geospatial data available with the ability to estimate the spatial distribution of forest land cover and soils. Developing methods that utilize multiple geospatial data sets will result in more thorough estimates of ecosystem C stock distributions. The objective of this study was to develop, apply, and validate methods to obtain comprehensive estimates of the spatial distribution of ecosystem C stock components from live-tree, detritus, and soil pools within an EC flux-tower footprint. First, a set of geospatial data sets was collected and assessed for its predictive ability for the measured aboveground C stocks. Next, large tree and snag aboveground C stocks were estimated using two methods: (i) a geospatial regression model, and (ii) most similar neighbor (k-MSN) spatial prediction methodology, and the results were compared with those of a multiple linear regression model using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data alone. Finally, we applied the spatial prediction methodology to estimate the spatial distribution of other C stock components (including soil C and woody debris).";"Ferster, Colin J.

We aimed at predicting wolf presence by developing a habitat model using land cover classes, livestock density and human influence (e.g. population and road density). We confirmed the presence of three wolf packs by kernel density distribution analysis of scat location data and detected their rendezvous sites by howling simulations. Wolf habitats were characterized by lower human presence and higher densities of livestock. The model, developed by binary logistic regression, included the variables livestock and road density and correctly predicted 90.7% of areas with wolf presence. Wolves avoided the closer surroundings of villages and roads, as well as the general proximity to major roads. Our results show that the availability of prey (here: livestock) is the most important factor for wolf presence and that wolves can coexist with humans even in areas of poor land cover, unless these areas are excessively fragmented by anthropogenic infrastructures.";"Eggermann, Julia
