Abstract/Description
Analysing the class character of land reform in India and Pakistan the author makes a distinction between ideology and programme. Judged by its ideology land reform in India is sharply anti‐landlord and pro‐peasant and is thus a mobiliser of peasant support for the ruling elite. The programme of land reform however serves primarily the interests of an emerging intermediate class of under‐proprietors and big peasants. This intermediate class makes a joint front with the rural poor to curb the privileges of landlords. But it makes a common cause with the landlords to thwart any prospect of agrarian radicalism turning into a pro‐poor agrarian programme. In Pakistan the conflict between the old landlords and the emerging intermediate class is not as sharply articulated as in India and land policy therefore had a more pronounced pro‐landlord bias than was the case in India. In Pakistan at best it denotes the tension between the old moribund and a new dynamic landlord class.†
The following Part II of this paper is devoted to the diversity of peasant economies focusing on the typical patterns of change included under the umbrella term of ‘modernisation’. It reviews in these terms the aspects of the peasant economy outlined in Part I. The final Part III turns to agrarian policies and the impact of state intervention on peasant economies. It discusses the aims of such interventions i.e. land reform and the major programmes of reconstruction and transition in peasant economies today: ‘betting on the strong’ collectivisation and the transformation of the peasant into a ‘modern’ farmer.
This paper is a study of the Persian land reform between 1962 and 1972. It examines the genesis of the reform its implementation and its effects with reference to the specific features of the historical development of the Iranian society. It shows that land reform has not improved the socio‐economic status of the peasantry as a whole while it has affected a large proportion of the peasants adversely. It offers theoretico‐empirical evidence that instead of creating an independent peasantry and a more autonomous urban bourgeoisie the reform has led to the further consolidation of the traditional socio‐economic power of the state over all social classes.
Analysing the actual processes and patterns of agrarian change following land reforms in India and Pakistan the author shows how radical land reform:ideology:without a radical land‐reform:programme:has:dual:consequences — beneficial for the emerging dynamic landlord or intermediate classes and agonising and unsettling for the rural poor. The latter are deprived of the elements of paternalism and security existing even within the old exploitative system without the provision of a new framework of security.:These dual consquences have been reinforced further by recent technological changes and the impetus to commercialism from these changes. The forced shift from secure to insecure feudalistic to commercial tenancy or the decline of tenancy resulting from eviction of tenants and resort to self‐cultivation by landlords coupled with growing economic differentiation between rich and poor peasants denote new and more naked sources of social tension and conflict than the old. They herald especially in India a new phase of agrarian instability in which the discontent of the rural poor may grow and cumulate and may even provide the impulse for a radical agrarian programme in tune with a radical agrarian ideology.†
The paper describes and discusses the Indian peasant uprising which took place in the Puna (high tableland) of Jujuy Province in Northern Argentina between 1872 and 1875. The origins of the revolt are to be found principally in the land tenure system and specifically in problems associated with the historical evolution of the colonial encomienda system. The role of ‘outside’ political forces in the uprising is discussed and evaluated but it is argued that the Indians’ demands for the return of their communal lands was the fundamental issue. In this respect it is suggested that the revolt should be examined within the wider context of Indian revolts and agrarian unrest which affected various parts of the Andean Highlands during the last thirty years of the nineteenth century.
This paper examines alternative formulations of agricultural surplus mobilisation and peasant economic integration in the North‐east region of Brazil. The competing hypotheses are whether recent output growth has consolidated precapitalist modes of production or has been accompanied by the increasing penetration of capitalist relations of production. It is suggested that these models give incomplete specifications of rural social structure and posit a false dilemma between capitalist and precapitalist modes of production. The evidence available on land tenure regional marketing systems labour supply and rural proletarianisation for the period 1940–70 is reviewed in analysing these issues.
In spite of the fact that the Portuguese Land Reform has been a radical and far‐reaching one it has received very little attention from British social scientists. This review article looks at three books published in Portugal since April 1974 which are essential reading for anyone interested in this subject. In understanding the development of the Land Reform and the Revolution as a whole it is important to recognise the different types of regional agrarian structure which exist in Portugal. This review pays particular attention to those parts of the three books which deal with these regional questions. The cleavage between those areas in which rural wage‐labourers predominate and those in which peasant farmers are in the majority goes a long way towards explaining both the advances and the defeats of the Portuguese Revolution.
In this note new data concerning the agrarian structure of Bangladesh are employed to test the efficacy of ceilings on the size of landholdings as a means of making land available to the landless and the near landless. The data confirm that the numbers of potential claimants for land far exceeds the potential supply even if ceilings on holdings were lowered from 100 standard bighas:(:331/3 acres) to 25 standard bighas:(:81/3 acres).

The peasantry in colonial Ghana formed as a result of the response of indigenous cultivators to integration into the world capitalist economy. Changing relationships to land to kin and to markets characterised the move from tribesmen to peasantry. Retention of ‘traditional’ land tenure consequent partly upon political activity by educated Ghanaians both ensured that Ghana would become a peasant not a plantation economy; and provided the major mechanism for stratification of the peasantry namely debt. A small class of capitalist farmers formed a weak indigenous financial/commercial sector competing with the metropolitan mercantile bourgeoisie.
The interaction between a highly capitalist land settlement and a social structure that was much too primitive gave rise to agrarian conflicts from the very beginning of colonial rule. Tensions increased sharply in the twentieth century for a multiplicity of reasons. By around the 1930s they crystallised into an organised and widespread movement led by the ‘Kisan Sabha’. The Kisan Sabha during its short life has undergone various experiences in programme formulation organisational layout and interaction with various political parties while remaining the most political force in Bihar. It was ultimately successful in bringing down the old and unsuitable settlement after the country won freedom.:But only the better‐off among the peasants could reap the benefit; the misery of the poorer section increased even though the independent government announced that it would undertake land reform measures. In the post‐colonial period differentiation of the peasantry proceeded at a fast rate and consequently agrarian movements changed in character.:Since the late 1960s the poorest section have taken action under different ideologies. They are not yet well organised but they are moving gradually in that direction. Significant progress has been made under the auspices of various parties specifically in Tundi Champaran and Bhojpur.

Pp.xxiv + 674; £22.50.:The article challenges the accepted view of Ireland as an essentially ‘western’ country where ‘modernization’ has followed with some local variations the broad western path of development. That path included a century ago thoroughgoing land reform of the sort now frequently advocated in the Third World. The article suggests instead that the colonialization of Ireland where capitalism was superimposed on an indigenous pastoralism has given rise to the same under‐development that is characteristic of all the other former colonies now comprising the Third World where as in Ireland capitalism was superimposed on an indigenous culture.
It has been asserted of Papua New Guinea that the nineteenth and twentieth century expansion of capitalism into that country occurred without the commodification of more than a small amount of land. The various arguments supporting this view are rejected and the evidence to the contrary is presented. It is shown that from the 1950s smallholder production increases have been substantial mainly but not wholly in export crops. The role of the state is examined with particular focus upon the characteristics of state power and the politics of land which have underpinned the increase in smallholder production. Similarities in the quality and application of state power across both colonial and post‐colonial regimes is stressed.

This article addresses theoretical issues concerning differentiation and class formation using North American data. It explores how socio‐economic characteristics vary and impact survival in agriculture. The study is based on panel data collected from a sample of smallholders in three Piedmont North Carolina counties. Factor analysis reveals five major dimensions of differentiation: scale household labour off‐farm family labour and income demographic characteristics and land tenure. An index of propensity to survive in agriculture constructed from three waves of panel data is regressed upon five indices measuring the underlying dimensions of differentiation. Land tenure manifests a statistically significant net effect on survival in agriculture. These empirical results support theoretical arguments in favour of integrating analyses of socio‐economic and demographic differentiation in the study of agricultural enterprises.
This article's context is the distinction inform and meaning of land tenure systems as between tribes and peasants and the role of the state in the transformation of traditionally inalienable tribal lands into alienable private property. The historical circumstances which have shaped and transformed the economy and culture of a particular tribal population ‐ the Limbus of east Nepal ‐ are examined. There is analysis of the programme of land reform introduced by the Nepalese state whose chief outcome for the Limbus was the abolition of their:kipat:tenures and the conversion of their lands into private property. The implications in terms of land and identity are considered and the outcome of heavy dependence on a small class of high caste Hindus who are now their landlords creditors and employers is outlined.
It has been consistently argued by development practitioners that the absence of rural credit from banks is one of the most debilitating aspects of African rural life. It has also been argued by historians that European bankers in Africa deliberately discriminated against rural African credit seekers. In this article we argue that over a period of three decades British bankers attempted to create lending facilities which were to be directly aimed at extending credit to West African smallholders. Bankers were prevented from doing so by the establishment in colonial law of ‘customary’ forms of land tenure overtly hostile to the recognition of African private property in land. The fear on the part of colonial officialdom was that bank credit extended on the basis of a legal recognition of private property would have a corrosive effect upon the African ‘community’. In the place of bank credit officials promoted co‐operatives which were seen as more in keeping with African society. By failing to understand that it was officialdom rather than bankers that was responsible for the failure of the creation of rural bank credit historians have been complicit in the maintainance of a ‘Fabian’ bias in much thinking about land and credit in Africa.
A major component of the economic rationale for redistributive land reform is the empirically observed inverse relation between farm size and farm productivity. A major policy implication of this statistical relationship frequently suggested is for a small farm bias in agricultural development strategy. This article examines the hypothesis that while the above inverse relation may hold in the static context of a relatively backward agriculture it breaks down with advancing levels of technological innovation and to show using primary data from village surveys that this latter process has indeed been taking place in the context of rural Egypt. The article points out some of the conceptual and methodological confusion of earlier studies.
Processes of class formation in rural Fiji have been suggested in a number of recent works. Land accumulation has been seen as a vital part of this and the effects observed have included landless‐ness and poverty. However this article suggests that the limits to such land accumulation may have been reached in some areas. Because Fiji has retained a form of communal tenure over most of its land indigenous Fijians have been able to resist continued loss of land through leasing. This is not because they are opposed to commercial agriculture or individual gain but more because their effective sovereignty over land has been lost to the state and returns to leasing are minimal.

Contrary to the mainstream economic view that unfree labour in the US ended with the Emancipation this article argues that an unfree labour system continued to dominate southern agriculture in the post Civil War period. Part I details how the southern land tenure system contract labour laws and credit system combined to create a social structure of accumulation [Edwards Gordon and Reich 1982] that effectively trapped a majority of sharecroppers in debt peonage. However unlike Ransom and Sutch [1977] I argue that it was the planter and not the merchant class who were the chief architects and beneficiaries of the unfree labour system. Part II creates a model showing how this ‘unfree’ social structure of accumulation led to the limited and skewed patterns of industrial development the low level of technological innovation in agriculture the eventual creation of a large surplus labour pool and the depressed wage rates that have characterised the American South up to the 1970s.
In this review article Robert Netting's book Smallholders Householders. Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive Sustainable Agriculture ‐ the product of a lifetime of study and fieldwork by an American anthropologist schooled in cultural ecology ‐ is considered. The book which is essentially about adaptations to population increase in different ecological contexts is dedicated to the defence of smallholders against both Right and Left. It is seen as having some several excellent qualities not least the relevance of its central stress on ecology. But it is criticised inter alia for its attempt to explain land tenure by land use rather than social struggle. The absence of any awareness of Narodnik ecological thought on the peasantry is noted.:Smallholders Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive Sustainable Agriculture:by Robert McC.

This article seeks to explore why private farming in Russia has fared so poorly even after private farming was designated the centrepiece of Russian land reform and political capital was invested in its success. The underlying causes for the lack of success extend beyond economic and social factors. While the entire agricultural sector has been adversely affected by reform policies undertaken since 1992 private farmers have been hurt the most because they were more vulnerable. Private farmers have not been successful in defending their interests because they are politically weak a fact that led them to seek out urban alliances whose interests differ from private farmers and because of intra‐rural divisions that have weakened the efforts by agrarians to defend their interests.
Although the Agrarian Reform Laws of the late 1940s were intended to preserve the rich peasant economy Chinese land reform during 1947–52 was uneven in its spatial impact. In some areas the reform was indeed a ‘wager on the strong’. But in others land reform was more egalitarian re‐distributing self‐cultivated land from rich peasants to the rural poor. New county‐level evidence suggests that this egalitarianism hampered the pace of agricultural growth in the years immediately prior to collectivisation.
This article focuses on the land reform attempts of the single‐party regime in Turkey of the mid‐1930s through the mid‐1940s culminating in the reform Law of 1945. Why the Turkish ruling elite wanted a land reform is still not adequately understood and there are a number of controversial and often contradictory interpretations. The thesis here is that despite mainstream approaches to the issue in Turkish historiography the land reform attempts during the single‐party era should be seen as part of the Kemalist project of conservative modernisation. The article argues that a variety of concerns were important in shaping the Turkish elite's thinking on land reform including an ideology of peasantism combined with a fear of rural unrest (from sharecroppers agricultural laborers and landless and land‐poor peasants); a fear also of urbanisation proletarianisation and socialist ideas; a desire to strengthen Republican nationalist ideology in the countryside as a basis of regime support (with a particular emphasis on the Kurdish issue). The conclusion presents an interpretation of the Turkish land reform that connects the long‐and short‐term causes of the land reform Law of 1945.
This article examines land restitution in the new South Africa and the intersecting roles of land‐claiming communities forcibly resettled from their land during the apartheid years and the NGOs and — since 1994 — Government Commissioners who have helped them to reclaim the land. Ideas and practices concerning land community and development that emerge from the interaction between these different players are mutually constitutive but sometimes also mutually incomprehensible. A populist rhetoric evident both ir: discussions with former land owners and in much of NGO publications such as:Land Update:depicts land as something communally owned which must be communally defended. This sense of uniformly experienced injustice and shared resistance against outside intervention obscures the fact that claims on land derive from a series of sharply differentiated historical experiences and articulate widely divergent interests such as those — in the case of the farm Doornkop for example — between former owners and their former tenants. The restitution of land to these former owners while of great importance to them as a source of identity and as a redress of past injustices is not necessarily the key to solving ‘poverty injustice and misery’ as claimed for the process of land reform in South Africa as a whole.
The focus of this article is on the land transfer programme (PTT) carried out in El Salvador over the past decade as a result of the 1992 Chapultepec Peace Accord. Building on the agrarian reforms of the 1980s the PTT beneficiaries were smallholders created by the state and drawn from ex-combatants on both sides (the FMLN the military) in the war. Among the issues considered are the forms of tenure that resulted and the agrarian debt incurred. Also examined is the socio-economic profile of the PTT beneficiaries together with their assessment of the positive/negative impact on their lives of the reform programme. Finally the achievements and failures of the PTT are evaluated in terms of the wider national/international context and the resulting contradiction between the objectives of the agrarian reform and the determinants of global markets.
Findings presented here about farmer suicides in Amravati and Yavatmal districts Maharashtra are evaluated in relation to Durkheimian theory which attributes such acts to an historically specific combination of social and economic causes. Lower and middle caste peasant smallholders found themselves trapped between enhanced aspirations generated by land reform and other post-1947 measures and the reality of neoliberalism (rising debt declining income). Suicides among large and medium farmers belonging to the higher castes in Maharashtra were occasioned by failures in business trade and politics. Such cases are consistent with the argument put forward by Durkheim that suicide is an effect of individualization a process of socio-economic ‘estrangement’ from agrarian communities experienced by rural producers in the context of rapid economic growth.
This article examines the crisis of the Jamaican peasantry. Jamaica's peasants are struggling against pressures old and new with the burden of their spatial inheritance magnified by a withering state rising food imports following trade liberalisation and oft-conflictive social relations. It begins by examining the historical formation of the peasantry after Emancipation emphasising the unevenness of the landscape and the tensions between individualism and cooperation before describing the protracted process of de-peasantisation which has sped under structural adjustment reforms. Current conditions and future prospects are assessed through the insights and experiences of peasant farmers situated on the periphery of a plantation landscape. Ultimately the future of peasant farming in Jamaica is seen to be bound up foremost in the struggle for land reform and it is hoped that the current de-stabilisation of the plantation system will provide a new window for historic change.
After considering notions of social justice as they are related to concepts of ‘development’ this article seeks to provide a regionally differentiated overview of the evolution of land tenure in Bolivia and the way arrangements for land tenure legalization have been contested and negotiated over time. It will show how the colonial ‘reciprocity pact’ which entailed recognition of indigenous tenure systems came under attack from liberalizing policies during the second half of the nineteenth century. The 1953 agrarian reform brought new arrangements and new agrarian policies that formally aimed at modernization. Yet another reform in 1996 under the aegis of neoliberalism brought a formal recognition of indigenous tenure systems which however has not yielded very satisfactory outcomes. This is due to a one-sided emphasis on tenure that disregards broader community organization and a slow and biased implementation favouring the traditionally dominant sectors.
This article traces the effects of globalisation on an export-oriented ‘hotspot’ in Chile's non-traditional agricultural export sector. Drawing on evidence from fieldwork carried out in 1994 and in 2004/5 the analysis examines the impact of neoliberal policy over the past two decades. Although the fruit export sector is seen as a key success story of the Chilean economy and is an area to which small producers are often encouraged to ‘reconvert’ it is argued here that the outcome has been land re-concentration marginalisation and proletarianisation. Small farmers become increasingly locked into dependent relationships with larger landowners and agribusiness whilst others form a rural proletariat that serves these concerns. Whilst some commentators have labelled this process ‘semi’ or ‘neo’ feudalism this article maintains that we are witnessing a deepening fragmentation of the peasantry driven by the continued development of capitalism. The gains of the earlier land reform period are being eroded as rural Chile differentiates and depeasantisation unfolds.
The focus of this analysis is the zone of the Brazilian Amazon where the greater frontier has arrived from Rondônia and Mato Grosso states where new productive systems and environmental and land colonisation policies have resulted in a complex agrarian structure. This ranges from traditional riverine peasant farms to agribusiness enterprises which co-exist or interact economically but as yet have not become embroiled in conflict. A Leninist model of agrarian transformation prevails in rice-soybeans-beef production in savannah areas and a Kautskian model in the livestock ranching of the forested areas. The latter trend may develop into a Leninist pattern in the future due to environmental policy and limits to land concession which generate land ownership concentration thereby frustrating land reform policy.
Reviewed here are two ostensibly very different books about indigenous peasantries in Ecuador each of which addresses issues arising from current indigenous mobilisation including peasant agency based on pluriculturalism and plurinationalism. Of interest are ways in which a discourse about ethnicity and gender has been and is deployed both by peasants and by the state and how republican ideals of equality have been and are utilised by ‘those below’. One book conceptualises state/peasant interaction as symbiotic and has a broadly optimistic approach about the impact and the transformative potential of contemporary indigenous politics. The other by contrast sees the same relation as uniformly exploitative and oppressive and takes a more pessimistic view insisting that without land reform any political development in rural Ecuador will necessarily count for little.
This article reviews the most recent monograph to be published on agrarian conflict in the state of Chiapas since the Zapatista uprising of 1994. In it the author combines discursive and structural analysis from the disciplines of history anthropology and geography to understand the response of regional landed elites to the agrarian mobilizations of 1994–1998. The result is an agrarian political economy which besides being a useful analysis of contemporary events constitutes a history and ethnography of land tenure landed production and agrarian struggles in Chiapas from the liberalism of the late nineteenth century through the revolutionary post-revolutionary and neo-liberal eras of the twentieth century.
The most recent land reform in Uzbekistan in which Large Farm Enterprises (LFEs) were split into medium-sized:fermer:enterprises left alongside the country's overwhelming majority of small:dekhan:peasants continued strong state intervention in agrarian production. Three ‘forms’ (rather than ‘modes’) of production emerged: (1) state-ordered production of cotton and wheat; (2) commercial production in particular of rice; and (3) household production of other food staples including wheat and rice. These production ‘forms’ or processes are characterised by distinct input and output relations terms of trade and technical requirements. They interrelate through competition for limited resources such as land water and other inputs rather than competition amongst the actors themselves (the state the new medium-sized:fermers:and the small:dekhan:peasants). A contest over resources is particularly evident between the (state-ordered) cotton crop and the (commercial) rice crop in the case study on which our argument is based namely the province of Khorezm a downstream part of the Amu Darya river basin in the western part of the country.
This paper offers a discussion of some of the features of recent land tenure debates and policies. It argues that two different orientations can be discerned: one that tends to regard land primarily as an economic asset and another that rather takes a (human) rights orientation and emphasises food and shelter security. These different orientations can be seen to be related to contrasting conceptualisations of extra-legality and different ranges of policy options when it comes to the legalisation or formalisation of land tenure and the acknowledgement of arrangements alternative to Western style individual ownership.
‘Viability’ is a key term in debates about land redistribution in southern African and beyond. It is often used to connote ‘successful’ and ‘sustainable’– but what is meant by viability in relation to land reform and how have particular conceptions of viability informed state policies and planning approaches over time? How have such notions influenced the contested politics of land and agriculture? In southern Africa policy debates have tended to focus narrowly on farm productivity and economic returns and an implicit normative model is the large-scale commercial farm. Through a review of land reform experiences in South Africa Namibia and Zimbabwe this paper critically interrogates this influential but under-examined notion. It examines contrasting framings of viability derived from neo-classical economics new institutional economics livelihoods approaches (both developmentalist and welfarist) radical political economy and Marxism and their influence in southern Africa. Through a discussion of alternative framings of viability the paper aims to help shift policy debates away from a narrow technocratic economism a perspective often backed by powerful interests towards a more plural view one more compatible with small-scale farming-based livelihoods.
There is a growing literature on the experiences of participatory democracy in Latin America. Largely focused on urban areas and municipal service provision the literature provides important lessons as to whether how and why participation works to improve the quality of democracy. In this paper I examine an unlikely case of participatory democracy: the struggle for land reform in the Brazilian countryside. Analysing the relationships between the federal agency in charge of land reform in Brazil (the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform) and the largest grassroots social movement organised to fight for the distribution of land (the Landless Movement) provides evidence of participatory democracy by default rather than by design: government officials who lack the resources and technical capacity to carry out reform are forced to rely on social movement actors who demand attention by routinely transgressing at the margins of acceptable (and legal) behaviour. At the same time the features of political life in Brazil that allow or force the Landless Movement to collaborate with the state make it difficult for individual settlers to do so. For those individuals who do not feel adequately represented by the movement and attempt to be included on their own the political system and culture continue to privilege the most powerful thereby reinforcing prior settlement inequalities.
The current global land grab is causing radical changes in the use and ownership of land. The main process driving the land grab or ‘foreignisation of space’ as highlighted in the media and the emerging literature is the production of food and biofuel for export in the aftermath of recent food and energy crises. However there are several other processes driving the land rush. In this article I argue that an analytical framework that focuses on only one or two processes that drive the global land grab offers a narrow perspective on this complex process. It will be unable to take into account the full range and extent of agrarian and social changes that occur in light of the land grab and their strategic implications for poor people's livelihoods. An important starting point is to identify the broad processes driving the current land rush and trace their structural and institutional origins. To do so I identify and examine seven factors that are giving rise to radical changes in landownership and land use in Africa Asia and Latin America. Finally ‘codes of conduct’ as proposed by several quarters in the context of global land grab are unlikely to work in favour of the poor.
This article considers the global expansion of agrofuels feedstock production from a political economy perspective. It considers and dismisses the environmental and pro-poor developmental justifications attached to agrofuels. To local populations and direct producers the specific destination of the crop as fuel food cosmetics or other final uses in faraway places is probably of less interest than the forms of (direct or indirect) appropriation of their land and the forms of their insertion or exclusion as producers in global commodity chains. Global demand for both agrofuels and food is stimulating new forms (or the resurgence of old forms) of corporate land grabbing and expropriation and of incorporation of smallholders in contracted production. Drawing both on recent studies on agrofuels expansion and on the political economy literature on agrarian transition and capitalism in agriculture this article raises the question whether ‘agrofuels capitalism’ is in any way essentially different from other forms of capitalist agrarian monocrop production and in turn whether the agrarian transitions involved require new tools of analysis.
The global political economy of biofuels emerging since 2007 appears set to intensify inequalities among the countries and rural peoples of the global South. Looking through a global political economy lens this paper analyses the consequences of proliferating biofuel alliances among multinational corporations governments and domestic producers. Since many major biofuel feedstocks – such as sugar oil palm and soy – are already entrenched in industrial agricultural and forestry production systems the authors extrapolate from patterns of production for these crops to bolster their argument that state capacities the timing of market entry existing institutions and historical state-society land tenure relations will particularly affect the potential consequences of further biofuel development. Although the impacts of biofuels vary by region and feedstock and although some agrarian communities in some countries of the global South are poised to benefit the analysis suggests that already-vulnerable people and communities will bear a disproportionate share of the costs of biofuel development particularly for biofuels from crops already embedded in industrial production systems. A core reason this paper argues is that the emerging biofuel alliances are reinforcing processes and structures that increase pressures on the ecological integrity of tropical forests and further wrest control of resources from subsistence farmers indigenous peoples and people with insecure land rights. Even the development of so-called ‘sustainable’ biofuels looks set to displace livelihoods and reinforce and extend previous waves of hardship for such marginalised peoples.
The expansion of agrofuel crops challenges us to rethink policies territories human agency and the paradigms used to explain them. In Brazil policies supporting the expansion of agrofuel crops and the intensification of agrofuel production are reorganising rural land use and undermining some forms of participation in the capitalist and family modes of production. To reflect on this new reality we study peasant movement reactions proposals and territorial disputes with agribusiness. Using the Pontal do Paranapanema region of São Paulo state as a case in point the paper analyses territorial disputes between expanding sugarcane plantations and agrarian reform settlements as well as biodiesel production projects developed by the Landless Workers Movement (MST) and the Western São Paulo Federation of Settlement and Family Farmer Associations (FAAFOP). It also analyses the agrofuel policies of other peasant organisations including Via Campesina. The production of agrofuels has changed the processes of land acquisition and use by both agribusiness and the peasantry provoking new insights into the nature of territorial conflicts and thereby stimulating the need to revise perspectives on the agrarian question in Brazil.

Placing labor at the center of the global ‘land-grab’ debate helps sharpen critical insights at two scales. At the scale of agricultural enterprises a labor perspective highlights the jobs generated and the rewards received by people who work in and around large farms. This approach guides my critical reading of the report prepared by a World Bank team that argues for large-scale land acquisition as a way to reduce poverty. Using data from within the report itself I show why poverty reduction is a very unlikely result. I develop the argument further by drawing on research in colonial and contemporary Indonesia where large-scale plantations and associated smallholder contract schemes have a long history. A labor perspective is also relevant at the national and transnational scale where it highlights the predicament of people whose labor is not needed by the global capitalist system. In much of the global South the anticipated transition from the farm to factory has not taken place and education offers no solution as vast numbers of educated people are unemployed. Unless vast numbers of jobs are created or a global basic income grant is devised to redistribute the wealth generated in highly productive but labor-displacing ventures any program that robs rural people of their foothold on the land must be firmly rejected.
‘Land grabbing’ in Africa by China and other populous high-income Asian countries such as South Korea has received considerable attention while land grabbing in post-Soviet Eurasia has gone largely unnoticed. However as this article shows foreign state and private companies are also acquiring vast areas of farmland in this region. The article first discusses the factors that make post-Soviet Eurasia such an attractive region for international investment arguably encompassing much greater agricultural land reserves than most regions of sub-Saharan Africa or Asia. Second in view of the use of media and web-based data in this article the methodological limitations of researching land investments are discussed. Third an overview is given of the processes of land accumulation and farm acquisition. Both domestic and international accumulation of land are dealt with in the domestic context of agricultural development and institutions. Furthermore the main actors (investors) involved in land grabbing are distinguished (according to their country of origin and legal or institutional form). Fourth the article outlines the main obstacles (and points of contention) concerning the emergence (and effectiveness/performance) of domestic and especially international agroholdings in the region. Some preliminary findings are presented on the possible effects of land grabbing on local populations in this region.
The most important achievements of the Communist governments in Kerala India were the implementation of the land reforms and the legislation of the Agricultural Workers' Act. Using ethnographic and archival research based on these events and the processes through which they became a reality this paper will question some of the fundamental assumptions of the influential Subaltern Studies project and postcolonial theory like the positing of governmentality and passive revolution as the general characteristics of ‘Third World’ societies' experience with modernity. It will argue that more importantly their culturalist framework with its gross ignorance of class and material concerns is hardly adequate to understand the fusing of the aspirations of recognition and redistribution or the material and cultural that characterizes the struggles by the peasantry and agrarian labor and their synthesis by the Communist Party. Despite their professed aim of inaugurating a democratic project with the peasant as citizen Subaltern Studies and postcolonial theory unlike the Communist movement do not envisage any material transformation of the agrarian classes that will actualize this objective.
This article examines the empirical facts about the actual outcome of Zimbabwe's land reform based on years of field research. It shows that the popular assumption about failed land reform in Zimbabwe is wrong on several counts: the character of Zimbabwe's land reform has been redistributive and the extent of this has been wide enough to trigger significant progressive changes in the agrarian structure. This is despite some elites having benefited from the process and foreign-owned agro-industrial estates and conservancies being retained. The distribution of land among land reform beneficiaries has been relatively uneven with some receiving larger land allocations than others and this in turn influenced the differentiated access of these groups to farming services and infrastructure. Yet the productivity of small producers has grown slowly with output escalating recently. Three decades of land reform has recast land-based social relations in important ways with the poor gaining more than previously believed.
Defining mobilization as a powerful tactic and social process enables a critical analysis of state power as well as its spatial configurations and legitimation practices. Mobilization in the site of Đi:n Biên Ph:first appeared during military confrontation (1952–54) and reappeared during land reform (1953–57) and collectivization (1959–60) all of which transformed agrarian community forms political relations and economic production – although not always as intended. Analyzing its use meaning and contingent effects on a frontier of an emerging Vietnam underlines how mobilization drew on and produced power to regulate relations of rule and production within an emerging nation-state. Drawing on historical sources and in dialog with literatures on social movements and comparative politics this paper considers a series of mobilizations to represent distinct but inter-related stages in a process of statemaking.
Land questions have invigorated agrarian studies and economic history with particular emphases on its control since Marx. Words such as ‘exclusion’ ‘alienation’ ‘expropriation’ ‘dispossession’ and ‘violence’ describe processes that animate land histories and those of resources property rights and territories created extracted produced or protected on land. Primitive and on-going forms of accumulation frontiers enclosures territories grabs and racializations have all been associated with mechanisms for land control. Agrarian environments have been transformed by processes of de-agrarianization protected area establishment urbanization migration land reform resettlement and re-peasantization. Even the classic agrarian question of how agriculture is influenced by capitalism has been reformulated multiple times at transformative conjunctures in the historical trajectories of these processes reviving and producing new debates around the importance of land control.:The authors in this collection focus primarily on new frontiers of land control and their active creation. These frontiers are sites where authorities sovereignties rights and hegemonies of the recent past have been challenged by new enclosures property regimes and territorializations producing new ‘urban-agrarian-natured’ environments comprised of new labor and production processes; new actors subjects and networks connecting them; and new legal and violent means of challenging previous land controls. Some cases augment analytic tools that had seemed to have timeless applicability with new frameworks concepts and theoretical tools.:What difference does land control make? These contributions to the debates demonstrate that the answers have been shaped by conflicts contexts histories and agency as land has been struggled over for livelihoods revenue production and power.
This study explores the links between land ownership contention private violence and the state. Colombia presents a context where criminal actors participate in the regular functioning of public institutions. The study rejects normative conceptions about the link between criminal actors and the state. Crime and violence are not considered as extraneous factors separated from the political game; they are analyzed as constitutive of logics of competition accumulation and economic development ultimately elements in the process of state formation.
This study considers how Guatemalan genocide survivors mediate their identities through property relations on a former development pole or strategic hamlet built on the ashes of a scorched earth massacre. It traces the historical trajectory of a lowlands Q'eqchi' community's land tenure from a land conflict with a plantation owner that sparked a military massacre to their resettlement under army auspices. I conclude that the community did not choose to privatize their land titles because they joined up with a neoliberal project. Rather they used individualized titles as a strategy to ward off violent dispossession. Further the study argues that spiritual leaders explained their decision to leave sacred sites unmarked on the grid of private titles as a means of protection. Today the community as a collective renews their spiritual relationship with the hill-valley spirit and seeks permission to plant on private property.
This paper argues that research into the dynamics of land control in the contemporary ‘land grab’ can benefit from engagement with the literature on booms in the production of crops like cocoa coffee fast-growing trees oil palm rubber and shrimp in Southeast Asia. This literature can help answer three key questions: who seeks to exercise control over land for the purpose of growing export-oriented crops under boom conditions; how would-be producers bring tobear regulatory power market power force and legitimation to gain control over land; and how booms differentially affect areas with secure and insecure land control relations.
Land reform land politics and resettlement in Laos have changed people's land access and livelihoods. But these reforms have also transformed political subjectivity and landed property into matters for government to a degree hitherto unknown in Laos. The control over people land and space has consolidated sovereignty in ways that make government an ineluctable part of people's relation to land. This transforms agrarian relations. Three cases demonstrate how rural small holders' access to land depends on the ways in which property and political subjects have been produced. As a consequence agovernment institution's control over land does not:represent:or:reflect:pre-existing sovereignty. It:produces:it.

Redistributive land reform and agrarian reforms since 2000 progressively changed some of Zimbabwe's agrarian relations particularly by broadening the producer and consumption base. However they fuelled new inequities in access to land and farm input and output markets. These complex structural changes are explored using a series of surveys secondary sources and official documents. Findings show that exploitative agrarian labour practices continue despite the diversification of labour towards numerous farms and other enterprises. Agricultural output declined primarily due to reduced inputs and credit supplies and frequent droughts but has been rising since 2006. Increasing export production now involves more producers driven by the diversification of agrarian merchants and contract farming. Agro-industrial capital has gradually increased its domestic operations in the supply of inputs and marketing especially after re-liberalisation in 2008. Many new farmers accumulate assets although some struggle for social reproduction. Agrarian politics now entail new struggles over agrarian markets land and labour rights.
Most commentary on Zimbabwe's land reform insists that agricultural production has almost totally collapsed that food insecurity is rife that rural economies are in precipitous decline that political ‘cronies’ have taken over the land and that farm labour has all been displaced. This paper however argues that the story is not simply one of collapse and catastrophe; it is much more nuanced and complex with successes as well as failures. The paper provides a summary of some of the key findings from a ten-year study in Masvingo province and the book:Zimbabwe's Land Reform: Myths and Realities:. The paper documents the nature of the radical transformation of agrarian structure that has occurred both nationally and within the province and the implications for agricultural production and livelihoods. A discussion of who got the land shows the diversity of new settlers many of whom have invested substantially in their new farms. An emergent group ‘middle farmers’ is identified who are producing investing and accumulating. This has important implications – both economically and politically – for the future as the final section on policy challenges discusses.
In the heat of the discussions about the fast-track land reform programme (FTLRP) in Zimbabwe little attention is given to the experience with land reform immediately following independence. Understanding these past experiences is useful to contextualize current challenges. Although the farmers resettled in the early 1980s started out in a completely different political and economic environment the challenges in establishing their farms and communities were at least to some extent very similar to those reported today. However livelihoods developed by the farmers in the old resettlement areas have been severely constrained by the macro-economic context. We argue that any discussion on the success of FTLRP should acknowledge the impact of the devastating macro-economic context on the opportunities for smallholder farmers to establish their farms and become agriculturally productive.
Women's access to land and the shaping of livelihoods after fast track land reform should be viewed with a new social and economic lens in Zimbabwe. This paper examines the extent to which negotiations and bargaining by women with the family state and traditional actors has proved to be useful in accessing land in one semi-arid district Mwenezi in southern Zimbabwe. Based on multi-site ethnography it shows the complex and innovative ways women adopted in accessing land and shaping non-permanent mobile livelihoods. I challenge the assumption that Western notions of individual rights to land are the best mechanisms for women in Africa; rather it is the negotiated and bargaining processes that exist in patriarchal structures that lead to cultural contracts enabling women's land access. Off-farm activities involving trading in South Africa became a major activity undertaken by the women. Trips to South Africa intensified due to land acquisition leading to new market searches beyond national borders. The role of collective action and women's agency in overcoming the challenges associated with trading in South Africa is examined within the ambit of the livelihoods analysis.
The fast track land redistribution programme generated new agrarian labour relations altering the tying of labour on the large farms to tenancy supplemented by casual labour from the communal areas. Job losses and displacement occurred but this is not the whole story as new and diverse sources of rural employment have emerged including high levels of self-employment on small farms (A1) supplemented by casual employment. Large farms dependent on wage labour experience labour shortages despite the mechanisation drive. However communal areas and A1 farmers continue to provide labour to large farms although labour supplies are negotiated on new terms.
Questions of who was allocated land under Zimbabwe's Fast Track land reform programme and how productive the beneficiaries have been are highly controversial. This article presents detailed empirical data on beneficiaries who were small and medium-sized commercial farms (the A2 model) in Goromonzi district land allocation processes and land use. Goromonzi District is one of the four districts that share a boundary with Harare the capital city of Zimbabwe. A questionnaire survey targeting 65 A2 beneficiaries was implemented in 2003 while key informant interviews were done in 2006. Drawing on both primary and official data the article shows that official criteria for selecting beneficiaries for A2 farms that emphasized the potential to use the land productively were ignored in practice. The institutions responsible for land allocation were captured by members of the ruling party and by representatives of the state security apparatus and most beneficiaries were drawn from the governing or the local elite. Many lacked sufficient capital to invest meaningfully in commercial agriculture did not have relevant farming experience and were unable to put the bulk of their land into production for several years. As a result in Goromonzi District the impact of Fast Track land reform on commercial agriculture has been negative.
This paper extends the analysis of Zimbabwe's Fast Track land reform to the district of Chipinge in Manicaland province in south eastern Zimbabwe where particular agro-ecological political and social dynamics are important. In the three A1 resettlement schemes studied political loyalty and patronage largely explain how the new beneficiaries acquired land. Most scholarly work media and advocacy reports acknowledge the role of political patronage in the acquisition of A2 farms but they underplay this on A1 resettlement schemes. Based on empirical data I argue that some A1 land reform beneficiaries are clients of patronage networks. Even though the new A1 farmers have other legitimate claims to land they are being subordinated to a partisan state and authoritarian ruling party that is willing to exclude other ‘ordinary’ people with ‘wrong’ or weak political ties in a highly politicised landscape. Thus the paper argues that in these cases the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)'s governing elite manipulated autochthonous historical political social reproduction and livelihoods grievances among different groups of people to set in motion a party politicised Fast Track Land Reform (Fast Track) project meant to reassert its political hegemony.
The return to ancestral lands has been at the centre of the land reform rhetoric in Zimbabwe. This argument is premised on the fact that many communities were displaced from their ancestral lands during the colonial period hence they saw the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in 2000 as an opportunity for them to ‘return’ to their old homes. This article explores and analyses the issues surrounding land disputes in one village model A1 after the land reform programme and the role played by the regime of traditional authorities in determining how belonging is negotiated. It also analyses the conflicts between autochthons and migrants over the control of the new resettlement areas and over the authority of village heads and chiefs. Claims to land based on ancestral graves and autochthony are also analysed in view of the power of political authorities in land allocation. This paper offers an analysis of the intricacies of land reform in the newly resettled areas and examines the interface between politics and traditional authority on how belonging is negotiated in these contexts. The article is largely based on qualitative interviews with resettled farmers in Gutu informal interactions as well as personal observations.
Fast track land reform led to the restructuring of agrarian relations in Zimbabwe. This paper explores the emerging forms of local agency on selected A1 farms in Goromonzi and Zvimba. It analyses how A1 beneficiaries have formed local farmer groups (LFGs) and the extent to which these have contributed towards relieving farm production challenges that include the unavailability of productive assets limited household labour and unavailability of inputs. Through case studies of local farmer groups this paper manages to examine the internal dynamics of local agency the nature of participation and the extent to which these formations actually provide a relief to members and provide the first line of defence of the newly found land rights. The findings provide important clues regarding local agency in a context where lineage forms of organisation do not exist and in most cases ‘strangers’ from different places have been resettled next to each other.
This paper examines China's overseas land-based investments in agriculture. Our hypothesis is that – despite extensive media NGO and scholarly attention to China'sglobal resource-seeking activities – the discourse on Chinese ‘land grabs’ is insufficiently informed by the available data. Moreover we argue that China's overseas land-based investments are part of what can be termed ‘developmental outsourcing’. Different from a conventional interpretation of outsourcing this concept refers to global off-shoring in which the state plays a key role in planning intervention and regulation. This paper does not aim to provide definitive answers yet intends to scrutinize the data and re-examine the ‘land grabbing’ discourse. This will be done by studying land-based investments in terms of incidence size and geographical dispersion over 1949-2011. Where relevant and possible other variables such as the investor data source investment type andoutcome will be discussed. Lastly we will also discuss the data quality and reliability.
This paper examines the domestic political economy of so-called ‘land-grabbing’ in Ethiopia assessing the motivations of the Ethiopian government which has strongly promoted foreign agricultural investment. The paper draws on a unique set of federal and regional databases detailing foreign and domestic investments in Ethiopia to analyse the likely role investment will play in the Ethiopian economy and the areas which have been targeted for investment. The analysis identifies increased foreign exchange earnings as the main likely contribution of investment but in doing so highlights concerns for food security in Ethiopia as the goal of national self-sufficiency has given way to a risky trade-based food security strategy. The paper also argues that the federal government's attempts to direct investment to sparsely-populated lowlands have important implications for the ethnic self-determination that is a key tenet of Ethiopia's federal system.
During the past two decades agrarian (‘land and farm’) reforms have been widespread in the transition economies of Eastern Europe the Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA) following earlier ones in Asia (China and Vietnam). However independent family farms did not become the predominant sector in most of Eastern Europe. A new dual (or bi-modal) agrarian structure emerged consisting of large farm enterprises (with much less social functions than they had before) and very small peasant farms or subsidiary plots. The paper compares five case studies looking at agrarian actors property rights state influence and rural poverty. These are Russia Armenia Moldova and Uzbekistan in the EECCA region and China's Xinjiang province in Asia. The paper concludes that state influence is still substantial property rights regimes are quite diverse and rural poverty remains medium to high. State-led agrarian reform in particular where a redistributive (or restitution-based) land reform was implemented led in some cases to land-based wealth redistribution but policies and institutions were lacking to support the individual farm sector. More often the outcome was a rapid transfer of land in the hands of corporate farm enterprises reversing the initial process of ‘re-peasantization’. It seems that the old ‘Soviet dream’ of mega-farm enterprises in the ‘transition to capitalism’ has regained prominence with huge agro-holdings ‘calling the shots’ providing an insecure future for agricultural workers peasants and farmers.
Across the world ‘green grabbing’ – the appropriation of land and resources for environmental ends – is an emerging process of deep and growing significance. The vigorous debate on ‘land grabbing’ already highlights instances where ‘green’ credentials are called upon to justify appropriations of land for food or fuel – as where large tracts of land are acquired not just for ‘more efficient farming’ or ‘food security’ but also to ‘alleviate pressure on forests’. In other cases however environmental green agendas are the core drivers and goals of grabs – whether linked to biodiversity conservation biocarbon sequestration biofuels ecosystem services ecotourism or ‘offsets’ related to any and all of these. In some cases these involve the wholesale alienation of land and in others the restructuring of rules and authority in the access use and management of resources that may have profoundly alienating effects. Green grabbing builds on well-known histories of colonial and neo-colonial resource alienation in the name of the environment – whether for parks forest reserves or to halt assumed destructive local practices. Yet it involves novel forms of valuation commodification and markets for pieces and aspects of nature and an extraordinary new range of actors and alliances – as pension funds and venture capitalists commodity traders and consultants GIS service providers and business entrepreneurs ecotourism companies and the military green activists and anxious consumers among others find once-unlikely common interests. This collection draws new theorisation together with cases from African Asian and Latin American settings and links critical studies of nature with critical agrarian studies to ask: To what extent and in what ways do ‘green grabs’ constitute new forms of appropriation of nature? How and when do circulations of green capital become manifest in actual appropriations on the ground – through what political and discursive dynamics? What are the implications for ecologies landscapes and livelihoods? And who is gaining and who is losing – how are agrarian social relations rights and authority being restructured and in whose interests?
‘Green grabs’ or the expropriation of land or resources for environmental purposes constitute an important component of the current global land grab explosion. We argue that international environmental institutions are increasingly cultivating the terrain for green grabbing. As sites that circulate and sanction forms of knowledge establish regulatory devices and programmatic targets and align and articulate actors with these mechanisms they structure emergent green market opportunities and practices. Drawing on the idea of primitive accumulation as a continual process we examine the 10:th:Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity as one such institution.
Biochar currently attracts technological and market optimism promising multiple wins – for climate change food security bioenergy and health – not least for African farmers. This paper examines the political-economic and discursive processes constructing biochar as a novel green commodity creating new alliances amongst scientists businesses venture capital firms and non-governmental organisations. Carbon market logics are not only threatening large-scale land grabs for biochar feedstocks but also other forms of resource labour and ecological appropriation through driving research and development and shaping small-scale pilot projects. In these soil carbon is ‘chopped out’ of its ecosystem and social contexts and revalued as exchangeable pieces of carbon nature. Farmers are hailed as green actors and market winners provided they discipline their practices according to these new technical and market logics. These discourses contrast strongly with the farmers' existing conceptual and practical repertoires; a case study from Liberia illustrates how farmers already manipulate soil carbon in creating locally valued anthropogenic dark earths but within diverse farming repertoires ontologies of human–nature interrelationship and historical and political ecologies.
While conflict-related dynamics are recognized as causes of land grabbing in Colombia violent processes of exclusion and expropriation behind ‘greener’ projects are often seen as disconnected from them. The case of ecotourism in Tayrona National Natural Park makes it possible to explore the geographies of violence that sustain tourism in the area and their role in shaping everyday resource politics. This paper shows how green pretexts of paradisiacal spots in need of protection have contributed to privatization and dispossession. Furthermore it details how land-grabbing dynamics have been enabled by processes of sociospatial demarcation that produce not-green-enough subjects as bodies-out-of-place.
This paper examines how tourism as a form of land use and economic development is a critical site of struggle over the meaning of neoliberalism landscape and land rights in northern Tanzania. I examine two tourism arrangements in Loliondo: joint ventures between expatriate-owned ecotourism companies and predominately Maasai villages; and the leasing of a hunting concession on village lands by the central government to a powerful foreign investor from the United Arab Emirates. Despite the fundamental role of foreign investors in appropriating resources and surplus value from regional landscapes in each of these cases I argue that the Maasai in Loliondo see contemporary land grabbing as firmly situated in state claims to property and territory. The Maasai in Loliondo have come to think of the market expressed through their direct relationships with ecotourism investors as the most promising space to legitimize and secure land rights and access to resources. Loliondo an area in northern Tanzania bordering the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area has become one of the most important sites for tourism development in Tanzania. This region is home to the iconic Maasai people who practice pastoralism and are part of what attracts tourists to Tanzania. These Maasai face increased pressure to assert their local vision of a landscape and their ability to commoditize it. I situate current land struggles within the political economy of tourism in Loliondo and show how different articulations of market–state–community become both materially and symbolically meaningful. Ultimately I argue that the Maasai retain faith in market-based relationships in spite of increasingly limited room to maneuver.
This paper traces a genealogy of land access and legitimization strategies culminating in the current convergence of mining and conservation in Southeast Madagascar contributing to recent debates analyzing the commonalities and interdependencies between seemingly discrete types of land acquisitions. Drawing upon research carried out near the Rio Tinto/QMM ilmenite mine in 2009 (January–March) it focuses on how local Malagasy land users are incorporated into new forms of inclusion (into the neoliberal capitalist economy) and exclusion (from land-based subsistence activities) resulting from private sector engagements in conservation and sustainability. Sustainability tropes and corporate partnerships with international conservation NGOs were found to play a part in land access in part through the neoliberal project of commodifying economically valuing and objectifying nature. Through a process of mimesis (of conservation NGOs) and alterity (‘othering’ land users) Rio Tinto's process of creating scarcity of biodiversity paradoxically lends support to the company's claim to be ‘saving’ biodiversity from local Malagasy people; this is described as a process of inversion wherein actual mining impacts are abstracted and remediated as part of a broader sustainable development strategy.
While the size and speculative nature of land transactions in the wake of energy food and climate crises have surprised observers the reasons for partial implementation of many land developments remain largely unexamined. This contribution investigates trajectories of land acquisition and enclosure by analyzing four acquisition processes in Indonesia – those associated with rice oil palm:Jatropha:and carbon sequestration – considering their implications for comparative studies elsewhere. The paper finds that current patterns of land usechange represent a continuation of ongoing land transformation processes. Itdescribes the logic leading to partial realization of large-scale schemes. Highlighting the importance of interactions between formal and vernacular rural land development processes the essay concludes that many large-scale schemes are better understood as virtual land acquisitions.
The importance of law and investment contracts in particular has been noted in recent discussions around ‘land grabbing’. This paper extends a legal analysis to what has been termed ‘green grabbing’ in this special issue and argues that the contracts that shape foreign investment in carbon sequestration projects can pose substantial material risks for governments local communities and even the environment. Investment contracts also present a formidable obstacle to the implementation of initiatives aimed at recognising the rights of forest-dwelling peoples particularly the right to participate in decision-making. The paper draws on the experience of developing countries with the negotiation of investment contracts in traditional natural resource sectors and a small number of contracts from Sub-Saharan Africa that specifically deal with carbon sequestration to illustrate the problems that may arise in this new area of foreign investment.
In recent years private companies have acquired long-term leasehold titles to more than five million hectares of what was formerly customary land in Papua New Guinea (PNG) but hardly any of this land has been devoted to production of the four green commodities in which PNG might have some comparative advantage – sustainable palm oil bio-ethanol biodiversity and carbon credits. Nearly all of it is dedicated to so-called ‘agro forestry’ projects that appear to be short-term salvage logging projects justified by the promise of a purely virtual form of large-scale agricultural production. I argue that the ‘agro foresters’ have been more successful than the green investors because of a set of political and institutional factors that distinguish PNG from many of the other countries where land grabbing has become the order of the day.
To combat climate change and hunger a number of governments foundations and aid agencies have called for a ‘New Green Revolution’. Such calls obfuscate the dynamics of the Green Revolution. Using Arrighi's analysis of capital accumulation cycles it is possible to trace a Long Green Revolution that spans the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Such an analysis illuminates commonalities in past and present Green Revolutions including their bases in class struggles and crises of accumulation modes of governance – particularly in the links between governments and philanthropic institutions – and the institutions through which truths about agricultural change were produced and became known. Such an analysis also suggests processes of continuity between the original Green Revolution and features of twenty-first-century agricultural change while providing a historical grounding in international financial capital's structural changes to help explain some of the novel features that accompany the New Green Revolution such as ‘land grabs’ patents on life and nutritionism.
This essay provides theoretical and empirical analysis of the interrelationships between land grabs primitive accumulation and accumulation by dispossession (ABD) in the context of capitalist development. Evidence from a multi-class peasant formation in deltaic Bangladesh indicates that land grabs have been propelled by interactions between neoliberal globalization state interventions power relations and peasant resistance. Key roles have been played by illegal violence and de-linking of poor peasants from production organization and clientelist relations providing access to land. Establishment of a shrimp zone for export production has led to systematic eviction of the poor backed by state power. Poor peasant resistance has shifted towards overt forms involving coalition-building and collective action. It is argued that the concept of primitive accumulation can subsume both market and non-market mechanisms as well as voluntary and involuntary transactions involving different degrees of intentionality inclusive of deliberate dispossession unintended consequences and negative externalities. Primitive accumulation and ABD correspond to distinct historical phases of capitalism and are subsumable under a:generic:concept of ongoing:capitalism-facilitating accumulation:. The dynamics of ‘actually existing capitalism’ display a:two-way:and:recursive:causal relationship in which continuing primitive accumulation is as much a:consequence:of expanding capitalist production as its:precondition:.

The most recent ‘land rush’ precipitated by the convergent ‘crises’ of fuel feed and food in 2007–2008 has heightened the debate on the consequences of land investments with widespread media coverage policy commentary and civil society engagement. This ‘land rush’ has been accompanied by a ‘literature rush’ with a fast-growing body of reports articles tables and books with varied purposes metrics and methods. Land grabbing as it is popularly called is now a hot political topic around the world discussed amongst the highest circles. This is why getting the facts right is very important and having effective methodologies for doing so is crucial. Several global initiatives have been created to aggregate information on land deals and to describe their scale character and distribution. All have contributed to building a bigger (if not always better) picture of the phenomenon but all have struggled with methodology. This:JPS:Forum identifies a profound uncertainty about what it is that is being counted questions the methods used to collate and aggregate ‘land grabs’ and calls for a second phase of land grab research which abandons the aim of deriving total numbers of hectares in favour of more specific grounded and transparent methods.
Recent research on land deals reports gigantic quantities of hectares seized with relatively little regard for the solidity of the evidence or for considerations of scale other than area. This commentary questions the usefulness of aggregating data of uneven quality and transforming it into ‘facts’. Making claims on the basis of problematic evidence does not serve agrarian and human rights activists well since it may undercut their legitimacy and make it difficult for them to identify their adversaries. Studying land tenure and corporate ownership is inherently complicated with intractable legibility problems. Social scientists must subject their sources to critical scrutiny and understand the contexts of their production preservation and dissemination. An accelerated process of dispossession is clearly in motion but countering it effectively requires precise and accurate data which are difficult to obtain. Oversimplified claims may not only undermine efforts to counter specific cases of land grabbing – and claims about land grabbing more generally – but may also divert attention from less publicized cases and from the actors behind the land grabbing. They also tend to reduce land grabbing to a quantitative problem rather than focusing on the social relations that it may or may not transform.
This article focuses on two issues. First it critically engages with the emerging global databases on large-scale land deals and the ‘data’ on global trends so far circulated paying special attention to their accuracy and reliability and the extent to which they represent an instance of ‘false precision’. The usefulness of these datasets and some of the possible side effects of their abuse or bad use are also critically explored. Second the article considers some important methodological problems that may lie behind the fast-growing research on ‘land grabs’. In particular some of the untested assumptions implicit in many of the existing studies as well as the problematic dichotomies that often influence researchers' interpretations of available evidence will be critically discussed emphasizing the need for greater ‘reflexivity’ in current ‘land grab’ research. The paper concludes that the need for methodological rigour is not a luxury but rather politically and tactically crucial from the point of view of those who campaign against real dispossession and exploitation. There is no shortcut for good quality evidence.
The Beta version of the Land Matrix (Land Matrix:2012:) was launched in April 2012 as a tool to promote public participation in building a constantly evolving database on large-scale land deals and making the data visible and understandable. The aim of the Land Matrix partnership is to promote transparency and open data in decision-making over land and investment as a step towards greater accountability. Since its launch the Land Matrix has attracted a high degree of attention and stirred some controversy. It provides valuable lessons on the challenges and benefits of promoting open data on practices that are often shrouded in secrecy. This paper critically examines the ongoing efforts by the Land Matrix partnership to build a public tool to promote greater transparency in decision-making over land and investment at a global level. It intends to provoke discussion of the extent to which such a tool can ultimately promote greater transparency and be a step towards greater accountability and improved decision-making. It will present the Land Matrix and its value addition before detailing the challenges it encountered related to the measurement of the large-scale land acquisition phenomenon. It will then specify how it intends to address these issues in order to establish a dynamic and participatory tool for open development.
The debate about ‘land grabs’ by foreign agents should not obscure the role of national governments or the accelerating process of appropriation of land by national agents. Much of the appropriated land is under forms of ‘customary’ tenure. In arguing that a fundamental problem is the denial of property in land to Africans I lay out the colonial and post-colonial reproduction of ‘customary’ tenure as not equivalent to property rights the documentation of mounting competition and conflict centring on land and the more recent threats by national and international agents. Against this background I question acceptance of an inevitable agro-industrial future which makes millions of Africans ‘surplus’ to the needs of capitalist investment.

The Merauke Integrated Food and Energy Estate (MIFEE) in Papua Indonesia is a state-led mega-project to transform local agriculture through large-scale corporate investment in food crops and biofuels for foreign markets. The project has led to extensive land dispossession accompanied by devastating social and ecological impacts. This contribution analyzes how discourse regarding food and energy crises has been employed to release land from customary tenure to a coalition of state corporate and local elite actors. The interests of these actors have converged on the state-led mega-project to transform local agriculture through large-scale corporate investment in food crops and biofuels in the name of national food security.
Customary land and forests are more embedded in the global economy than ever. With globally significant supplies of land and raw materials and favorable terms for foreign investors developing countries – particularly in Africa – have become increasingly attractive trade partners and destinations for investors. Increasing competition over land is placing new pressures on vast tracts of forest and woodland areas often considered ‘under-utilized’ by national governments despite their critical role in supporting local livelihoods. While increased demand for primary agricultural forest and mining commodities in the context of forest tenure reforms and decentralized decision-making could create unprecedented economic opportunities for forest-dependent communities increased ‘stakes’ over forest resources and land will undoubtedly heighten governance challenges. This is in no small part due to the political dynamics of property and to the role of the ‘recursive constitution of property rights and authority’ in the evolution of the modern nation-state. By identifying the social ‘stakes’ associated with different pathways through which sectoral and extra-sectoral commodities shape forests this paper provides a conceptual framework for analyzing how shifting contours of rights property and authority in the context of forest-related trade and investment shape human well-being for affected communities and the wider citizenry of host countries. It then illustrates the use of the framework through its application to two brief case studies from southern Africa: tobacco production in Malawi and copper mining in Zambia. It is hoped that this framework will provide a meaningful contribution to growing scholarship on the political dynamics of property and implications for rights-based approaches to agricultural investment and large-scale land acquisitions.
This contribution analyses how indigenous land disputes have taken place within a political process and the political responses to land tenure disputes. It does so by analysing the case of the:Comunidad Zona Lacandona:(Lacandon Community; Chiapas Mexico) and the land tenure disputes in which it has been involved during the period 1972–2012. The paper argues that the Lacandon Community (LC) has a micro-corporatist relationship with the state and that its creation has brought its beneficiaries (:comuneros:) into an ongoing dynamic of conflict and cooperation with the state fellow landed communities social and non-governmental organisations and guerrillas. By analysing its relationship with the state and the 40-year long conflict the paper presents the way in which the LC has defended its land rights within institutional channels as well as by means of contentious action. The essay also shows how conflict has been dealt with within a political process and contributes to the theoretical understanding of the categories of micro-corporatism and political process as they are employed in those cases where indigenous peoples enter into conflict over land. Data for this paper comes from interviews agrarian archives public information requests newspaper articles and ethnographies on the case study and the region.
This article shows the coexistence of the language of legal claims and the use of violence as constitutive modes of getting control over resources. Through the analysis of a specific case of land dispute east of Kabul the capital of Afghanistan we aim at revealing how local struggles are linked to broader geographies of power. Following important changes in the material conditions in Afghanistan which have led to the expansion of the city and the transformation of the rural-urban fringe territorialized power appears as a pre-condition to control the circulation of people goods and money information and ideas allowing us to add:landscapes: the circulation of land to the five categories famously distinguished by Appadurai as a way of organizing the study of the world's culture and economy.
The Rwandan government's ongoing reconfiguration of the agricultural sector seeks to facilitate increased penetration of smallholder farming systems by domestic and international capital which may include some land acquisition (‘land grabbing’) as well as contract farming arrangements. Such contracts are arranged by the state which sometimes uses coercive mechanisms and interventionist strategies to encourage agricultural investment. The Rwandan government has adapted neo-liberal tools such as ‘performance management contracts’ which make local public administrators accountable for agricultural development targets (often explicitly linked to corporate interests). Activities of international development agencies are becoming intertwined with those of the state and foreign capital so that a variety of actors and objectives are starting to collaboratively change the relations between land and labour. The global ‘land grab’ is only one aspect of broader patterns of reconfiguration of control over land labour and markets in the Global South. This paper demonstrates the ways in which the state is orienting public resources towards private interests in Rwanda through processes that have elsewhere been termed ‘control grabbing’ [Borras:et al.:2012: 402–416].
Discussions of land grabs for various purposes including environmental ends have expanded in recent years yet land grabbing remains inconsistently defined and poorly understood. Our ability to assess the extent to which land grabs are occurring and to identify the mixture of factors driving land and resource acquisition is limited. This paper assesses whether a land grab for conservation is happening in southern Chile and identifies the various driving forces that combine to drive land acquisitions in the region based on a detailed exploration of the recent massive growth in privately owned protected areas in the region. This paper finds that the various dominant definitions of land grabs each apply only partially to southern Chile that land grabs for conservation need to be understood as the latest stage in a longer process by which the region's natural resources are incorporated into the Chilean and the global economy and that green grabs interact in various ways with broader resource grabs particularly for forestry and hydroelectricity. This case study demonstrates the limitations of some definitions of land grabs particularly their focus on capitalist accumulation within land grabs their international nature and their emphasis on legal processes.
‘Meat grabbing’ describes actually existing land deals undertaken for industrial meat production either directly in the form of animal housing and stocking (confined animal feeding operations or CAFOs) or indirectly in the form of monocrop grain and oilseed production for livestock feed. Meat grabbing is also a concept for analyzing the relationships between industrial meat regimes food security politics and the global land rush relationships which have not yet been sufficiently considered in research or in policy. Using China's reform-era meat revolution as an analytical case this paper proposes meat grabbing as a concept with three broad goals: (1) to show how industrial meat complicates notions of food security and of food security land grabs (2) to incorporate social inequalities and environmental injustices into the conceptualization and measurement of land deals and (3) to expand dispossession's domain to include relationships between people and agroecosystems. This is an initial exploration of the content and framing of meat grabs intended to synthesize its core features and raise questions for further study.
Since 2007 capital markets have acquired a newfound interest in agricultural land as a portfolio investment. This phenomenon is examined through the theoretical lens of financialization. On the surface the trend resembles a sort of financialization in reverse – many new investments involve agricultural production in addition to land ownership. Farmland also fits well into current financial discourses which emphasize getting the right kind of exposure to long-term agricultural trends and ‘value investing’ in genuinely productive companies. However capital markets' current affinity for farmland also represents significant continuity with the financialization era particularly in the treatment of land as a financial asset. Capital gains are central to current farmland investments both as a source of inflation hedging growth and of potentially large speculative profits. New types of farmland investment management organizations (FIMOs) are emerging including from among large farmland operators that formerly valued land primarily as a productive asset. Finally the first tentative steps toward the securitization of farmland demonstrate the potential for a much more complete financialization of farmland in the future.
To historicize food sovereignty is not simply to recognize its multiple forms and circumstances across time and space but also to recognize its relation to the politics of capital in a crisis conjuncture. This paper traces the evolution of the food sovereignty vision from the initial stages of the food sovereignty countermovement to the present arguing that food sovereignty politics have not only traveled from countryside to city as consumers/citizens anticipate ecological constraints and compensate for unequal food distributions but also they have been confronted with transitions in the food regime following the recent food crisis. New enclosures in the forms of land grabs and value-chains administered by public-private ‘governance’ partnerships have contradictory effects: threatening the peasant base of the food sovereignty countermovement but also threatening to exacerbate the food crisis as evidenced in recent food riot politics animated by the food sovereignty vision. As the food regime restructures it reconditions the possibilities of food sovereignty politics. Arguably the ultimate historicization of food sovereignty possibility is immanent in cumulative energy and climate feedbacks.
Drawing on recent scholarship on the financialization of agro-food systems and the global land grab this paper examines new forms of financial investment in agriculture in the Canadian prairie provinces. We examine the factors underpinning investor involvement in the sector including its anticipated financial performance as well as processes of agricultural restructuring that combined with government actions to liberalize farmland ownership have facilitated the enrollment of land and labour into new financial vehicles. We focus in particular on the emergence of two new forms of investment vehicles – farmland investment funds and an exchange-traded farming corporation – comparing the business model and investment strategy of each. In doing so we highlight the ways in which the new investment patterns may propel the restructuring of the agricultural sector alter power relations among key actors and introduce new logics into the farming landscape. Our findings allow us to comment on the relevance of the land grabbing frame for making sense of the financialization of agriculture in the global North.
Food sovereignty as a counter-movement to the food regime includes a range of struggles and is evidently quite elastic as a discourse and practice. Because the food regime itself is evolving and restructuring food sovereignty embodies movement. In its ‘second generation’ phase it operates on both rural and urban fronts separately and together connecting producers workers consumers and various activist organizations. Nevertheless it is important to recognize food sovereignty's origins in the global agrarian crisis of the last three decades. Small producers (peasants farmers pastoralists fishers forest-dwellers) continue to experience massive displacement by World Trade Organization (WTO)-style ‘free trade’ overlaid with new displacements by fiat force and finance as land grabbing in various forms proceeds apace. This is a key theme in a response to Henry Bernstein's questions about the character of the food sovereignty movement.
A central figure in the food sovereignty movement is the ‘middle peasant’ a cautious figure who balances food with cash-crop production guided by a strong aversion to ecological and market risk. Drawing on long-term field research in highland Sulawesi Indonesia this article explains why farmers switched from food to mono-crop cacao production and a stable middle peasantry did not emerge. It outlines their reasons for the switch their struggles to make ends meet on small plots of poor-quality land and the rapid polarization that soon arose. Ironically their farm-dependence increased their vulnerability. Unlike farmers in many parts of the world who appear to be autonomous but are actually supported by state transfers remittances or wage work these farmers were on their own. Competitive capitalist relations quickly emerged and took on an especially virulent almost textbook form. These relations were compulsory. Farmers with inadequate plots of land and newly landless highlanders could not opt out challenging notions of food sovereignty framed in terms of liberal notions of choice. Even when small-scale farmers are untouched by land grabbing or corporate schemes as in this case expanding their capacity to exercise control over their food their farms and their futures is still a huge challenge.

Armed conflict is widely believed to disrupt agricultural production and ‘reverse’ development but it may also involve the violent transformation of rural economies from subsistence to commercial agriculture. The case of Las Pavas an estate in northern Colombia provides further evidence that armed conflict created opportunities for violent land grabs and the expansion of commercial agriculture in Colombia. However aggregate data suggest that primitive accumulation may be only part of the story behind the massive scale of forced displacement and dispossession. A research strategy that accounts for the diversity of subnational contexts processes and outcomes is needed.
At first glance rubber plantations in the Northwest of Vietnam do not appear so different from ‘large-scale land acquisition’ which is quite common in the Global South. However when we closely examine how many processes in plantations work we can see that there are many different processes at work besides those that take place in other countries where transnational or domestic corporations purchase or lease land for growing food fibre or fuel crops. Rubber plantations have been strongly supported by the government and promoted as a way to industrialize and modernize the uplands while claiming to narrow the economic gap between the uplands and lowlands. Drawing on fieldwork in two villages in Son La and on a review of policy papers and documents this paper identifies the political mechanisms and policies that have emerged as critical factors enabling the dispossession of land for the development of a market economy with a socialist orientation in Vietnam. The paper seeks to understand how institutional control over land and over the discussion of political subjects produces control. It argues that land grabs for rubber plantations in Northwest Vietnam are moves to strengthen state sovereignty. This land seizure has indeed created a new way of land governance that hitherto did not exist in Vietnam.
This contribution deals with agricultural dynamics in late-Imperial Russia. Based upon a comprehensive micro-level data set on annual yields between 1883 and 1913 we provide insight into regional differences of agricultural growth and the development prospects of Russian agriculture before WWI. Making use of the fact that contemporary Russian statistics distinguished between mostly communally governed open fields and privately owned land we are able to test the implications of different land tenure systems for agricultural yield growth. In a broader sense we seek to challenge the common narrative of Russia as an exception to the pan-European picture of economic development during the era of industrialization.
In a widely read paper the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization World Bank and others propose systematic property rights formalization as a key step in addressing the problems of irresponsible agricultural investment. This paper examines the case of Cambodia one of a number of countries where systematic land titling and large-scale land concessions have proceeded in parallel in recent years. Cambodia's experience exemplifies the challenges of the ‘formalization fix’ – the proposition that property formalization constitutes a preferable front-line defense against land grabbing – and highlights formalization's uneven geography as an issue that has yet to generate adequate discussion internationally. Three dimensions of Cambodia's less-than-successful formalization fix efforts stand out: (1) the spatial separation of systematic land titling and agribusiness concessions that emerged during the 2000s and has only recently begun to be addressed; (2) the deployment of property formalization as a means:of:land grabbing especially when applied selectively and unevenly; and (3) the political arena of efforts to legitimize ‘state land’. The paper questions the formalization fix as a policy solution and argues for both greater spatial transparency in property formalization efforts throughout the global South and greater attention to the problem of unmapped state land in general.
The dominant corporate structure of South Africa's agro-food system has led many to suggest there is limited value in redistributing land as a scarce economic resource or in providing support to black small-scale farmers when large agribusinesses are capable of meeting food needs. Agrarian reform (land reform plus black small-scale farmer support) is not a necessary component of the existing economic system in South Africa. Yet it has tremendous political importance especially in the context of a stagnant or declining job market. After considering the development of the corporate agro-food system in South Africa and its impact on agrarian reform this paper concludes that agrarian reform as a political project and a vision retains the potential to contribute not only to a more just society but also to progressive economic transformation.
This paper contributes to the discussion about ‘inclusive business models’ as alternatives to large-scale land acquisitions by analysing a case in which a foreign agribusiness investor within an impact investment paradigm acquired and rehabilitated a rice processing plant in Chókwè Mozambique. A contract farming programme drawn up to source raw produce for the factory led to radical shifts in control over land and water resources. The case is set against the background of a large-scale irrigation system that has played an important role in national agricultural policies since colonial times. The private sector-led development approach is strongly supported by the state which portrays it as an opportunity to reduce its dependency on rice imports. The investor redirected the benefits of land and water use through taking a role of coordination and control within the irrigated production system.:The ensuing rural transformation reminds one of earlier periods in the development of the irrigation system: the central control over production and the very high level of agricultural inputs and mechanisation remind one of the state socialist period while the removal of smallholders from their land and its concentration in the hands of a few bears a strong resemblance to the scheme's establishment under colonial rule.

This contribution draws on Nancy Fraser's concept of ‘participatory parity’ to analyze the reproduction and contestation of inequalities internal to land reform settlements affiliated with the Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST) located in the cacao lands of southern Bahia Brazil. These inequalities are variously manifest in unequal control over land and legal documents disparities in status and what Fraser calls ‘voice'. These circumstances help account for quantitative evidence that shows a strong preference among local landless populations for land reform organizations that are more decentralized and less hierarchically organized. These circumstances also motivate direct actions undertaken by grassroots MST settlers seeking to destabilize the conditions that ground these inequalities. This research highlights the importance of attending to local histories and interactions through which participatory disparities are christened and reproduced; indicates potential methodological consequences; and examines the interplay of transgressive action dialogue and recognition as settlers struggle to bring about ‘participatory parity' – or what they might call genuine ‘friendships' – in their communities.
Oil palm production and consumption and the trade of its multiple commodities have expanded exponentially in recent decades. This paper argues that this expansion will continue due to and along with the rise of ‘flexing’ among its increasing multiple uses especially for more industrial and energy purposes. Oil palm has been extensively analysed in the context of land grabs and agrarian change land conversion and deforestation. However its nature as a flex crop remains unexplored especially with respects to the convergence of global food fuel and environmental crises. This paper provides a preliminary discussion of how oil palm fits in the flex-crop framework to analyse its enabling material and ideational bases as well as who informs decides and controls the nature of flexing. This is done through an analysis of the different roles played by state corporate (private) and social actors in the flexing of oil palm across the globe. We conclude by drawing some implications for further research.
This article attempts to understand how control over land (power in practice) is built achieved and contested in the context of land transfers involving pressures over possession rights in Santiago del Estero in northern Argentina. Here new forms of land control – due to expansion of the speculative soy and cattle frontiers – are changing and involve new relationships while using novel mechanisms to gain and maintain control. The article adopts the notion of shifting ‘frontiers of land control’ as an analytical lens following Lund and Peluso (2011). We can say that the process of soy and cattle expansion into the new frontiers happens through a group of different mechanisms which range from voluntary purchase to violent evictions. As shifts in land control in the frontier involve pressures on possession rights we observe different mechanisms of control mainly in the direction of dispossession and enclosure. The paper adds to the debate on ‘land grabbing’ by (a) showing how domestic investors operate to advance industrial agriculture and (b) showing how this frontier advances in a context of (rather unsecured) possession rights where rights are being shifted through transfers (sales leases evictions) and compensation mechanisms as well as conflict and judicial procedures.
One of the causes of the increasing number of ecological distribution conflicts around the world is the changing metabolism of the economy in terms of growing flows of energy and materials. There are conflicts on resource extraction transport and waste disposal. Therefore there are many local complaints as shown in the Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJatlas) and other inventories. And not only complaints; there are also many successful examples of stopping projects and developing alternatives testifying to the existence of a rural and urban global movement for environmental justice. Moreover since the 1980s and 1990s this movement has developed a set of concepts and campaign slogans to describe and intervene in such conflicts. They include environmental racism popular epidemiology the environmentalism of the poor and the indigenous biopiracy tree plantations are not forests the ecological debt climate justice food sovereignty land grabbing and water justice among other concepts. These terms were born from socio-environmental activism but sometimes they have also been taken up by academic political ecologists and ecological economists who for their part have contributed other concepts to the global environmental justice movement such as ‘ecologically unequal exchange’ or the ‘ecological footprint’.

This study combines legal and anthropological approaches to investigate how the establishment of a large-scale biofuel agro-industry is reinterpreting and potentially transforming customary institutional arrangements in rural Sierra Leone. The contractual relationships established between land acquirers and local authorities can be seen as an ‘institutional innovation’ that aims at interpreting and overcoming the limits of the national land regime. However by formalizing customary land tenure structures through land registration such innovations are exacerbating pre-existing social inequalities. We identified four categories of resulting conflicts: interlineage intervillage interfamily and intergenerational conflicts. Taken together these conflicts question the current land-based sociopolitical structures of rural Sierra Leone and could be drivers of societal change.
When institutional function is disregarded in property rights reforms there may be two outcomes. One the new institution grows detached from actors’ praxis and evolves into an ‘empty institution’ allowing those governing to enforce without enforcing while those governed can continue what they did. Two the institution evolves into a ‘non-credible’ institution which may collapse or change due to rising conflict. The concepts are applied to China’s Grazing Ban a profound measure to regulate the nation’s largest land resource: grassland. A survey and interviews in 11 villages in Northwest China demonstrate that most herders feel that a ban is not appropriate for conservation. Over half perceive negative ecological change while there are complaints over adverse income effects. More than one-third admit to illegal (night-time) grazing leading to conflicts between enforcers and herders. The ban’s lack of credibility may be attributed to its disregard of the function of land for social welfare. Through an institutional analysis of grassland reforms it is demonstrated that the state's reasons to keep imposing the ban are as much driven by ecological conservation as by the need to ascertain control over a vast frontier endowed with mineral reserves and inhabited by ethnic minorities.
This paper argues that large-scale land appropriation is displacing subsistence farmers and reworking agrarian social relations in northern Ghana. The recent wave of farmland enclosure has not only resulted in heightened land scarcity but also fostered a marked social differentiation within farming communities. The dominant form of inequality is an evolving class of landless and near-landless farmers. The majority of households cope with such dynamics by deepening their own self-exploitation in the production process. The fulcrum of this self-exploitation is gendered property rights as part of the conjugal contract with men exerting a far greater monopoly over land resources than had previously been the case. Due to acute land shortages women’s rights to use land as wives mothers and daughters are becoming insecure as their vegetable plots are being reclassified as male-controlled household fields. The paper further documents the painful choices that landless farmers have to make in order to meet livelihood needs including highly disciplined yet low-waged farm labor work and sharecropping contracts. In these livelihood pathways there emerge again exploitative relations of production whereby surplus is expropriated from land-dispossessed migrant laborers and concentrated with farm owners. These dynamics produce a ‘simple reproduction squeeze’ for the land-dispossessed. Overall the paper contributes to the emerging land grabbing literature by showing geographically specific processes of change for large-scale mining operations and gendered differentiated impacts.

What are the relative pros and cons of different pathways of agricultural commercialisation in Africa? This paper examines aspects of three commercial farming cases each of which represents one of the three most dominant models of commercial agriculture – small-scale outgrowers medium-size commercial farms and a large estate – in the high-potential area of Meru County in Kenya. The paper provides a comparative perspective across the cases examining their outcomes in terms of land relations labour livelihoods and local economic linkages. The study used a mixed-methods approach including a household survey and a range of qualitative methods including detailed life histories. We find diverse dynamics across our cases: increasing land consolidation spurred by the rising class of commercial coffee farmers but also land fragmentation as a result of population pressure and prevalence of inheritance as a pathway to land acquisition in the case of horticultural outgrowers. The plantation generates relatively better paid employment for permanent skilled workers while the commercial farms create employment for casualised insecure and poorly paid seasonal labour. These labour regimes are highly gendered. The outgrowers combine family and hired labour. Across the three cases farmers diversify income between on-farm and off-farm sources. The commercial and outgrower farms are dynamically integrated into the local economy while the estate is less so. These features of the three models generate processes of social differentiation which are reshaping the agrarian structure and rural economy in Meru County.
The dynamics of customary land rights and displacement among east African pastoralists have been the subject of extensive scholarly inquiry. Displacement to make way for other land uses government-led privatization schemes endogenous subdivision to defend land against outsiders and progressive enclosure of private land in the context of the recent ‘land rush’ are some of the documented trajectories of land tenure change. Less explored is how exogenous authority systems gain traction within common property regimes to re-shape the contours of property. Laikipia Kenya presents an ideal context for this research given the uniquely ambitious effort to conserve globally significant wildlife on private land. We focus on a group ranch owned collectively by Maa-speaking pastoralists for whom formal title was secured with the support of outside actors vested in conservation and coupled with efforts to provide financial incentives for conservation. Findings suggest the new governance structure established in the context of land titling has become a pathway through which outside authority gains traction – with consequences for property sovereignty and the traction of green agendas. Findings deepen understanding of how shifting authority shapes processes of alienation and legitimation and contribute to ongoing debates about land grabs tenure formalization and neoliberal approaches to conservation.
The realisation of rights and enforcement of correlative duties through practice and politics legitimate the use of force against some to protect and fulfil the rights of others. When a conflict occurs whose rights and which rights should take priority require clarification. Land grabs represent a conflict not just between use and exchange values but also potentially between different types of rights – such as property rights and the right to the means of subsistence. In such cases it seems that the dictum ‘between equal rights force decides’ seems to be particularly applicable. This paper explores recent experiences of displaced people in the Karamoja and Teso regions of North Eastern Uganda in order to examine this phenomenon. A socially inclusive and just epistemic perspective requires that we extend our gaze to take account of the local political dynamics and impacts on and voices of people who have been displaced and how their basic rights have been affected – ‘putting the last first’. The analysis suggests that the transition to formalised property regimes based on liberal conceptions of ‘rights’ represents a case where the language of rights is usurped to serve the interests of the powerful and privileged rather than challenging social injustice.
This introduction to the collection seeks to determine to what extent the specialist regional literature on agrarian and environmental transformations in chas responded to land grab studies and how scholarship on Southeast Asia contributed to the broader field. We argue that at the centre of land grab studies is what Mara Goldman calls a ‘standardized package’ that we use to explore the ways that the field of land grab studies has been taken up in the Southeast Asian literature; the places and topics that receive the most attention and those that tend to be deemphasised and underrepresented; and efforts to critique and ‘decentre’ the global land grab and processes of land grabbing in the existing literature and in the contributions to this collection. We suggest that Southeast Asian scholars contributed to the dynamism of the field by pushing for greater nuance context and historical specificity and integration of longstanding academic theories and concerns. These efforts are part of the productive tension between opening up the range of topics and processes under study on the one hand and maintaining unity and centring of the field on the other that has been fundamental to land grab studies.
Despite centuries of state-directed eradication efforts opium cultivation persists in northern Laos and Myanmar. The most recent of these efforts is China’s Opium Replacement Program (ORP). Like other illicit crop substitution programmes the ORP seeks to provide opium cultivators with licit livelihood alternatives. Unlike other programmes it does so by supporting Chinese agribusiness investors in the region – predominantly rubber companies – instead of targeting opium producers directly. Rubber is not however economically or ecologically speaking an optimal replacement for opium. Rubber and opium have contrasting production cycles and market characteristics and are grown at different altitudes by different types of producers (large corporations and smallholders respectively). Due to this apparent mismatch critics have dismissed the ORP’s opium eradication aims viewing it as a pretext for land grabs. I argue instead that rubber makes sense as an opium replacement crop based on Chinese and Lao state views that opium is a symptom of weak state control and underdevelopment in the borderlands and rubber a tried and true modernising crop. I thus offer that the ORP attempts replacement by displacement – not necessarily by physically replacing opium fields with rubber plantations but rather by drawing land and labour into rubber away from opium.
In recent years thousands of Vietnamese migrant farmers have crossed the border into Cambodia and leased land for export-oriented rice and shrimp production. Based on case studies in two Cambodian border provinces we argue that these land transfers represent an intersection of broader processes of agrarian change that is re-shaping the Cambodian borderlands into a hybrid socio-ecological zone. Cambodian landlords and intermediaries use unequal access to politico-legal authority and the exclusionary power of the border to leverage control over their migrant tenants thereby capturing a significant portion of the surplus from the migrants’ high-value commodity production systems and potentially creating new trajectories of agrarian transition.
Recent scholarship on land grabs has begun exploring the complexity of local dynamics of land control with emphasis on the concepts of access and exclusion and the social processes that influence these two. In this paper I emphasize that a nuanced examination of broader social-ecological transformations would enrich our understanding of land control and exclusion. Drawing from field research in the Philippine province of Palawan this paper examines how the combined effects of the practices of conservation enclosures the uneven land accumulation brought about by oil palm expansion and the use of legitimizing upland discourses all contribute to social-ecological transformations in swidden and the exclusion of indigenous smallholders from benefiting from integral forms of swidden agriculture. These practices of land control and the associated social-ecological transformations are not just interconnected but also characterized by feedback mechanisms. The more smallholders decide to alter (or abandon) swidden practices participate in oil palm contract farming and/or sell their land to oil palm growers the greater the tendency for land to accumulate among migrant settlers and absentee landowners. This in turn may lead to further reduction in the availability of fallow land and exclusion of more indigenous smallholders over time.
Indonesia has a long history of land grabs before this term was coined reaching from colonial occupation to cleptocratic rule. The most recent wave of enclosures across the archipelago builds on large-scale market-oriented spatial planning. This paper shares our experience of using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to produce high-quality community controlled maps in order to challenge some of the official spatial planning processes in West Kalimantan. Developed at first as a component of action research looking at the political ecology of the Kapuas River the drone mapping soon developed its own dynamics and delivered quite impressive results in bolstering legal and political claims of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Dayak communities. We argue that relatively simple and accessible drone technology has some potential for furthering the recognition of local and indigenous people and their territorial claims. Such a view however stands in contrast to recent debates that have highlighted the limits and even detrimental social and political effects of counter-mapping. Drawing on our experience with ‘community drones’ we compare ‘traditional’ and drone counter-mapping in key dimensions of production distribution and use. This comparison helps to delimit more clearly the occasions and conditions under which drone-based counter-mapping may be a politically useful tool.
Smallholder engagement with export commodities in Southeast Asia potentially offers a more inclusive development pathway than large-scale plantation production which has been associated with the phenomenon of land grabs. This raises three questions which we explore in this paper: What are the agro-economic factors favouring or obstructing smallholders relative to plantations? What are the incentives for agribusiness firms to contribute to smallholder production other than by direct control of land? Can smallholder production be broadly inclusive in the face of internal differentiation and encroachment by external investors? We compare smallholder involvement with four cash crops which have experienced strong market demand – rubber oil palm cassava and teak – based on fieldwork in six Southeast Asian countries. We conclude that smallholder production can be a viable and inclusive strategy contingent on the case-by-case confluence of a number of key factors which we enumerate.
This article introduces the Special Issue on ‘Gender and generation in agrarian and environmental transformation in Southeast Asia’. The contributions to this collection focus on the intersecting dynamics of gender generation and class in Southeast Asian rural communities engaging with expanding capitalist relations whether in the form of large-scale corporate land acquisition or other forms of penetration of commodity economy. Gender and especially generation are relatively neglected dimensions in the literature on agrarian and environmental transformations in Southeast Asia. Drawing on key concepts in gender studies youth studies and agrarian studies the papers mark a significant step towards a gendered and ‘generationed’ analysis of capitalist expansion in rural Southeast Asia in particular from a political ecology perspective. In this article we introduce the papers and highlight the importance of bringing gender and generation in their interaction with class dynamics more squarely into agrarian and environmental transformation studies. This is key to understanding the implications of capitalist expansion for social relations of power and justice and the potential of these relations to shape the outcomes for different women and men younger and older in rural society.
Across many parts of Indonesia investment in oil palm has brought accelerated forms of land acquisition and market engagement for communities signalling far-reaching implications for equity and well-being of current and future generations. This paper uses a conjunctural feminist political ecology approach to explore gendered and generational engagements with oil palm in Indonesia. The paper compares four communities in East Kalimantan that form part of an ongoing study of the gendered impacts of large-scale and independent smallholder investments in oil palm in the context of corporate zero deforestation commitments in West and East Kalimantan. We show how different pathways of engagement with oil palm – adverse or otherwise – reflect the interplay between modes of incorporation into oil palm systems with landscape history gender life stage and ethnic identity. Whilst our findings complicate singular ‘victim’ narratives they also challenge the ‘cruel optimism’ that is accompanying the current oil palm boom.
We examine what we argue has been overlooked in the Cambodian context: the roles and practices of women in relation to men and their complementary struggles to protest land grabbing and eviction and subsequently rebuild community and state relations. We present research carried out in Cambodia in 2014–2015 in Kratie the country’s most concessioned province. Through a feminist political ecology lens we examine how protest and post-eviction community governance are defined as women’s or men’s work. Our case also reveals how ‘rebuilding’ gender relations in rural Cambodia simultaneously rebuilds uneven community and state relations.
Like that in other post-communist states Tajikistan’s agricultural decollectivization was initiated through top-down measures. However the implementation process has not been uniform across the state’s territory; in some districts collective farms were quickly and thoroughly broken up while in others the process is just now beginning. In this paper we investigate spatial variation in Tajikistan’s decollectivization process. Through analyses of diverse data we reveal that low cotton yield is a necessary condition for farm individualization in districts that are distant from the capital. We interpret this result as indicating that farm managers responsible for unproductive farms often have little incentive or capacity to resist the break-up of farms. In contrast managers of productive farms have both an incentive and the capacity to maintain collective farming. Furthermore although human capital dimensions including family size off-farm income and education affect an individual farmer’s preference for private farming these are not necessary conditions for widespread farm individualization at the district level. In other words we did not find evidence that farmers had the capacity to directly determine collective farm dissolution.
The end of the civil war in Aceh brought peace but it has been of a predatory nature. As a moment of rupture the peace revealed interests powers and dynamics and it offered an opportunity for their reconfiguration. When unrest ceased old agrarian conflicts between smallholders and planters resumed. Peace held promise of land reform. Yet old patterns of smallholder dispossession were entrenched as the former insurgency leadership aligned with the old elite of plantation companies. Oil palm contract-farming schemes effectively alienated smallholders from their land and violence precluded their organization. As a result large-scale plantation production expanded. Through the creation of a violent frontier smallholders were denied recognition of independent rights and property. In essence smallholders were dispossessed by a combination of violence political power and duplicitous paperwork. The study is based on fieldwork in areas where current land conflicts are played out as well as on secondary sources.
In 2005 Guatemalan community forest concessionaires achieved a remarkable legislative victory that reversed a green land grab in the Maya Biosphere. The fight over this space the Mirador Basin provides valuable contributions to analyses of global land grabs grassroots politics and power relations underpinning environmental governance. First the fight for the Mirador Basin illustrates how green land grabs create new natures rather than simply enclosing existing green spaces. Second it contributes to recent scholarship detailing land-grabbing practices of resistance acquiescence and incorporation ‘from below’ by describing how Maya Biosphere community forest concessionaires were able to reverse a green grab. Lastly I argue this successful reversal largely rests on the articulation and mobilization of a new rights-bearing subject – the forest concessionaire. Struggles for land in the Maya Biosphere illustrate that practices and relations of green governance do not always create disciplined neo-liberal green subjects. Rather community forestry has provided a political platform turning reserve residents into influential actors participating in the re-territorialization of power in contemporary Guatemala.
‘Green economy’ is a broad concept open to different interpretations definitions and practices ranging from the greening of current neoliberal economies to radical transformations of these economies. In Africa one emerging and powerful idea in the implementation of the green economy seems to be to use a green agenda to further strengthen development as modernization through capital-intensive land investments. This has again reinvigorated old debates about large-scale versus smallholder agriculture. Influential actors justify large-scale ‘green’ investments by the urgency for economic development as well as to offset carbon emissions and other environmental impacts. In this contribution we discuss the case of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) to give examples of how the green economy may materialize in Africa. SAGCOT is presented by the Tanzanian government as well as investors and donors as a leading African example of an ‘investment blueprint’ and as a laboratory to test green growth combining profitable farming with the safeguard of ecosystem services. In particular we discuss three Scandinavian investments within SAGCOT their social implications and their discursive representations through the public debates that these investments have generated in Scandinavia.
This contribution examines two large-scale land acquisitions on Peru’s northern coast using a ‘land–water nexus’ approach. The establishment of large sugarcane monocultures resulted in a massive transfer of land and water rights from smallholders to biofuel companies. Using Ribot and Peluso’s theory of access we demonstrate that this transfer of rights was enabled by the convergence of neoliberal land and water reforms and the presence of the two investors. This constellation (1) altered smallholders’ bundles of rights; and (2) created sharp imbalances that radically changed access to land and water not only through changing bundles of rights but also and maybe more significantly through widening the gaps between smallholders’ and biofuel companies’ bundles of powers. Using Hall et al.’s powers of exclusion approach we identify the processes both underpinning and resulting out of the changing access relations analyzed in this study. Changes to Peru’s water governance may accentuate power asymmetries between investors and smallholders constraining locals’ access to increasingly scarce water.
In considering the complex relationships between taboo culture and landscapes it is productive to examine not only how people bestow taboos onto places but also how they take them away. In this contribution I use as a case study a 35-hectare parcel of agricultural land in Madagascar where members of an extended family are debating whether or not to continue to follow their ancestral taboos while farming. Analyzing the debate alternative historical cultural and political narratives of land relationships emerge including a fraught colonial history ongoing battles over land tenure shifting community demographics and intergenerational conflicts. Overall this stretch of land illustrates that agricultural landscapes may be rendered without taboo not because they lack meaning but because they contain an excess of overlapping – and highly contentious – meanings.
While family agriculture is above all characterised by the non-separation of capital and labour the recent developments in various forms of production – the land grabbing process in particular – can be analysed from the viewpoint of capital/labour separation. In-depth research conducted in several regions of the world shows that this process is accompanied by a distribution of value added which is particularly favourable to capital holders but to the detriment of workers an imbalance which is partly due to the disconnection between salaries and productivity which is behind the profitability of these projects (the capacity to remunerate invested capitals).
Scholars are increasingly re-theorizing territory beyond the nation-state given Indigenous and Afro-descendant groups’ demands for ‘territory’ as they confront land grabbing in Latin America. Yet alternative territorialities are not limited to such ethnic groups. Based on 16 months of ethnographic research between 2011 and 2016 I explore the relational territoriality produced by a peasant ‘peace community’ in San José de Apartadó Colombia. By tracing the collective political subject produced by the Peace Community’s active production of peace through a set of spatial practices places and values which include massacre commemorations food sovereignty initiatives and Indigenous–peasant solidarity networks this contribution presents a conceptual framework for analyzing diverse territorial formations.
Farmers in Canada are older and more capitalized than ever before. Meanwhile farmland values continue to rise. These forces together are generating unprecedented shifts in farmland relations marked by increasing reliance on rental tenure and the rise of hybrid owner–renter consolidating farmers. This paper explores these dynamics in Ontario and asks how they are impacting on-farm agroecological stewardship. To do so we begin with a review of the land and property relations literature as well as farmland and agricultural change in Ontario. We then briefly review agroecological issues and concepts that are important for linking on-farm agroecological health to aformentioned farmland and agricultural changes. From here we use survey interview and soil sample data collected from grain farmers across Ontario to elucidate relatively new shifts in land tenure and use dynamics. We argue that this complex set of forces is interacting to produce an appealing set of conditions for financial investors while restricting access to farmland for less-capitalized farmers. We then show how these shifts are divesting capital and attention from agroecological health. We conclude with a reflection on how the state has been mediating and contributing to these dynamics and urgently call for land policy that prioritizes social and ecological principals.
This paper explores the political processes that activists engaged in contesting land grabbing have triggered to connect claims across borders and to international institutions regimes and processes. Through a review of cases of land-grab resistance that have led to project cancelation or suspension I argue that contextual elements of the land grab and shifting geopolitics highlight the need for adaptation and refinement of models of transnational advocacy historically structured in North–South patterns. For example while some elements of the boomerang pattern of transnational advocacy are still relevant changing realities call for new empirically enriched models. To this end I outline two typologies of political contention that can help us conceptualize multi-scalar interactions between activists to demonstrate the impact of local resistances at larger scales – ‘the catapult effect’ and the ‘minefield effect’. This paper contributes to calls for further theorization to understand how feedback processes between international discourses meso-politics and conflicts and resistance at local sites of production impact the implementation of contested land deals.
How do authoritarian populist regimes emerge within the European Union in the twenty-first century? In Hungary land grabbing by oligarchs have been one of the pillars maintaining Prime Minister Orbán’s regime. The phenomenon remains out of the public purview and meets little resistance as the regime-controlled media keeps Hungarians ‘distracted’ with ‘dangers’ inflicted by the ‘enemies of the Hungarian people’ such as refugees and the European Union. The Hungarian case calls for scholarly-activist attention to how authoritarian populism is maintained by and affects rural areas as well as how emancipation can be envisaged in such a context.
In the last two decades the industrial tree plantation (ITP) sector has expanded rapidly in southern China causing important changes in land-use and land control. It involves both domestic and transnational corporations and has provoked widespread conflict and political contestations. The villagers who are affected by the expansion of ITPs have reacted in varied and complex ways: some of the villagers were incorporated in the ITP sector while others are excluded; some have embraced the change while others have complaints; and some of the complaints remained latent while others developed into (overt or covert) forms of resistance. This paper explores how and why various social groups have responded differently to the expansion of ITPs. This paper reveals the dynamics of villagers’ inclusion and exclusion in the ITP sector covering both ‘passive’ and ‘active’ forms of inclusion and exclusion resulting in differentiated political reactions from villagers. This paper hopes to contribute towards a more comprehensive understanding of the complex engagement of villagers in changes in land use and land control not just in the most commonly studied countries in global land grabbing but inside China and in transactions that involved large foreign companies something that has so far been missed in the literature on land grabbing.
Developments in the area of ‘precision agriculture’ are creating new data points (about flows soils pests climate) that agricultural technology providers ‘grab’ aggregate compute and/or sell. Food producers now churn out food and increasingly:data:. ‘Land grabs’ on the horizon in the global south are bound up with the dynamics of data grabbing although hitherto researchers have not revealed enough about the people and projects at issue. Against this backdrop this paper examines some key issues taking shape while highlighting new frontiers for research and introducing the concept ‘data sovereignty’ which:food:sovereignty practitioners (and others) need to begin considering.
This paper analyzes frontier dynamics of land dispossessions in Ethiopia’s pastoral lowland regions. Through a case study of two sedentarization schemes in South Omo Valley we illustrate how politics of coercive sedentarization are legitimated in the ‘civilizing’ impetus of ‘improvement schemes’ for ‘backward’ pastoralists. We study sedentarization schemes that are implemented to evict pastoralist communities from grazing land to be appropriated by corporate investors. It is argued that frontier imaginations of pastoral lowlands legitimate coercive practices of ‘emptying’ the lowlands for investments. ‘Improvement schemes’ enroll private investors and enterprises affiliated with Ethiopia’s ruling party in the politics of ‘thickening’ state presence in the pastoral frontier. Agricultural extension packages serve to expand state control over sedentarized pastoralists and make lowland resources more extractable for investors and for the ruling regime.
This paper examines the factors influencing household participation in and withdrawal from a World Bank-funded voluntary resettlement scheme moving 15000 low-income farming households within and across rural districts in Malawi. Using a survey of 203 beneficiary households focus groups and in-depth interviews we identify a lack of access to land and conflict over land in the area of origin as salient participation factors in resettlement while withdrawal factors include lower access to infrastructure and poor soil quality in resettlement areas. We also highlight limited prior awareness of actual conditions in resettlement areas low and biased participation in the decision to move a greater desire for formal land titles due to loss of customary entitlement as a result of resettlement and widespread ambiguity and confusion over titles for resettled plots. In this context we point to a pattern of ‘negative resettlement’ in which households remain resettled despite major grievances for lack of an alternative option contrasting with ‘positive resettlement’ where households remain by choice. We suggest that intra-district resettlement is more likely to be successful than inter-district resettlement when there is a risk of informed consent deficiency. These findings point to the relative failures of this particular resettlement scheme and suggest possible improvements for land redistribution schemes from agro-industrial projects to poor households.
This paper situates literature on food sovereignty and land reforms in relation to academic and popular writings about land issues in Canada. We argue that settler Canadian food sovereignty scholarship and activism has yet to sufficiently grapple with the implications of private property ownership in relation to ongoing processes of settler colonialism. We also argue that efforts to advance ecologically sustainable farming practices in Canada need to confront private property ownership in terms of its contribution to both capitalist and colonial violence.
This contribution analyses how corporations involved in large-scale land acquisition respond to a countermovement of critics such as non-governmental organisations local communities peasant movements scholars and journalists. Though the countermovement rightly receives much attention its impact on corporations/investors is less discussed. International guidelines and corporate pledges to ban ‘land grabbing’ in their operations however may be signs that critics have some influence. Yet by no means has this proven to be sufficient. Starting from a study of a European agribusiness operating in Zambia this paper aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the extent to which corporations are susceptible to a countermovement.
Guatemala’s palm oil production has surged in line with the global demand for biodiesel and vegetable oil production. While corporate land grabs have been a popular concept in agrarian studies we emphasize the integral roles of the state and racially-charged political power relations enhanced by the neoliberal food regime. These power relations with racism at their core foster land control grabs occurring alongside the rise of the palm oil industry. Their effects extend beyond merely the dispossession of land. The oil palm expansion and related dispossessions mostly benefit the international markets and the wealthy ruling class comprised of creole descendants and affluent ladinos. The soaring industry has given rise to human rights violations and a lack of access to or control of various resources such as food and water. Based on fieldwork we show that dispossessed Guatemalans especially the indigenous experience rising poverty domestic food shortages and an influx of foreign foodstuffs as the meagrely paid work in the oil palm sector is only available for the few.
Tropical forests are newly valuable because of the carbon they sequester. Yet it is not clear who will benefit as a result. This article examines forest carbon’s new value in Acre Brazil. It argues that a state program (the System of Incentives for Environmental Services – SISA) shifts forest carbon’s value from land to certain forms of labor. This approach allows the government to allocate it to poorer people without access to formal land tenure a form of environmentally-premised redistribution. It also increases governmental power favors intensive land use and threatens to unmoor forest carbon from struggles for rights.
Contemporary large-scale land transactions (LSLTs) also called land grabs are historically unprecedented in their scale and pace. They have provoked robust scholarly debates yet studies of their gender-differentiated impacts remain more rare particularly when it comes to how changes in control over land and resources affect women's labor and thereby their livelihoods and well-being. Our comparative study of four LSLTs in western Ethiopia finds that the transactions led to substantial land use change including relocation and decrease in size of smallholder parcels loss of communally-held grazing lands and loss of forests. These changes had far-reaching impacts on household labor allocation the gendered division of labor and household wellbeing. But their effects on women are both more adverse and more severe expressed in terms of increased wage labor to make up for lost land and livestock more time spent gathering firewood and water from increasingly distant locations and an increased intensity of household responsibilities where male members underwent wage labor migration. These burdens led to negative psychological corporal and material effects on women living in and near transacted areas compared to their situation prior to transactions. This article both responds to the deficit in studies on the impacts of LSLTs on gendered livelihoods labor relations and wellbeing outcomes and lays the groundwork for future research.
This article explores relationships between state corporate capital and local stakeholders in the political economy of sugarcane from a gender perspective. The findings based on empirical research at the site of Tanzania’s largest sugarcane producer pre- and post-privatisation provide insights into the degree to which the estate-outgrower model can be regarded as ‘inclusive’ for women and men. Three aspects of commercial sugarcane production are analysed: land tenure labour and leadership within canegrowers’ associations. We argue that politico-economic changes in the sector post-privatisation have increased gender differentiation in sugarcane production and consolidated power in the hands of local elites.
English-language research on the contemporary global grain trade says little about Japan. Japanese firms however have made extensive overseas investments in grain production and trading since 2007 becoming major players in the soya trade between North and South America and China and the Japanese state has developed policies promoting ‘foreign agricultural investment’ in grains. This paper documents and explains these developments by exploring the legacies of earlier Japanese grain trade moves examining three visions of the relationship between foreign agricultural investment and Japan’s food security and arguing that conceptualizations of Japan as an ‘Asian land grabber’ fit awkwardly with the empirical record.
The Chinese government’s recent scheme to issue land certificates to rural households was embraced by some villages but opposed by others. This is puzzling to economists and policymakers who propose that formal property rights are essential for investment economic growth and income generation. Why did some Chinese villages accept and others resist land titling? Based on my fieldwork in three Chinese villages I argue that two important factors explain different local reactions to land titling – the impact of urbanization and the level of congruence between statutory and customary land tenure systems.
In India's contemporary model of extractive industry the Company Town has been replaced by the ‘company village.' Private sector firms throughout India's mineral belt now occupy sectors that were until recently almost exclusively state-owned. Once the great hope for India's industrial modernization and developmentalist effort extraction continues to cause immense social and environmental dislocation but now offer few avenues of employment. Operating in the resettlement colonies of those displaced by land acquisition and in peripheral villages extractive companies’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs attempt to mediate and redirect rural aspirations away from plant gates and mine sites though often with only limited success.
This article reports key findings drawing on a database containing more than 12000 protest news events in China from 2000 to 2018 including over 1500 protests against land expropriation. It finds that while social conflicts over land seizures continue to be the leading cause of protests in rural China there was an upward trend for the number of related protest between 2000 and 2014 and a downward trend between 2014 and 2018. Under Xi Jinping police were increasingly inclined to arrest and crack down on land seizure protesters. Failing to adequately deal with land disputes may undermine China's regime legitimacy.
The intersection between land grabs and climate change mitigation politics in Myanmar has created new political opportunities for scaling up expanding and deepening struggles toward ‘agrarian climate justice’. Building on the concepts of ‘political opportunities’ and ‘rural democratization’ to understand how rural politics is relevant to national regime changes in the process of deepening democracy this paper argues that scaling up beyond the local level becomes necessary to counter the concentration of power at higher levels. At the same time this vertical process is inextricable from building horizontal networks and rooting struggles in communities. By looking at national-level land policy advocacy for more just land laws accountability politics in mining at a regional level in the southern Tanintharyi region and the bottom-up establishment of local indigenous territories this paper illustrates how expanding these struggles becomes necessary but is also accompanied by potential fault-lines. These fault-lines include divergent political tendencies within the network and challenges to working in areas contested by the Burmese state and ethnic armed organizations.
Much of rural Myanmar remains under local Customary Tenure Systems (CTS) particularly in upland ethnic areas. Yet CTS lack legal recognition and are increasingly vulnerable to appropriation. This paper examines how since 2016 communities and civil society organisations (CSOs) across Shan State have organised to document their CTS as a basis for advocacy. Findings confirm CTS remain prevalent and valued but communities are experiencing increasing pressure through both gradual erosion and direct appropriation. Communities and CSOs demand statutory recognition and protections. CTS defence is perceived as a priority element of a wider political process against coercive adverse incorporation and for self-determination.
Twentieth century land reform centred on landlords tillers and a revolutionary or reform-producing state. The twenty-first century version involves a wider array of actors and diverse agendas including good governance and the mitigation of climate change. Commons co-ops and corporations figure large in the twenty-first assemblage where they enable different parties to align around a progressive neoliberal platform that sets insurrectionary demands aside to focus on what seems plausible and fundable within existing constraints. Focusing on Indonesia where land reform recommenced circa 2016 I consider both the elements that comprise the land reform assemblage and the elements excluded from it.
This article explores the nexus between old and new commons anti-politics and Corporate Social Responsibility measures in the context of on-going land grabbing. Detailed case studies in Ghana Malawi Morocco and Tanzania show that powerful discourses of development women's empowerment and wasteland productivity increase serve as anti-politics machines that hide the fact that winners are few and losers many. Despite differential bargaining power mediated by class age lineage or gender some actors manage to take advantage of the situation: contrary to the often used tragedy metaphor we argue that we are faced with an open-ended ‘drama of the commons’ which is still unfolding.
This paper highlights how farmers in a northern Lao village transformed their customary land rights – in the face of incoherent overlapping state territorialization attempts – into a territorial strategy to secure their land tenure. By planting rubber some villagers have engaged in a crop boom to lay claim to land which has recently been zoned for upland rice cultivation (and conservation) as part of a state-led land use planning initiative. We show how internal resettlement ethnic division and the influx of commercial agriculture in the Lao uplands intersect in a novel land use planning process and predetermine the plan's actual significance.
There is no doubt that Zimbabwe's Fast Track Land Reform Program resulted in repeasantization. As several studies point out it also resulted in accumulation from below by a majority of the resettled peasantry. Our study focuses on an area where counter-agrarian reform is in motion and accumulation from below is constrained. In this location we argue that repeasantization is severely being contested as indicated by the re-emergence of a dual-mode of production and the subsequent ‘virtual’ dispossession and proletarianization of the land reform beneficiaries. Our findings shed more light on the dynamics of capitalism and agrarian politics in a context where land reforms are implemented under neoliberalism. In this enclave peasants after accessing land through the land reform collectivized their land and parceled it to the downsized and nearby capitalist farming system. The capitalist farming system engages in spatio-temporal fix by moving from one rural site to another as it follows the dictates of accumulation. While the possibility of full-scale land dispossession exists the current state ownership of land and the peasantry's resistance provided some brakes to full-scale land dispossession. At the same time the state's limited support to land reform beneficiaries fuels this localized land dispossession. The peasantry's exploitation in this enclave ranges from corvee labor to coercion into the mini-land enclosures; these are implemented by village heads who are local state functionaries. This study also recasts the relevance of the Marxist framework in understanding rural dynamics more specifically; it revisits Karl Kautsky's arguments on the coexistence thesis of the peasantry and capitalist farming and illustrates the Zimbabwean state's ambivalence with regards to the conditions of peasant and capitalist farming.
This article explores whether mechanisation affects patterns of accumulation and differentiation in Zimbabwe's post land reform where policy consistently disadvantages smallholders. Is the latest mechanisation wave any different? The article considers dynamics of tractor access and accumulation trajectories across and within land use types in Mvurwi area. Larger richer and well-connected farmers draw on patronage networks to access tractors and accumulate further. Some small to medium-scale farmers generate surpluses and invest in tractors or pay for services. Thus accumulation from above and below feeds social differentiation. Tractor access remains constrained yet mechanisation is only part of the wider post-2000 story.
