"AGRIS:US2016221795";"Relationship between the cultivated land change and the population and economic development in Shandong Province since 1990";"";"According to the statistical data of Shandong Province from 1990 to 2006, we use the method of statistical analysis to analyze the dynamic relationship between the cultivated land change and the population and economic development in recent 17 years. We establish the regression model for the research on the correlation among cultivated land change, population, GDP and per capita GDP. Result shows that the cultivated land area in Shandong Province experienced three stages from slow decrease, sharp decrease to slight decrease in 1990-2006, and the per capita area of cultivated land had been decreasing gradually during the 17 years. There are significant correlation among the cultivated land area, population and per capita GDP in Shandong Province, and they can be well described by the linear regression model. The regional differences of cultivated land change in Shandong Province are significant. With the development of economic development level, the cultivated land area occupied by increasing unit economic aggregate is gradually decreasing.";"Li, Xin

Evolution of the two systems is primarily explained by variation of scarcity and land productivity. In early colonial times, Canada's economy was tightly linked to the fur trade with Indian people, while New England's economy was based more on agriculture with more intensive land use. In Canada, the focus was on the rights to timber from natural forests due to its abundant natural forests, poor road access and low productivity for farming, whereas in the US, the focus was on not just the forests but also the land as land was valuable for farming. While we emphasize the differences in scarcity in timber and timberland as the main cause of the disparity of the forestland tenure systems between the two countries, some legal and political factors are also explored.";"Zhang, Y.

This study looks for answers to this puzzle by reviewing a large number of empirical studies in a wide variety of contexts. The kinds of local skills and expertise that are important for good timber concession management, how local people and concession managers can construct mutually profitable relationships, the most effective strategies used by communities to defend their claims in conflicts with private firms, and the types of public policies that are supportive of more equitable terms of cooperation in forest concession management are issues that were examined in the review. Institutional arrangements that regulate the relationship between local communities and forest concessionaires, and particularly the distribution of de jure property rights, help explain the mixed results. Less conclusive evidence exists with regards to community perspectives on concession-community relationships. The study concludes by suggesting future directions for research and discusses the implications of the findings for public policy.";"Ravikumar, A.

"AGRIS:US201500162665";"Effects of urbanization and industrialization on agricultural land use in Shandong Peninsula of China";"";"China is the most populated country in the world with slightly more than half of the population is still living in rural areas. In the past couple of decades, rapid urbanization and industrialization have significantly changed the land use/land cover (LULC) pattern in rural areas, particularly those around the big cities in eastern China. Shandong Peninsula, a traditional agriculture area, also has witnessed rapid urbanization and industrialization. Analysis of land use/land cover change in this area, specially the change of agricultural lands, would help us better understand the interaction between government's policies and farmers’ economic interests. This paper developed a method to extract single-cropping land, double-cropping land and other land use/land cover categories for 1978, 1999 and 2006 from seasonal variations in Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) during a crop calendar year. Spatial analysis results indicated significant changes of arable lands and other land use/land cover categories due to the urbanization and industrialization. The most possible reason is due to the continuous adjustment of government's policies and shift of farmer's economic interests. Results from this study would help government make wise decisions in the near future to mitigate urban sprawl and industrial development while maintain enough agricultural production.";"Lu, Qingshui

"AGRIS:US201400171642";"Managing private forestlands along the public–private interface of Southern Illinois: Landowner forestry decisions in a multi-jurisdictional landscape";"";"Private forest landowners in the southernmost region of Illinois operate within a multijurisdictional, intermixed public–private landscape. As such, they operate within the context of traditionally studied drivers of forest management on private lands, but also manage their lands within the context of the contentious debate about how the Shawnee National Forest is managed. We posited that this debate about the management of public land could affect forest management actions on private parcels. We also studied the effects of traditional drivers in private forest landowner research: land characteristics, demographics, and landowner objectives. Mail survey results for private forest landowners in the southernmost 11 counties of Illinois were used to examine the factors influencing the adoption of four actions: seeking advice from a forester, obtaining a written forest management plan, doing a commercial timber harvest, and implementing timber stand improvement. Results highlighted that traditional personal factors—financial objectives and parcel size—were strongly related to forest landowner management action adoption. Landowners' actions were largely independent of proximity to the Shawnee National Forest and largely independent of overall satisfaction with Shawnee National Forest management. In the context of decreasing parcel size and generally low financial objectives for private forestland parcels, we emphasize the need for policy and practice to better adapt to address these trends in order to maintain sustainable forest management across the landscape.";"Hendee, Jacob T.

The analysis employs the broader framework provided by empirical growth literature and recent developments in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) measurement to search for fundamental determinants of growth in African agriculture. One main contribution and new findings in this analysis is the quantification of the contribution of the productivity growth and the contribution of different inputs such as land, labor, tractor and fertilizer in the agricultural growth. Growth accounting computation highlights the fact that factor accumulation rather than TFP accounts for a large share of agricultural output growth and fertilizer has been the most statistically important physical input contributor to agricultural growth. The study also highlights the extent to which agricultural growth contributors vary in relation with different country conditions, institutions and politico-historical factors.";"Nkamleu, Guy Blaise";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-11-31";"en";"";"";"";"002";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204591";"http://purl.umn.edu/52108";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400065373";"framework for national assessment of land degradation in the drylands: a case study of somalia";"";"Land degradation is a gradual, negative environmental process that is accelerated by human activities. Its gradual nature allows degradation to proceed unnoticed, thus reducing the likelihood of appropriate and timely control action. Presently, there are few practical frameworks to help countries design national strategies and policies for its control. The study presented here developed a framework for the national assessment of land degradation. This framework is envisaged to support governments in formulating policies on land degradation. It uses time‐series remote sensing data to identify the rate and extent of land degradation, local experts to identify prevalent degradation types and drivers of the degradation and field observations to validate the overall assessment. Its simplicity, use of freely downloadable input data and self‐triangulation of the assessment methods make it suitable for rapid assessment of land degradation on a national scale. It was tested in Somalia, where it exhibited accuracy greater than 60 per cent when assessing land degradation. This framework is relevant for designing national strategies and policies that address land degradation and provides an opportunity for accurate identification of areas to target with comprehensive local assessment. Testing of the framework in Somalia showed that about one‐third of the country was degraded because of loss of vegetation cover, topsoil loss and to the decline of soil moisture. Overgrazing, excessive tree cutting and poor agronomic practices in agricultural areas were identified as the primary drivers of the country's land degradation. These drivers are encouraged by the prevailing communal land tenure practices, poor governance and civil war. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Omuto, C. T.

"AGRIS:US2016203243";"Household Food Security in a Subsistence Economy: Application of Translog Cost Function to Cross-sectional data in Vihiga District, Kenya";"";"Vihiga, one of the poorest and densely populated districts in Kenya is perpetually food deficit (GOK, 2005). While food demand continued to rise, production fell behind both targeted production and district demand. To make matters worse food deficit situation worsened over the last decade. Rising population and competition for resources have curtailed efforts to improve household food production in the district. Unfavorable poverty indicators in the district only make matters worse. About 57.6 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of households live below absolute poverty line while 57 percent of the population and households live below food poverty line (GOK, 2005). Poor welfare indicators for Vihiga district underscore the importance and urgency for addressing its basic needs. Understanding determinants of food security in Vihiga district will improve targeting, the focus and success of policies for addressing food insecurity. The paper examines food security in a subsistence economy with an application of a Translog cost function to household survey data in Vihiga district to determine the supply side constraints. Cluster sampling was used with divisions forming the main clusters in the district. Using systematic random sampling, 50 households were selected from each cluster resulting in a sample of 300.  Results show that scale of production, number of adults, household head, business income, employment; human resource development, capital, and land size significantly influence household food security. Food security programmes, in subsistence economies, aimed at revamping production should focus more on enhancing accessibility to production resources and improving the quality of labor through training.Key Words: Food security, Translog cost function, Vihiga, Kenya";"Nyangweso, P.M.

A Watershed-scale Sensitivity Analysis";"";"Complex relationships between landscape and aquatic habitat conditions and salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations make science-based management decisions both difficult and essential. Due to a paucity of empirical data, models characterizing these relationships are often used to forecast future conditions. We evaluated uncertainties in a suite of models that predict possible future habitat conditions and fish responses in the Lewis River Basin, Washington, USA. We evaluated sensitivities of predictions to uncertainty in model parameters. Results were sensitive to 60% of model parameters but substantially so (|partial regression coefficients| >0.5) to <10%. We also estimated accuracy of several predictions using field surveys. Observations mostly fell within predicted ranges for riparian shade and fine-sediment deposition, but large woody debris estimates matched only half the time. We provide suggestions to modelers for improving model accountability, and describe how managers can incorporate prediction uncertainty into decision-making, thereby improving the odds of successful salmon habitat recovery.";"Fullerton, A.

The input data include a multispectral high resolution digital image and a vector file in shapefile format containing the polygons or objects, usually extracted from a geospatial database. The design of the available descriptive features or attributes has been mainly focused on the description of agricultural parcels, providing a variety of information: spectral information from the different image bands; textural descriptors of the distribution of the intensity values based on the grey level co-occurrence matrix, the wavelet transform and a factor of edgeness; structural features describing the spatial arrangement of the elements inside the objects, based on the semivariogram curve and the Hough transform; and several descriptors of the object shape. The output file is a table that can be produced in four alternative formats, containing a vector of features for every object processed. This table of numeric values describing the objects from different points of view can be externally used as input data for any classification software. Additionally, several types of graphs and images describing the feature extraction procedure are produced, useful for interpretation and understanding the process. A test of the processing times is included, as well as an application of the program in a real parcel-based classification problem, providing some results and analyzing the applicability, the future improvement of the methodologies, and the use of additional types of data sets. This software is intended to be a dynamic tool, integrating further data and feature extraction algorithms for the progressive improvement of land use/land cover database classification and agricultural database updating processes.";"Ruiz, L.A.

The goal of this article is to introduce support vector machine (SVM) methods capable of handling missing data in land-cover classification. The novelty of this article consists of combining the powerful SVM regularization framework with a recent statistical theory of missing data, resulting in a new method where an SVM is trained for each missing data pattern, and a given incomplete test vector is classified by selecting the corresponding SVM model. The SVM classifiers are evaluated on Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ) images covering a scene of Norwegian mountain vegetation. The results show that the proposed SVM-based classifier improves the classification accuracy by 5–10% compared with single image classification. The proposed SVM classifier also outperforms recent non-parametric k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) and Parzen window density-based classifiers for incomplete data by about 3%. Moreover, since the resulting SVM classifier may easily be implemented using existing SVM libraries, we consider the new method to be an attractive choice for classification of incomplete data in remote sensing.";"Salberg, Arnt-Børre

"AGRIS:US201400107255";"Object-based change detection";"";"Characterizations of land-cover dynamics are among the most important applications of Earth observation data, providing insights into management, policy and science. Recent progress in remote sensing and associated digital image processing offers unprecedented opportunities to detect changes in land cover more accurately over increasingly large areas, with diminishing costs and processing time. The advent of high-spatial-resolution remote-sensing imagery further provides opportunities to apply change detection with object-based image analysis (OBIA), that is, object-based change detection (OBCD). When compared with the traditional pixel-based change paradigm, OBCD has the ability to improve the identification of changes for the geographic entities found over a given landscape. In this article, we present an overview of the main issues in change detection, followed by the motivations for using OBCD as compared to pixel-based approaches. We also discuss the challenges caused by the use of objects in change detection and provide a conceptual overview of solutions, which are followed by a detailed review of current OBCD algorithms. In particular, OBCD offers unique approaches and methods for exploiting high-spatial-resolution imagery, to capture meaningful detailed change information in a systematic and repeatable manner, corresponding to a wide range of information needs.";"Chen, Gang

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW) CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) measurements are employed to invert the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) Rahman–Pinty–Verstraete (RPV) model for regions identified with the same IGBP type. The inversion of this non-linear parametric model is optimized to improve the computation efficiency and merged into a radiative transfer model to correct the surface radiances for the atmospheric effect. Analysis of the nature of the reflectance field simulated for several regions selected for every IGBP type determines whether the creation of general BRF models for surfaces defined by the same IGBP land cover is feasible. According to the results gathered in this study, the BB BRDFs for regions classified by the IGBP classification show values for the coefficient of variation (CV) between 3.5% and 44.1%. Consequently, the high differences achieved in the reflectance fields discourage the creation of BRDFs based on the IGBP land types.";"Domenech, Carlos

"AGRIS:US2016216813";"Empirical methods for determining a reserve price in conservation auctions";"";"Conservation auctions are increasingly being used to procure publicenvironmental goods on private land. In the absence of demand-sideprice information, the majority of conservation auctions in Australia havebeen designed without a reserve price. In these instances bids have beenaccepted in order of cost-effectiveness until the budget constraint binds. Itis widely recognised that in situations where auctions are run repeatedlya reserve price strategy could allow for a more efficient allocation of fundsacross multiple rounds, both spatially and temporally.This paper provides a brief overview of methods for determining areserve price for application in conservation auctions. It is concluded thatinformation deficiencies and the high transaction costs involved in theapplication of these methods to conservation auctions often render themunsuitable for application to real-world auctions.This paper presents an empirical approach to determining a reserveprice using data obtained during an auction - the supply curve. Theapproach stems from the C4.5 algorithm, developed in the field ofdata mining to construct decision trees from training data using theconcept of information entropy. The algorithm establishes a reserve priceby determining the cut-off price that results in the ”best fit” of twonormal distributions to the frequency distribution of bid-price per unitenvironmental benefit.Empirical data from conservation auctions in Victoria is used todemonstrate the algorithm and compare auction results obtained usingthe algorithm and traditional ”budget” methods. The paper presents adiscussion on the situations where the algorithm could be appropriatelyused, and advantages and limitations of the approach are identified. Thepaper concludes that the use of the algorithm can result in efficiency gainsover the traditional budget method in situations where alternative reserveprice strategies are impractical.";"Eigenraam, Mark

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine the weight of evaluation index in research region. Taking the index numerical value of Hubei Province as the standard value, index value of the research region is evaluated. Combining with the index weight obtained by AHP, urban land intensive use is evaluated by the weighted average. Result shows that land intensive use level of Zhongxiang City is much lower than the average level of Hubei Province. Therefore, urban land of Zhongxiang City is of is great potential. Insufficient input is one of the major factors restricting the land use intensity, so the input in urban land of Zhongxiang City should be increased. Land use intensity of Zhongxiang City is relatively low and needs to be further improved. And land-use output of Zhongxiang City is also relatively low, especially that the land use efficiency of industry is far lower than the average level of Hubei Province. Besides, Zhongxiang City has a high sustainability of urban land use. But it still has a certain gap with the average level of Hubei Province.";"Luo, Xin-mao

The model is applied to West Virginia for the 1990-1999 period. Consistent with recent findings on migration patterns, the results show that jobs followed people. New jobs were captured by commuters, while agricultural land losses were occurring in the commuters' counties of origin or bedroom communities. However, counties with relatively more profitable and concentrated agricultural enterprises were less susceptible to alternative land use pressure than counties with less productive or fragmented agricultural land. Elasticities indicate population change is elastic, whereas employment and agricultural land density changes are inelastic to factors affecting them. Growth management, when combined with agricultural land retention programs, may be most effective at preserving agricultural land in high growth or potential growth areas.";"Hailu, Yohannes G.

Given fairly recent changes in the international policy ethos where a regime of stronger intellectual property protection has become a fait accompli for most developing countries, it is of some significance to ask whether more stringent protection of intellectual property does indeed encourage innovation. And this is the question which this paper examines, utilising cross-country panel data on R&D investment, patent protection and other country-specific characteristics spanning the period 1981-1990.

"AGRIS:US201300866553";"Grazing-Induced Modifications to Peak Standing Crop in Northern Mixed-grass Prairie";"";"Selective grazing can modify the productive capacity of rangelands by reducing competitiveness of productive, palatable species and increasing the composition of more grazing-resistant species. A grazing system (season-long and short-duration rotational grazing) x stocking rate (light: 16 steers·80 ha-1, moderate: 4 steers·12 ha-1, and heavy: 4 steers·9 ha-1) study was initiated in 1982 on northern mixed-grass prairie. Here, we report on the final 16 years of this study (1991-2006). Spring (April+May+June) precipitation explained at least 54% of the variation in peak standing crop. The percentage of variation explained by spring precipitation was similar between stocking rates with short-duration grazing but decreased with increasing stocking rate for season-long grazing. April precipitation explained the greatest percentage of the variation in peak standing crop for the light stocking rate (45%), May precipitation for the moderate stocking rate (49%), and June precipitation for the heavy stocking rate (34%). Peak standing crop was 23%-29% greater with light (1495±66 kg·ha-1, mean±1 SE) compared to moderate (1218±64 kg·ha-1) and heavy (1156±56 kg·ha-1) stocking rates, which did not differ. Differences in peak standing crop among stocking rates occurred during average and wet but not dry springs. Neither the interaction of grazing system and stocking rate nor grazing system alone affected standing crop across all years or dry, average, or wet springs. Grazing-induced modification of productive capacity in this northern mixed-grass prairie is attributed to changes in species composition with increasing stocking rate as the less productive, warm-season shortgrass blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis [H.B.K.] Lag. ex Griffiths) increases at the expense of more productive, cool-season midheight grasses. Land managers may need to substantially modify management to offset these losses in productive capacity.";"Derner, J.D.

We modeled body fat of individual does as a function of vegetation cover, composition, and water characteristics of their annual, summer, and winter home ranges in north-central New Mexico. We also modeled home range size as a function of the same characteristics. Levels of body fat were most closely and negatively related to the amount of pinyon-juniper in an individual deer's annual home range (F1,21=7.6; P=0.012; r2=0.26). Pinyon-juniper types provided little (combined ground cover of preferred forbs and shrubs=5.7%) mule deer forage but were included in home ranges in excess of their availability on the landscape, likely because of security cover attributes. Proportion of grasslands in home ranges was most strongly related to both annual (F1,23=4.9; P=0.037; r2=0.18) and summer (F2,25=5.7; P=0.009; r2=0.31) home range sizes, and home ranges increased as the grassland component increased, indicating that this habitat type was providing little value to mule deer. Grassland (0.2% combined cover of preferred forb and shrub) and montane conifer (3.2% ground cover of preferred forb and shrub) habitat types similarly lacked preferred mule deer food, and grasslands also lacked cover. Most immediate gains in mule deer habitat in north-central New Mexico may be attained by management of pinyon-juniper communities to increase forage quantity and quality while maintaining cover attributes. Gains can also be realized in grasslands, but here management must establish both cover and forage.";"Bender, L.C.

This is a synthesis of the papers presented at the meeting of the AFPF (French Grassland Society), with an emphasis on the new utilizations that are appearing, and it invites to contemplate new prospects for the grassland areas and the forage species. The new utilizations are described and analysed, with a view of defining what adaptations can be applied to these swards (choice of species, tilling practices, scope and level of management, etc.), and also in order to analyse the possible competitions and synergies and to see how to apply the existing know-hows to other ends than those linked to forage. Among the new utilizations are the following : 1 degrees the ecological regulation, because of the various eco-systemic roles played by grasslands thanks to their multi-functionality (pollution control, preservation of the bio-diversity, carbon storage, etc.); 2 degrees the production of resources of agricultural origin and of energy (but the forage species have certain disadvantages); and 3 degrees the greening of certain environments and the quality of the landscapes.

We applied a recently developed methodology to analyse the transition matrix of six land-cover classes, derived from 1986 and 2002 Landsat images of an area of 15 675 km² in southern Burkina Faso. Results show that most landscape transformations followed a systematic process. In addition, some transitions occurred as an apparently random process, probably caused by uncommon or sporadic events. Degradation of woodland to shrub-/grassland over 15.7% of the landscape, increases in biomass from woodland to dense forest on 10% of the landscape and conversion of 6% of the landscape from shrub-/grassland to cropland were the dominant signals of forest-cover transitions. From a planning perspective, the dominance of systematic processes should facilitate regional land-use planning and sustainable forest management in a context of immigration and agricultural intensification.";"Ouedraogo, Issa

"AGRIS:US201301956044";"Economic Analysis of Landowners' Willingness to Adopt Wetland and Riparian Conservation Management";"";"Within the Canadian prairies, there has been extensive loss and degradation of wetland and riparian zones, primarily caused by the intensification and expansion of agriculture. Since most of the wetland and riparian areas found within this agricultural landscape are located on privately owned land, effective policy must be informed by an understanding of the socio-economic characteristics of these landowners. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the compensation required for private landowners to conserve wetland and riparian zones within the Prairie Pothole Region of Saskatchewan and to evaluate the influence of farm characteristics and landowner attitudes on conservation decisions. A survey, targeted at landowners in two distinct regions, was used to evaluate the willingness to accept for conserving riparian areas based on a proposed 10-year payment program. While the analysis confirms that the magnitude of the payment is an important factor in landowners' conservation adoption decision, the impact of other factors including landowner experience, planning horizon, and perceptions of wetland values provides important insights into conservation program development and delivery. Dans les Prairies canadiennes, la perte et la détérioration des zones humides et des zones riveraines sont importantes et sont principalement attribuables à l'expansion et à l'intensification de l'agriculture. Comme la plupart des zones humides et riveraines de ce paysage agricole se trouvent sur des terres privées, une politique efficace doit reposer sur la compréhension des caractéristiques socio-économiques des propriétaires fonciers concernés. Le présent article vise à estimer la valeur des compensations qu'il faudrait verser aux propriétaires fonciers privés pour qu'ils acceptent de conserver les zones humides et les zones riveraines dans la région des cuvettes des Prairies de la Saskatchewan et àévaluer l'influence des caractéristiques agricoles et de l'attitude des propriétaires fonciers sur les décisions de conservation. Nous avons utilisé une enquête menée auprès de propriétaires fonciers dans deux régions distinctes pour évaluer le consentement à accepter (CAA) de conserver les zones riveraines fondé sur la création proposée d'un programme de paiements étalé sur dix ans. Bien que l'analyse confirme que la taille des paiements représente un facteur important dans les décisions de conservation des propriétaires fonciers, d'autres facteurs, tels que l'expérience des propriétaires fonciers, l'horizon de planification et les perceptions quant à la valeur des zones humides, fournissent des renseignements importants pour l'élaboration et la prestation de programmes de conservation.";"Yu, Jia

"AGRIS:US201400183770";"Global versus local change effects on a large European river";"";"Water temperature and discharge are fundamental to lotic ecosystem function, and both are strongly affected by climate. In large river catchments, however, climatic effects might be difficult to discern from background variability and other cumulative sources of anthropogenic change arising from local land and water management. Here, we use trend analysis and generalised linear modelling on the Loire, the longest river in France to test the hypotheses that i) long-term trends in discharge and river temperature have arisen from climate change and ii) climatic effects on water quality have not been overridden by local effects. Over 32years (1977–2008), discharge in the Middle Loire fell by about 100m³/s while water temperature increased by 1.2°C with greatest effects during the warm period (May–August). Although increasing air temperature explained 80% of variations in water temperature, basin-wide precipitation showed no long-term trend and accounted for only 18% of inter-annual fluctuations in flow. We suggest that trends in abstraction coupled with a potential increase in evapo-transpiration at the catchment scale could be responsible for the majority of the long-term discharge trend. Discharge and water temperature explained only 20% of long-term variations in major water quality variables (conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, suspended matter, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate, phosphate and chlorophyll-a), with phosphate and chlorophyll declining contrary to expectations from global change probably as a consequence of improved wastewater treatment. These data partially support our first hypothesis in revealing how warming in the Loire has been consistent with recent atmospheric warming. However, local management has had larger effects on discharge and water quality in ways that could respectively exacerbate (abstraction) or ameliorate (reduced point-source pollution) warming effects. As one of the first case-studies of its kind, this multi-parametric study illustrates the potential for complex interactions between climate change and other environmental factors in large rivers.";"Floury, M.

"AGRIS:US201600044892";"Assessing environmental requirements effects on forest fragmentation sensitivity in two arboreal rodents";"";"The study of the effect of habitat fragmentation on species that inhabit residual patches requires the investigation of the relationship existing between species distribution and landscape components. To understand which components of landscape mosaics are more influential for species’ persistence, we compared the distribution of two arboreal rodents proved to be sensitive to habitat fragmentation, the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius and the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris. Their occurrence in residual oak woods in central Italy was studied with nest-boxes and hair-tubes, developing a new method for hair analysis. Their distributions were analysed considering patch, matrix composition and configuration, and landscape vegetation variables. The two species showed a different degree of plasticity, with the squirrel being significantly more specialised at the landscape scale. The comparison of the two distribution patterns highlighted the influence of different ecological constraints and the existence of different strategies to cope with fragmentation. Patch size and patch attributes were generally weaker determinants of occurrence, compared to landscape metrics. The squirrel presence was significantly influenced by the presence of shared perimeter between hedgerows and woods and by the lack of isolation of the residual patches, suggesting the use of several fragments to compensate the low habitat quality. Conversely the hazel dormouse seemed to be more affected by the internal management of the woods, and in particular by the mean DBH. Our results highlight how the recognition of the extrinsic constraints and the influence of multi-scale habitat selection may help guiding land use management, to ensure species conservation in profoundly exploited landscapes.";"Zapponi, Livia

However, protected areas also attract people, and therefore, land use has intensified at the boundaries of these lands globally. In the USA, since the 1970s, housing growth at the boundaries (<1 km) of protected areas has increased at a rate far higher than on more distant private lands. Here, we designed our analyses to address our central hypothesis that increasing housing density in and near protected areas will increasingly alter their avian communities. We quantified the relationship between abundance and richness of protected‐area avian species of greatest conservation need, land‐cover affiliates (e.g. species associated with natural land cover such as forest breeders) and synanthropes (e.g. species associated with humans) with housing density on the boundary of protected areas and on more distant private lands from 1970 to 2010 in three ecoregions of the USA. We accomplished this using linear mixed‐model analyses, data from the US Census Bureau and 90 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Housing density at the boundary of protected areas tended to be strongly negatively related with the abundance and richness of species of greatest conservation need and land‐cover affiliates (upwards of 88% of variance explained) and strongly positively related with synanthropes (upwards of 83% of variance explained). The effect size of these relationships increased in most cases from 1970 to 2010 and was greatest in the densely developed eastern forests. In the more sparsely populated West, we found similar, though weaker, associations. Housing density on private lands more distant from protected areas had similar, but more muted negative effects. Synthesis and applications. Our results illustrate that as housing density has increased along the boundary of protected areas, the conservation benefit of these lands has likely diminished. We urge conservation planners to prioritize the purchase of private‐land inholdings in order to maximize the extent of unfragmented natural lands within protected areas. Further, we strongly recommend that land‐use planners implement boundary management strategies to alter the pattern of human access to protected areas, cluster development to concentrate the footprint of rural housing, and establish conservation agreements through local land trusts to buffer protected areas from the effects of development along protected‐area boundaries. To maximize the conservation benefit of protected areas, we suggest that housing development should be restricted within 1 km of their boundaries.";"Wood, Eric M.

Through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, we explored the meaning of hunting in the lower Omo valley, Ethiopia, and found that large game hunting was best understood as an activity that served to establish and maintain human–human relationships. Hunting was important as it created the basis for long-term bond-relations between a hunter and his friend (‘misso’) and a hunter and his honorary elder sister (‘misha’) that could be drawn on in times of hardship. By contrast, interactions between hunter and wildlife were given hardly any attention by our participants.

Shieling areas, where milking livestock were taken to pasture for the summer, represented one element of grazing management and in this paper we consider the extent to which historical shieling-based grazing pressure contributed to land degradation. Based on a grazing model to assess pressures and tephrochronology -based soil accumulation rates allied to micromorphology as a proxy for land degradation, our findings suggest that the shieling sy stem contributed to the maintenance of upland vegetation cover and related productivity levels without causing land degradation from settlement through to ca. AD 1300. As land degradation accelerated from ca. AD 1477 it is likely that shieling management continued to operate effectively contributing to the overall resilience of livestock farming.";"Brown, Jennifer L.

Our research, which is founded on a contextualist notion of policy design, demonstrates the potential of innovative land use policy instruments (i.e. form-based codes, conditional use permits) to address risk. We model environmental risks from point and mobile sources in Southeast Los Angeles (SELA), a known air toxics hotspot. We compare risk contours before and after implementation of land use interventions. The use of innovative form-based codes for modifying built environments results in appreciable risk reductions around transportation corridors in SELA. Conditional use permits employing technological standards for commercial and light-industrial land uses also produce some risk reductions.

"AGRIS:US201300929285";"Simulation of the Consequences of Different Fire Regimes to Support Wildland Fire Use Decisions";"";"The strategy known as wildland fire use, in which lightning-ignited fires are allowed to burn, is rapidly gaining momentum in the fire management community. Managers need to know the consequences of an increase in area burned that might result from an increase in wildland fire use. One concern of land managers as they consider implementing wildland fire use is whether they can meet the goals in the land management plan for the desired distribution of forest structural stages across the landscape with further increases in fire. These questions were explored for a 49,532 ha landscape on the Boise National Forest in Idaho that typically experiences mixed-severity and stand-replacing fires. The landscape simulation model TELSA was used to evaluate how increases in fire frequency and area burned might affect landscape composition and structure. Information about frequency, annual area burned, and size-class distributions of fires derived from a fire atlas for the northern Rocky Mountains were used to define the fire regime parameters for five different simulation scenarios. Scenarios with higher fire frequency and area burned resulted in landscapes dominated by earlier successional forest stages and only small patches occupied by large trees. Simulated variability in area occupied by different tree-size classes on this landscape was much greater than the desired ranges defined in the land management plan for the forest at large. A measure of dissimilarity (Euclidean Distance) from desired composition was used to evaluate scenarios for their relative ability to achieve long term land management goals. The lowest values of Euclidean Distance were for a scenario that represents a substantial increase in fire over 20th century fire regimes. Euclidean Distance increased for scenarios with very high rates of burning, implying an upper limit to the desired amount of fire for this landscape. These findings could be used to develop guidance for achieving desired conditions with wildland fire use.";"Miller, Carol";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300929285";"http://hdl.handle.net/10113/21697";"";"";"";"83-102"

The Chitwan District was one of the focus districts in the Terai Community Forestry Development Project that promoted a tree seedling distribution program. This paper examines the current position of tree integration on farmland and its contribution to livelihoods of rural households in this district. Interviews with local key informants, government and non-government agencies and wood-based industries, as well as an in-depth study of 32 households were used to describe the constraints faced by the households in management of trees on farmland. Most households cited disease, poor growth, lack of preferred tree species, lack of technical support, an uncertain tree market, and lack of financial support as constraints. Despite the important role of trees in subsistence and market-based rural livelihood diversification, and the consequent reduction in pressure on national forests from on-farm trees, current government policies and practices fail to recognise the value of these trees. It is argued that there is substantial potential for improving on-farm trees to enhance rural livelihoods. A responsive service mechanism centred on tree growing households would help the management of tree resources on the farmland.";"Regmi, Bishwa N.

"AGRIS:US201600092059";"Demography, traits and vulnerability to urbanization: can we make generalizations?";"";"Human‐induced land cover change threatens species diversity and ecosystem services. The rapid pace of current change makes predicting species’ declines imperative, but leaves little time for thorough study of all species. One solution is to make generalizations about species’ vulnerability to urbanization based on traits common among studied species in decline. To date, most generalizations about traits associated with species’ declines in response to urbanization are based on presence or abundance, or detailed studies of a few species. If these generalizations broadly reflect responses to urbanization, they should hold across the mechanisms driving patterns of abundance, such as survival or reproduction. Across 68 bird species in the north‐eastern USA, we investigated how food preference, nest location, habitat preference, migration distance, number of broods, clutch size, body mass and an interaction between urbanization and these traits affected survival and reproduction. Mass was the strongest predictor of survival, followed by number of broods, migration distance and nest location. Nest location was the strongest predictor of reproduction, followed by migration distance. No interaction between urbanization and species’ traits affected survival; however, differences in response to urbanization among species with different food preferences, migration distances, masses, nest locations and number of broods were important in predicting reproduction. Synthesis and applications. We found that some traits influenced demographic rates even though they were not associated with urbanization; identifying differences in species’ baseline demographic rates, irrespective of urbanization, is needed to guide management objectives. Reproduction, but not survival, was influenced by urbanization, suggesting that management in our region of study should target increasing suitable nest sites and reducing nest predation. Determining traits associated with demographic rates and urbanization across broad geographic extents can provide new insights for species’ management and help guide conservation initiatives.";"Brown, Leone M.

In the present study, a life cycle assessment framework is used to determine on-farm GHG emissions and water use, and the overall 'cradle-to-farm gate' GHG emissions and water use attributed to beef production. The total on-farm emissions for the two properties were 2984 t CO2-e/year (or 1.93 t CO2-e/livestock unit) for the 634-cow enterprise turning off weaner cattle at Gympie and 5725 t CO2-e/year (or 1.70 t CO2-e/livestock unit) for the 720-cow enterprise turning off finished steers in the Arcadia Valley. The on-farm emissions are largely attributable to enteric methane emissions from the beef herd. The overall 'cradle-to-farm gate' GHG emissions associated with enterprise products were 3145 t CO2-e/year at Gympie and 7253 t CO2-e/year in the Arcadia Valley, with the additional emissions coming from off-farm inputs (fuel for farm vehicles and earth-moving equipment, electricity, supplementary feed, agricultural chemicals, farm services) and additionally, for the Arcadia Valley enterprise, from purchased store steers. The carbon footprint of beef products at the farm gate ranged from 17.5 to 22.9 kg CO2-e/kg liveweight at Gympie, where wearers are the primary product, and from 11.6 to 15.5 kg CO2-e/kg liveweight in the Arcadia Valley, where finished steers are the primary product. Green water use ranged from 7400 to 12700 L/kg liveweight depending on class of livestock, with on-farm blue water use of 51-96 L/kg liveweight and off-farm blue water use of 0.1-59 L/kg liveweight. The ability to offset on-farm GHG emissions through reforestation varied between the two locations, with predicted biosequestration rates of 19.3-34.7 t CO2-e/ha per year at Gympie (rainfall 1200 mm/year) from eucalypt plantation and 1.5-9.8 t CO2-e/ha per year in the Arcadia Valley (rainfall 600 mm/year) through reforestation from a combination of brigalow regrowth, leucaena and environmental eucalypt plantings. The area that would need to be reforested to offset on-farm emissions (over a 30-year time horizon) would be 86-155 ha at Gympie (7-13% of the holding) and 629-4108 ha in the Arcadia Valley (9-60%). If carbon sequestration could be achieved at the higher end of the rates nominated, a significant proportion of on-farm emissions could be offset by sequestration in timber, with minimal impact on beef production. However, at the lower end of the forest sequestration range, the required level of land-use change would reduce the carrying capacity, and hence beef production, especially at the Arcadia Valley site.";"Eady, Sandra

"AGRIS:US201400103572";"Hidden Costs of Passive Restoration";"";"The first few years of tropical forest restoration can be expensive, especially when applied to expansive areas. In light of this, passive restoration has been recommended as a considerably cheaper or even free alternative. There are, however, both direct and indirect costs associated with passive restoration. First, the longer recovery time that is typically required in passive restoration can be perceived as project failure, especially when compared with nearby active restoration efforts. In the worst‐case scenario, this can lead to the premature termination of a project by a landowner who would like to see more rapid or visible results. Second, passive restoration may be viewed as land abandonment, and in developing nations where land tenure is not always strictly enforced this may invite unanticipated uses, such as ranchers who may unintentionally or intentionally allow livestock to take advantage of the “unused” forage grass, thus setting back recovery efforts. Lastly, passive restoration does have direct financial costs, including material costs for establishing fences and repairing them, and labor costs for site vigilance. These upfront investments may need to be made repeatedly in passive restoration efforts, and for a longer time period than for an active restoration project. Both the direct and indirect costs should be considered prior to choosing passive restoration as a strategy in a particular restoration project.";"Zahawi, Rakan A.

In particular, in the inventory approach expansions of UGBs are considered as decision situations, land consumptions as problems, and order sizes of UGBs as solutions. We compare the time- and event-driven systems of the inventory control problem based on the decision network framework. The former in the framework is considered as making single, independent decisions in time, whereas the latter as making multiple, linked decisions in time. Our numerical example shows that the event-driven system is more effective than the time-driven system in that the former incurs less total cost than the former in the UGBs context. The implication is that making multiple, linked decisions, as manifested by Decision Network, would yield more benefits, such as lowering the total cost, to the planner than making these decisions independently.";"Han, Haoying

Alley farming, the alternative agricultural system, has been introduced as a technical option to increase yield, reduce or eliminate fallow and conserve soil water. This study uses a logistic regression model to determine the factors influencing the adoption of alley farming in Sierra Leone. Data for the study were collected from a total of 160 farmers in 16 farming communities across 4 ecotones in the Freetown Peninsula through a survey, interactive discussion and personal observation. It is found that although most of these communities are aware of alley farming, female farmers are less likely than males to adopt this farming technology. Also membership of farmers’ associations and access to extension services positively influences adoption of alley farming, but limited land availability hinders adoption in the region. Most of the farmers practicing or trying out alley farming prefer this farming system over slash-and-burn shifting cultivation. High demand for fuelwood, short or no fallow periods and replenishment of soil fertility are among the attributes driving farmers to switch to alley farming. Despite its merits, alley farming is not perceived as a complete substitute for slash-and-burn shifting cultivation in the study area. For wider adoption, there is the need to develop demonstration farms to show the feasibility of incorporating farmer-specific biophysical, hydro-climatic and socio-economic conditions into alley farming system in the region.";"Conteh, Alhaji M.

"AGRIS:US201500163207";"Multivariate geostatistical methods for analysis of relationships between ecological indicators and environmental factors at multiple spatial scales";"";"As all biodiversity-related variables, ecological indicators are influenced by environmental factors working at different spatial scales. However, assessing the relationship between environmental factors and ecological indicators is limited to a set of spatial scales determined a priori. This a priori assumption can hide important relationships, especially for ecological indicators with a complex spatial structure that can be driven, for example, by the influence of multiple pollutants with different dispersion ranges or by the influence of local and regional factors such as land-cover and climate. To relate ecological indicators and environmental factors without assuming a priori spatial scales of analysis, we used a Linear Model of Coregionalization. This method has been used in literature to analyze the joint distribution of biodiversity variables. Here we show that it can be used to gain insight into spatial patterns of relationships between ecological indicators and underlying environmental factors. We applied this method to a region of south-west Europe, relating data from land-cover, altitude and climate with an ecological indicator, the abundance of fruticose lichen species, known to be very sensitive to multiple environmental factors. Based on variogram analysis we identified distinct spatial scales of relationships between the ecological indicator and environmental factors. For each spatial scale we described relationships using Principal Component Analysis applied to the coregionalization matrices. This way we could assess how strong the relationship between each environmental factor and ecological indicator at each spatial scale was: at medium scales (c. 15km) open spaces areas (a proxy for particle emissions) were more important; at larger scales (c. 45km) open spaces, artificial areas (a proxy for gaseous pollutants) and also climate were preponderant. Thus, multivariate geostatistics provided a tool to improve knowledge on relationships between ecological indicators and environmental factors at multiple spatial scales without setting a priori spatial scales of analysis.";"Ribeiro, Manuel Castro

"AGRIS:US201500199488";"Soil erosion under the impacts of future climate change: Assessing the statistical significance of future changes and the potential on-site and off-site problems";"";"Soil erosion by water is a major environmental threat to the sustainability and productive capacity of agriculture in many tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. In temperate regions, meanwhile, the ‘off-site’ transport of sediment and pollutants into nearby water courses and the ‘muddy flooding’ of properties and infrastructure pose a much greater threat. These adverse impacts may become a more serious future environmental problem under the impacts of future climate change, ranging from direct changes in precipitation characteristics to the more indirect effects of temperature in governing plant biomass and shifts in land use to accommodate the new climatic regime. A number of modelling studies have been conducted in various locations to examine how climate change and its impacts will affect soil erosion, but few studies attempt to quantify how statistically significant those changes are, or whether the changes will pose agricultural and/or environmental problems. This study aims to address these issues, by developing simple methodologies to assess the statistical significance of future soil erosion rates based on comparing relative changes to natural variability around present-day rates, and determine whether these changes may be problematic by comparing absolute soil erosion rates to tolerable thresholds. A modelling study across six hillslopes in Northern Ireland is conducted to demonstrate these methodologies, using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. The direct impacts of climate change are modelled using statistical downscaling methods and a simple sensitivity analysis in the case of sub-daily precipitation data, whilst a scenario approach is taken in order to model the indirect impacts of changing land use and management. Results indicate a mix of soil erosion increases and decreases, depending on which scenarios are considered. Downscaled climate change projections in isolation generally result in erosion decreases, whereas large increases are projected under many scenarios where changes in sub daily rainfall intensity and land use are accounted for. Only the most extreme scenarios reveal the potential for on-site problems of soil erosion, whilst the off-site impacts are likely to become a more considerable environmental issue with respect to water quality and muddy flooding under a wide range of future scenarios. A number of scenarios reveal statistically significant increases in soil erosion from the present day, but these are confined to only two out of the six sites. At the remaining four sites, high absolute rates are projected under many scenarios, despite not representing statistically significant increases, and there also exist a number of cases where statistically significant increases translate to low absolute erosion rates. This illustrates the importance of analysing both relative and absolute soil erosion rates, as the former allows us to isolate the impacts of climate change in contributing to erosion, whereas the latter allows us to determine whether those changes may be problematic by comparing them to tolerable thresholds. The methodologies outlined and demonstrated in this study provide a simple means of generating these additional pieces of information which could prove useful in decision-making contexts.";"Mullan, Donal";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use planning;climate change";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500199488";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2013.03.007";"";"";"";"234-246"
"AGRIS:US201500199481";"spatio-temporal invariability of sediment concentration and the flow–sediment relationship for hilly areas of the Chinese Loess Plateau";"";"The spatio-temporal variation underlies and complicates studies related to earth surface processes. Subsequent to our previous studies reporting the temporal invariability of sediment concentration, this study further reports the spatial invariability of sediment concentration or the flow–sediment relationship in the hilly part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The dense channel network dissects this area into numerous sub-watersheds, which are composed of entire slopes (a combination of the hill slope and the valley side slope). Our data mainly involves ten experimental sites of entire slope and sub-watershed and 580 flood events at three locations. Our analysis at the intra-event time scale shows that the instantaneous sediment concentrations in runoff can generally approach the detach-limited maximum sediment concentration since the active massing wasting ensures an abundant sediment supply. Consequently, the event mean sediment concentration does not only remain fairly constant among flow events but also among the experimental sites despite the possible differences in topography, soil management or land cover, water source, soil surface properties, etc. This observation also holds at the annual time scale. Our result implies that a single proportional function is adequate to fit the flow–sediment relationship for any entire slope or sub-watershed, where eroded sediments are primarily sourced, over a considerable areal extent unless soil property has changed or check dams are installed. Moreover, the proportionality coefficient, which is indicative of the maximum detachment capacity, can be approximated through flume experiments rather than necessarily through long-term field observations. Our finding can facilitate the obtainment of spatially distributed information on soil loss in the Chinese Loess Plateau and is also indicative of other locations where sediment supply is sufficiently available.";"Zheng, Mingguo

"AGRIS:US201500205036";"Drivers of Coastal Shoreline Change: Case Study of Hon Dat Coast, Kien Giang, Vietnam";"";"Coastal shorelines are naturally dynamic, shifting in response to coastal geomorphological processes. Globally, land use change associated with coastal urban development and growing human population pressures is accelerating coastal shoreline change. In southern Vietnam, coastal erosion currently is posing considerable risks to shoreline land use and coastal inhabitants. The aim of this paper is to quantify historical shoreline changes along the Hon Dat coast between 1995 and 2009, and to document the relationships between coastal mangrove composition, width and density, and rates of shoreline change. The generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify the major biophysical and land-use factors influencing shoreline change rates. Most significant drivers of the rates of change are cutting of mangroves, the dominant mangrove genus, changes in adjacent shoreline land use, changes of shoreline land cover, and width of fringing mangroves. We suggest that a possible and inexpensive strategy for robust mangrove shoreline defense is direct mangrove planting to promote mangrove density with the presence of breakwater structures. In the shorter term, construction of coastal barriers such as fence-structured melaleuca poles in combination with mangrove restoration schemes could help retain coastal sediments and increase the elevation of the accretion zone, thereby helping to stabilize eroding fringe shorelines. It also is recommended that implementation of a system of payments for mangrove ecosystem services and the stronger regulation of mangrove cutting and unsustainable land-use change to strengthen the effectiveness of mangrove conservation programs and coastal land-use management.";"Nguyen, Hai-Hoa

Landowner attitudes to ecological restoration of agricultural landscapes";"";"Private property accounts for much of the planet's arable land, and most of this has been cleared for agricultural production. Agricultural areas retain only fragments of their original vegetation and this has been detrimental to many native plant and animal species. Habitat restoration and revegetation may be able to reconnect and enlarge existing remnant areas in agricultural landscapes and, thereby, enhance native plant and animal communities. However, conservation initiatives will be successful only if landowners actively participate in restoration actions. This study used four hundred postal questionnaires to assess the degree to which landowners in two regions of south-eastern Australia adopt restoration activities, their opinions regarding remnant and revegetated land and their management actions in these areas. One hundred and seventy nine completed questionnaires were received. Three quarters of respondents had undertaken restoration on their property or were planning to revegetate in the future. Landcare members were most likely to have previously revegetated and future revegetation intentions were best predicted by previous restoration activities and a primary income source that was off-farm. Landowners were more likely to manage restored and remnant areas if they perceived threats such as weeds, pest animals and fire risk would be detrimental to their property, than to enhance environmental outcomes. These results indicate that landowners are interested in restoring natural areas, but without greater assistance to restore ground layers and manage perceived threats posed by fire and invasive plants and animals, restoration actions will not have their desired biodiversity benefits.";"Jellinek, Sacha

The 12 management treatments in this study included control, aeration, burning, herbicide application, fertilization, over-sowing, ploughing + resowing and a combination of all the treatments. A mixture of seeds consisting of alfalfa, sainfoin, smooth bromegrass, orchardgrass and blue wheatgrass was used for oversowing and in the ploughing + resowing plots. The trial was established in a randomized block design and four replications. Lime and no lime were applied as split plot treatments. The highest yield and crude protein ratio were obtained from the ploughing + resowing plots. Although most seeds in the resowing and over-sowing plots germinated, all young seedlings died due to competition with existing vegetation. The results obtained from this research showed that satisfactory results could not be obtained with the treatments without sufficient aeration in soils. It was determined that aeration using the rake had not been adequate. High yield and hay protein ratio were obtained from the ploughing + resowing plots as the ploughing provided adequate air to soil before resowing. Liming increased the soil pH from 6.0 to 6.5 and also increased hay yield and crude protein ratio.

Of these frontier regions, Cape York Peninsula has become the focus for increasingly entrenched, complex contests about regional futures, with the transition towards complex multifunctionality demonstrated in the 1970, 1990 and 2010 tenure maps. Transition dynamics are explored in tables summarising functional trajectories at these benchmark years, also with an examination of non-Indigenous and Indigenous driving forces, actors, agendas, power relations and decision processes. In this increasingly contested arena, currently the pivotal divide is between traditionalist/localist against modernist/reformist/regionalist visions of Indigenous futures, with this divide influencing the agendas and strategies of other major participants, notably conservationists and state and federal governments. The most probable functional trajectory towards 2030 can be identified, based on the partial resolution of the current flux in land tenures, property rights, power relations and economic prospects.

Strong genetic diversification in the world’s largest living odonate, the Neotropical damselfly Megaloprepus caerulatus";"";"Mesoamerican biodiversity is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic destruction of natural land cover. Habitat degradation and climate change are primary threats to specialized forest odonate species that are important model organisms for forest health and defining conservation units. The extreme niche specialization of Megaloprepus caerulatus, the world’s largest extant odonate, makes it well suited as an indicator for changing environmental conditions. Megaloprepus, which is considered to be a monospecific genus, is highly dependent on old growth forests whose water filled tree holes are limiting reproductive resources for this species. Here, we focus on the question how historical and recent fragmentation events, strong niche conservatism and ecological conditions have affected population dynamics, viability and the species status in this evolutionarily old genus. Two mitochondrial sequence markers (ND1 and 16S rRNA) and a set of microsatellites were used to analyze population structure and genetic diversity of M. caerulatus in the northern part of its distributional range. Results suggested an absence of gene flow and no shared haplotypes among the study populations. Statistical parsimony indicated high sub-structuring among populations with sequence diversity similar to levels found at the species level compared to other odonates. In sum, the genetic data suggest that Megaloprepus may actually consist of more than one species. The taxonomic status of the group should be revised in light of the three distinct genetic clusters found in different forest regions. The results may also allow insights into the impact of recent and historical habitat fragmentation on a strong Neotropical forest restricted insect species.";"Feindt, Wiebke

Landsat images acquired during the years of 1990/1991, 1999/2000, and 2008/2010 were used to examine LULC change trajectories with the post-classification comparison approach. A classification system composed of six classes – forest, savanna, other vegetation (secondary succession and plantations), agro-pasture, impervious surface, and water – was designed for this study. A hierarchical-based classification method was used to classify Landsat images into thematic maps. This research shows different spatiotemporal change patterns, composition, and rates among the three study areas and indicates the importance of analysing LULC change at multiple scales. The LULC change analysis over time for entire study areas provides an overall picture of change trends, but detailed change trajectories and their spatial distributions can be better examined at a per-pixel scale. The LULC change at the polygon scale provides the information of the changes in patch sizes over time, while the LULC change at census sector scale gives new insights on how human-induced activities (e.g. urban expansion, roads, and land-use history) affect LULC change patterns and rates. This research indicates the necessity to implement change detection at multiple scales for better understanding the mechanisms of LULC change patterns and rates.";"Lu, Dengsheng

The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was used to summarize the climatic conditions at different time scales, and was correlated with the standardized streamflow index (SSI) calculated at the mouth of each catchment. The Ebro basin encompasses a gradient from Atlantic to Mediterranean climates, and has remarkable complexity in topography, geology and land cover. The basin is highly regulated by dams, which were built to produce hydropower and supply water for agriculture. These characteristics explain why sub-basins of the Ebro River basin respond in differing ways to precedent climatic conditions. Three main sub-basin groups were distinguished on the basis of the correlation of their streamflow responses to different time scales of the SPEI: (1) sub-basins correlated with short SPEI time scales (2–4months), which generally corresponded to unregulated headwater areas; (2) sub-basins correlated with long SPEI time scales (10–20months), where groundwater reserves play a major hydrological role; and (3) sub-basins correlated with medium SPEI time scales (6–10months). The latter occur in the lower sectors of the Ebro basin and its tributaries, which receive river flows from the other two sub-basins, and where dam regulation has a significant influence on the hydrological characteristics. In addition to the three main sub-basin groups, other streamflow responses associated with seasonal factors were identified, particularly those related to snowpack and the various management strategies applied to reservoirs.";"López-Moreno, J.I.

The Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC), through its role in assisting Indigenous people to acquire and manage land for cultural, social, environmental and economic benefits, has operated in the carbon market and is keen to continue working with its partners to explore the opportunities to develop and broaden this further. The Northern Territory Cattlemen’s Association, as the major industry body for the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory, has been actively involved in assessing the opportunities which may be presented through greenhouse gas abatement where these are compatible with sound resource and economic management. In recent years, Australian governments have considered and developed diversified carbon abatement opportunities for farmers, particularly through the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). Australian Carbon Credit Units generated through the CFI can contribute to meeting Australia’s commitments under international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The opportunity for economic diversification into carbon farming on marginal land where the primary land use is pastoralism is of particular interest, particularly where it can lead to strengthened economic returns, jobs and other benefits for Indigenous people. Lessons learnt from the ILC’s Fish River Fire Project demonstrate the potential, but also emphasise the need for further research into the practicalities of introducing carbon projects into predominantly pastoral landscapes in Australia and internationally. It is suggested that several issues require further assessment by pastoralists who may be considering engaging in the CFI or other carbon markets.";"Walton, Nerissa

Previous efforts to quantify this ecosystem service have been either largely conceptual or based on complex atmospheric models. Here, we review previous research on this topic and propose a new and simple analytical approach for estimating the physical regulation of climate by ecosystems. The proposed metric estimates how landâcover change affects the loading of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, while also accounting for the relative contribution of windâtransported heat and moisture. Although feedback dynamics between land, atmosphere, and oceans are not modeled, the metric compares well with previous studies for several regions. We find that ecosystems have the strongest influence on surface climatic conditions in the boreal and tropical regions, where temperature and moisture changes could substantially offset or magnify greenhouseâforced changes.

One of them, EcoFINDERS, launched a pan-European survey in order to define normal operating ranges for soil biodiversity and quality, through the use of several methodologies. The objective of the current work was the characterization of European soils under different land uses and from representative bio-geographical locations, using a PLFA method developed in the context of the mentioned survey, in order to recognize and define operation ranges for soil PLFA. PLFA analysis demonstrated to be a valuable tool in the evaluation, comparison and distinction of several land uses and biogeographical (BG) zones. The analysis of the PLFA diversity with PCA and PERMANOVA/SIMPER demonstrated a good separation of soil samples relatively to each defined land use and BG zone. Soils of the same BG zone and land use group showed an average biomarker constitution with consistent differences of PLFA/biomarker compositions relatively to other groups, especially concerning land uses. Total PLFA biomass was consistently higher in non-arable environments, i.e., forest or grass soils. Arable soils contained a total PLFA biomass that was in average 2.5â2.9 times lower than grassland or forest soil. Arable and grassland soils contained significantly low relative quantities of the saprophytic Fungi biomarker 18:2Ï6,9c (which decreased more than 18:1Ï9c), and low Total Fungi biomarkers/Bacteria biomarkers ratio (TF/B). The opposite occurred in forestry soil samples, and the Boreal BG zone stood out, showing the highest total fungal composition, with a most important contribution of the 18:2Ï6,9c saprophytic Fungi biomarker. Grasslands (all BG zones) showed to be the richest (3.5â3.8%) in Arbuscular Mycorrhizae Fungi biomarker, 16:1Ï5c. High proportions of Gram-positive, relatively to Gram-negative biomarkers occurred essentially in arable soils, in this study, but also in Alpine grasslands, which main Gram-positive biomarkers were a15:0, and i15:0. Total biomass, PLFA Biomarker groups, and different balances between individual PLFA enabled the discrimination of samples originating from both different BG zones and land uses.";"Francisco, Romeu

Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area. Considering the above background, this study was conducted with the objectives of developing a land degradation assessment model using a GIS based approach.";"Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed, South Eastern University of Sri Lanka";"";"";"AGRIS";"2013-10-07";"";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"LKA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=CH2016321011";"http://www.scipress.com/ILNS.53.80.pdf";"";"";"";"80-86"

Using occurrence data collected in 2009 and 2010 from the Boise National Forest, Idaho, we developed distribution models for Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) and Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) to explore associations between habitat factors and owl occupancy. We then spatially applied these models in a Geographic Information System. We considered land cover and topographic variables at three spatial scales: 0.4-km, 1-km, or 3-km-radius plots centered on point-count locations (n = 150) with resolution of land covers at 30Â m. Flammulated Owls occupied 27 (18%) point-count locations and occurred in areas with a higher proportion of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at the 0.4-km scale, less diverse land cover composition at the 1-km scale, and in south-facing aspects at the 3-km scale. Northern Saw-whet Owls occupied 45 (30%) point-count locations and were associated with relatively flat terrain at the 0.4-km scale that had larger proportions of non-forest land cover. At the 1-km and 3-km scales, Northern Saw-whet Owls occurred in areas with south-facing aspects having a higher proportion of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), respectively. Biologists and land managers interested in the conservation of Flammulated Owls and Northern Saw-whet Owls can use our approach to delineate habitats important for these owls or to help identify locations suitable for restoration.";"Scholer, Micah N.

"AGRIS:US201400178262";"Integration of legume trees in maize-based cropping systems improves rain use efficiency and yield stability under rain-fed agriculture";"";"Water availability is a major constraint to crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where agriculture is predominantly rain-fed. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the nitrogen-fixing legume tree Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and inorganic fertilizer on rain use efficiency (RUE), a robust measure of productivity and land degradation, in three long-term (11–12 years) experiments conducted in Zambia and Nigeria. On the two Zambian sites, sole maize (Zea mays) grown continuously (for 11–12 years) with the recommended fertilizer achieved the highest RUE (3.9–4.6kgha⁻¹mm⁻¹) followed by maize intercropped with Leucaena (2.5–3.4kgha⁻¹mm⁻¹). This translated to 192–383% increase in RUE over the control (maize grown without nutrient inputs), which is the de facto resource-poor farmers’ practice. RUE was more stable in fully fertilized sole maize on the first Zambian site and not statistically different from the maize–Leucaena associations on the second site. On the Nigerian site, RUE was higher in maize planted between Leucaena hedgerows supplemented with 50% of the recommended fertilizer (3.9kgha⁻¹mm⁻¹), maize grown between Leucaena hedgerows without fertilizer (3.0kgha⁻¹mm⁻¹) and sole maize receiving the recommended fertilizer (2.8kgha⁻¹mm⁻¹), which translated to increases in RUE of 202%, 139% and 85%, respectively, over the control. RUE was more stable in the maize grown between Leucaena hedgerows than in the fully fertilized maize. On all sites RUE was least stable in the control. Yield stability in the maize–Leucaena association was not significantly different from the fully fertilized maize on the Zambian sites. On the Nigerian site, maize yields were more stable in maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows than in fully fertilized sole maize. Supplementation of maize grown in Leucaena hedgerows with 50% of the recommended fertilizers resulted in greater yield stability. It is concluded that intercropping cereals with legume trees and supplementation with inorganic fertilizer can increase rain use efficiency and yield stability in rain-fed agriculture in SSA.";"Sileshi, Gudeta W.

"AGRIS:US201300812530";"Application of GIS and logistic regression to fossil pollen data in modelling present and past spatial distribution of the Colombian savanna";"";"Climate changes affect the abundance, geographic extent, and floral composition of vegetation, which are reflected in the pollen rain. Sediment cores taken from lakes and peat bogs can be analysed for their pollen content. The fossil pollen records provide information on the temporal changes in climate and palaeo-environments. Although the complexity of the variables influencing vegetation distribution requires a multi-dimensional approach, only a few research projects have used GIS to analyse pollen data. This paper presents a new approach to palynological data analysis by combining GIS and spatial modelling. Eastern Colombia was chosen as a study area owing to the migration of the forest-savanna boundary since the last glacial maximum, and the availability of pollen records. Logistic regression has been used to identify the climatic variables that determine the distribution of savanna and forest in eastern Colombia. These variables were used to create a predictive land-cover model, which was subsequently implemented into a GIS to perform spatial analysis on the results. The palynological data from the study area were incorporated into the GIS. Reconstructed maps of past vegetation distribution by interpolation showed a new approach of regional multi-site data synthesis related to climatic parameters. The logistic regression model resulted in a map with 85.7% predictive accuracy, which is considered useful for the reconstruction of future and past land-cover distributions. The suitability of palynological GIS application depends on the number of pollen sites, the distribution of the pollen sites over the area of interest, and the degree of overlap of the age ranges of the pollen records.";"Flantua, Suzette G.

To achieve better soil P management, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of land management on soil P dynamics and P budget. We conducted a 4-year cultivation experiment in two dry tropical croplands in Tanzania at two sites with contrasting soil textures, viz. clayey and sandy. We then evaluated the effect of different types of land management (control plot, plot treated with crop residue only, plot treated with fertilizer only, and plot treated with both crop residue and fertilizer) on soil fractionated P and P budget at both sites. At the end of the experiment, fertilizer application (50kgPha⁻¹year⁻¹) clearly increased NaOH-extractable inorganic P by 66.0–82.6kgPha⁻¹ (soil depth 0–15cm) at the clayey site and was equivalent to 33.0–41.3% of applied P fertilizer. However, fertilizer application did not clearly increase NaOH-extractable inorganic P at the sandy site owing to its low content of Al and Fe oxides. On the other hand, the effect of crop residue application (7.5MgCha⁻¹year⁻¹) on fractionated soil P was scarce, even with fertilizer application. Thus, applied crop residue increased soil C but did not significantly increase any P fractions, even with substantial P fertilization. On the basis of the P budget, we found that P was substantially unaccounted for only in the fertilizer treatment plots, i.e., 59.5–89.1 and 121.3–138.2kgPha⁻¹ (soil depth 0–15cm) at clayey and sandy sites, respectively. Our results indicate that substantial P loss, possibly through leaching, seemed to have occurred at the sandy site in particular. Therefore, not only P fixation but also P loss from leaching of applied P should be reduced to achieve better P management in this region.";"Sugihara, Soh

We use the conservation of the freshwater pearl mussel in the River Esk, North Yorkshire, UK, as an empirical case study to examine the interaction that takes place between professionals from different institutional and disciplinary backgrounds as they come together to work on a common problem. We focus on two aspects: the way in which an institutional context was created; and the interaction between the professionals involved. Our analysis demonstrates that the strategic intermediary role of professionals is vital to policy implementation. The intermediary uses their strategic vision and undertakes political manoeuvring following the presentation and interaction of different knowledges and evidence to ensure a certain course of action. This is different from a knowledge broker. The role of the professional is to draw on expertise, both formal and tacit, to interpret and judge data in relation to decision making. Those individuals participating in decision making of this nature have multiple histories, roles and motivations which enables innovation in the creation of meaning within environmental management. The quality of the evidence can be assumed adequate once subject to diverse professional scrutiny. These findings are important since innovative behaviour that creates new structures and practices is becoming central to delivering good management of land, water and biodiversity.";"Bracken, Louise J.

"AGRIS:US201500196044";"Regional land-use allocation with a spatially explicit genetic algorithm";"";"Land-use allocation is an important way to promote the intensive and economic use of land resources and achieve the goal of sustainable development. It is a complex spatial optimization problem, and heuristic algorithms have been one of the most effective ways to solve it in past studies. However, heuristic algorithms lack the guidance of planning knowledge, which makes land-use patterns usually unreasonable in practice. This research proposes a spatially explicit genetic algorithm (SEGA) that integrates land-use planning knowledge with the genetic algorithm (GA). The SEGA transforms the spatially implicit computation mode of the GA into a spatially explicit optimization style, which helps to promote the effectiveness of regional land-use allocation. Gaoqiao Town, China, was selected as the study area to test the SEGA. Results show that: (1) land-use conversions are reasonable in accordance with planning knowledge, and they improve overall land-use suitability and spatial compactness; (2) compared with the GA, the SEGA is superior in achieving global objectives and simulating local dynamics. We demonstrated that planning knowledge is essential to heuristic algorithms for land-use allocation.";"Liu, Yaolin

Therefore, the cooperation by beneficiaries including non-farm households is considered to be desirable. However such cooperation may be difficult to achieve, as the participation of non-farm households in the management of such resources leads to the diversification of stakeholders.In this study, we shall firstly review the existing studies on the collective activities for the management of irrigation system. Secondly, by using the framework of social-ecological systems, key issues for the management of the irrigation system in Japan will be clarified. Thirdly, we will clarify the mechanism involved in the management of CPRs through the identification of determinants for activities to manage agricultural irrigation and drainage channels, based on data from the rural community-level in Niigata Prefecture. Finally, we shall draw policy implications and research tasks for the management of the rural CPRs.";"Furuzawa, Shinichi

"AGRIS:US201600079421";"flexible spatiotemporal method for fusing satellite images with different resolutions";"";"Studies of land surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes often require remote sensing datawith high acquisition frequency and high spatial resolution. However, no single sensor meets this requirement. This study presents a new spatiotemporal data fusion method, the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) method, to generate synthesized frequent high spatial resolution images through blending two types of data, i.e., frequent coarse spatial resolution data, such as that from MODIS, and less frequent high spatial resolution data such as that from Landsat. The proposed method is based on spectral unmixing analysis and a thin plate spline interpolator. Compared with existing spatiotemporal data fusion methods, it has the following strengths: (1) it needs minimum input data; (2) it is suitable for heterogeneous landscapes; and (3) it can predict both gradual change and land cover type change. Simulated data and real satellite images were used to test the performance of the proposed method. Its performance was compared with two very popular methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and an unmixing-based data fusion (UBDF) method. Results show that the new method creates more accurate fused images and keeps more spatial detail than STARFM and UBDF. More importantly, it closely captures reflectance changes caused by land cover conversions, which is a big issue with current spatiotemporal data fusion methods. Because the proposed method uses simple principles and needs only one fine-resolution image as input, it has the potential to increase the availability of high-resolution time-series data that can support studies of rapid land surface dynamics.";"Zhu, Xiaolin

In this paper, we examine the impact of the TRQ system on New Zealand’s meat and dairy trade. We draw together theoretical and empirical insights and present preliminary findings arising from interviews with key stakeholders. In particular, we examine whether the TRQ system has achieved its objectives from the perspective of the dairy and meat sectors in New Zealand and we analyse problems that appear to exist with the system.

In this study, we analysed the perceptions of 500 users and interest groups regarding the ES provided by the Bilbao Metropolitan Greenbelt (BMG) ecosystems in northern Spain, and we compared these perceptions to the demands for ES. The objective of this study is to understand user preferences and to thereby better orient land use planning. The results show that the demand for ES in the BMG did not correspond to what users perceived these ecosystems to provide. The respondents' perceptions appeared to be related to the management practices in the area, whereas their demand was related to the benefits they would like to obtain from the BMG. The interviewees were in favour of improvements to peri-urban rural areas, and the results suggested that the authorities should highlight the role of the BMG ecosystems with respect to regulating services and historic and cultural values to improve people's awareness of the ecosystems' capacity to provide benefits to society. Application of this framework also highlighted that there were differences in the perception of and demand for ES among different user groups.

There is, therefore, a need for empirical evaluations to identify the driving factors and to provide evidence that supports the development of context-specific conservation projects. We used a quantitative approach to measure, post hoc, the effectiveness of a US$19 million Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICDP) that sought to reduce biodiversity loss through the development of villages bordering Kerinci Seblat National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Indonesia. We focused on the success of the ICDP component that disbursed a total of US$1.5 million through development grants to 66 villages in return for their commitment to stop illegally clearing the forest. To investigate whether the ICDP lowered deforestation rates in focal villages, we selected a subset of non-ICDP villages that had similar physical and socioeconomic features and compared their respective deforestation rates. Village participation in the ICDP and its development schemes had no effect on deforestation. Instead, accessible areas where village land-tenure had been undermined by the designation of selective-logging concessions tended to have the highest deforestation rates. Our results indicate that the goal of the ICDP was not met and, furthermore, suggest that both law enforcement inside the park and local property rights outside the park need to be strengthened. Our results also emphasize the importance of quantitative approaches in helping to inform successful and cost-effective strategies for tropical biodiversity conservation.";"LINKIE, MATTHEW

The country is the second largest exporter, accounting for 34% of the world’s export of cashew kernels having a comparative advantage in production and processing on account of its cheap and skilled labour force. The yields in India are poor at 860 kg/ha as compared to 4,125 kg/ha in Vietnam and 2,000 kg/ha in Nigeria. There is an urgent need to expand and fully utilize the potential if India has to keep pace with growing global demand, retain market share and stay ahead of the rapidly emerging competition in the world market. The industry employs over three lakh persons with more than 95% of them being women in India. It earned a foreign exchange of Rs. 22,889 million, but the gap between actual production of raw nuts and demand by the processing industries has made India to resort to imports of raw cashew warranting a policy change to encourage more local production and thereby preventing the outflow of valuable foreign exchange. The present paper deals with impact of climate change in cashew production, influence of various weather parameters on flowering and yield, carbon sequestration potential of cashew nut to mitigate climate change under different land use systems and a methodology for calculation of tradable carbon credits with a holistic approach to withstand competition from global players.

"AGRIS:US201500201862";"Dissolved organic nitrogen as an indicator of livestock impacts on soil biochemical quality";"";"Soil degradation in the Mediterranean and other arid and semi-arid regions of the world is caused mainly by cultivation and grazing. A consequence of de-vegetation due to overgrazing has been a decrease in organic matter (litter) input to soil and a decrease of aggregate size and stability making soils more susceptible to erosion and to organic matter losses. This study provided evidence linking the Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) export from river basins to livestock grazing intensity and the resulting decrease in vegetation. Koiliaris River Basin in Crete was selected to study the effects of livestock grazing on water quality because it offers a unique morphologic situation due to its karstic hydrogeology draining the upland grazing areas through karstic springs. Mass balance calculations of N loads indicated that organic N is behaving as a conservative substance. It is postulated that the two potential mechanisms of Mineralization–Immobilization-Turnover and Direct Uptake did not operate in the degraded soils of the karst and arguments are presented justifying the hypothesis. De-vegetated soils of the area had lower C and N content, the same bacterial count, but lower microbial activity, lower fungi counts and species richness and lower mineralizable N compared to naturally vegetated soils. DON was the predominant N species in both extracted soluble N pools. De-vegetated soils had lower decomposition potential compared to vegetated soils. Mineralization and plant uptake appeared to be restricted and leaching of soluble low aromaticity organic matter was favored. A linear relationship between DON export and livestock N load was obtained for five Greek basins suggesting a mechanism that operates on regional scales. The de-vegetation of grazing lands in Koiliaris River highland calcaric leptosols was shown to be a primary factor causing the decline of soil biochemical quality and DON can be used as a reliable indicator for livestock grazing impacts to soil biochemical quality.";"Stamati, Fotini E.

Available reconstructions focus on the net area difference between two time steps (net changes) instead of accounting for all area gains and losses (gross changes). This leads to a serious underestimation of land‐cover/use dynamics with impacts on the biogeochemical and environmental assessments based on these reconstructions. In this study, we quantified to what extent land‐cover/use reconstructions underestimate land‐cover/use changes in Europe for the 1900–2010 period by accounting for net changes only. We empirically analyzed available historic land‐change data, quantified their uncertainty, corrected for spatial‐temporal effects and identified underlying processes causing differences between gross and net changes. Gross changes varied for different land classes (largest for forest and grassland) and led to two to four times the amount of net changes. We applied the empirical results of gross change quantities in a spatially explicit reconstruction of historic land change to reconstruct gross changes for the EU27 plus Switzerland at 1 km spatial resolution between 1950 and 2010. In addition, the reconstruction was extended back to 1900 to explore the effects of accounting for gross changes on longer time scales. We created a land‐change reconstruction that only accounted for net changes for comparison. Our two model outputs were compared with five commonly used global reconstructions for the same period and area. In our reconstruction, gross changes led in total to a 56% area change (ca. 0.5% yr⁻¹) between 1900 and 2010 and cover twice the area of net changes. All global reconstructions used for comparison estimated fewer changes than our gross change reconstruction. Main land‐change processes were cropland/grassland dynamics and afforestation, and also deforestation and urbanization.";"Fuchs, Richard

"AGRIS:US201500217590";"Systems approach to pro-poor land reforms: A concept paper";"";"There has been renewed interest in the academic discourse on land reforms due to recent high profile works suggesting a positive correlation between reforms and poverty reduction. Land is held under different tenure regimes in different regions, countries and communities. These are often in the form of community tenure, state tenure, individual tenure or a mixture of two or three of them. However, land reformers are in constant debate as to which of the three offers the most appropriate pathway to poverty reduction. The policy outcomes of such debates have been to superimpose one tenure option over the other in differing situations. This article conceptualises a metaphorical approach to land reforms grounded on general systems theory. It advocates for contextualised methodological rigour and an approach to land reforms reliant on the influencing variables of alternative land tenure regimes as opposed to wanton superimposition of one form of tenure over the other.";"Anaafo, David";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"poverty;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217590";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2013.04.016";"";"";"";"421-426"
"AGRIS:US201500217591";"Is land cover an important asset for addressing the subjective landscape dimensions?";"";"This paper explores which physical landscape components relate to subjective landscape dimensions. The ways in which people describe their surrounding cultural landscape was analyzed through an assessment of their representations of it. A special focus was placed on assessing the role of land cover as a means to communicate landscape meanings regarding a specific geographical region. The methodological framework was built on the basis of a questionnaire survey, multivariate statistical analysis and mapping approaches. This research shows that there is a set of physical landscape components that relate to subjective landscape dimensions which can be disclosed through the assessment of social representations. Enhancing and safeguarding those physical landscape components associated with the subjective landscape dimensions are important aspects in both framing and targeting land cover/use policies and decision making. Results also suggest that land cover can be understood as an important asset for describing landscapes as more than 30% of respondents referred to it when asked to represent the case study region of Alentejo in southern Portugal. This might mean that in addition to objective ecological and biological functions, land cover is also an important asset for evaluating subjective landscape dimensions in line with place attachment and landscape identity. Finally, the ways in which the empirical material gathered here can be used to inform policy and planning are explored.";"Carvalho-Ribeiro, Sónia

"AGRIS:US201500217593";"Pushing back the frontiers of property: Community land trusts and low-income housing in urban Kenya";"";"Property lies at the heart of the urban development process. While it creates the wealth needed to finance the urban economy, property can also be a source of disenfranchisement, especially among those unable to cope with the rules set by the market and facilitated by government policy. The hegemony of individual property particularly presents a paradox. Whereas individualised tenure theoretically confers the highest possible benefits in the property rights bundle, individualisation can also precipitate a wave of dispossession among poor households unable to neither meet stringent development regulations nor withstand market vicissitudes. This paper explores the possibility of developing alternative forms of property capable of meeting the practical housing needs of the urban poor. Specifically, the paper discusses the community land trust (CLT) as an innovative form of property capable of facilitating low-income housing provision. Based on an analysis of the Tanzania-Bondeni community land trust recently implemented in Voi, we argue that CLTs constitute a powerful innovation for low-income housing provision in urban Kenya. However, CLTs employ an intricate legal framework and institutional design that can be daunting, while their long-term success demands community commitment and effective leadership that may be hard to guarantee.";"Midheme, Emmanuel

"AGRIS:US201500217596";"Institutionalization of common land property in Portugal: Tragic trends between “Commons” and “Anticommons”";"";"The use and exploitation of natural resources is generally structured by institutions, especially by property institutions. The main objective of this paper is to present a diachronic analysis of the institutionalization of common land property in Portugal. The several types of ownership may be largely explained by common land history. We intend to draw an outline of the emergence, evolution and transition of common land from the late nineteenth century to the present day, using the matrix proposed by Heller. The economic problem of the optimal level of appropriation is recurrent in studies that analyze the economic implications of property rights. Thus, it is imperative to analyze whether or not the dimension of common land ownership is relevant to its efficient exploitation. In essence, we infer that common land ownership in the 1st period (1850–1926) may be classified as limited-access commons (limited access to commoners) with a relatively small average size of 50ha. This common land was primarily used for grazing, firewood collecting and shrub extraction. In the second period (1926–1974), the State dictatorship invoked the public interest (forest easements) and took possession of more than 80% of common land, promoting the transition from limited-access commons to state ownership. The units of commons were aggregated in forest perimeters for Silviculture activity, the average size being greater than 3400ha. Finally, we analyzed the institutionalization of common land ownership in the period after the democratic revolution on April 25th 1974. We concluded that the incipient legal and institutional frameworks revealed an inability to integrate an effective title to these territories to give way to a better classification of limited-exclusion anticommons. The Heller matrix approach revealed to be a useful tool, however insufficient to study holistically Portuguese common land institutionalization. In our preliminary conclusions the Heller matrix appears to be an ill-posed problem (no continuum). It allows for the reversibility between different property regimes that involve great simplifications in the epistemology of property rights.";"Lopes, Luis Filipe Gomes

This study analyzed the impacts of afforestation of marginal croplands, including potential benefits in the form of carbon sequestration rewards via the Clean Development Mechanism, on the livelihood of commercial farms and rural households by considering their interdependencies via wage-labor relations in irrigated agricultural regions of the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River, Central Asia. A dynamic nonlinear programming model was developed that jointly maximizes profit of farm and net incomes of rural households over a 15-year horizon under conditions of decreasing irrigation water availability and forestry plantations with a single seven-year rotation period. The results showed that the introduction of short-rotation plantation forestry in degraded irrigated croplands can help mitigate the repercussions of water shortages on rural livelihood, while sustaining energy needs, income, and food security. Although income and food consumption of rural households may decline from year two to six after afforestation, the subsequent increase in farm profit following the harvest of tree plantations would be transmitted to rural households through existing wage-labor payment arrangements. The incorporation of fuelwood into labor payment schemes would substitute the use of fossil fuels by rural households and thus substantially decrease their energy expenses and CO₂ emissions. Furthermore, given the low irrigation water demand of trees, afforestation would increase irrigation water availability for more productive croplands.";"Djanibekov, Utkur

They facilitate registration and management of 3D properties and reduction of boundary disputes. They also enable a wide variety of applications that in turn identify detailed and integrated 3D legal and physical objects for property management and city space management (3D land use management). Efficient delivery and implementation of these applications require many elements to support a digital 3D cadastre, such as existing 3D property registration laws, appropriate 3D data acquisition methods, 3D spatial database management systems, and functional 3D visualisation platforms. In addition, an appropriate 3D cadastral data model can also play a key role to ensure successful development of the 3D cadastre. A 3D cadastral data model needs to reflect the complexity and interrelations of 3D legal objects and their physical counterparts. Many jurisdictions have defined their own cadastral data models for legal purposes and have neglected the third dimension, integration of physical counterparts and semantic aspects. To address these problems, this paper aims to investigate why existing cadastral data models do not facilitate effective representation and analysis of 3D data, integration of 3D legal objects with their physical counterparts, and semantics. Then, a 3D cadastral data model (3DCDM) is proposed as a solution to improve the current cadastral data models. The data model is developed based on the ISO standards. UML modelling language is used to specify the data model. The results of this research can be used by cadastral data modellers to improve existing or develop new cadastral data models to support the requirements of 3D cadastres.";"Aien, Ali

A number of transgenes conferring resistance to insects, diseases and herbicide tolerance have been transferred into crop plants from a wide range of plant and bacterial systems. In the majority of the cases, the genes showing expression in transgenic plants are stably inherited into the progeny without detrimental effects on the recipient plant. More interestingly, transgenic plants under field conditions have also maintained increased levels of insect resistance. Now, transgenic crops occupy 44.2 million hectares on global basis. During the last 15 years, transformations have been produced in more than 100 plant species; notable examples include maize, wheat, soybean, tomato, potato, cotton, rice, etc. Amongst these herbicide tolerant and insect tolerant cotton, maize and soybean carrying Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes are grown on a commercial scale. Genetic transformation and gene transfer are routine in many laboratories. However, isolation of useful genes and their expression to the desired level to control insect pests still involves considerable experimentation and resources. Developing pest resistant varieties by insertion of a few or single specific gene(s) is becoming an important component of breeding. Use of endotoxin genes such as Bt and plant derived genes (proteinase inhibitors) to the desired levels offers new opportunities to control insects and strategies involving combination of genes. Transgenic technology should be integrated in a total system approach for ecologically friendly and sustainable pest management. Issues related to Intellectual property rights, regulatory concerns, and public perceptions for release of transgenics need to be considered. Providing wealth of information on gene expression in higher plants by switching the gene on and off as and when required, makes gene manipulation a more direct process for genetic improvement of crops.";"Mohan Babu, R.

We use a coupled hydrology–entomology model to investigate the effects of land use change on hydrological processes impacting mosquito abundance in a highland village of Ethiopia. Land use affects partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and runoff that reaches small-scale topographic depressions, which constitute the primary breeding habitat of Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes. A physically based hydrology model isolates hydrological mechanisms by which land use impacts pool formation and persistence, and an agent-based entomology model evaluates the response of mosquito populations. This approach reproduced observed interannual variability in mosquito abundance between the 2009 and 2010 wet seasons. Several scenarios of land cover were then evaluated using the calibrated, field-validated model. Model results show variation in pool persistence and depth, as well as in mosquito abundance, due to land use changes alone. The model showed particular sensitivity to surface roughness, but also to root zone uptake. Scenarios in which land use was modified from agriculture to forest generally resulted in lowest mosquito abundance predictions; classification of the entire domain as rainforest produced a 34% decrease in abundance compared to 2010 results. This study also showed that in addition to vegetation type, spatial proximity of land use change to habitat locations has an impact on mosquito abundance. This modeling approach can be applied to assess impacts of climate and land use conditions that fall outside of the range of previously observed variability.";"Stryker, Jody J.

From 1997 to 2004, 14 wolves (11 in a wolf-saturated area and three in a low-density area) were radio-collared with long-lasting transmitters in a Spanish agricultural area containing a high-human-population density, a dense network of roads and a shortage of wild ungulates. The wolves mainly feed on an overabundance of livestock carrion. Nine wolves (one of them, three times) dispersed during the study period. The mean age and distance of natal dispersal were 24.8 months and 32 km. The natal dispersal period was much longer in wolves radio-collared in the saturated area (mean >14.6 months) than in the low-density area (<1 month). All three of the dispersers living in the low-density area, and two of the six dispersers in the saturated area settled and bred during the study. The average tenure of six breeders was 4.5 years. The radio-collared wolves spent 72% of the monitoring time living in packs and the rest living in pairs, as dispersers or as peripheral wolves, but the percentage of loners was much higher in the saturated (33.5%) than in the low density (1.6%) areas. The overall annual mortality was 18% (lower than in most populations studied in less modified habitats), but lone wolves had a significantly higher mortality than members of packs and pairs. Nine wolves died during the study, none of them due to natural causes. In general, our results are very similar to those obtained in less modified habitats, except for the dispersal distance, which was much shorter than in other studies. We suggest that barriers and habitat constraints may reduce dispersal distances in our study area.";"Blanco, J.C.

"AGRIS:US201400168456";"Estimating influence of stocking regimes on livestock grazing distributions";"";"Livestock often concentrate grazing in particular regions of landscapes while partly or wholly avoiding other regions. Dispersing livestock from the heavily grazed regions is a central challenge in grazing land management. Position data gathered from GPS-collared livestock hold potential for increasing knowledge of factors driving livestock aggregation patterns, but advances in gathering the data have outpaced advancements in analyzing and learning from it. We fit a hierarchical seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model to explore how season of stocking and the location where cattle entered a pasture influenced grazing distributions. Stocking alternated between summer on one side of the pasture one year and fall on another side of the pasture the next year for 18 years. Waypoints were recorded on cattle for 50d each year. We focused our analysis on the pasture's 10 most heavily grazed 4-ha units, because these units were the most prone to negative grazing impacts. Though grazing of the study units was always disproportionately heavy, it was much heavier with the summer than fall stocking regime: Bayesian confidence intervals indicate summer grazing of study units was approximately double the average fall grazing value. This is our core result, and it illustrates the strong effect stocking season or date or both can have on grazing distributions. We fit three additional models to explore the relative importance of stocking season versus location. According to this analysis, stocking season played a role, but stocking location was the main driver. Ostensibly minor factors (e.g. stocking location) can greatly influence livestock distributions.";"Rinella, Matthew J.

These results are primarily downscaled from the national or regional scale to a spatial resolution appropriate for environmental impact analysis. Different studies represent the interactions between the economic and geographic components of the land system in different ways. This paper explores how interactions between economic and geographic aspects of the land system can be strengthened in modelling studies. It does so by comparing two existing approaches (CLUE and Capri-Spat) for the European Union (EU27). CLUE focuses on disaggregating national level changes in claims for agricultural and urban area to a 1km×1km grid, explicitly addressing consequences of changing demands for agricultural and urban area for other land uses such as (semi-) natural vegetation. Whereas, CAPRI-Spat is concerned with agricultural land use, disaggregating cropping shares, animal stocking densities, yield and agricultural input use for mapping units. The mapping units are clusters of 1km×1km pixels considered homogenous in terms of soil, slope, land cover and administrative region. This paper discusses differences between the two models relating to geographical units, distribution algorithm and most importantly diverging interpretation of ‘agricultural land’, in relationship to their respective concepts and objectives. It concludes that a stronger integration of the geographic and economic aspects can be achieved by linking the overall land use dynamics simulated by CLUE to the detailed representation of the agricultural sector by CAPRI-Spat. Therefore, relative changes in land use classes at 1km×1km resolution obtained from CLUE simulations update a priori means in CAPRI-Spat entering a Highest Posterior Density Estimator. The findings of this study contribute to our overall capacity to integrate approaches from different disciplines in the integrated analysis of land change and the ex ante assessment of environmental and economic effects of agricultural policies.";"Britz, Wolfgang

The use of the remote sensing techniques in LULC changes detection brings consistency and reliability to the decision maker at regional scale. Three temporal data sets of images were used to obtain the land cover changes in this study: Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) acquired in 1984, and Landsat-7 enhanced Thematic Mapper acquired in 2000 and 2005 consequently. Each temporal data set consists of four Landsat scenes, which were mosaicked to cover the whole Nile Delta. Two different supervised classification algorithms were implemented to produce classification maps in thematic form. Support vector machine showed higher classification accuracies in comparison with maximum likelihood classification. The results indicated that the rapid imbalance changes occurred among three land cover classes (urban, desert, and agricultural land). These changes powered the land degradation and land fragmentation processes over the agricultural land exclusively due to urban encroachment. Slight land cover changes were detected between fish farms and surface water land cover classes.";"Elhag, Mohamed

Here, we examine how PADDD affects deforestation and forest carbon emissions. We documented 174 enacted and 8 proposed PADDD events affecting more than 48,000 km² in three REDD+ priority countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malaysia, and Peru. Where sufficient data were available, we estimated deforestation rates and the quantity and economic value of forest carbon already lost and at risk in three land tenure classes: PADDDed, protected, and never‐protected. PADDDed forests experienced deforestation and forest carbon emissions greatly exceeding rates in protected areas and slightly exceeding rates in never‐protected forests. PADDD represents business‐as‐usual for protected areas, posing substantial risk to forests and forest carbon stocks. REDD+ policies have substantive implications for protected area biodiversity and forest carbon emissions; the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ provides new, but insufficient, guidance for nations to address these issues.";"Forrest, Jessica L.

Profit maximising agents which choose between forestry and agricultural land uses were simulated under carbon price scenarios of $20, $50 and $0 per tonne CO₂ equivalent. The model suggests that an ETS will lead to increased afforestation and rotation age, and decreased silviculture and deforestation. A $20 carbon price or higher led to an overall increase in carbon sequestration by the forestry sector, driven predominantly by afforestation on lower fertility sites. Higher carbon prices increase the range of available land for planting. Future carbon price expectancy was critical. Rising carbon price expectancy led to large scale afforestation, but also to significant deforestation. A falling expectancy prevented deforestation but also stifled afforestation. The most sustainable solution was a stable carbon price expectancy allowing land to consistently work towards an economically optimal use. The recommendation of this report is for policy which promotes a stable long-run carbon price and flexibility for change between land uses. Suggestions include a guaranteed maximum carbon price, or allowing a forest to be felled at reduced penalty if another is concurrently planted.";"Adams, Thomas

To determine where and why fires occur, the natural and cultural landscape features that influence the location of fires were analysed. We investigated the probability of fire occurrence as a function of predisposing conditions and ignition sources, such as land use, land use zoning, accessibility or land cover, to understand the spatial determinants of fires. The study area is the entire province of Jambi, central Sumatra, Indonesia. This province has a diverse setting of actors (small- and large-holders), land cover types and land uses. Fires were extracted for 1992/1993 from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) satellite data. The results of the spatial statistical analysis show that fire occurrence in Jambi Province in 1992/1993 was determined both by predisposing conditions (mostly climate, elevation and suitability for specific tree crops) and human-related causes (presence of transmigration projects and land allocation to specific land uses). National policies are thus a major driving forces of fires through land allocation. Road accessibility is only an important determinant of fires in forests. Few fires seem to be accidental. While logging companies control fire during their exploitation of concessions, logged-over forests and forests allocated to production but not yet under use have many fires. In 1992/1993, large- and small-holders were likely to be both responsible for fire occurrence. These results highlight the large influence of land use and policies on vegetation fires in Indonesia.";"Stolle, F.

In northern China, the central goal of the program is to entice sustainable transitions in resource uses through subsidizing cropland afforestation and grassland exclosure. This study, based on a household survey in Shabianzi, an agropastoral community in the Mu Us Sandy Land, examines farmers' responses to and the environmental outcome of the GTGP. Results show that through intensification of maize production, farmers were able to assimilate the impact of grassland exclosure, and the new resource use system fosters closer linkage between crop and livestock production. As a result, sheep population in the community shows a steady recovery after the program, hogs experience a sharp increase, while goats register an abrupt decline. Improved household economy resulted from increased livestock offtake rates diminishes pressure on subsistence cultivation, and average household landholding has been stabilized at ∼1.0-1.2ha. Grassland exclosure is almost universally violated through surreptitious herding; but grazing intensity has been reduced, which leads to vegetation recovery and an improvement in the local environment. Similar transitions are observable within the Mu Us Sandy Land, demonstrating these successful stories are not site-specific, but represent a general pattern. These “islands of sustainability” stress the importance of pathway(s) undertaken by local farmers in understanding the environmental outcomes of the GTGP.

Therefore, the objective of this paper was to assess the determinants of food security under changing land use and land management systems—from communal to private investment—using household survey data collected from pastoral and agro-pastoral communities. The data were analyzed using ordinary least-square econometric analysis. The results showed that having sufficient land for crop farming, competition over land for private use, number of plots, use of improved seeds, access to infrastructure, and distance from main markets have a negative impact on food security. However, conflict with neighbors and use of crop residue as livestock feed have a positive impact on food security; impacts were also shown to affect geographically distributed pastoral and agro-pastoral communities differently. There are a number of constraints associated with such land-use changes in order to improve land productivity on privately held land, including unstable market prices, reducing the benefits from irrigated farming, moisture stress where pastoral land classified as arable suffers from water unavailability and expansion of gullies resulting in abandonment of farmland. In conclusion, land conversion to encourage pastoralists to take up sedentary farming to ensure food security will only accelerate rangeland degradation. Therefore, it is imperative that investment in land management be complemented with other interventions, which can thereby increase land productivity, for example, adoption of drought tolerant crops, water harvesting, enhancing pastoralists/agro-pastoralists’ technical knowledge and improved marketing infrastructure.";"Beyene, Fekadu";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land use planning;food security;rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ETH";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600017117";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-014-9596-8";"";"";"";"1163-1182"

We argue that when mining heritage sites are read as evolved organic landscapes and linked to the surrounding forested and hedged farmland, the disruptive aspects of mining are masked. Cultural landscape is now a separate listing for World Heritage sites and includes associative and designed landscape as well as those that have evolved organically. These usages have rarely been scrutinized with care. We analyse how mid-nineteenth century goldmining sites can be best thematically interpreted and understood for their heritage, indeed World Heritage, significance and, where appropriate, developed for their sustainable heritage tourism potential. Drawing on a number of research disciplines, a schematic framework is offered for interpreting and classifying these new world cultural landscapes based upon analysis of gold-rush heritage sites throughout the Trans-Tasman world.

This approach aims at nature protection that balances both conservation and growth, creating livable environments and maintaining open spaces. In Istanbul, the functional and spatial connectivity of greenways can protect the local landscape against urbanization and population growth problems. This study aimed to emphasize the natural and cultural heritage in an ecologically based planning approach. After taking into consideration the current greenway planning process in Europe and America, a planning strategy was determined for Haliç reflecting all characteristics of Istanbul and possibly representing the first greenway example in the city. Haliç was degraded by industrialization, urbanization, migration and inappropriate land use plans through the ages and existing greenway corridors had disappeared. As a result, current greenway planning strategies were foreseen as a solution to prevent threats to heritage and re-emphasize the lost identity of Haliç. It was emphasized as the starting point of a greenway plan that could be applied for Istanbul in general.";"Hoşgör, Zerrin

We find that competition reducelers adjust for a possible winner’s curse by increasing their bids by roughly 10 percent over their reservation values. Using the inferred reservation values, we compare this program to an alternative take-it-or-leave-it offer.

However, little is known about the impact of grazing on spatial patterns of vegetation and soil, even though grazing has variously been shown to create, maintain or destroy those patterns. We studied how grazing intensity affected the spatial patterns of vegetation and soil fertility at scales ranging from 0.1 to 18.7m in a desert steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. Increasing grazing intensity decreased the range of spatial autocorrelation of plant aboveground biomass at the fine scale (<2m), indicating that vegetation patches were more fragmented under higher grazing pressure. Spatial heterogeneity of soil water content and organic C concentration decreased along the gradient of increasing grazing intensity at the fine scale. Light grazing increased soil NH₄ ⁺ availability and its overall variability. Soil NO₃ ⁻ only had significant cross-correlation with aboveground biomass in un-grazed plots at the fine scale, suggesting that the spatial correlation between plant and soil fertility was affected by grazing. Spatial patterns of studied variables did not respond to grazing intensities at a coarse scale (1-18m). Our results demonstrated that the grazing intensity altered fine scale processes in this desert steppe and caused divergent responses of spatial distribution of vegetation and soil fertility.";"Lin, Yang

This study focuses on the Central Rift Valley and explores the potential for co-investments in SLM, where public and private sector partners support farmers with material, capital, knowledge, etc. A survey revealed current bottlenecks for co-investments and requirements needed to collaboratively invest in SLM. It covered 165 public sector partners (micro-, meso- and macro-level institutions) and 42 private sector partners (banks, exporters and local traders). Results for the public sector show a gap between macro- and micro-/meso-level actors concerning co-investments in SLM. Macro-level institutions do not acknowledge the bottlenecks identified by micro- and meso-level institutions (e.g. lack of accountability, top-down approaches and lack of good leadership). Similarly, opinions on requirements for co-investments in SLM differ considerably, showing that bridging the institutional micro–macro gap is crucial to co-investments. Most factors are related to the wider governance context and to different perceptions among micro- and macro-level actors as to the critical pre-conditions to co-investment in SLM. Improving governance at all institutional levels, capacity building and enhancing a common understanding on barriers to SLM is required. Results for the private sector reveal that economic bottlenecks limit possibilities to co-invest in SLM, and that enabling policies in the public sphere are required to trigger private investments. Hence, the potential for co-investments in SLM is available in Ethiopia at micro- and meso-level and within the private sector, but profound commitment and fundamental policy changes at the macro-level are required to exploit this potential.";"Adimassu, Zenebe

The term regolith encompasses soil (A and B horizons) and highly weathered bedrock (C horizon). The thickness of the regolith has a major control on water holding capacity for plant growth and movement of water through the landscape, and as such is important in hydropedological modelling and in evaluating land suitability, e.g. for forestry and agriculture. Thickness estimates also have direct application in mineral exploration and seismic risk assessment. Geology and landscape evolution within the study area is complex, reflecting the variable nature of bedrock materials, and the partial preservation of deeply weathered profiles as a consequence of weathering processes dating to the Cenozoic, or possibly older. These characteristics, together with strong climatic gradients, make the study area an ideal location to understand environmental and landscape evolution controls on weathering depth. The area also features weathered landscape analogues to many parts of southern Australia. We use a digital soil mapping rules based approach to develop a model to predict regolith thickness. This model uses statistically-based relationships established between 714 regolith thickness measurements and 29 geographic environmental covariates including geology, geochemistry, terrain and climate themes, and with a ground resolution of 10m. Accuracy testing based on a 75:25% training:test data split on the resulting map established a correlation R² of 0.64. This result is encouraging and is a significant advance over regolith depth mapping by traditionally-based regolith-landscape mapping methods. Finally, it leads the way towards a nationally consistent regolith thickness map for landscape scale environmental simulation modelling and decision support.";"Wilford, J.

The primary objectives of this study were to determine the influence of woody plant expansion on soil carbon (C), soil nitrogen (N), and roots to a depth of 15 cm along a 42-year (1963-2005) chronosequence encompassing grassland, woodland, and transition zones in a northern Great Plains grassland. From these data, we also estimated ecosystem-level soil C and N changes associated with woody plant expansion in the top 0-15 cm of soil. We found total soil C increased across the chronosequence from grassland (5,070±250 g C m-2) to woodland (6,370±390 g C m-2) (P<0.05) at 0-15 cm soil depth. Total soil N also increased from grassland to woodland (425±16 to 556±30 g N m-2) (P<0.05) at 0-15 cm soil depth. Coarse particulate organic matter C and N increased from grassland to woodland (940±100 to 598±35 g C m-2, 70±10 to 35±1 g N m-2) at 0-5 cm soil depth. At the ecosystem-level, we estimate C and N accumulations at 0-15 cm soil depth are occurring at a rate of 18 and 1.7 g m-2 year-1, respectively. Results of this study suggest soil resources, namely soil C and N, in the northern Great Plains are changing following woody plant expansion.";"Springsteen, Anna

The performance of the multi-temporal texture was evaluated and compared with the use of multi-temporal spectral data alone and plus the traditional variogram texture in land cover classification using bitemporal hyperspectral Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer/Project for On Board Autonomy (CHRIS/PROBA) images. The results show that although land cover classification using spectral information from bitemporal CHRIS/PROBA data alone had an acceptable overall accuracy of 85.66%, the inclusion of multi-temporal texture in land cover classification led to significant increases (at the 95% confidence level) in both overall accuracy (3.3–4.3% improvement) and the kappa coefficient (4.9–6.6% improvement), particularly for vegetation classes. The incorporation of multi-temporal texture into multi-temporal land cover classification also outperformed the incorporation of the traditional variogram texture. The proposed method provides a new way to exploit the temporal correlation between bitemporal images for improved land cover classification.";"Jin, Huiran

"AGRIS:US201400159920";"Segmenting landholders for improving the targeting of natural resource management expenditures";"";"Segmentation of landholders has rarely been undertaken in the natural resource management literature, yet it provides a rich set of information for planners to improve targeting of public investment and resources. Segmentation allows the identification of segments of landholders that are ‘investment ready’, their location and characteristics, and the land conservation incentive programmes that they would be most willing to participate in. Segments that are not investment ready are also identified, and the instances where they reside in critical ecological habitats. Further, segmentation analysis provides insight into constraints to participation among these segments. We report the results of a large-scale segmentation exercise involving qualitative research and a quantitative survey of 5904 landholders in Australia. Using several new constructs related to human capital, trust and social connectedness not previously used for segmentation, we find three mainstream and two lifestyle segments which differ substantially in their socio-demographics and their propensity to be involved in incentive programmes.";"Morrison, Mark

The land cover distribution observed in Italy in 1960, 1990, and 2006 was compared with trends in annual precipitation and the aridity index estimated during 1951–2007. Annual rainfall decreased by 0.41% per year during the examined period with the consequent increase in the aridity index (0.48% per year). Both rainfall decrease and aridity increase followed a non-uniform spatial distribution impacting differently the Mediterranean landscape mosaic. Land cover classes with higher precipitation rates and moderate to low aridity regimes experienced larger climate variations. Natural and semi-natural areas (including forests, shrublands, pastures, mountain zones with glaciers and rocky areas) resulted as the most vulnerable to climate aridity. Croplands were associated to moderately dry conditions in 1951–1960 but underwent only mild climate variations during the following fifty years. Results may inform sustainable regional planning for peri-urban and rural land experiencing aridity and contribute to the implementation of national action plans against climate changes in the Mediterranean basin.";"Salvati, Luca

However, struggles in the recent past have been clearly delineated as striving to not merely gain access to land for cultivation, but also to claim formal individual titles to parcels of land. Taking this as the point of departure, a study was undertaken with the objective of assessing the willingness to pay (WTP) for obtaining management rights as well as individual titles to land among the indigenous people in Kerala, using the contingent valuation method (CVM). Two types of land market exist in the region: the adivasi land market and the general land market. The adivasi land market is imperfect and transactions are restricted to within the indigenous population. This study shows that indigenous people are willing to pay a higher amount than the existing market price for adivasi lands. The WTP for obtaining formal management rights for adivasi land is estimated to be 20.75 per cent of the existing general land market price while the WTP for obtaining formal ownership rights is 32.63 per cent.";"Veettil, Prakashan Chellattan

"AGRIS:US201301825107";"potential of Estonian semi-natural grasslands for bioenergy production";"";"High biodiversity of Estonian semi-natural grasslands can only be maintained through continuous management. One option for the usage of biomass from these areas is bioenergy production, if both the herbaceous biomass yield and the chemical characteristics of the cut meet the needs. In 2007 the largest average annual biomass yield per area was achieved in floodplain meadows (5.7tdrymass/ha), which also have the highest potential for biomass production among Estonian semi-natural grasslands (more than 113,000tdrymass). The area of mesic meadows is larger, but due to lower average yield per area (2.5tdrymass/ha), the potential of this meadow type was less than half of that of floodplain meadows (53,000tdrymass). The corresponding numbers for wooded meadows were 1.6tdrymass/ha and 12,000tdrymass, respectively. Chemical characteristics of herbaceous biomass from wooded meadows significantly differed from mesic and floodplain meadows, giving the highest values of Ca, K, Mg, crude protein and ash (1.3%, 2.4%, 0.3%, 10.9% and 9.5% of the dry biomass, respectively). The energetic value of the biomass from different meadow types varied between 18.1kJ/g and 18.6kJ/g. Therefore, various options for bioenergy conversion should be considered depending on the local plant community and restrictions to the harvest time.";"Heinsoo, Katrin

Soil CO₂ efflux was measured in 2003 and 2004 in seven beech plots differing in terms of soil type and leaf area index. After eliminating temporal fluctuations due to soil temperature and soil water content, standardized soil CO₂ efflux varied significantly among plots over a large range given the homogeneity of the land cover type. Correlation analyses revealed that this spatial variability could not be explained by root biomass, litter C content, soil C contents, stand basal area or stem density. Conversely, very significant correlations were found with topsoil bulk density, superficial soil C/N ratio, and leaf area index. Multiple regression analysis led to a model relating standardized soil CO₂ efflux to C/N ratio and topsoil bulk density, thus explaining 87% of observed inter-plot spatial variability. This study highlighted the need to consider spatially varying soil factors such as C/N ratio and bulk density when experimental schemes are elaborated to estimate mean soil CO₂ efflux at forest scale.";"Ngao, Jérôme

"AGRIS:US201600195660";"implications of a changing climate on agricultural land classification in England and Wales";"";"The agricultural land classification (ALC) of England and Wales is a formal method of assessing the quality of agricultural land and guiding future land use. It assesses several soil, site and climate criteria and classifies land according to whichever is the most limiting. A common approach is required for calculating the necessary agroclimatic parameters over time in order to determine the effects of changes in the climate on land grading. In the present paper, climatic parameters required by the ALC classification have been re-calculated from a range of primary climate data, available from the Meteorological Office's UKCP09 historical dataset, provided as 5Â km rasters for every month from 1914 to 2000. Thirty-year averages of the various agroclimatic properties were created for 1921â50, 1931â60, 1941â70, 1951â80, 1961â90 and 1971â2000. Soil records from the National Soil Inventory on a 5Â km grid across England and Wales were used to determine the required soil and site parameters for determining ALC grade. Over the 80-year period it was shown that the overall climate was coolest during 1951â80. However, the area of land estimated in retrospect as âbest and most versatile (BMV) landâ (Grades 1, 2 and 3a) probably peaked in the 1951â80 period as the cooler climate resulted in fewer droughty soils, more than offsetting the land which was downgraded by the climate being too cold. Overall there has been little change in the proportions of ALC grades among the six periods once all 10 factors (climate, gradient, flooding, texture, depth, stoniness, chemical, soil wetness, droughtiness and erosion) are taken into account. This is because it is rare for changes in climate variables all to point in the same direction in terms of ALC. Thus, a reduction in rainfall could result in higher grades in wetter areas but lead to lower classification in drier areas.";"KEAY, C. A.

Detection of incipient populations of this pest is difficult because of its cryptic life stages and a multiyear time lag between initial attack and the appearance of signs or symptoms of infestation. We sampled branches from open-grown urban ash trees to develop a sample unit suitable for detecting low density A. planipennis infestation before any signs or symptoms are evident. The sample unit that maximized detection rates consisted of one 50-cm-long piece from the base of a branch ≥6 cm diameter in the midcrown. The optimal sample size was two such branches per tree. This sampling method detected ≈75% of asymptomatic trees known to be infested by using more intensive sampling and ≈3 times more trees than sampling one-fourth of the circumference of the trunk at breast height. The method is less conspicuous and esthetically damaging to a tree than the removal of bark from the main stem or the use of trap trees, and could be incorporated into routine sanitation or maintenance of city-owned trees to identify and delineate infested areas. This research indicates that branch sampling greatly reduces false negatives associated with visual surveys and window sampling at breast height. Detection of A. planipennis-infested asymptomatic trees through branch sampling in urban centers would provide landowners and urban foresters with more time to develop and implement management tactics.";"Ryall, Krista L.

Water temperature, oxygen content, coarse benthic matter and some stonefly metrics (abundance, biomass, richness, index of diversity, % predators, % shredders, stonefly total score and stonefly average score) were all negatively influenced by the extent of urban and field land cover.

We contend that in a context of modern agriculture, with well defined property rights, agricultural contracts must balance costs and benefits, aligning tenant and landlord incentives towards a similar objective. The study debates the potential effects of tenancy status and duration of contracts, over soil conservation and input use. We present empirical evidence about the effects over the soil and input use in tenant (fixed rent or sharecropping) and owner-operator farms using farm level data from the 2002 National Agricultural Census of Argentina. The empirical results show some differential effects but do not support a general and clear negative effect for tenancy arrangements. Our intuition is that the interaction among specific characteristics of farmers (education, experience, assets, etc.), the natural resources endowment (soil fertility) and the economic and institutional environment (labor markets, monitoring costs, property rights, rule of law etc.) are more important factors than the land tenancy or contract type itself.";"Lema, Daniel";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"property rights;agriculture;transaction costs";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ARG";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012209795";"http://purl.umn.edu/25420";"";"";"";""

Land use/cover maps of 1953, 1978 and 2002 were interpreted and analysed within GIS to quantify the shift from forest to rainfed cultivation. Six sites were sampled in a non-changed forest and in cultivated fields, three for each. Different soil properties of texture, bulk density, organic matter, total nitrogen, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), phosphorous and potassium were analysed. Results showed that many forests were changed into cultivated lands at a rate more than the reforestation. Subsequently, adverse effects on the studied physical and chemical properties were observed. The most affected properties were particle size distribution, bulk density of surface soil and subsoil. Organic matter and CEC decreased in cultivated soil as compared to the forest soil. Cultivated soils were found to exhibit a significantly lower status in physical and chemical soil properties as compared to forest soils. This general decline in the soil physical and chemical properties, in turn, contributed to soil erosion, reduction of soil fertility and land degradation.There is an urgent need to improve soil quality by developing sustainable land use practices to reduce the rate of soil degradation and to ensure long-term sustainability of the farming system in the study area and in similar biophysical settings.

We use farm-household survey data in order to compare the productivity of smallholder maize production under integrated (ISFM) and chemicalbased soil fertility management using a normalized translog yield response model. The results indicate higher maize yield responses for integrated soil fertility management options after controlling for the intensity of fertilizer application, labour intensity, seed rate as well as land husbandry practices a s well as selected policy factors. The estimated model is highly consistent with theoretical conditions. Thus we conclude that the use of ISFM improves maize productivity, compared to the use of inorganic fertilizer only. Since most farmers in the maize-based farming systems are crowded out of the agricultural input market and can hardly afford optimal quantities of inorganic fertilizer, enhancement of ISFM is likely to increase their maize productivity. We finally highlight areas of policy support needed to enhance ISFM uptake in smallholder maize-based farming systems.";"Sauer, Johannes

"AGRIS:US201600003825";"Understanding Variability in Adaptive Capacity on Rangelands";"";"The art and science of developing effective policies and practices to enhance sustainability and adapt to new climate conditions on rangelands and savannas are typically founded on addressing the “average” or “typical” resource user. However, this assumption is flawed since it does not appreciate the extent of diversity among resource users; it risks that strategies will be irrelevant for many people and ignored, and that the grazing resource itself will remain unprotected. Understanding social heterogeneity is vital for effective natural resource management. Our aim was to understand the extent to which graziers in the northern Australian rangelands varied in their capacity to adapt to climate variability and recommended practices. Adaptive capacity was assessed according to four dimensions: 1) the perception of risk, 2) skills in planning, learning and reorganising, 3) financial and emotional flexibility, and 4) interest in adapting. We conducted 100 face-to-face interviews with graziers in their homes obtaining a 97% response rate. Of the 16 possible combinations that the four dimensions represent, we observed that all combinations were present in the Burdekin. Any single initiative to address grazing land management practices in the region is unlikely to address the needs of all graziers. Rather, policies could be tailored to type-specific needs based on adaptive capacity. Efforts to shift graziers from very low, low, or moderate levels of adaptive capacity are urgently needed. We suggest some strategies.";"Marshall, Nadine A.

Based on simulations using well calibrated and validated Carbon Exchanges in the Vegetation-Soil-Atmosphere (CEVSA) model, temporal and spatial variations in carbon storage and fluxes in China may be generated empower us to relate these variations to climate variability and LULC with respect to net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (HR), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), storage and soil carbon (SOC), and vegetation carbon (VEGC) individually or collectively. Overall, the increases in NPP were greater than HR in most cases due to the effect of global warming with more precipitation in China from 1981 to 2000. With this trend, the NEP remained positive during that period, resulting in a net increase of total amount of carbon being stored by about 0.296 PgC within a 20-year time frame. Because the climate effect was much greater than that of changes of LULC, the total carbon storage in China actually increased by about 0.17 PgC within the 20-year time period. Such findings will contribute to the generation of carbon emissions control policies under global climate change impacts.";"Gao, Zhiqiang

Parallel to thismarket-driven development, the Kazakhstani government tries to promote other institutionalarrangements that it deems to be of superior competitiveness, especially agro-food clusters.Refering to Hayek’s concept of pretence of knowledge and empirical evidence of cluster facilitationpolicies of other countries the success of the Kazakhstani cluster initiative is questioned.";"Wandel, Jurgen";"Balmann,   Alfons;Glauben,   Thomas;Muller,   Daniel;Buchenrieder,   Gertrud;Hockmann,   Heinrich;Petrick,   Martin;Brosig,   Stephan";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"KAZ";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016203651";"http://purl.umn.edu/91766";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400151330";"Changes of net primary productivity in China during recent 11 years detected using an ecological model driven by MODIS data";"";"Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Accurately mapping the spatial-temporal variations of NPP in China is crucial for global carbon cycling study. In this study the process-based Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) was employed to study the changes of NPP in China’s ecosystems for the period from 2000 to 2010. The BEPS model was first validated using gross primary productivity (GPP) measured at typical flux sites and forest NPP measured at different regions. Then it was driven with leaf area index (LAI) inversed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance and land cover products and meteorological data interpolated from observations at 753 national basic meteorological stations to simulate NPP at daily time steps and a spatial resolution of 500 m from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010. Validations show that BEPS is able to capture the seasonal variations of tower-based GPP and the spatial variability of forest NPP in different regions of China. Estimated national total of annual NPP varied from 2.63 to 2.84Pg C·yr⁻¹, averaging 2.74 Pg C·yr⁻¹ during the study period. Simulated terrestrial NPP shows spatial patterns decreasing from the east to the west and from the south to the north, in association with land cover types and climate. South-west China makes the largest contribution to the national total of NPP while NPP in the North-west account for only 3.97% of the national total. During the recent 11 years, the temporal changes of NPP were heterogamous. NPP increased in 63.8% of China’s landmass, mainly in areas north of the Yangtze River and decreased in most areas of southern China, owing to the low temperature freezing in early 2008 and the severe drought in late 2009.";"Liu, Yibo

"AGRIS:US2016209868";"Potential directions in land estate policy (Debate summary)";"A földbirtok-politika lehetséges irányai (Az eddigi vita összefoglalása)";"A „Gazdálkodás” 2010. évi 2. számában vitacikkem jelent meg „A földbirtok-politikaválaszt igénylő kérdései” címen. Ezzel az volt a célom, hogy a témakörrel kapcsolatban felvessek kérdéseket, leírjak megállapításokat, és ezzel egy olyan vitát generáljak, ami fórumot ad a tudományos közélet szereplőinek a megszólalásra, a vélemények ütköztetésére, egymás nézeteinek jobb megértésére, a politika számára javaslatok megfogalmazására. A vitában az agrárgazdaságtan, üzemtan képviselői és mások kifejthették a véleményüket olyan fontos birtokpolitikai kérdésekkel kapcsolatban, mint a földtulajdon, a földhasználat, a földbérlet, a földpiac, a mezőgazdasági üzemszabályozás, a tagosítás, a föld öröklése, a külföldiek földhöz jutása, az állam szerepvállalása és ennek eszközrendszere. Már a vitaindító gondolatok megfogalmazásakor meggyőződésem volt, hogy a témakört a lehető legszélesebben kell felvetni, mert a birtokpolitika megalkotása komplex megközelítést igényel. Ennek nemcsak szakmai indokai vannak, hanem praktikus okai is: minél szélesebben vetjük fel ugyanis ezt a politikailag igencsak érzékenytémát, annál több felületet találunk a kompromisszumokra, a megegyezésre, ahonnan el lehet kezdeni a közös munkát. A komplex megközelítés szükségességét igazolja Csete László és Barcza Gabriella vita során tett megállapítása is: „a földkérdés a tulajdonlásra szűkítve önmagában nem, csak hosszabb távra előre tekintve, összefüggéseiben oldható meg.” Az elmúlt év februári vitaindítást az magyarázta, hogy már akkor érezni lehetett, a 2010. évi választás jelentős fordulatot hoz a rendszerváltás utáni magyar politikában. Ennek egyik markáns területe lesz az agrárpolitika, és ennek fő meghatározója, a birtokpolitika. Tarthatatlanná vált az az állapot – és ezt a vita szinte valamennyi résztvevője visszaigazolta –, hogy az elmúlt évtizedek kormányainak egyikében sem kapott stratégiai, szociális és környezetfenntartó jelentőségének megfelelő figyelmet a vidék és az agrárgazdaság. (Ebben a sorban talán csak az első Orbán-kormány kapott némi felmentést Alvincztól, Barczától és Csetétől.) Márpedig ha fókuszba kerülnek az agrár- és birtokpolitika kérdései, a jelenlegi nehéz helyzetből a kitörést egy azonos irányba húzó csapat, egy közösség, az agrártársadalom együttes véleményalkotása segítheti. Ehhez a munkához – ha úgy tetszik, stratégiaalkotáshoz – kívánt szerény eszközeivel hátteret adni ez a vita, hogy megerősítse, cáfolja, vagy éppen kiegészítse a politikában megfogalmazott (pre)koncepciókat. Ma már tudott, hogy a földmoratóriumot az Unió 2014-ig meghosszabbítja. Nem kis teljesítménye ez a magyar agrárdiplomáciának, hiszen ennek a lehetőségnek az érvényesíthetőségéről cikkeinkben többen is pesszimistán nyilatkoztunk. Többségében azonban egyetértettünk abban, hogy a vonatkozó jogintézmények áttekintése és újraszabályozása ebben az esetben sem tűr halasztást, mert – mint Orlovits Zsolt a vita során kiemelte – az új birtokpolitikai koncepció eredményes adaptációjához viszonylag hosszadalmasabb átmeneti idő szükséges. A kétharmados parlamenti többséglehetőségeire és felelősségére hivatkozva remélni lehet, hogy a kormány vidékbarát agrárpolitikájában mielőbb érzékelhetővé válik az iránylátás, a szakmailag megalapozott okos döntésekre épülő cselekvés. -------------------------------------------------- In volume II of the Gazdálkodás journal in 2010, I published an article titled “Topical issues of land ownership policy”. My intention was to raise questions and set forth conclusions relevant to the topic and thus generate a debate, a forum where scientific players can voice their opinion, contrast their views, get to know one another’s opinions better, and formulate policy proposals. Representatives of the science of agro-economy and others could participate in the debate concerning important issues of land estate policy such as land ownership, land use, land lease, land market, the regulation of agricultural businesses, the formation of estates, the inheritance of land, land acquisition by foreigners, governmental actions and the instruments used in such actions. Even when I formulated the thoughts which started the debate, I was convinced that the topic should be addressed from the widest possible range of aspects, as the creation of a land estate policy requires a complex approach. This is due to practical as well as professional reasons: the more comprehensively this politically very sensitive topic is covered, the more opportunities we will have for compromise, for agreement, which can form the basis of joint work. The need for a complex approach is confirmed by the statement made by László Csete and Gabriella Barcza in the course of the debate: „the issue of land estates cannot be resolved in itself, limited to the issue of ownership, but only through consideration of a longer period and its wider context.”The timing of the start of the debate - February last year - was prompted by the fact that already at that time it could be expected that the 2010 elections would bring a significant turn in Hungarian politics. Agricultural policy, as well as its decisive component, land estate policy, would play an important role in this change.  As confirmed by nearly all participants of the debate, the situation – i.e. that none of the governments over the last decades paid as much attention to the countryside and the agricultural economy as they deserved on the grounds of their strategic, social and environmental importance - had become untenable.  (In this respect, possibly only the first Orbán government was found less guilty by Alvincz, Barcza and Csete.) Now, if issues of agricultural and land estate policy are brought in focus, it is the common will of a team, a community, the joint opinion of the agricultural community that could help break free from the present difficult situation.  The debate was intended as a contribution to this work – strategy-building, if you will  –, to confirm, confute or complement the (pre)conceptions formulated by political actors.We now know that the ban on land purchase by foreigners will be extended by the European Union to 2014. This is not a small feat of Hungarian agricultural diplomacy, as several of us voiced a pessimistic opinion in our articles on the probability of this occurring.  The majority of the contributors agreed, however, that even in this case, the review and re-regulation of the relevant legal institutions should not be delayed, because - as pointed out by Zsolt Orlovits in the course of the debate - a relatively long transitional period is required for the successful adoption of a new land estate policy. With reference to the opportunities and responsibility of its two-thirds majority, it can be hoped that a clear direction and action based on professionally sound smart decisions soon becomes visible in the Government’s countryside-friendly agricultural policy.";"Kapronczai, Istvan";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-02-31";"hu";"land use;land ownership";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016209868";"http://purl.umn.edu/119890";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400145408";"Efficiency and Accuracy of Wildland Weed Mapping Methods";"";"Land managers must set weed management priorities if limited resources are to be utilized effectively. Weed surveys and inventories assist land managers in this process by providing information regarding the identity, location, and relative abundance of weeds on their land. Although this information is vital, it can be challenging to select a method that provides the necessary data to meet management objectives while remaining accurate and cost effective. This paper critically evaluates four wildland weed mapping methods. These methods were defined as (1) paper-drawn, (2) buffered-point, (3) screen-drawn, and (4) perimeter-walked. Polygons were drawn by hand on topographic maps in the paper-drawn method. The other methods utilized handheld geographic positioning system (GPS) technology to digitally record infestations. Six experienced weed mappers independently recorded the location and size of eight sagebrush patches using each method. Time and accuracy were evaluated for each method based upon mapping time, distance walked, horizontal precision error, estimated size error, and shape error. The paper-drawn method was significantly less accurate than GPS-based methods at recording patch size and location. There was no significant difference in the accuracy of the buffered-point, screen-drawn, and perimeter-walked methods at reporting patch size and location. The need to cover land area quickly and efficiently favors the selection of the buffered-point or screen-drawn method because of time and distance factors. However, if patch shape is an important factor, the perimeter-walked or buffered-point methods may be the best choices of methods tested.";"Christensen, Stephanie D.

An extrapolation from farm households in Ogun State, Nigeria";"";"The study assessed poverty in rural areas of Ogun State, Nigeria through the food energy (calorie) intake approach. A sample of 60 households (comprising of 346 members) were selected using a multistage sampling technique and were interviewed with the aid of well‐structured questionnaire. Data were analysed using nutrient estimation techniques, cost of calorie method and poverty index. The estimated food poverty line was 64.72 naira. The incidence, intensity and severity of poverty were consistently higher among female‐headed households and households that lack access to credit facilities with values 0.290, 0.359, 0.160 and 0.313, 0.371, 0.160 for the poverty measures respectively. Incidence of poverty reduces with educational level and age of household heads, but the corresponding intensity and severity were higher for households whose heads are between 46‐ and 55‐year brackets and those who have secondary school education. All measures of poverty decline with farm size. Multipronged strategies involving improvement of educational level of household heads, improved access to agricultural land and credit facilities, as well as fair distribution of resources towards women, among others, are recommended for poverty and hunger reduction and for sustained agricultural production.";"Ayinde, Idris A.

Emerging markets for carbon emission offsets may offer developing nations needed incentives for reforestation, rehabilitation, and avoided deforestation. However, relatively little empirical data exists regarding carbon storage in African tropical forests, particularly for those in arid or semi-arid regions. Kenya's 416 km² Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is the largest remaining fragment of East African coastal dry forest and is considered a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000), but has been significantly altered by past commercial logging and ongoing extraction. Forest carbon storage for ASF was estimated using allometric equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and spectroscopy for soils. Satellite imagery was used to assess land cover changes from 1992 to 2004. Forest and thicket types (Cynometra webberi dominated, Brachystegia spiciformis dominated, and mixed species forest) had carbon densities ranging from 58 to 94 Mg C/ha. The ASF area supported a 2.8-3.0 Tg C carbon stock. Although total forested area in ASF did not change over the analyzed time period, ongoing disturbances, quantified by the basal area of cut tree stumps per sample plot, correlated with decreased carbon densities. Madunguni Forest, an adjoining forest patch, lost 86% of its forest cover and at least 76% of its terrestrial carbon stock in the time period. Improved management of wood harvesting in ASF and rehabilitation of Madunguni Forest could substantially increase terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region.";"Glenday, Julia";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300903392";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9910-0";"";"";"";"85-95"

The socioeconomic profile of Shikohpur is highly skewed with mostly small and marginal farmers. Though the areas under wheat in Shikohpur are increasing, the productivity is declining or remaining stagnant over the years. Most of the area during kharif season (June-September) remains fallow. Pearl millet based cropping systems (pearl millet-mustard and pearl millet-wheat) are predominant. Soils are mostly loamy sand to sandy loam with average of 70-80% sand content. Organic C content in soil is less than 0.3%, due to high prevailing temperature with little rainfall and also intensive agriculture followed in this region. Though the annual average seasonal rainfall in Gurgaon did not have much variation over the years, occurrence of extreme climate events has increased in the last two decades. The crop intensity is low and the water table is declining. Water and nitrogen production functions were developed for the important crops of the region, for their subsequent use in scheduling of the inputs. InfoCrop, WTGROWS and technical coefficients were used for crop planning and resource management under climate change and its variability, extreme events, limited resource availability and crop intensification. These will help in disseminating necessary agro-advisories to the farmers so that they will be able to manipulate the inputs and agronomic management practices for sustained agricultural production under normal as well as extreme climatic conditions.";"Singh, Manish

In this study, landslide hazard zonation of Souk Ahras province was carried out using a Raster-based GIS and statistical processing. Landslide locations were defined from interpretation of aerial photographs and field surveys. Rotational, planar and complex landslides were identified. To reveal the controlling factors of landslides, a temporal distribution of 603 recognized landslides (1981–2011) is compared with the monthly precipitation variation, indicating a strong correlation between precipitation and landslide occurrence. The correlation between landslide and lithology, slope angle, and elevation shows the same results. Tabular data, maps and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database in a GIS platform. The factors that influence landslide occurrence, such as slope angle, slope exposition and elevation were derived from the DEM; Lithology, soil deposits and faults were digitalized from the geologic maps; roads, streams and timber were extracted from Landsat image; precipitation was krigged from pluviometric measurement dataset. Different classes of thematic layers were assigned. A corresponding rating value as attribute information and an attribute map was generated for each data layer in the GIS. Landslide hazard areas were assessed and mapped using the landslide occurrence and permanent factor maps, by applying a probabilistic method with a logistic regression approach. The results of the analysis were verified using landslides location map, compared with the probability model. The resulting map can be used to mitigate this hazard, and to plan land use and urbanization.";"Hadji, Riheb

Increased urbanization and greater specialization have led to rising incomes, and changes in food production and consumption patterns. Changes in consumption and increased production specialization have also resulted in changes in trading patterns, with South Korea emerging as a leading importer of agri-food products.South Korea places great importance on self-sufficiency in food staples, and achieving income parity between rural and urban households. To attain these goals, considerable support has been provided to its agriculture sector. South Korea's policy support to the agriculture sector ranks among the worlds' highest. Small holdings still persist, entry into the sector is difficult, and the farm population is aging rapidly. Demographics and resource scarcity are therefore likely to shape the sector's evolution in the coming decades.This note first provides an overview of South Korea's demographics and land resources, followed by a review of the evolution of South Korea's agricultural policies.

The demand for agricultural land was low during the first decade after the collapse of the Soviet agriculture system. The situation is changing and the demand for agricultural land is increasing at the present time. Yet, simultaneously, the formation of arable land prices is not studied much. There are several factors affecting land prices and spatial characteristics are among them. The aim of the study is to estimate the impact of spatial characteristics of land parcels on the price of arable land in Estonia. Correlation and regression analyses were used in order to find the possible impact of spatial characteristics (e.g. soil productivity, access conditions and distance from cities) on arable land prices. Data about the 86 rural municipalities were used for the study. The results of the study show that the impact of spatial characteristics of land explains about 20 percent of the arable land price variation. Quality of land and the access conditions to land plots had a statistically significant impact on arable land prices. The impact of the distance from cities and the shape of arable land plots on arable land prices were not detected in the study.";"Maasikamaee, S., Estonian Univ. of Life Sciences, Tartu (Estonia)

The age of the farmer, household size, and irrigation use are significant determinants of the decision of farmers to adopt herbicides as an alternative to manual weeding, while economic variables such as the price of herbicides, total income, and access to credit determine the level of herbicide use. Determinants of both adoption and level are land ownership, farm area, and the method of crop establishment. These results are potentially relevant when designing policies to reduce excessive herbicide use or to encourage the adoption of alternative weed control methods such as integrated weed management.";"Beltran, Jesusa C.

"AGRIS:US201600069012";"Improved Band Selection Technique for Hyperspectral Data Using Factor Analysis";"";"This paper discusses a statistical and band transformation based approach to select bands for hyperspectral image analysis. Hyperspectral images contain large number of spectral bands with redundant information about the spectral classes in the image scene. It is necessary to reduce the high dimensionality of the data for the processing of hyperspectral data. We report a feature selection technique that removes correlated spectral bands using band decorrelation technique and obtains maximum variance image bands based on factor analysis. Factor analysis method of band selection technique is also validated against existing methods of band selection. The study is carried out for the agriculturally rich area of Musiri region of South India that has varied landcover types. Evaluation of the band selection procedure is done using signature separability measures such as Euclidean distance, Divergence, Transformed divergence and Jeffries Matusita distance. Results indicated that selected bands exhibited maximum separability and also occurred predominantly at wavelength 700 nm, 850, 1000 nm, 1200 nm, 1648 nm and 2200 nm.";"Lavanya, A.

"AGRIS:US201400167105";"Cross-evaluation of measurements of peatland methane emissions on microform and ecosystem scales using high-resolution landcover classification and source weight modelling";"";"The methane exchange in an oligotrophic mire complex was measured on the ecosystem and microform scale with the eddy covariance (EC) and the closed chamber technique, respectively. Information about the distribution of three distinct microform types in the area of interest and in each 30min EC flux source area was derived from a high-resolution (1m²) landcover map in combination with an analytical source weight model (Kormann and Meixner, 2001). The mean weighted coverage of flark, lawn and hummock microforms in the EC source area (0.3%:57%:43%) closely mirrors the overall distribution in the area of interest (0.5%:50.1%:49.4%), despite great differences in microform coverage between individual 30min EC source areas. The measured ecosystem flux was fitted to the sum of three microform flux models based on environmental variables and weighted by their fractional coverage in the EC source area. This method resulted in a better representation of the ecosystem flux compared to an approach based on only one flux model for the whole ecosystem (R²=0.87, RMSE=0.44 vs. R²=0.74, RMSE=0.61, n=5181) and thus constitutes a successful down-scaling of measured ecosystem scale flux to the microform scale. A comparison of down-scaled and measured microform fluxes reveals a good agreement for lawn microforms and systematic differences for flark and hummock microforms. Reasons for the differences are thought to be the limited resolution of the landcover classification and the systematic underestimation of hummock fluxes by the closed chamber technique. As a result, hummock fluxes derived by down-scaling of EC fluxes are considered to be more dependable than closed chamber fluxes. The seasonal ecosystem methane budget from gap-filled EC measurements was 9.4±0.2gCH₄m⁻²; the budget derived from up-scaled microform measurements was 8.0±0.8gCH₄m⁻². The lower value of the latter budget is attributed to the underestimation of flark and hummock fluxes by closed chamber measurements and to the microform gap-filling procedure. Generally, estimates from up-scaled microform measurements are found to be less certain than estimates from EC measurements.";"Forbrich, Inke

"AGRIS:US2016211349";"Integrating ecological and economic aspects in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes";"Integration ökologischer und ökonomischer Aspekte in Landnutzungskonzepten für Agrarlandschaften";"Especially in environmentally sensitive agricultural landscapes, agriculture cannot define its aims by itself - it has to account for a number of demands of different groups of society. For example, agriculture is expected to produce food and at the same time contribute to the protection of cultural landscapes and to further ecological services. Land use concepts for ecologically particularly sensitive agricultural landscapes are often focussed on the attainment of specific environmental objectives in specific areas, neglecting both socioeconomic effects, in particular income effects, and the farmers' income-driven production responses outside these areas. The paper illustrates, on the basis of an empirical study, (1) that the farmers' objectives and production responses need to be integrated in land use concepts for agricultural landscapes because of their potentially counterproductive effects on the attainment of environmental objectives, and (2) how multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to transform a primarily ecology-oriented concept for an ecologically very sensitive agricultural landscape into a more comprehensive one that makes due allowance for the farmers’ responses and society's socio-economic objectives. The authors show that the integration of socio-economic objectives can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological goals. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications resulting from the implementation of land use concepts for agricultural landscapes, in particular in the field of agri-environmental policy, and raises some practical issues that come up if policy makers apply MCDA more widely in the design of such concepts.";"Ahrens, Heinz

The goal set out in this scientific paper is to explore the development trends current in the target sector of the market and identify problems and barriers to successful progress common to the entire real estate market in this country. The development of the market sector for agricultural lands is defined both by internal factors, such as, state policy and economic stability, refinancing and loan rates, friendly business and investment environment, development cycles of national economy, and also by such external factors as credit policy of other countries, stagnation and revival periods in neighbouring countries' economy, etc. Considering the limited volume of this reference paper, it is not possible to provide deeper insight of factors related to the development of the market sector for agricultural lands. The paper, thus, analyses mainly those issues that have contributed to the development of the target market sector during the previous year. These are - the development of the building and construction industry, real estate price speculations and transformation rules that allow the transformation of agricultural lands into non-agricultural plots. On having assessed the building and construction industry, it has become clear that the main drive of its development is the boom in the real estate market, which causes a chain reaction, where an impulse produced by the demand in the real estate market reaches the market for building and construction and further on the reaction is beamed forward onto the land market. The development is a logical and desirable process in any branch of economy, but if the progress becomes a rush, the relevant market sector fails to adjust itself to those rapid changes. The paper refers to and evaluates only a few of the existing problems, as well as provides possible solution to them.";"Geipele, I.

The utilised agricultural area has a faster tendency to decrease compared to the increase of forest areas between 1940 and 2005. Consequently it characterises the situation in the use of land in Latvia for the generation of renewable resources.

"AGRIS:US201500219460";"Complexity of ecological restoration in China";"";"Land degradation is a primary issue that affects environmental conservation and socioeconomic development. However, ecological restoration has complex and poorly understood consequences for the structure and composition of future ecosystems and socioeconomic systems. To illustrate the complexity of ecological restoration, we discuss the potential links between China's ongoing large-scale ecological restoration practices and the resulting changes of natural factors such as landscape characteristics, climate, and vegetation communities. These changes may lead to restoration difficulty when the goal is to rebuild a system that resembles the pre-disturbance state. Even though the intentions of ecological restoration may be good, it is necessary to harmonize the ecological effects with simultaneous and future social changes, thereby benefiting both nature and society. Any simplistic or extreme approach to ecological restoration is potentially dangerous because the long-term effects on nature and society are generally unknown, so careful monitoring will be required, particularly for large-scale projects.";"Ma, Hua

In residential land cover, private yards are influenced by individual homeowner preferences and actions while also experiencing large-scale human and biophysical drivers. We studied plant nitrogen (%N) and N stable isotopic composition (δ¹⁵N) in residential yards and paired native ecosystems in seven cities across the US that span major ecological biomes and climatic regions: Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City. We found that residential lawns in three cities had enriched plant δ¹⁵N (P < 0.03) and in six cities higher plant N (%) relative to the associated native ecosystems (P < 0.05). Plant δ¹⁵N was progressively depleted across a gradient of urban density classes in Baltimore and Boston (P < 0.05). Lawn fertilization was associated with depleted plant δ¹⁵N in Boston and Los Angeles (P < 0.05), and organic fertilizer additions were associated with enriched plant δ¹⁵N in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City (P < 0.04). Plant δ¹⁵N was significantly enriched as a function of housing age in Baltimore (r ² = 0.27, P < 0.02), Boston (r ² = 0.27, P < 0.01), and Los Angeles (r ² = 0.34, P < 0.01). These patterns in plant δ¹⁵N and plant N (%) across these cities suggests that N sources to lawns, as well as greater rates of N cycling combined with subsequent N losses, may be important drivers of plant N dynamics in lawn ecosystems at the national scale.";"Trammell, T.

The farm group model EU-FARMIS is applied to quantify the effects of the reform and the impacts of the options for national implementation. The analysis is done for France and Germany because their implementation schemes adequately reflect the broad range of options. It is found that cereal and fodder maize production is reduced both in France and Germany. In contrast, the acreage of other arable fodder crops, of set-aside and of non-food crops is expanded. While bull fattening is substantially reduced in both countries, suckler cow production is extended in France due to partial decoupling, but reduced in Germany due to full decoupling. Sectoral income effects measured in Farm Net Value Added are similar. The regional implementation of decoupling in Germany induces a significant redistribution of direct payments and therefore causes differences in income effects depending on farm type, location and size.";"Kupker, Bernd

"AGRIS:US201400143128";"importance of wetlands in the energy balance of an agricultural landscape";"";"Energy fluxes, including net radiation, latent heat flux and sensible heat flux were determined on clear days during the vegetative period in four types of land cover: wet meadow, pasture, arable field, and an artificial concrete surface. The average net radiation ranged between 123� W� m⁻² at the concrete surface and 164� W� m⁻² at the wet meadow. The mean maximum daytime latent heat ranged between 500 and 600� W� m⁻², which corresponds to an evapotranspiration rate of about 0.2� g� m⁻²� s⁻¹ under the prevailing conditions of the wet meadow. The results demonstrated that the wet meadow dissipated about 30� % more energy through evapotranspiration than the field or the pasture, and up to 70� % more energy than the concrete surface. The evaporative fraction indicated that more than 100� % of the energy released by the wet meadow was dissipated through evapotranspiration; this was attributed to local heat advection. Wetland evapotranspiration thus contributes significantly to the cooling of agricultural landscapes; the energy released can reach several 100� MW� km⁻². Wetland evapotranspiration has a double ‘air conditioning’ effect through which it equalises temperature differences: (1) surplus solar energy is bound into water vapour as latent heat; (2) The vapour moves towards cooler portions of the atmosphere where the energy is released. The air-conditioning effect of wetlands plays an important role in mitigating local climate extremes; this ecosystem service tends to be disregarded in relation to other better-known wetland functions such as nutrient retention and provision of high biodiversity.";"Huryna, Hanna

For example, statistics on the wide variation in the number of trusts in different regions of the United States raise questions about whether such variation makes economic sense. This paper builds a model to identify the optimal number of private conservation agents. The model depicts two competing forces: regional spatial externalities in conservation benefits that increase the efficiency of having fewer agents and organizational costs, and fund-raising specialization, which increases the efficiency of having more agents. Using state-level variables, we perform a count-data analysis of the number of trusts conserving land in each state. We find that the number of trusts actually observed is consistent with the optimal number of trusts that is predicted by the model on the basis of the relative importance of spatial externalities and organizational size in different regions.";"Albers, Heidi J.

The answers were evaluated using multivariate statisticalmethods. Comprehensive knowledge was obtained about number and size of land and capitalshares, voting mode, indebtedness, cost of social security contributions for the employees andof the support for household plots and ensuing consequences for the profitability ofenterprises.Within a farm, land shares are principally of the same size varying between 2.6 and 48.5hectares. Farm workers hold 53.0 % of the land shares and 53.3 % of the capital. In 14 out of23 corporations the voting mode was not in agreement with the legal rules. A significantnonlinear relationship between acreage and profitability could be confirmed. Compared with medium-sized farms, the profitability was higher in some very large (>20 thousand ha) andalso in relatively small farms (approx. 4 thousand ha). In case of the latter it was to be checkedup whether and which way restructuring would be feasible in order to raise the profitabilitylevel.The average cost efficiency of large-scale farms as used in Russia for reporting on profitabilitywas 3.4 % in 1999. If the costs of social security contributions by the farms for the workers,support for family farms and sometimes unusually high depreciation rates are neglected, theaverage cost efficiency is clearly higher (25.5 %). 15 farms out of 59 believe that they are ableto settle the debt problem under their own steam; 9 hope for contributions by the government,and 35 expect a full assumption of their debts by the state.";"Schulze, Eberhard

"AGRIS:US201301598274";"Simulated dynamics of carbon stocks driven by changes in land use, management and climate in a tropical moist ecosystem of Ghana";"";"Sub-Saharan Africa is large and diverse with regions of food insecurity and high vulnerability to climate change. This project quantifies carbon stocks and fluxes in the humid forest zone of Ghana, as a part of an assessment in West Africa. The General Ensemble biogeochemical Modeling System (GEMS) was used to simulate the responses of natural and managed systems to projected scenarios of changes in climate, land use and cover, and nitrogen fertilization in the Assin district of Ghana. Model inputs included historical land use and cover data, historical climate records and projected climate changes, and national management inventories. Our results show that deforestation for crop production led to a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 33% from 1900 to 2000. The results also show that the trend of carbon emissions from cropland in the 20th century will continue through the 21st century and will be increased under the projected warming and drying scenarios. Nitrogen (N) fertilization in agricultural systems could offset SOC loss by 6% with 30kgNha⁻¹ year⁻¹ and by 11% with 60kgNha⁻¹ year⁻¹. To increase N fertilizer input would be one of the vital adaptive measures to ensure food security and maintain agricultural sustainability through the 21st century.";"Tan, Zhengxi

"AGRIS:US201500211801";"Characteristics, suitability and recommendations for management of land in acid sulfate soil-affected brackishwater ponds for tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) culture in Luwu Regency, Indonesia";"";"Luwu is one of the regencies located on the east coast of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia which has large brackishwater ponds area, but it has a low productivity of shrimp and fish. Therefore, a study was carried out to know the land characteristics for determining suitability and management of land for tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) culture in brackishwater ponds to increase the productivity and sustainability. Factors considered in land characteristics are: topography and tidal range, soil quality, water quality and climate. Spatial analysis in Geographic Information System is used for determining the land suitability for tiger prawn culture in brackishwater ponds. Land management is determined based on land characteristics to conform to technology that can be applied in brackishwater ponds. The results of study showed that brackishwater ponds soil in Luwu Regency are classified as acid sulfate soil and acid sulfate soil associated with peat soils that are characterized by low pH and macro nutrient content as well as high potential acidity and toxic elements content. Texture is generally classified as loamy sand, sand, sandy clay loam and sandy loam. Water quality in general can support brackishwater pond culture, except the forms of nitrogen which has relatively high content. Low rainfall was found from September to February and high rainfall in the other months. The analysis shows the actual land suitability of the existing brackishwater ponds in Luwu, namely 11,740.9 ha, where no land is classified as highly suitable (S1 class), 10,434.4 ha classified as moderately suitable (S2 class) and 1,306.5 ha classified as marginally suitable (S3 class) for tiger prawn culture. One of the recommendations for land management is through remediation, in the form of drying, submerging and flushing or liming for improving soil quality.";"Mustafa, Akhmad

"AGRIS:US201400132609";"influence of watershed characteristics on nitrogen export to and marine fate in Hood Canal, Washington, USA";"";"Hood Canal, Washington, USA, is a poorly ventilated fjord-like sub-basin of Puget Sound that commonly experiences hypoxia. This study examined the influence of watershed soils, vegetation, physical features, and population density on nitrogen (N) export to Hood Canal from 43 tributaries. We also linked our watershed study to the estuary using a salinity mass balance model that calculated the relative magnitude of N loading to Hood Canal from watershed, direct precipitation, and marine sources. The overall flow-weighted total dissolved N (TDN) and particulate N input concentrations to Hood Canal were 152 and 49 μg l−1, respectively. Nitrate and dissolved organic N comprised 64 and 29% of TDN, respectively. The optimal regression models for TDN concentration and areal yield included a land cover term suggesting an effect of N-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra) and a human population density term (suggesting onsite septic system (OSS) discharges). There was pronounced seasonality in stream water TDN concentrations, particularly for catchments with a high prevalence of red alder, with the lowest concentrations occurring in the summer and the highest occurring in November–December. Due to strong seasonality in TDN concentrations and in particular stream flow, over 60% of the TDN export from this watershed occurred during the 3 month period of November–January. Entrainment of marine water into the surface layer of Hood Canal accounted for ≈98% of N loading to the euphotic zone of this estuary, and in a worst case scenario OSS N inputs contribute ≈0.5% of total N loading. Domestic wastewater discharges and red alders appear to be a very important N source for many streams, but a minor nutrient source for the estuary as a whole.";"Steinberg, Peter D.

"AGRIS:US201301912712";"Management effects on European cropland respiration";"";"Increases in respiration rates following management activities in croplands are considered a relevant anthropogenic source of CO₂. In this paper, we quantify the impact of management events on cropland respiration fluxes of CO₂ as they occur under current climate and management conditions. Our findings are based on all available CarboEurope IP eddy covariance flux measurements during a 4-year period (2004-2007). Detailed management information was available for 15 out of the 22 sites that contributed flux data, from which we compiled 30 types of management for European-scale comparison. This allowed us to address the question of how management activities influence ecosystem respiration. This was done by comparing respiration fluxes during 7, 14, and 28 days after the management with those observed during the matching time period before management. Median increases in respiration ranged from +83% (early season tillage) to −50% (rice paddy flooding and burning of rice residues) on the 28 days time scale, when only management types with a minimum of 7 replications are considered. Most management types showed a large variation among events and between sites, indicating that additional factors other than management alone are also important at a given site. Temperature is the climatic factor that showed best correlation with site-specific respiration fluxes. Therefore, the effect of temperature changes between the time periods before and after management were taken into account for a subset of 13 management types with adequate statistical coverage of at least 5 events during the years 2004-2007. In this comparison, late-season moldboard ploughing (30-45cm) led to highest median increase in respiration on the 7 days timescale (+43%), which was still +15% in the 28 days comparison. On average, however, management-induced increases in respiration losses from croplands were quite moderate (typically <20% increase over 28 days). An assessment of extreme values in daily respiration fluxes using the Gumbel distribution approach revealed that sites with larger average respiration fluxes also experience the larger extremes in respiration fluxes. This suggests that it is very unlikely that sites that generally have low respiration rates will have exceedingly high respiration rates as a result of certain specific management events.";"Eugster, Werner

"AGRIS:US201500217975";"Relationships between aquatic biotic communities and water quality in a tropical river–wetland system (Ecuador)";"";"Many tropical wetlands threatened by land use changes, or modifications in hydrological regime require effective management policies and implementation to protect them. The Abras de Mantequilla wetland, located in the Guayas River Basin in Ecuador, is subject to two major environmental disturbances, i.e., short-term agriculture (rice, maize) on the land around the wetland and the effects of planned infrastructure works of the Baba dam in the upper catchment. Both activities are expected to be the main constraints for the future wetland health. The objective of this study was to provide an initial characterization of the biotic communities of the river and wetland habitats before the dam starts operating. Plankton, macroinvertebrates, fishes and associated physical and chemical variables were sampled at 12 sites during the wet season (February 2011). Biotic metrics (abundance, taxa richness, diversity and evenness) were computed for the aquatic communities in the wetland and the river. A biotic index (Biological Monitoring Working Party-Colombia/adaptation) was applied to the macroinvertebrate community. Relationships between biotic and abiotic variables indicated nutrients, velocity and sediment type as main drivers. Cluster analysis grouped physico-chemical variables according to river or wetland sites. Similarities regarding the taxa composition among sites were explored with non-metric multidimensional scaling method (NMDS), showing clusters for ichthyoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Higher densities of organisms were recorded in the wetland compared with the river. The wetland is an important area of breeding and reproduction for fish communities, with its lentic habitats promoting the development of high densities of ichthyoplankton. In order to achieve sustainable solutions for integrated river–wetland systems, management options should focus on maintaining natural variation in hydrodynamic conditions throughout the entire catchment, as well as implement good practices in agriculture and reforestation using native species. Local and national authorities should support continuous monitoring programmes, taking account of seasonal variation and of future impacts from flow reduction and nutrient enrichment.";"Alvarez-Mieles, G.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounts for over 60% of the total goat population in Africa, with an estimated 147 million goats representing about 80 indigenous breeds or strains distributed across all agro-ecological zones and ruminant livestock production systems. Goats are particularly important in marginal agricultural land areas, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, which together hold 64% of the goat population. At the rural community level, goats play a significant role in the food chain and overall livelihoods of the poor rural households where they are also largely the property of resource poor women and their children. Indigenous goat breeds/strains are adapted to the diverse local production circumstances and are able to thrive with minimum inputs. Goats still remain largely marginalized, even at the household level. This paper attempts to look at the challenges and opportunities of goat keeping at the household level for the improved welfare of the keepers, using SSA as a representative of other developing sub-regions.";"Lebbie, S.H.B.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"women";"Land & Gender";"";"002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400099186";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2003.08.015";"";"";"";"131-136"
"AGRIS:US201500205207";"Remnant riparian vegetation, sediment and nutrient loads, and river rehabilitation in subtropical Australia";"";"A decline in the ecosystem health of Australia's Moreton Bay, a Ramsar wetland of international significance, has been attributed to sediments and nutrients derived from catchment sources. To address this decline the regional management plan has set the target of reducing the loads by 50%. Reforestation of the channel network has been proposed as the means to achieve this reduction, but the extent of revegetation required is uncertain. Here we test the hypothesis that sediment and nutrient loads from catchments decrease proportionally with the increasing proportion of the stream length draining remnant vegetation. As part of a routine regional water quality monitoring program sediment and nutrient loads were measured in 186 flow events across 22 sub‐catchments with different proportions of remnant woodland. Using multiple linear regression analysis we develop a predictive model for pollutant loads. Of the attributes examined a combination of runoff and the proportion of the stream length draining remnant vegetation was the best predictor. The sediment yield per unit area from a catchment containing no remnant vegetation is predicted to be between 50 and 200 times that of a fully vegetated channel network; total phosphorus between 25 and 60 times; total nitrogen between 1.6 and 4.1 times. There are ~48 000 km of streams in the region of which 32% drain areas of remnant vegetation. Of these 17 095 km are above the region's water storage dams. We estimate that decreasing the sediment and phosphorus loads to Moreton Bay by 50% would involve rehabilitating ~6350 km of the channel network below the dams; halving the total nitrogen load would require almost complete restoration of the channel network.

"AGRIS:US201301635119";"Relationships Between Nutritional Condition of Adult Females and Relative Carrying Capacity for Rocky Mountain Elk";"";"Lactation can have significant costs to individual and population-level productivity because of the high energetic demands it places on dams. Because the difference in condition between lactating and dry Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) cows tends to disappear as nutritional quality rises, the magnitude of that difference could be used to relate condition to habitat quality or the capability of habitats to support elk. We therefore compared nutritional condition of >or =2.5-yr-old lactating and dry cows from six free-ranging Rocky Mountain elk populations throughout the United States. Our goal was to quantify differential accrual of body fat (BF) reserves to determine whether the condition of dry and lactating cows could be used to define relevant management thresholds of habitat quality (i.e., relative carrying capacity) and consequently potential performance of elk populations. Levels of BF that lactating cows were able to accrue in autumn and the proportional difference in BF between dry and lactating cows in autumn were related (F1-2,10>=16.2, P<0.001). Models indicated that elk experienced no negative effects of reproduction on condition when lactating cows were able to accrue >=13.7% BF in autumn. When lactating cows are accruing <=7.9% BF, elk are in a nutritionally stressed condition, which may be limiting population performance. Using the logistic model to predict relative proximity to ecological carrying capacity (ECC), our population-years ranged from 3-97% of ECC and proportion of the population lactating (an index of calf survival) was negatively related to proportion of ECC. Results indicate that the proportional difference in accrual of BF between lactating and dry cows can provide a sensitive index to where elk populations reside relative to the quality of their range.";"Piasecke, Jessica R.

Farm households allocate their time between farm and off-farm activities to help stabilized household income (consumption). What characterizes those households who engage in off-farm activities? Is there any pattern over time? Using 1999, 2003 and 2007 farm-level data from the USDA’s Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), this study estimates intensity of off-farm income (or income diversification). The results show that older operators, full owners, and small farms have higher intensity of off-farm income in total household income. In contrast, dairy farms, vertically coordinated farms and farms located in the Southern and Pacific regions have lower intensity of off-farm income. In other words, household incomes of these farms are less likely to be diversified.";"Mishra, Ashok K.

A fuzzy interval approach is proposed in which linguistic-scale labels assigned to each land-cover class at each sample observation are converted to fuzzy intervals. These fuzzy intervals are then used to produce a fuzzy confusion matrix from which fuzzy thematic accuracy measures analogous to overall, user's, and producer's accuracy are produced. An advantage of this methodology is that it employs a practical and relatively simple reference labelling protocol (the linguistic scale) that accounts for reference database uncertainty and information on the percentage of the pixel covered by a land-cover class incorporating this uncertainty in fuzzy accuracy measures, providing an analysis that is readily interpretable because of similarity to the familiar confusion matrix approach. The fuzzy accuracy measures can be defuzzified to provide simplified accuracy measures analogous to the thematic accuracy measures derived from traditional (i.e. crisp classification) confusion matrices. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a case study in which the accuracy assessment of a land-cover map for Continental Portugal derived from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images is made.";"Sarmento, Pedro

"AGRIS:US201400158401";"Monitoring the status of forests and rangelands in the Western United States using ecosystem performance anomalies";"";"The effects of land management and disturbance on ecosystem performance (i.e. biomass production) are often confounded by those of weather and site potential. The current study overcomes this issue by calculating the difference between actual and expected ecosystem performance (EEP) to generate ecosystem performance anomalies (EPA). This study aims to delineate and quantify average EPA from 2000–2009 within the Greater Platte and Upper Colorado River Basins, USA. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images averaged over the growing season (GSN) served as a proxy of actual ecosystem performance. Yearly EEP was determined with rule-based piecewise regression tree models of abiotic data (climate, soils, elevation, etc.), independently created for each land cover. EPA were calculated as the residuals of the EEP to GSN relationship, and characterized as normal performing, underperforming, and overperforming at the 90% confidence level. Validation revealed that EPA values were related to biomass production (R² = 0.56, P = 0.02) and likely to the proportion of biomass removed by livestock in the Nebraska Sandhills. Overall, 60.6% of the study area was (normal) performing near its EEP, 3.0% was severely underperforming, 5.0% was highly overperforming, and the remainder was slightly underperforming or overperforming. Generally, disturbances such as fires, floods, and insect damage, in addition to high grazing intensity, result in a negative EPA. Conversely, mature stands and appropriate management often result in positive EPA values. This method provides information critical to land managers to evaluate the appropriateness of previous management practices and restoration efforts and quantify disturbance impacts. Results are at a scale sufficient for many of the large management units of the region and for locating areas needing further investigation. Applications of EPA data to monitoring invasive species, grazing impacts, and vulnerability to plant community shifts have been suggested by land management professionals.";"Rigge, Matthew

"AGRIS:US201500010305";"Use of ensemble simulations to evaluate the urban effect on a localized heavy rainfall event in Tokyo, Japan";"";"Recently, localized heavy rainfall over highly urbanized areas has caused severe damage in Japan. Although studies have indicated that the presence of urban areas can intensify rainfall, the chaotic noise caused by differences in initial conditions can change the urban effect. Therefore, the usability of ensemble simulation methods for urban effects on a single localized heavy rainfall event must be clarified to synthesize state-of-the-art observations and numerical model studies. This study examined the difference in a localized heavy rainfall event under different initial conditions. We demonstrated the advantage of ensemble experiments using a cloud-resolving model to evaluate the urban effect. In this study, we focused on a localized heavy rainfall event that occurred over Tokyo on 5 August 2008 and killed five people working in a drainpipe. Two ensemble experiments were performed according to the lagged average forecasting (LAF) method. Each experiment had six members, with initial conditions spanning 6 h from 02 to 07 Local Standard Time (LST) on 5 August 2008. The model was integrated continuously through 18 LST for each run. The model had a horizontal grid resolution of 2 km. The first experiment (CTRL) used the actual land cover, anthropogenic heat, and geometric structures. The second experiment (PDDY) used an imaginary land cover in which the urban area was changed to paddy fields. Comparison of the ensemble means showed that the peak value of the maximum hourly rainfall decreased and the peak time was delayed in PDDY compared with CTRL. The smaller peak value and delayed peak time of rainfall in PDDY seemed to be caused by the weaker updraft associated with near-surface convergence, which was caused by weaker surface heating. Regardless of the difference caused by the initial conditions, the decrease in the peak value and the delay in the peak time were significant according to the t-test. Although the area was limited compared with near-surface temperature and horizontal wind convergence, a significant reduction in rainfall was also seen over the heavily urbanized area of Tokyo in the horizontal distribution of the difference in accumulated rainfall. These results indicate that although differences in the initial condition can change the modeled urban effect on rainfall, ensemble simulation methods can be used to examine the significance of the urban effect on a single localized heavy rainfall event.";"Souma, Kazuyoshi

The rockslide–debris avalanche blocked the course, resulting in the development of a lake with maximum length of around 3.5km. The increase in the inflow rate from 47,000–74,000m³/d between April and October to 304,000m³/d between late October and the first fortnight of November, accelerated the growing rate of the lake. On 12 November 2005 the dam failed, releasing 24.6∗10⁶m³ of water. The resulting outburst flood caused damages mainly on infrastructure, and affected the facilities of a hydropower dam which was under construction 250km downstream from the source area. In this work we describe causes and consequences of the natural dam formation and failure, and we dynamically model the 2005 rockslide–debris avalanche with DAN3D. Additionally, as a volume ~24∗10⁶m³of rocks still remain unstable in the slope, we use the results of the back analysis to forecast the formation of a future natural dam. We analyzed two potential scenarios: a partial slope failure of 6.5∗10⁶m³ and a worst case where all the unstable volume remaining in the slope fails. The spreading of those potential events shows that a new blockage of the Santa Cruz River is likely to occur. According to their modeled morphometry and the contributing watershed upstream the blockage area, as the one of 2005, the dams would also be unstable. This study shows the importance of back and forward analysis that can be carried out to obtain critical information for land use planning, hazards mitigation, and emergency management.";"Penna, Ivanna M.

Interviews took place on sites where various strategic herbicide treatments were implemented for Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense) control using the active ingredients glyphosate and metsulfuron. Forest owners expressed unease about the possibility for post-treatment privet reestablishment due to reseeding or other factors and opinions surfaced calling for selective chemicals or application methods that would spare non-target species. Furthermore, treatment cost effectiveness with regard to timber value, the possible need for expensive multiple treatments, cost-share incentives, and treatment guarantees from herbicide applicators were participant concerns. Environmental concerns surfaced about possible effects of both herbicide use and the invasion of privet on natural systems and an unexpected result was a strong feeling among the forest owners that focus groups are a powerful demonstration tool.";"Howle, Matthew B.

Launched by a group of ecologists and a farming cooperative, this project is aimed at reconciling agriculture and environment by reintroducing alfalfa in a cereal farming area. The parties involved did not have the same outlook on the project. The agro-ecological and territorial innovation process was based on a participative approach: a participative workshop was organized and was attended by thirty participants. Alfalfa was discussed as a relatively unknown constitutive element of the agroecosystem. The workshop focused on i) the interdependence of the different players and the advantage of coordinating alfalfa crop farming, plus ii) the conditions of a collective approach for driving the agroecosystem. Possible regulations were reviewed for promoting a collective approach rather than an individual profit-oriented strategy

"AGRIS:US201301908092";"Clearing of invasive alien plants under different budget scenarios: using a simulation model to test efficiency";"";"Clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is a necessary but expensive exercise. Typically, insufficient resources are available to clear all areas simultaneously. Consequently areas need to be prioritized for clearing. The financial resources available determine the extent of the area which can be cleared, while the prioritization identifies the location of the areas to be cleared. We investigate the following questions: (1) How does a change in the budget impact on the efficiency of the clearing operations over time? (2) How does this differ for different sites? (3) Can we identify pattern which make it possible for managers to determine if their budget is sufficient to achieve a management goal (e.g. clearing 95% of the area of IAPs) in a given time? (4) Can we draw general rules about how the time needed of achieving a management goal is changing when increasing the budget? We use a spatio-temporal explicit simulation model (SpreadSim) to simulate the spread of major woody IAPs over time, using a random prioritization strategy as a null model. This strategy requires no understanding or assumptions about the factors influencing spread; it is thus a reasonable baseline prioritization strategy. Our results confirm that a reduction of the budget increases the time needed to reach a management goal of 95% non-invaded areas and simultaneously increases the overall budget needed to achieve this goal. In addition, for each site, we can identify three values. Firstly, a “lower critical limit” of the budget, below which the IAP spread is only slowed down and management does not result in a reduction of the area invaded by IAPs, which is independent of the management goal. Secondly, the “critical budget”, at which we have a chance of more than 50% of achieving our management goal in a given time. Thirdly, an “upper critical limit” for the budget, above which no substantial change in the time needed to reach the management goal can be observed. For all our three sites, the “upper critical limit” is located at approximately 1.7 times the “critical budget”. The variability of the temporal trajectories of the area covered by IAPs for different simulations for the same input parameter and highly non-linear change in IAP cover over time indicate that an identification of the “critical budget” based on few years of IAP management is nearly impossible and that the use of simulation models is imperative. Nevertheless, the general pattern observed can be generalized to other prioritization strategies and provide important guidance for budget allocations.";"Krug, Rainer M.

Formal workshops and information sessions for land managers were run during the symposia. At the end of each symposium, the managers ran dedicated question-and-answer sessions on the research they felt was needed to improve their work. We discuss the potential of such interventions to increase interaction and awareness between researchers and managers of biological invasions. The symposia certainly provided the managers with opportunities to think about broader issues and develop contacts, but problems with terminology use and the lack of solutions specific to their context tempered the value of their experience. Conversely, researchers at times under-estimated the managers perceived relevance of their presentations to management. The structured and facilitated attendance of managers of invasive plants at international conferences on invasion biology is one mechanism for at least narrowing “the gap” between science and management.";"Shaw, Justine D.

Human activity, through its impact on land use and cover, affects this ecological succession at various degrees. Through a remote sensing study, we explored how the drivers for land use and cover changes (LUCC) have changed over the last decades and which impact this has on ecological succession. Remote sensing data used include a Landsat MSS from 1973, a Landsat TM from 1986 and Landsat ETM+ from 2000; a conventional type of classification was used whereby supervised classification of the 2000 image was supplemented by unsupervised classification of the older images. Due to decreased rainfall and water abstraction for intense irrigated agriculture in its catchment, Lake Abijata lost 46% of its area between 2000 and 2006. On the emerged land, an ecological succession was observed along the environmental gradient of the retreating lake: emerged bare land, grassland, land with few scattered Acacia shrubs and open woodlands. Between 1986 and 2000, LUCC tendencies were totally reversed and woody vegetation decreased strongly, indicating increased human impact. This land degradation took place in a context of instable political situation, fuelwood extraction, higher population density and better communications.";"Temesgen, H.

Conservation practitioners and planners suspect exurban development alters ecological processes and biodiversity to a considerable larger extent than suspected by inhabitants of exurban development areas, but empirical support for this assertion is lacking. To examine the consequences of exurban development, we studied forest bird communities in exurban development and forests located in and around Shenandoah National Park and Massanutten Mountain in northern Virginia, USA. We conducted point-count surveys for birds three times at 106 sample locations from April to July 2006. We recorded 44 species in total; 30 species were present in both exurban development and forests, 9 species were only found in exurban development, and 5 species only in forest. Bird species composition differed significantly between land-use types based on analysis in a multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP; P < 0.01). Relative bird abundance for forest specialist species changed significantly in exurban development versus forest (t test, P < 0.05). Three species, American Robin Turdus migratorius, Northern Cardinal Cardinalis cardinalis, and Common Grackle Quiscalus quiscula were indicators of exurban development. Indicators of forest were Carolina Chickadee Poecile carolinensis, Eastern Towhee Pipilo erythrophthalmus, and Wood Thrush Hylocichla mustelina.

Among the variety of initiatives addressing social and environmental problems, a growing number of certification systems have appeared in various sectors, particularly agrifood. Most initiatives rely on independent third-party certification to verify compliance with a standard, as it is seen as the most credible route for certification. The effects of third-party audits, however, still need to be empirically investigated. This article provides a critical assessment of the notion of ‘evidence’ which is at the heart of auditing practices. It focuses on the case of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and fieldwork carried out in Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of palm oil. In this country, some non-governmental organizations decided to participate in the RSPO in order to use this platform to tackle the issue of land conflicts. They managed to include important clauses regarding indigenous and land rights in the RSPO standard. In practice, however, auditors rarely recognize as valid evidence the forms of proof put forward by local communities.

Across the northern Mediterranean countries, governments have adopted policies and implemented incentive and regulatory instruments to manage this phenomenon. For transition countries, the application of these instruments is less effective due to the weakness of the institutional framework.The Albanian coastal area is suffering for the last ten years from an anarchic urbanisation of its former agricultural land. This issue is analysed though the study of the land market trends in the 1992-2005 period. Data on market transactions and the characteristics of sold land offer information on the land uses and insights on the future development of the area.Our study is based on a field research in the region Durrës-Kavaja (central area of the country), which constitutes an area heavily concerned by this phenomenon. We identified the main characteristics of the land market and their effects on urbanisation and land development.The conflict between agriculture and urbanisation appears to be won by the latter, leading to the establishment of new urban dwelling areas. The existing policies and instruments can neither prevent urbanisation nor influence its type.The study concludes on the necessity to define a stronger development policy, based upon incentive and regulatory instruments

Les politiques de gestion du foncier dans les zones littorales doivent gérer une pression d'urbanisation toujours croissante. Dans les pays du Nord de la Méditerranée, ces politiques parviennent tant bien que mal à gérer cette pression à travers une série d'instruments tels que les zonages régissant les droits de construction, les achats de surface d'intérêt spécifique et, parfois, une fiscalité adaptée. Pour les pays sortis de la transition avec des institutions publiques assez faibles, ces instruments sont généralement moins effectifs.La zone littorale albanaise subit depuis dix ans une pression d'urbanisation sur des terres qui avaient jusqu'alors une vocation agricole. Nous étudions ce phénomène à partir de données relatives au marché foncier (pour la période 1992-2005) qui s'est formé dans la zone. Les caractéristiques des transactions et du foncier vendu nous fournissent des informations sur les usages de ce dernier et nous permettent d'explorer le futur de la zone.Notre étude est basée sur un travail de terrain dans la zone de Durrës-Kavaja (zone littorale centrale) qui constitue la zone la plus touchée par l'urbanisation. On a pu ainsi identifier les caractéristiques du marché foncier et les effets de l'urbanisation dans la zone d'étude.Le conflit agriculture - urbanisation est définitivement gagné par cette dernière en produisant des nouvelles zones urbaines.

Using the Czech Quaternary Pollen Database, this case study evaluates the extent to which selection of data and input parameters for the REVEALS model applications would affect reconstruction outcomes. The REVEALS estimates of PFTs (grid-cell based REVEALS PFT estimates, GB REVEALS PFT-s) are calculated for five time windows of the Holocene using fossil pollen records available in each 1°×1° grid cell of the Czech Republic. The input data and parameters selected for testing are: basin type and size, number of ¹⁴C dates used to establish the chronology of the pollen records, number of taxa, and pollen productivity estimates (PPE). We used the Spearman correlation coefficient to test the hypothesis that there is no association between GB REVEALS PFT-s using different data and parameter inputs. The results show that differences in the basin size and type, number of dates, number and type of taxa (entomophilous included or not), and PPE dataset do not affect the rank orders of the GB REVEALS PFT-s significantly, except for the cases when entomophilous taxa are included. It implies that, given careful selection of data and parameter and interpretation of results, REVEALS applications can use pollen records from lakes and bogs of different sizes together for reconstruction of past land cover at the regional to sub-continental spatial scales for purposes such as the study of past land cover–climate interactions. Our study also provides useful criteria to set up protocols for data compilation REVEALS applications of this kind.";"Mazier, F.

In a second stage critical determinants of efficiency are determined using aTobit model. In this analysis the focus is on technical (characteristics of the irrigation area andnetwork), organizational and administrative variables. Results show that on average 18.7% of theused inputs could be saved if the WUA would operate on the frontier. The average scale efficiency,which can be calculated as the ratio between Constant and Variable Returns to Scale efficiencymeasures was around 71%, indicating that many WUAs are not operating at an efficient scale. Subvectorsefficiencies show that WUAs present better performances in maintenance activities than inmanagement. The inefficiency found can furthermore be mainly attributed to the number of years ofexperience in operating a WUA in addition to the number of water pumping stations managed and therate of the exploited area. The scale inefficiencies are mainly due to administrative and organizationalvariables.";"Frija, Aymen

A probit approach is used to analyze the effect of perception of land degradation and other factors on the adoption of zaï and stone rows. The results of the estimation show that the availability of organic matter from small ruminants is determinant for the adoption of both zaï and stone rows. Although most of farmers are aware of the causes and consequences of land degradation, this factor does not significantly impact on farmers’ decision to invest in SWC measures. Opportunities do exist for making more efficient use of local sources of nutrients, such as small ruminants’ organic matter in combination with locally accepted SWC measures. This may increase farmers’ willingness to go beyond SWC measures, to invest in nutrient supply in their soils which are characterized by poor fertility.

In order to achieve economies of scale, transfer of the inefficiently held land by the part-time and absent farmers to the full-time farmers is essential. The paper thus proposes - as a third way beyond the centrally planned economy and free market system - the establishment of a law to oblige the lease of unused land to full-time farmers with a minimum lease term of one- (preferably five-) year so as to solve land waste and fragmentation and enlarge full-time farm sizes; improvement of village services to fulltime family farms; transformation of the trade-distorting to non-trade-distorting agricultural subsidies; and promotion of off-farm activities, so as to sustain land use under private land ownership and boost EU enlargement.

The HSI (habitat suitability index) and WUA (weighted useable area) of aquatic organisms were quantitatively calculated using a distributed runoff model coupled with a heat budget model, land cover data, and digital cartographic data. The results showed that the HSI values of O. masou masou and P. altivelis altivel tended to be high in locations where they were actually observed. The HSI distribution patterns of L. cruciata and L. lateralis showed different results, even though the two species are in the same genus and have similar life cycles. The HSI distribution of Anura sp. returned an average value for the whole basin except for urban and upstream basin areas. In fact, Anura sp. frogs were observed throughout the study basin. Incorporating the dynamic factor of water temperature in the model allowed for monthly evaluations, especially for annual migratory organisms, such as P. altivelis altivel. WUA fluctuations, considering river water temperature, can characterize the annual behavior of P. altivelis altivel and Anura sp., and the partial behavior of O. masou masou.";"Nukazawa, Kei

"AGRIS:US201400169197";"Modeling urban land use change by the integration of cellular automaton and Markov model";"";"Spatially land use models are indispensable for sustainable land use planning. This study demonstrates a combined Markov–Cellular Automata model to analyze temporal change and spatial distribution of land use stressed by natural and socioeconomic factors in Saga, Japan. Firstly, area change and spatial distribution of land use are calculated using GIS technology, and then the transition among different land use types is analyzed to obtain the transformation matrices during a period of 1976–2006. Meanwhile, an integration evaluation procedure with natural and socioeconomic data is used to generate the transition potential maps. Secondly, using the transition potential maps and transition matrices, a Markov–Cellular Automata model is established to simulate spatial distribution of land use in 2006. Finally, we use this Markov–Cellular Automata model to forecast the future land use changes during the period of 2015–2042. As a consequence, area change simulation predicts a continuing downward trend in agriculture land and forestland areas, as well as an upward trend in built-up areas; spatial distribution simulation indicates that built-up land will expand toward suburban regions, and land use of urban center is at the decline stage. Hence, if the current trends keep constant without holistic sustainable development measures, severe land use decline will ensue. The study is anticipated to help local authorities better understand and address a complex land use system, and develop the improved land use management strategies that can better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation.";"Guan, DongJie

We analyze and compare the efficiency of different sample-based approaches for the estimation of coverage of different land cover classes from aerial imagery in a case study in Lower Saxony, Germany on the basis of the estimated standard errors. A complete delineation of vegetation classes in n = 279 aerial photo plots of 400 × 400� m thrown onto the study region of 1,117.7 km² in accordance with a systematic grid is compared to different configurations of line intercept sampling and clusters of points. The observation designs under study are characterized by different complexity and total size of the observation units and therefore also to the efforts related to yield a single observation. Especially for those classes that cover a relatively large proportion of the sampling frame, our results show that difference in performance between the different designs are negligible. A cluster of four transects of 200 m each allows estimating the area of land cover classes with high coverage with nearly similar precision as a complete mapping of fixed area plots of 16 ha each.

This concern has been particularly evident in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and the Amazon, but disastrous fires in recent summers in Australia, Europe, and the United States have drawn worldwide attention. Concern about forest fires, and related air pollution and biodiversity impacts, led international organisations and northern countries - such as the Asian Development Bank, the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Bank, and the government of Germany - to undertake fire assessments and provide technical assistance. Nongovernmental organisations, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and World Wide Fund for Nature, have also devoted increased attention to fires. Aiming at prevention of future fires, 40 fire projects and missions costing well over US$30 million have worked in Indonesia over the last 20 years. Despite the money and effort spent on them, fires continue to burn every year. It may appear to some that efforts to address the 'fire problem' have not been effective as fires still occur. There remains a lack of clarity about 'fire problems', which has, at times, led to the adoption of policies that may have negative impacts on livelihoods, the environment, and the economy. Two 'simple' changes in the way fires are considered would significantly improve fire-related policies and initiatives. Fires should be seen as a component of land management processes, rather than as a 'problem' to be prevented, suppressed, or mitigated. Not all fires are the same. These two points are discussed in the context of Southeast Asia, and particularly Indonesia, as an example of the problems and questions faced by tropical countries. We argue that efforts on fires so far have generated increased knowledge of the 'fire problem'; now, we need to capitalize on that knowledge to avoid wasting money in the future.";"Tacconi, L.

"AGRIS:US201301567861";"inventory of the mires of Hokkaido, Japan--their development, classification, decline, and conservation";"";"Hokkaido Island is located in the cool temperate zone, and its climate conditions facilitated the formation of a variety of wetland types, the majority of them peat-forming mires. Most of these remained in a natural state until the early 20th century. However, drainage and subsequent conversion mostly to agricultural land have since destroyed more than 70% of the original wetland ecosystems. This paper (1) provides an overview of mire types, (2) reviews the development process of mires in Hokkaido during the Holocene, (3) analyzes the causes of losses of wetland areas, and (4) gives a summary of the current conservation and management status. Basic mire types that have been described in other parts of the northern hemisphere can also be recognized in Hokkaido, although there are floristic differences, and the frequency and intensity of volcanic impact and tsunamis is higher than in most other regions with abundant mire formation. Mire formation started at various points during the postglacial period; a few mountain mires in southwest Hokkaido date back to the Lateglacial, but most mountain mires formed during the mid to late Holocene. Most lowland mires developed at altitudes below 20 m and were influenced by the Jomon transgression that peaked ca. 6,000 years BP. The largest lowland mires started forming after the sea retreated, and many are not older than ca. 3,000 years. In 1996, the total number of wetlands (including peat-forming mires, freshwater marshes, and saltmarshes) greater than 1 ha was 150, with a total area of 59,881 ha. In 1928, when many wetlands were yet undeveloped, their total area was 200,642 ha. Most losses occurred between the 1950s and 1970s, when post-war development economics promoted agriculture and large-scale reclamation projects. Currently, 90.7% of mountain wetlands are public land, while 81.3% of the lowland wetlands are private or in mixed ownership. The ownership condition affects the possibilities for the protection of complete mire complexes especially in the lowlands. For effective conservation of wetland ecosystems it is necessary to include the catchment area in the planning of protected areas.";"Fujita, Hiroko

This study provides an updated overview of the black wattle industries in both countries, including planted areas and land ownership, silviculture and management, bark extract production, woodchip exports, as well as key research and development issues. The current total planted area to black wattle is 110 000 ha in South Africa and c. 170 000 ha in Brazil. In both countries black wattle is mainly cultivated by farmers (c. 76–78% of the total area). Due to the high prices fetched by the wattle woodchips in the international market, black wattle is a profitable crop. In South Africa, the timber provides 85% of the revenue and the bark the other 15%, and thus the commercial emphasis has shifted from bark to timber. At present the only significant secondary products are charcoal and firewood. Acacia mearnsii bark tannins are used in the leather industry, adhesives for wood composites, water flocculants and specialty products for the chemical, food and beverage industries. The world demand for vegetable tannins has remained unchanged over the past two decades due to intense competition from synthetic tannins. South Africa produces about 45 000 t of bark extract annually, whereas Brazil produces 30 000–40 000 t. The annual value of A. mearnsii extract from South Africa and Brazil is about US$100 million. The total wattle woodchip exports from South Africa and Brazil in 2013 was 800 000 bone dry metric tonnes (BDMT) and 570 000 BDMT, respectively, with an estimated value of US$208 million. Acacia mearnsii offers important economic advantages for pulp production (higher wood density and pulp yield, which translate into higher digester productivity and factory output), and is highly suitable for hardwood bleached kraft pulping, dissolving and semi-chemical pulps. These factors make A. mearnsii a sought-after species and have ensured a sustained demand for wattle woodchips in the Japanese market, and today continue to attract new customers in emerging markets (China and India). The most important challenges for the black wattle industry in South Africa are (1) to maintain the wattle land base and improve productivity from the existing resource and (2) considering that black wattle is a highly labour-intensive crop and the recent increases in labour costs, it is necessary to revisit current silviculture practices from a costs–yield perspective and to develop mechanised harvesting/bark stripping systems. The Brazilian wattle industry faces important challenges in silviculture, tree improvement, and pests and diseases, which require further research and collaboration between the few players involved. It is important for both Brazil and South Africa to develop domestic markets for wattle solid wood as additional sources of income for the many farmers growing wattle.";"Chan, Julian Moreno

A vascular wilt disease of A. koa resulting from infection by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. koae (FOXY) causes high rates of mortality in field plantings and threatens native A. koa forests in Hawai'i. Landowners are reluctant to consider A. koa for reforestation and restoration in many areas due to the threat of FOXY. Producing seeds or propagules with genetic resistance to FOXY is vital to successful A. koa reforestation and restoration. Virulent FOXY isolates were used in seedling inoculation trials to evaluate resistance levels among A. koa families in greenhouse experiments. Seedling survival varied by family, ranging from 3% to 92%, with an overall average of 46%. One clonal and three seedling field trials were established in 2012 and 2013 using selected families based on the inoculation trials. The greenhouse screening method serves as a powerful tool to rapidly evaluate A. koa families prior to outplanting, but the field trial data are needed to further validate the results and to monitor the durability over time. The field trials will also serve as a source of germplasm for selection of other commercial traits.";"Dudley, Nicklos S

Climate change to 2099 was derived from seven UKCP09 future projections and the UK Met Office’s historical dataset. Land management scenarios were established based on outputs from earlier published investigations. Modelling results suggested that as climate changes, the response of blanket peat erosion will be spatially very variable across Great Britain. Both relative changes and absolute values of sediment yield were predicted to be higher in southern and eastern areas than in western and northern parts of Great Britain, peaking in the North York Moors of eastern England. Areas with high precipitation and low temperature were predicted to have low relative erosion changes and absolute sediment yield. The model suggested that summer desiccation may become more important for blanket peat erosion under future climate change, and that temperature was more dominant than precipitation in controlling long-term blanket peat erosion change. However, in the North York Moors, precipitation appeared to be more dominant in driving long-term erosion change. Land management measures were shown to provide a means to mitigate against the impacts of climate change on blanket peat erosion.";"Li, Pengfei

At the same time it can contribute to improve the linkage between the role of land use patterns and the understanding of land system functioning and its contribution to human well-being. The concept should be developed in a way that can be applicable in socio-ecological systems where nature and society are capable of enhancing their roles mutually. The objective of this paper is to suggest a standardized scheme and generalizable criteria to assess how successful the application of the ES concept contributed to facilitate participatory planning. We consider three potential advantages and three critical aspects for how to improve the applicability and relevance of the ES concept in planning. Hereon based, we present a balanced score card tool for which we broke down to advantages and risks into concrete questions. We illustrate the application of this approach with two case studies, representatives of two major governance schemes in relation to land use planning. We demonstrate that the balanced score card approach helps to reveal potential imbalances regarding the consideration of different ES groups. It supports testing the potential of the ES concept to enhance or not interactions of local and regional actors. We conclude that the framework should be reconsidered after a set of case studies to be developed into a monitoring tool for supporting planning practices.";"Fürst, Christine

In order to quantify the effect of LU/LC, topography, and morphology, runoff and sediment yield of a small multivegetated watershed in a sub-humid subtropical region in India were simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and were compared with measured values. The mixed land use watershed displayed a synchronized runoff response to monsoon rains. Measured runoff and sediment yield varied one sub-watershed to another and ranged, respectively, from 256.33 to 367.83 mm and from 0.27 to 11.65 t/ha for 734.90 mm of rainfall in 2000 and from 310.36 to 393.49 mm and from 0.84 to 10.71 t/ha for 765.50 mm of rainfall in 2001. The correlation coefficient between rainfall and runoff was 0.86, that between runoff and sediment yield was 0.56, and that between rainfall and sediment yield was 0.55. The sub-watersheds with relatively high forest cover (SWS1 and SWS2) showed significantly less runoff and sediment yield (310.36 mm and 0.84 t/ha), whereas a sub-watershed with more area under cultivation produced higher runoff (393.5 mm) and higher sediment yield (11.65 t/ha). Measured and model simulated estimates of runoff and sediment yield from different sub-watersheds were employed to prioritize control measures in the watershed comprising areas under cultivation, waste, fallow and eroded land, and forest and bushes. The average estimates of sediment yield from different sub-watersheds were used to prioritize the checkdam construction as an effective measure to control sediment transport to downstream water resources.";"Mishra, Ashok

"AGRIS:US201400051428";"Working Knowledge: characterising collective indigenous, scientific, and local knowledge about the ecology, hydrology and geomorphology of Oriners Station, Cape York Peninsula, Australia";"";"The term, Working Knowledge, is introduced to describe the content of a local cross-cultural knowledge recovery and integration project focussed on the indigenous-owned Oriners pastoral lease near Kowanyama on the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. Social and biophysical scientific researchers collaborated with indigenous people, non-indigenous pastoralists, and an indigenous natural resource management (NRM) agency to record key ecological, hydrological and geomorphological features of this intermittently occupied and environmentally valuable ‘flooded forest’ country. Working Knowledge was developed in preference to ‘local’ and/or ‘indigenous’ knowledge because it collectively describes the contexts in which the knowledge was obtained (through pastoral, indigenous, NRM, and scientific labour), the diverse backgrounds of the project participants, the provisional and utilitarian quality of the collated knowledge, and the focus on aiding adaptive management. Key examples and epistemological themes emerging from the knowledge recovery research, as well as preliminary integrative models of important hydro-ecological processes, are presented. Changing land tenure and economic regimes on surrounding cattle stations make this study regionally significant but the Working Knowledge concept is also useful in analysing the knowledge base used by the wider contemporary indigenous land management sector. Employees in this expanding, largely externally funded, and increasingly formalised sector draw on a range of knowledge in making operational decisions – indigenous, scientific, NRM, bureaucratic and knowledge learned in pastoral and other enterprises. Although this shared base is often a source of strength, important aspects or precepts of particular component knowledges must necessarily be deprioritised, compromised, or even elided in everyday NRM operations constrained by particular management logics, priorities and funding sources. Working Knowledge accurately characterised a local case study, but also invites further analysis of the contemporary indigenous NRM knowledge base and its relationship to the individual precepts and requirements of the indigenous, scientific, local and other knowledges which respectively inform it.";"Barber, M.

A total of 259 phytosociological relevés in four regions were resurveyed after periods of between 17 and 29 years. Analysis of the data revealed that floristic composition of the grasslands changed significantly during the study period, although the factor 'time' explained only a small proportion of the total variation (2.0-4.1%). The shifts in floristic composition were interpreted as indicators of changing management intensity due to continuing changes in agricultural structures. In three of the study regions there was an increase in species that are competitive under nutrient-rich conditions, possess high roughage quality and are tolerant of frequent mowing, indicating that the intensity of management had increased. Despite this apparent intensification, however, the initially high mean values per plot for species number (30.7-36.3) and evenness (0.72-0.77) mainly increased during the interval between the surveys. In the study region with the highest intensity of management, the abundance of weed species increased on some sites and the indicator value for roughage quality decreased, suggesting that intensification had been excessive and had destabilised these plant communities. Floristic shifts in the fourth study region, where the number of farms had declined considerably, mainly indicated extensification, especially on more marginal sites. The nature conservation value of the plant communities (i.e. number per plot of species indicating ecological quality) decreased in the three study regions where the floristic changes indicated that management had been intensified (-0.4 to -0.7 species) but increased in the fourth region (+1.1 species). It is concluded that the intensification of management in the fertile grasslands of the Alpine regions studied has been less extreme than in many European lowland areas, and that the developments have in most cases been sustainable. However, the evidence of some destabilised plant communities suggests that management intensity is now too high on these sites.";"Peter, M.

While natural habitats will form the cornerstone of conservation efforts in production-oriented environments, the success of these efforts will be enhanced by a greater understanding of the potential contribution of the increasingly modified countryside ('matrix') elements in these landscapes. Here, we investigate the relative occurrence of birds in some landscape elements (i.e. land-uses, vegetation types) common to agricultural environments around the world. Twenty-seven study mosaics (1kmx1km in size), selected to incorporate variation in the cover of native vegetation and the richness of different landscape elements, were sampled in Gippsland, south-eastern Australia. Birds were surveyed in five main types of elements: native vegetation, linear vegetation, plantation, scattered trees and pasture. The greatest number of species was recorded in native vegetation, the most important element for the majority of birds in Australian agricultural landscapes. Nevertheless, most countryside elements had value for many species; particularly structurally complex elements. Ordination analyses (based on presence/absence data for 81 species) showed that the composition of bird communities differed between elements. The number of mosaics in which 'all species' and 'woodland species' were recorded was positively related to the breadth of elements they used; thus species using a greater number of elements occurred more frequently in the study region. Correlation analyses identified that the richness of woodland species (those of increased conservation concern in Australia) in different elements was influenced by features of the mosaic in which they occurred. Notably, the richness of woodland bird species recorded in scattered trees and pasture increased with local native vegetation cover. Key implications for conservation in Australian agricultural environments include: (1) native vegetation is vital for the persistence of birds in these landscapes, and thus is the primary element on which conservation efforts in agricultural landscapes depend; (2) countryside elements can enhance the conservation value of agricultural landscapes by (a) increasing structural complexity in largely cleared areas and (b) increasing the heterogeneity of the entire landscape; and (3) patches of different elements cannot be managed in isolation from their surroundings, as landscape properties affect the richness of bird assemblages in different elements.";"Haslem, Angie

"AGRIS:US201301959123";"Improving irrigation water operation in the lower reaches of the Amu Darya River – current status and suggestions";"";"Irrigated agriculture is widespread in the Central Asian drylands and important for food security of the region. However irrigation practices based on rules made for cotton production on large units do not provide adequate guidance for the now widespread small farms that produce cotton wheat and rice. Excessive unsustainable water use is the consequence. Land and water resource management practices were analysed in 2006 for the irrigated area (approx. 1885 ha) of a water users' association (WUA) as a case study. The Shomakhulum WUA is situated in the Khorezm region Uzbekistan in the Aral Sea Basin. The designed water allowance of 0.40 l s−1 ha−1 was 46% higher than the 0.21 l s−1 ha−1 required in 2006. A ponding experiment conducted at two locations under typically shallow groundwater conditions showed that actual seepage losses in the major distributing canal (Pakhtakiyar) in the WUA were about 2% at one site and negative at the other. This does not support the present blanket recommendation of an additional 29% of water to compensate for anticipated seepage losses. Considering the effects of shallow groundwater the seasonal leaching requirements were estimated at 200 mm versus the 400 mm based on the blanket local recommendations for a 14 ha cotton field. However the actually applied water amounted to 670 mm which exceeds the calculated requirements by 235% and the local recommendation by 68%. The findings showed (i) excessive irrigation water supply and in turn high wastage owing to an underestimation of the potential shallow groundwater contribution (ii) overestimation of conveyance losses and (iii) excessive leaching due to outdated knowledge on leaching requirements when compared to standards. We suggest that the outdated water allowance the inaccurate estimation of the conveyance efficiency and excessive water applications during leaching cause a waste of precious fresh water and a rise in the shallow groundwater levels which consequently increases secondary soil salinity. The revision of irrigation and leaching norms combined with an improved knowledge on seepage dynamics under shallow groundwater levels is needed before any further recommendations can be made to the farmers in order to reach the objective of sustainable agriculture in the area.";"Awan, Usman Khalid

Our study examined the soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) contents inside and outside four grazing exclosures that had been established more than four decades ago in the semi-arid sagebrush steppe of Wyoming. Non-grazed soil carbon parameters were compared to those of the adjacent grazed soils to examine the effects of long-term grazing exclusion on the soil carbon accumulation and storage of this particular ecological region. Soil organic carbon concentration in these soils ranged from 3.67 to 53.8mgg⁻¹ dry soil. There was no significant difference in SOC due to treatment (grazing exclusion) in three of the four sites. Carbon to nitrogen ratios ranged from 10 to 11 with only one site exhibiting greater C:N ratio in ungrazed soil than in grazed soil. Microbial biomass carbon concentrations ranged from 99 to 1011μgg⁻¹ dry soil in the study sites. All pairwise comparisons (with correlation coefficients from 0 to 1 at α =0.05 level) between MBC and SOC were significantly positive and strong for ungrazed soil in all four sites. Greater MBC was observed in the ungrazed soil than in the grazed soil at two sites, demonstrating that long-term grazing exclusion promoted enrichment of the labile soil carbon pool.";"Shrestha, Gyami

However using suitable seedbed types and manipulating planting dates can minimize the effects. A four‐year (2000–2003) field experiment was conducted to evaluate three seedbed types broad bed and furrows (BBF) with early planting the traditional ridge and furrows (RF) and its modified version (wide ridge and furrows (WRF)) both under early and late planting in terms of water productivity of wheat. The FAO AquaCrop model was used to estimate crop water requirements. The result indicated that late planting on WRF or RF significantly (p < 0.05) increased grain yield and water productivity. Late planting on WRF (LWRF) increased rainfall water productivity by 66 44 and 51% respectively as compared to BBF early‐planted WRF (EWRF) and late‐planted RF (LRF). This was because of its increased effective area for crop growth over the RF and its relative suitability of planting time over the BBF. Therefore late‐planted WRF can be used for enhanced water productivity of wheat while introducing fast‐grow crops that are tolerant to waterlogging and growing early in the season may further enhance the land and water productivity in the area.";"Erkossa, Teklut.erkossa@cgiar.org

Such forces and conditions are recognised at three levels of discretion: (i) the generic level (ii) the government level (iii) the on‐farm level. The drainage development for salinity control of irrigated land in the (semi) arid zone is treated as a special case of drainage development driven by its own specific forces and considerations. Relevant comparisons have also been made with the development and adoption of other agricultural technologies such as farm mechanisation the seed–fertiliser package and irrigation. It is concluded that drainage development in regular rainfed agricultural land is primarily driven by its (farm) economic utility as an instrument for achieving more profitable land use and for overcoming constraints to further agricultural development. For drainage development to become a priority the level of agricultural development must generally have passed the threshold level at which the prevailing drainage conditions of the land have become a critical constraint to higher yields crop choice and efficient farm operations.";"Smedema, Lambert K.";"";"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301959128";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.615";"";"";"";"654-659"

Predictions for the development of the biofuel sector are either departing from the supply-side or the demand-side, but are mostly based on modelling efforts with an unclear experimental basis and only broadly defined economic settings. Results vary widely and tend to undervalue technical progress in processing efficiency or management-related increases in biomass yields. Moreover, calculations often neglect the impact of climate change, the need for irrigation and processing water, for soil fertility maintenance and the importance of socio-economic issues. Against these shortcomings and in view of several decades to centuries of Ecosystem Carbon Payback Times of most biofuel plantations, their future as a large-scale replacement for hydrocarbons will strongly depend on improved matter conversion efficiencies and successful prevention mechanisms for conflicts over land use.";"Andreas Buerkert

"AGRIS:US201600100011";"Testing Integrated Management Strategies for Tall Buttercup (Ranunculus acris) in Irrigated Hayfield Meadows";"";"Tall buttercup is an invasive forb that has been reported in all but eight states and one Canadian province. The species has been of concern in Montana where it has invaded over 8,300 ha, and it has been particularly problematic in irrigated hayfield meadows that are used for forage production. This study sought to develop an integrated management strategy to control tall buttercup while maintaining forage production. Research was conducted over 2 yr at flood-irrigated and subirrigated hayfield meadows near Twin Bridges, MT. Treatments were randomly applied in a split-plot design with four replications at both sites. Herbicide treatments occurred at the whole-plot level: nonsprayed, aminopyralid (172 g ai ha⁻¹), aminocyclopyrachlor + chlorsulfuron (83 g ai ha⁻¹ + 33 g ai ha⁻¹), and dicamba (981 g ai ha⁻¹). Split plots consisted of mowing and fertilization (28 kg N ha⁻¹). All herbicides provided up to 2 yr of tall buttercup control at both sites. In the second year, aminocyclopyrachlor + chlorsulfuron and aminopyralid reduced tall buttercup by 93% and 96%, respectively, for the subirrigated and flood-irrigated sites. At the subirrigated site, mowing reduced tall buttercup by 71%, and fertilization reduced it by 57%. Forage decreased following aminocyclopyrachlor + chlorsulfuron treatments. The integration of herbicide, mowing, and fertilization did not improve tall buttercup control.Nomenclature: Aminocyclopyrachlor; aminopyralid; chlorsulfuron; dicamba; tall buttercup, Ranunculus acris L. RANAC.Management Implications: Tall buttercup has been a problematic invader in New Zealand for many years. In North America the species has recently been of concern, especially in Montana where it is believed to reduce forage production in hayfield meadows. However, there are no published studies on tall buttercup management in North America, and landowners have little guidance about how to control the species, while maintaining productivity and plant diversity. In this study, we sought to develop an integrated management strategy to control tall buttercup while encouraging the growth of desirable forage plants, including perennial grasses and clovers. We used two study sites, one in a subirrigated hayfield and a second in a flood-irrigated hayfield in western Montana. We tested four herbicide treatments, including nonsprayed, aminopyralid (172 g ai ha⁻¹), aminocyclopyrachlor + chlorsulfuron (83 g ai ha⁻¹ + 33 g ai ha⁻¹), and dicamba (981 g ai ha⁻¹), mowing, and fertilization (28 kg N ha⁻¹), applied individually and in all possible combinations. Aminopyralid and aminocyclopyrachlor + chlorsulfuron most effectively reduced tall buttercup biomass. Dicamba also reduced tall buttercup compared to the nonsprayed treatment, but was not as effective as the other two herbicides. At the subirrigated site, mowing and fertilization used individually reduced tall buttercup. However, mowing or fertilization at the flood-irrigated site did not reduce tall buttercup, and their combination did not provide control at either site. Moreover, the integration of herbicides with mowing and fertilization did not improve tall buttercup control. Aminocyclopyrachlor + chlorsulfuron reduced perennial grasses at both sites, and all herbicides reduced clover, an important forage component of hayfield meadows, compared to nonsprayed plots across both sites. Although combinations of mowing and fertilization with or without herbicides did not improve control of tall buttercup over the use of herbicides alone, long-term integrated management can reduce selection pressure that could lead to herbicide resistance.";"Strevey, Hally K.

This study suggests a landscape value trade (LVT) scheme to be locally implemented so as to ensure the supply of agricultural landscape attributes demanded by local citizens. The feasibility of LVT, a ‘user-financed’ payment for environmental services (PES) scheme, is analysed in a local case from the southern part of Finland. We examine the disposition of both landowners (sellers) as well as residents (buyers). Of the landowners 43% were hesitant towards LVT, and for improvement of most of the attributes they demanded compensation exceeding their expenses. To examine the preferences of buyers for certain landscape attributes and also the existence of heterogeneity, we employed a random parameters logit (RPL) model with interactions. Buyers’ preferences were found to be spatially heterogeneous, and transaction costs are therefore expected to significantly determine the performance of LVT. However, a LVT plan that would incorporate the most significant landscape attributes, i.e. the presence of grazing animals, water buffer zone management in a natural state and the renovation of production buildings, was evaluated to be feasible to put into practice, while the aggregate benefits were almost twice as high as the anticipated costs.";"Grammatikopoulou, Ioanna

In 2013, we created a training program on five invasive plant species, specifically tailored to Québec (Canada) environmental managers. The course material was science-based, and included details on methods and costs. Here, we explain how this idea emerged, how the program was constructed and which types of managers were targeted. With modest resources, we reached 163 managers in less than 18 mo, who collectively oversee invasive species management for 41% of the Québec population. We presented factual information for all control methods, giving the environmental managers the tools to critically and objectively assess various options. Participants especially appreciated the highly practical content of the training and that they could submit their own invasion case for discussion. This program represents significant progress in narrowing the knowing–doing gap associated with the control of invasive plants in Québec, and we encourage such initiatives elsewhere for all fields of invasion biology.";"Lavoie, Claude

"AGRIS:US201400170068";"accidental outcome: Social capital and its implications for Landcare and the “status quo”";"";"For 25 years the Australian Landcare program has encouraged rural land managers to work cooperatively to resolve natural resource management issues across the nation. Landcare has spread and the model is used internationally. Despite its successes, Landcare has come under criticism for not sufficiently directing land management practices towards environmental sustainability. This criticism sees it as having maintained the “status quo”. Alternatively Landcare has been credited with acting as an agent that creates social capital, bringing neighbours together to share ideas and implement cooperative projects. We use the concept of social capital to offer insight into how Landcare groups as social networks can either inhibit or promote changes in land management. Using findings from a study of 16 Landcare groups in South Eastern Victoria, Australia, we demonstrate that various forms of social capital can act to either inhibit or empower individuals and groups to challenge the status quo of land management practice. We explain how the intentions of these grass roots organisations are to emphasise local knowledge, ownership and power. However, in some cases these actions produce the accidental outcome of maintaining the status quo. We argue that the way Landcare groups are supported can further aggravates this. At a time when the health of Landcare is in question, and the need for solutions to natural resource management problems are critical, understanding the implications of these findings will enable institutions to tailor programs to facilitate groups to challenge the status quo and reinvigorate interest in Landcare as a community building model.";"Compton, Erlina

This process is accompanied by accelerating degradation and loss of environmental services. Despite an extraordinary richness in native tree diversity, more than 90% of all forest plantations established in Ecuador consist of exotic species, primarily Eucalyptus spp. and Pinus spp. This is mainly due to the lack of information about the autecological and synecological requirements of the native species. The present study aims at providing basic knowledge on the early height development of native species in comparison to exotics. 12,000 seedlings of exotic and native species were planted in experimental trials at three sites of different successional stages: recently abandoned pastures (Setaria sphacelata), bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum) and shrubs. The results presented in this study refer to the status of the seedlings 3 years after planting. Soil data were revealed from soil core analysis from a total of 1008 soil samples distributed systematically over all plots. Soil chemical data were derived from a subsample of 125 randomly selected soil core sites. Soil properties in the study area emerged to be extremely heterogeneous. More than 60% of all plots presented two or more soil clusters. Soils in general were very poor in plant available N. Soil heterogeneity affected extractable Mn and Mg, dominating vegetation cover in turn affected Mn and P. Differences in soil properties had a strong effect for Eucalyptus saligna and Alnus acuminata. Manual above ground weeding showed species-specific effects: Tabebuia chrysantha and Heliocarpus americanus showed improved height growth, while that of Cedrela montana was reduced. There is evidence that A. acuminata can compete in growth with exotic species. Early successional species and exotics performed best on pasture dominated sites. Height growth of the mid-successional species C. montana was facilitated by bracken fern under certain soil conditions, and shrubs facilitated growth of T. chrysantha. The results indicate that reforestation with native species in Ecuador is possible but requires intensive consideration of interactions with soil properties and accompanying vegetation. Macroscopic soil core analysis can be a suitable instrument for detecting small-scale variation of soil properties. Nevertheless, a characterisation of both small-scale variation as well as variation on higher spatial scales, for instance by aerial photographs, is essential for effective planning of reforestation measures in the Andes.";"Günter, Sven

We identified nine specific project types, characterized by consistent combinations of tools and activities. TNC and WWF used project types differently; TNC focused more on land purchase, whereas WWF concentrated more on developing markets.

"AGRIS:US201500183972";"Ascribing soil erosion types for sediment yield using composite fingerprinting technique";"";"Soil erosion and eroded sediment are serious threats to sound land management. However, less attention has been given to quantifying the importance of different soil erosion features based on appropriate control measures that could be designated. Accordingly, this research was planned to quantify the contribution of potential sediment sources, i.e. sheet, rill and gully erosion, in Idelo watershed in Zanjan Province, Iran, using composite fingerprinting. Toward this aim, 16 geochemical and organic tracers were detected in sediment sources and sediment deposited at the outlet. The results of applying the composite fingerprinting technique, with a relative error of 16%, showed that sheet, rill and gully sources contributed 56%, 44% and 0%, respectively, to sediment yield. It was also apparent from the results that the composite fingerprinting approach could be successfully utilized to assess the provenance of sediment deposited at the main outlet of the study watershed by soil erosion type.

"AGRIS:US201600101729";"Carbon management in dryland agricultural systems. A review";"";"Dryland areas cover about 41 % of the Earth’s surface and sustain over 2 billion inhabitants. Soil carbon (C) in dryland areas is of crucial importance to maintain soil quality and productivity and a range of ecosystem services. Soil mismanagement has led to a significant loss of carbon in these areas, which in many of them entailed several land degradation processes such as soil erosion, reduction in crop productivity, lower soil water holding capacity, a decline in soil biodiversity, and, ultimately, desertification, hunger and poverty in developing countries. As a consequence, in dryland areas proper management practices and land use policies need to be implemented to increase the amount of C sequestered in the soil. When properly managed, dryland soils have a great potential to sequester carbon if financial incentives for implementation are provided. Dryland soils contain the largest pool of inorganic C. However, contrasting results are found in the literature on the magnitude of inorganic C sequestration under different management regimes. The rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels will greatly affect dryland soils, since the positive effect of CO₂ on crop productivity will be offset by a decrease of precipitation, thus increasing the susceptibility to soil erosion and crop failure. In dryland agriculture, any removal of crop residues implies a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC). Therefore, the adoption of no-tillage practices in field crops and growing cover crops in tree crops have a great potential in dryland areas due to the associated benefits of maintaining the soil surface covered by crop residues. Up to 80 % reduction in soil erosion has been reported when using no-tillage compared with conventional tillage. However, no-tillage must be maintained over the long term to enhance soil macroporosity and offset the emission of nitrous oxide (N₂O) associated to the greater amount of water stored in the soil when no-tillage is used. Furthermore, the use of long fallow periods appears to be an inefficient practice for water conservation, since only 10–35 % of the rainfall received is available for the next crop when fallow is included in the rotation. Nevertheless, conservation agriculture practices are unlikely to be adopted in some developing countries where the need of crop residues for soil protection competes with other uses. Crop rotations, cover crops, crop residue retention, and conservation agriculture have a direct positive impact on biodiversity and other ecosystem services such as weed seed predation, abundance and distribution of a broad range of soil organisms, and bird nesting density and success. The objective of sequestering a significant amount of C in dryland soils is attainable and will result in social and environmental benefits.";"Plaza-Bonilla, Daniel

Facing the concern of health risk, the toxic pollutants emitted from incinerators have attracted much attention from environmentalists, even though this technology is capable of reducing solid waste volume and demand for landfill areas, together with plenty of energy generation. To reduce the negative impacts of toxic chemicals emitted from incinerators, various monitoring and control plans are made not only for use in facilities performance evaluation but also better control of operation for stable effluent quality. How to screen out the key variables from massive observed and control variables for modeling the dioxin emission has become an important issue in incinerator operation and pollution prevention. For these reasons, this study used 4-year monitoring data of an incinerator in Taiwan as a case study, and developed a prediction model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) to forecast the dioxin emission. By doing this, a simplified monitoring strategy for incinerators with regarding to dioxin emission control can be achieved. The result indicated that the prediction model based on a back-propagation neural network is a promising method to deal with complex and non-linear data with the help of statistics in screening out the useful variables for modeling. The suitable architecture of an ANN for using in the dioxin prediction consists of 5 input factors, 3 basic layers with 8 hidden nodes. The R² was found to equal 0.99 in both the training and testing steps. In addition, sensitivity analysis can identify the most significant variables for the dioxin emission. From the obtained results, the frequency of activated carbon injection showed as the factor of highest relative importance for the dioxin emission.";"Bunsan, Sond

User groups with an interest in past land cover include the climate modelling community, socio‐ecological historians and earth system scientists. Europe is one of the continents with the longest histories of land conversion from forest to farmland, thus understanding land cover change in this area is globally significant. This study applies the pseudobiomization method (PBM) to 982 pollen records from across Europe, taken from the European Pollen Database (EPD) to produce a first synthesis of pan‐European land cover change for the period 9000 bp to present, in contiguous 200 year time intervals. The PBM transforms pollen proportions from each site to one of eight land cover classes (LCCs) that are directly comparable to the CORINE land cover classification. The proportion of LCCs represented in each time window provides a spatially aggregated record of land cover change for temperate and northern Europe, and for a series of case study regions (western France, the western Alps, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia). At the European scale, the impact of Neolithic food producing economies appear to be detectable from 6000 bp through reduction in broad‐leaf forests resulting from human land use activities such as forest clearance. Total forest cover at a pan‐European scale moved outside the range of previous background variability from 4000 bp onwards. From 2200 bp land cover change intensified, and the broad pattern of land cover for preindustrial Europe was established by 1000 bp. Recognizing the timing of anthropogenic land cover change in Europe will further the understanding of land cover‐climate interactions, and the origins of the modern cultural landscape.";"Fyfe, Ralph M.

"AGRIS:US201301906948";"How much browse is available for goats that graze Mediterranean woodlands";"";"The difficulty of determining the intake of browse grazed by goats is widely recognized. We suggest that a reasonable estimate of the amount of edible browse available to goats grazing shrubby Mediterranean vegetation can be derived from actual grazing data of goat herds that have obtained most of their annual maintenance requirements from pasture dominated by shrubs or shrubby trees. We have conducted such estimates on three forests in the Hills of Judea, two of which were grazed by milking herds and one by a herd producing mainly kids. The estimated long-term annual carrying capacity of the shrubby vegetation ranged between 457 and 725 grazing days per ha of shrub cover for the milking herds and 735 grazing days per ha for the non-milking herd. Assuming an average daily DM intake of 1.5kg/goat/day, the amount of browse DM consumed from the woody vegetation was estimated to be between 686 and 1103kg/ha of shrubby vegetation. In the literature, estimates of annual DM production of new growth of shrubby vegetation range widely between 200 and 2000kg/ha, but as most estimates do not indicate the cover of the woody vegetation, the actual amounts produced by a unit area of shrubby vegetation could well be higher. The browse ingested by the goats in the Judean Hills is evidently somewhere between half to one-third of the annual above ground DM production. The estimates derived in the present study define a range of useable browse production on Mediterranean woodland that is derived from actual, long-term use of shrubby pasture by commercial goat herds. They indicate that the nutritional value of the pasture for goats is, as a rule, more than double that for sheep or cattle.";"Evlagon, David

The processes that are affected by land use and management are generally understood, but uncertainties in projections are high. In this paper, we investigate the long-term effects of chronosequential land use change from grassland to cropland and vice versa on soil carbon stock dynamics in four fields on a Swedish farm. Between 1850 and 1920, three of the fields were converted from grassland into cropland, and one was converted back to grassland in 1971. The fourth (control) field is a grassland that has never been ploughed. In 1937, the four fields were sampled at 111 points in a regular grid (25 or 50 m) and the dried soil samples were stored at our Department. In 1971 and 2002, the original grid points were revisited and re-sampled. Land use changes affected the soil C stock significantly. In 1937, carbon stocks were significantly smaller in the arable fields than in the grassland soil. In the field that was converted from arable back to grassland, soil C increased significantly at an average rate of about 0.4 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. A soil C balance model (ICBM) driven by standard meteorological data and soil carbon input estimated from yield records described soil carbon dynamics reasonably well, although the range of simulated relative changes in C stocks between 1937 and 2002 in the four fields (from -7.4 to +8.8%) was narrower than those measured (from -19.5 to +16.5%). There are only few long-term studies in Northern Europe available for quantifying the effect of land use change on soil carbon stocks and the results presented here are therefore useful for improving predictions of changes in soil carbon driven by land use change.";"Kätterer, Thomas

"AGRIS:US201600101233";"Impacts of Changing Climate and Climate Variability on Seed Production and Seed Industry";"";"Agriculture is extremely sensitive to climate and weather conditions. The resilience of our crop production systems to changes in climate can be enhanced by improved understanding impacts and responses of crops to changing climates. Several countries in Asia and Africa are at the risk of losing about 280 million tons of potential cereal production as a result of climate change factor, particularly increasing temperatures and prolonged dry periods. The most significant negative changes for developing countries in Asia, where agricultural production declines of about −4% to −10% are anticipated under different socioeconomic and climate change scenarios. Rising temperatures will reduce the amount of fertile farmland, and by 2050, the amount of maize grown is expected to decline by 6–23% and wheat by 40–45%. The majority of the world’s food supply comes from the consumption of seeds from grain crops (wheat, rice, maize, soybean, barley, and sorghum), which are most vulnerable to changing climates. The growth in food production is lower than the population growth; therefore, there will be challenges of food security. Major impacts of climate change will be on rain-fed crops that account for nearly 60% of cropland area. As predicted, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa will be highly vulnerable to climate change. Crop production can be increased by the use of quality seeds of high-yielding stress-tolerant varieties, combined with judicious use of inputs, particularly water and nutrients. Climate changes affect all four dimensions of food security, that is, availability, access to food, stability of food supplies, and food utilization. The seed industry plays an important role in increasing food production. It provides high-quality seeds of high-yielding varieties in adequate quantities at the right time and right place. Climate change influences the population dynamics of insects, emergence of new pests, changing status of pest and disease development, and evolution of new races of pests. Quality seed production is also affected by crop/weed interactions, loss of pollinator biodiversity, and genetic diversity. The seed crop is also affected by climate change regarding change in crop phenology, reproduction, flowering, anthesis/pollen viability, and pollination/fertilization, length of seed-filling duration, seed setting, seed size, seed dormancy, seed yield, and ultimately seed quality. Therefore, the cost of seed production is likely to increase in changing climate due to scheduling of operations, land and water management, herbicide/insecticide applications, pollination management, and postharvest seed management. Issues regarding intellectual property rights (IPR) related to seed, including patent infringements, prevalence of monocultures, consolidations of transnational corporations through acquisitions and mergers, and biodiversity and pollinator-loss related issues further complicate the problem. The lack of trained conventional plant breeders, crop physiologists, and seed technologists and stronger interdisciplinary collaboration between agronomists and biologists need attention. Further, acceptance of engineered crop or seed, increasing cost of genetically engineered (GE) seed as compared with conventional seed with no yield advantage, increasing number of herbicide applications, culminate in loss in net farm income in developed countries. In this article, the issues regarding the impact of climate change (particularly increasing temperature and carbon dioxide concentrations) on seed production, the present trend of the global seed industry, are discussed.";"Singh, Rishi P.

This study compared the slope estimates of Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEMs with those generated by interpolation of topographic contours, at two grid cell resolutions. The magnitude and spatial patterns of error in DEM slope, and derived erosion estimates using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), were evaluated at three sites in eastern Australia. The sites have low-relief terrain and slope gradients less than 15%, characteristics which dominate the global land surface by area and are often highly utilised. Relative to a reference DEM resampled to the same resolution (a measure of DEM ‘quality’), the 90 m (3-s) SRTM DEM provided the best estimates of slopes, being within 20% for each 5% slope class outside alluvial floodplains where it over-predicted by up to 220%. Relative to a hillslope scale 10 m reference DEM, the 30 m (1-s) SRTM-derived DEM-S, provided slope gradient estimates slightly less biased towards under-prediction than the 90 m SRTM and significantly less biased on alluvial floodplains. In contrast, the 20 m vertical contour intervals underpinning the interpolated DEMs resulted in under-prediction of slope gradient by more than a factor of 5 over large contiguous areas (>1 km²). The 30 m DEM-S product provided the best estimate of hillslope erosion, being 3–4% better than the 90 m SRTM. The slope errors in the interpolated DEMs translated into generally poorer and less consistent erosion estimates than SRTM. From this study it is concluded that the SRTM DEM products, in particular the 30 m SRTM-derived DEM-S, provide estimates of slope gradient and erosion which are more accurate, and more consistent within and between low relief study sites, than interpolated DEMs.";"Kinsey-Henderson, Anne E.

"AGRIS:US201301920683";"Human-provoked amphibian decline in central Italy and the efficacy of protected areas";"";"Context Today, more than 32% of amphibian species are threatened and more than 43% face a steep decline in numbers. Most species are being affected simultaneously by multiple stressors and habitat protection is often inadequate to prevent declines. Aims The main goal of the present research was to understand the consequences of alternative human land use in producing landscape disturbance for amphibians. At the same time, we also evaluated the effect of changing climatic conditions as additional potential drivers of population decline. Another goal was to determine whether and to what extent the existing nature reserves have been effective in protecting species in recent decades. Methods We used generalised additive models (GAMs) to investigate the association between the state (stable/decline) of amphibian populations in 5×5km cells in central Italy and proxies of different typology of anthropogenic stressors, climatic variables and protection measures. Key results We found a significant association between anthropogenic landscape modifications and species decline. This negative relationship was revealed with agricultural predictors for the majority of the species, whereas urban fabrics had a slightly smaller impact. We found significant associations between amphibian declines and climatic variation, particularly the increasing number of dry days. Protected areas protected declines of two species only. Conclusions Our results showed that the status of amphibians in this region warrants greater attention than has been given previously. The detrimental effect of agricultural practices, combined with increasing aridity, makes amphibian populations particularly susceptible to extinction, and the conservation measures applied till now are inadequate for species protection in this region. Implications Our results should stimulate the implementation of environmental policies that focus not only on the protection of single habitats, but also on ensuring the environmental quality of the surrounding landscapes. Moreover, an adaptive management approach should be applied to take into account future modification of hydrology and climate.";"D'Amen, Manuela

Site selection for the establishment of large wind turbines, called wind farms, like any other engineering project, requires basic information and careful planning. This study assessed the possibility of establishing wind farms in Ardabil province in northwestern Iran by using a combination of analytic network process (ANP) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methods in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. DEMATEL was used to determine the criteria relationships. The weights of the criteria were determined using ANP and the overlaying process was done on GIS. Using 13 information layers in three main criteria including environmental, technical and economical, the land suitability map was produced and reclassified into 5 equally scored divisions from least suitable to most suitable areas. The results showed that about 6.68� % of the area of Ardabil province is most suitable for establishment of wind turbines. Sensitivity analysis shows that significant portions of these most suitable zones coincide with suitable divisions of the input layers. The efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid model (ANP-DEMATEL) was evaluated and the results were compared to the ANP model. The sensitivity analysis, map classification, and factor weights for the two methods showed satisfactory results for the ANP-DEMATEL model in wind power plant site selection.";"Azizi, Ali

"AGRIS:US201500220185";"Bird diversity and environmental heterogeneity in North America: a test of the area–heterogeneity trade‐off";"";"AIM: Deterministic niche theory predicts that increasing environmental heterogeneity increases species richness. In contrast, a recent stochastic model suggests that heterogeneity has a unimodal effect on species richness since high levels of heterogeneity reduce the effective area available per species, thereby increasing the likelihood of stochastic extinction (the ‘area–heterogeneity trade‐off’). We tested these contrasting predictions using data on bird distributions in North America. LOCATION: North America. METHODS: The effect of heterogeneity on species richness was tested using simultaneous autoregressive regression models based on two measures of heterogeneity (elevational range and land‐cover richness) each quantified at two scales (400 m, 5 km), three measures of species richness (observed, corrected for incomplete detection, and corrected for regional richness) and three variable selection methods [forced entry, Akaike information criterion (AIC)‐based and a null‐model approach]. Covariates included precipitation, temperature, elevation and latitude. For all variables, both linear and quadratic terms were included in the analyses. RESULTS: Overall, heterogeneity had a weak effect on species richness and the contribution of the quadratic term of heterogeneity to the explained variance was very small (< 1%). Nevertheless, in all 36 models, the coefficients of both the linear and quadratic terms of heterogeneity were statistically significant and the estimated inflection point was within the range of the data, as predicted by the area–heterogeneity trade‐off. Moreover, in 30 out of the 36 models, support for a unimodal effect of heterogeneity on species richness based on information theoretic criteria was strong (ΔAIC > 10), and in 22 of those 30 models the null hypothesis of a monotonically positive relationship could be rejected at the 0.05% significance level. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of bird richness in North America were predominantly consistent with the predictions of the area–heterogeneity trade‐off. Future attempts to understand the mechanisms affecting species diversity should pay more attention to the potential consequences of this fundamental trade‐off.";"Chocron, Rachel

"AGRIS:US201600199142";"approach for assessing suitability for forest management based on constraints of the physical environment at a regional scale1";"";"Constraints of the physical environment affect forest growth and forest operations. At a local scale, these constraints are generally considered during forest operations. At regional or continental scales, they are often integrated to larger assessments of the potential for a given land unit to be managed. In this study, we propose an approach to analyze the integration of physical-environment constraints in forest management activities at the regional scale (482â000 kmÂ²). The land features that pose constraints to forest management (i.e., hydromorphic organic deposits, dead-ice moraines, washed till, glacial block fields, talus, and active aeolian deposits, slopes > 40%) were evaluated within 1114 land districts. To distinguish land districts that can be suitably managed from those where constraints are too important for sustainable timber production, we carried out a sensitivity analysis of physical constraints for the 1114 land districts. After analysis of two portions of the study area under management, a land district was considered suitable for management when more than 20% of its land area consists of features imposing few constraints or, for mountain-type relief districts, when more than 40% of the land area consists of features imposing few constraints. These cutoff values were defined by expert opinion, based on sensitivity analyses performed on the entire study area, on analyses of two different sectors with different types of constraints and on a strong understanding of the study area. Our results show that land districts where the physical environment posed significant constraints covered 7.5% of the study area (36â000 kmÂ²). This study shows that doing an a priori classification of land units based on permanent environmental features could facilitate the identification of areas that are not suitable for forest management activities.";"Robitaille, AndrÃ©

"AGRIS:US201301793673";"Crofting and bumblebee conservation: The impact of land management practices on bumblebee populations in northwest Scotland";"";"The northwest of Scotland is a stronghold for two of the UK's rarest bumblebee species, Bombus distinguendus and Bombus muscorum. The predominant form of agricultural land management in this region is crofting, a system specific to Scotland in which small agricultural units (crofts) operate rotational cropping and grazing regimes. Crofting is considered to be beneficial to a wide range of flora and fauna. However, currently there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support this view with regard to bumblebee populations. In this study we assessed the effect of land management on the abundance of foraging bumblebees and the availability of bumblebee forage plants across crofts in northwest Scotland. The results of our study show that current crofting practices do not support high densities of foraging bumblebees. Traditional crofting practice was to move livestock to uplands in the summer, but this has been largely abandoned. Summer sheep grazing of lowland pasture had a strong negative impact on bumblebee abundance and forage plant availability throughout the survey period. The use of specific 'bird and bee' conservation seed mixes appears to improve forage availability within the crofted landscape, although the number of bees observed remained low. Of the forage plants available, the three most frequently visited species were from the Fabaceae. We therefore conclude that the creation of agri-environment schemes which promote the use of Fabaceae-rich seed mixes and encourage the removal of sheep grazing on lowland areas throughout the summer are essential in order to conserve bumblebee populations within crofted areas.";"Redpath, Nicola

"AGRIS:US2016213862";"The Ten Relationships in Rural Land Circulation";"";"The ten relationships during land circulation are discussed. Among them, the relationship between peasant household and government indicates that government should only carry out its service and regulatory functions and farmers should be the main body of land circulation, because peasants usually have no discourse power during land circulation. In the relationship between land ownership and contracting management right, we mainly discuss the transfer of land contracting management right and point out that land contracting management right within a certain period is the object of land circulation. In the relationship between land circulation and deepening reform, land circulation is only an approach to develop scale management and to deepen the reform. Land circulation can be accelerated only by vigorously developing secondary and tertiary industries and speeding up the transfer of rural surplus labor force. In the relationship between land circulation and land reform, it is pointed out that China at present is not suitable for a new land reform. In the relationship between the land contract with time limit and the contract system and private ownership system, contract system and private ownership system are unsuitable for China at present; and we should continue to insist on the land contract with time limit. In the relationship between land circulation and economic development, land circulation is a natural process without enforceability. Otherwise, it may hinder the development of rural economy. In the relationship between enterprise and peasant household, land circulation should be held among peasants and companies and enterprises can participate in it. The relationship between land circulation and agriculture business performance points out that land circulation should adapt to the local situation. Relationship between land circulation and land loss and annexation shows that land circulation must adhere to the moderate principle and prevent land loss of peasants into a handful of persons. And the relationship between small peasant economy and agricultural modernization indicates that economic model of small peasant economy may not be an obstacle to the modernization of agriculture.";"Cai, Zhirong

Vermont is known for its scenery, especially its agricultural landscape.  It has often been stated that Vermont's tourist industry, which represents 15% of the state's economy, depends upon this special landscape for its comparative advantage in the New England tourism market.  However, Vermont's landscape is changing.  The number of farms and acres of farmland have decreased significantly in the past several decades.  State policy makers are grappling with the challenge of supporting and preserving both the farm and tourist economies in the face of regional and global competition. This study quantifies the impact of the agricultural working landscape on tourist demand in Vermont.  Primary data were gathered through a survey of visitors to Vermont to determine how the disappearance of the agricultural landscape would affect their willingness to visit the state.  Findings indicate that 84% of respondents value the agricultural landscape of Vermont and 58.5% of the respondents would be less likely to visit Vermont if there were very few farms.  Knowing the level of this impact will help policy makers decide how much to invest in the preservation of farmland and marketing of farm visits and eco-tourism.";"Wood, Nancy

"AGRIS:US201301575387";"Effect of different agricultural management systems on chemical fertility in cultivated tepetates of the Mexican transvolcanic belt";"";"Volcanic soils in their natural state often require some amelioration to accommodate their use for agriculture. Tepetates are defined as hardened volcanic tuffs derived from geo-pedological processes; they have been partially altered by weathering. Tepetates occupy extensive areas of Mexico's Central Highlands and some of them have been adapted for agricultural use after the mechanical breaking up of this hard material. In their native condition tepetates contain only traces of C, N and available P. So, after their incorporation into agriculture production, the addition of fertilisers becomes necessary to improve soil fertility. In the present work changes in certain chemical and physico-chemical soil properties of cultivated tepetates were studied in the short-term (2002-2005) and medium-term (1986-2005) scales. Experimental plots situated in Tlalpan (State of Tlaxcala) were subjected to the following agricultural management systems: Traditional (Tt), Improved (Ti) and Organic (To). In the short term (4 years), the To management system, in which organic residues and manures were added, led to a decrease in the acidification tendency after cultivation, a recovery of initial exchangeable K⁺ levels, and an increase in soil organic C (SOC), total nitrogen (Nt) and available P (Pa) contents in the Ap horizon. The Ti management, in which crop residues and more chemical fertilisers were added, was especially efficient in increasing the concentration of available P. After 20 years of traditional cultivation, the tepetates showed a decrease in soil pH and exchangeable Mg²⁺ and K⁺ values, leading to a decline of the base saturation. These results point to the fragility and low buffer capacity of these systems. In contrast, a tendency of SOC, Nt and Pa accumulation was observed after 20 years of cultivation, influenced by the agricultural management system applied. Tepetates adapted for agricultural use evolved into more fertile substrates over the years of cultivation.";"Covaleda, Sara

"AGRIS:US201301575389";"Emergy evaluation and economic performance of banana cropping systems in Guadeloupe (French West Indies)";"";"Banana is the second most important agricultural commodity in Guadeloupe (French West Indies--FWI) and, to compensate the decline in international prices during the last 15 years, banana growers have intensified their production systems by increasing the use of technological inputs. Such intensification strategies, that require both material and investment increases, may impose economic as well as environmental risks, given the fragile island ecosystems. In order to assess the environmental performance of banana production in Guadeloupe, emergy synthesis methods were applied to six different types of banana cropping systems previously identified in the island. Additionally, aiming at improving managerial capacity and investment decision making, environmental performance results were contrasted with economic analysis for the six cropping systems. As a general outcome, these analyses showed that the better the environmental performance of the cropping system, the worse its economic performance. This result was corroborated by an increased contrast among cropping systems as related to their dependence on purchased inputs, although all cropping systems followed the same intensive and arguably wasteful agricultural model. Therefore, the analyses point out that sustainable banana production in Guadeloupe depends on a shift from the high fossil input model to a natural resources intensive one. In this sense, emergy flow analysis shows that innovation towards environmentally sound practices that would enhance nutrient cycling; integrate weeds, pests and diseases control; and improve the banana packing process might result in most positive impacts on overall sustainability. Economic analysis showed that the high labour costs contribute largely to the dependency of banana production on agricultural subsidies. However, reorienting the current European agricultural income policy to an environmental performance-based subvention might be a policy opportunity to achieve the present social goals while promoting sustainability in banana production. Furthermore, the EC regulation on quality standards for commercial bananas, by imposing strict aesthetic benchmarks, has a negative effect on the sustainability of banana production because substantial non-renewable and purchased emergy inflows into banana production systems aim to improve aesthetic standards over sound ecological management.";"de Barros, Inácio

Soil samples from 0.09m² blocks (100mm deep) were spread evenly in plastic containers in the greenhouse and studied over a 1-year period. The aboveground species composition was also compared. Sampling was from rangelands in excellent, good, moderate and poor conditions for each ecosystem. A total of 122 plant species were identified in the soil seed banks, with 32% in the Asbuli grassland, 35% in the Aydora open savanna and 33% in the Hurso closed savanna. Seedlings emerging from soil samples were in the order of decreasing number, grasses, forbs, woody plants, weeds and legumes. Seedling density decreased (P <0.05) in the soil seed bank with rangeland degradation in all ecosystems. Grass species richness was poorer in the degraded Asbuli grassland ecosystems, but increased in the Aydora open savanna and Hurso closed savanna. The grass species Tragus berteronianus and woody plant Crotolaria albicaulis dominated the botanical composition of the seed bank for all ecosystems with rangeland degradation. Eragrostis cilianensis and Eriochloa nubica were the dominant grass species in the soil seed bank of all ecosystems, regardless of rangeland degradation. There is no adequate evidence to prove that severe degraded rangelands in eastern Ethiopia maintain adequate soil seed banks that would improve the condition of it through restoration.

There are six subspecies distributed throughout the African subtropics, all of which manage to breed successfully during the winter dry season when few other cavity-nesting birds are actively nesting. In 2004, we recorded Meyer’s Parrots feeding on four cryptic arthropod larvae incubating inside fruits and pods in their seasonal diet. All of these were previously unknown in the diet of African parrots. Nesting females and chicks were fed regurgitate almost exclusively comprising these arthropod larvae for the first 10� weeks after nest occupation. In 2007, we demonstrated that Meyer’s Parrots actively search for these protein-rich arthropod larvae and synchronized their breeding effort within our study area to coincide their hatching period with the period of highest relative abundance of these larvae, resulting in a breeding synchrony index value of 79.3� % between females in the population. In 2009, we recorded the consumption of similar arthropod larvae parasitizing similar tree species in northern Zambia and two locations in Tanzania, thus confirming this behaviour throughout their distributional range. Similar behaviour is expected in their closest congeners, the Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus and Rüppell’s Parrot P. rueppellii. Poor land management practices (e.g. deforestation and frequent fires) most likely influence the abundance of these cryptic arthropod larvae and thus the breeding success of Meyer’s Parrot at population level.";"Boyes, Rutledge S.

"AGRIS:US201500162647";"Indicators for sustainable land use management in Santiago de Chile";"";"Indicators are helpful tools for land use management; especially in the context of sustainable urban development, they are indispensable information bases for decision making, communication, and awareness rising. For Santiago de Chile, like many other large and dynamic cities, a high complexity of geographical conditions, social and land use pattern, diverging interests, and a high velocity of development are characteristic. In this situation, the Risk Habitat Megacity (RHM) initiative seeks to support local and regional authorities in elaborating indicators applicable in land use and flood risk management. In this article, the indicator approach of the Land Use Management group within the RHM initiative is presented. Based on the analysis of characteristics of and demands on sustainability indicators, existing indicator sets for Santiago de Chile are analysed. Thereafter, the indicator set for sustainable land use management in Santiago de Chile is presented. It was elaborated in a combined bottom–up and top–down approach in discussion with Chilean scientists and stakeholders in order to guarantee its relevancy to practice. The analysis of the already existing indicators in Santiago de Chile shows that the newly developed toolset forms a valuable and complementary addition, mainly for two reasons: the interdisciplinary nature of the set and its reproducibility.";"Weiland, Ulrike

The decision behavior and rules of government agent, enterprise agent and resident agent in construction land growth were explored. A distinctive and dynamic simulation model of construction land growth was built, which integrated multi-agent, GIS technology and RS data and described the interaction among influencing agents. Taking Fuyang City in the Changjiang River Delta as an example, an assessment process for the remote sensing data in construction land and scenario planning was constructed. Repast and ArcGIS were used as simulation platforms. A simulation of the spatial pattern in land-use planning and the setting of scenario planning were conducted by using the incomplete active game, which was based on different natural, social and economic levels. Through this model, a simulation of urban planning space and decision-making for Fuyang City was created. Relevant non-structured problems arising from urban planning management could be identified, and the process and logic of urban planning spatial decision-making could thus be improved. Cel1-by-cel1 comparison showed that the simulation accuracy was over 72%. This model has great potential for use by government and town planners in decision support and technique support in the policy-making process.";"Zhang, Jing

"AGRIS:US201400028472";"influence of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of a rare bird species that commonly faces environmental fluctuations";"";"Habitat loss and fragmentation is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. Rare species are generally thought to be more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than common ones as small populations become even smaller. We did a population genetic study on a rare bird, the Worthen's sparrow Spizella wortheni which is endemic to semi‐arid and arid regions of northeast Mexico. Its population numbers suffer greatly from the transformation of grassland into farmland that leads to a patchy distribution with locally small population sizes. Our data show that its genetic diversity is nevertheless high, few to no differentiation between study localities was found, and gene flow was high. Although we can not exclude that is too early to see an impact on the genetic level, we think that these results might be explained by the species’ biology: like many other birds living in arid areas, the Worthen's sparrow has a nomadic life style; depending on local conditions individuals flexibly move between areas. This behavior could enhance their ability to find suitable habitat patches in a fragmented landscape. Our results imply that nomadic behavior, which is an adaptation to high temporal variability in environmental conditions, may make species more resilient to spatial variability caused by habitat fragmentation. This insight contributes to identifying common factors such as nomadism that predict a species’ sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.";"Canales‐Delgadillo, Julio Cesar

"AGRIS:US201600101875";"Weed-insect pollinator networks as bio-indicators of ecological sustainability in agriculture. A review";"";"The intensification of agricultural practices contributes to the decline of many taxa such as insects and wild plants. Weeds are serious competitors for crop production and are thus controlled. Nonetheless, weeds enhance floral diversity in agricultural landscapes. Weeds provide food for insects in exchange for pollination. The stability of mutualistic interactions in pollination networks depends on conservation of insect pollinator and weed communities. Some agricultural practices can destabilize interactions and thus modify the stability of pollination networks. Therefore, more knowledge on weed-insect networks is needed. Here, we review the interactions involved in insect visits to weed flowers in temperate arable lands. Our main findings are that (1) weed pollination by insects has a key role in maintaining weed communities in arable lands; (2) weed-insect pollinator interactions are modulated by the flowers’ features and their quality which are attracting insects; (3) most weeds are associated with generalist insect pollinators; and (4) even if weed-pollinator networks are largely mutualistic, some antagonist networks can be observed when deception occurs. We propose three weed-insect pollinator networks as potential bio-indicators to evaluate the ecological sustainability of arable land management strategies in temperate areas: (1) Geometridae and Bombyliidae species visiting Caryophyllaceae, (2) Papilionidae foraging on Apiaceae, and (3) Syrphidae visiting Asteraceae.";"Rollin, Orianne

Modeling this phenomenon can help in evaluating the impact of current or future agricultural practices on nitrate content within an aquifer. The three-dimensional Water flow and Nitrate transport Global Model (WNGM), that was previously developed and applied to a well-capture zone, is actually used to simulate future land management scenarios over the same zone. The studied area is located in a region with intensive agricultural practice in Southern Québec (Canada). The sandy unconfined aquifer underlying the agricultural fields is highly vulnerable to nitrate contamination from ground surface and nitrate concentrations around critical threshold of 45mg[formula removed]/L were observed in the municipal well. Using the calibrated WNGM, a number of land management scenarios were simulated in order to predict future trends of nitrate concentrations in the pumping well from 2008 through 2040 that could be induced by changes in land management practices over this well-capture zone. More specifically, these scenarios simulate implementation of improved or ideal agricultural practices within the agricultural portion of the well-capture zone, and modification of the pumping rate at the municipal well. The results show how a decrease and stabilization of nitrate concentration should occur at the municipal well after a period varying from 5 to 30years depending on the implemented agricultural modifications. It is also shown that, in this particular case, an increase of the pumping rate at the municipal well from 700 to 2800m³/d would lead to an increase of the well-capture zone from 0.8 to 2.5km² and to a decrease of nitrate concentrations at the municipal well from 43 to 34mg[formula removed]/L. Furthermore, it is predicted that application of improved agricultural practices in the vicinity of this municipal well could lead to a reduction of nitrate concentrations at the well of about 8mg[formula removed]/L.";"Bonton, Alexandre

Consequently, provider states can claim compensation from users of their national PGRs, leading to the need for bilateral or multilateral agreements to share national PGRs' commercial benefits. However, as benefit-sharing agreements are made exante, estimating the potential profit is difficult. Thus, issues around asymmetric information about the commercial value of such resources have emerged. In this paper, we use a patent portfolio as a proxy to estimate the potential commercial benefits of national PGRs and propose new evaluation indicators. We propose a comprehensive evaluation process that covers constructing a patent portfolio for each PGR, establishing indicators in terms of marketability, technology, and exclusiveness, and assigning weights to the indicators using fuzzy analytic hierarchy. In addition, we illustrate this process using a case of Korean national PGRs based on the opinions of stakeholders and experts. This research is expected to help promote national PGR transactions with equitable access and benefit sharing agreements.";"Lee, Bo Kyeong

"AGRIS:US201600196412";"Migration motivation of agriculturally educated rural youth: The case of Russian Siberia";"";"The migration of young people from rural areas is common in all agricultural regions of Russia, and Altai Krai, located in southwestern Siberia, is no exception. Out-migration, aversion to working in agriculture and the aging of farmers and farm managers are serious problems that raise questions about who will work in agriculture in the future. This paper aims to investigate factors that affect the decisions of agricultural students from Altai Krai to out-migrate or to return to their rural parental municipalities after finishing their university studies. We conducted a questionnaire survey of students at the Altai State Agrarian University in Barnaul and analyzed their migration intentions using a logit regression model. Migration motivation is studied in relation to personal and family background characteristics, employment expectations and quality of life, with a particular focus on references to agriculture. Our results show that the probability of leaving the parental municipality decreases if i) the respondent's parents support the study of agriculture, ii) the respondent's family owns agricultural land, iii) the respondent intends to work in agriculture, and iv) the respondent believes that it is not difficult to establish one's own business in the parental municipality. Women are more likely than men to leave their rural parental municipalities, and the probability of out-migration increases as respondents' life satisfaction increases. Our findings indicate that agricultural roots in the respondent's family stimulate young university graduates to return home and continue in the family tradition. Some of the factors that push young people, especially women, to out-migrate to cities (such as territorial isolation or the social roles of rural women) may be changed only over a long-term period. The recovery or enhancement of relationships between agricultural schools and agricultural enterprises, access to credits for business establishment and the purchase of agricultural land, and better living conditions in rural municipalities could encourage agriculturally educated youth to remain in rural areas and work in agriculture.";"BednaÅÃ­kovÃ¡, Zuzana

How has land cover changed from 1950–2011 along two grassland/forest ecotones in Hawaii with repeated fires? LOCATION: Non‐native forest with invasive grass understory and invasive grassland (Megathyrsus maximus) ecosystems on Oahu, Hawaii, USA. METHODS: We quantified fuel load and moisture in non‐native forest and grassland (Megathyrsus maximus) plots (n = 6) at Makua Military Reservation and Schofield Barracks, and used these field data to model potential fire behaviour using the BehavePlus fire modelling program. Actual rate and extent of land‐cover change were quantified for both areas from 1950–2011 with historical aerial imagery. RESULTS: Live and dead fuel moisture content and fine fuel loads did not differ between forests and grasslands. However, mean surface fuel height was 31% lower in forests (72 cm) than grasslands (105 cm; P < 0.02), which drove large differences in predicted fire behaviour. Rates of fire spread were 3–5 times higher in grasslands (5.0–36.3 m·min⁻¹) than forests (0–10.5 m·min⁻¹; P < 0.001), and flame lengths were 2–3 times higher in grasslands (2.8–10.0 m) than forests (0–4.3 m; P < 0.01). Between 1950 and 2011, invasive grassland cover increased at both Makua (320 ha) and Schofield (745 ha) at rates of 2.62 and 1.83 ha·yr⁻¹, respectively, with more rapid rates of conversion before active fire management practices were implemented in the early 1990s. CONCLUSIONS: These results support accepted paradigms for the tropics, and demonstrate that type conversion associated with non‐native grass invasion and subsequent fire has occurred on landscape scales in Hawaii. Once forests are converted to grassland there is a significant increase in fire intensity, which likely provides the positive feedback to continued grassland dominance in the absence of active fire management.";"Ellsworth, Lisa M.

Both visual and statistical comparison of TRMM-based rainfall with the gauged rainfall indicates that the monthly rainfall data are statistically comparable. Seasonal upward adjustment of the monthly TRMM-based rainfall improved the rainfall correlation giving a Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency of the simulated runoff of 89.5%. Thus, monthly TRMM-based rainfall estimate can be used to augment existing ground-measured rainfall data and together with Landsat-derived land-cover maps be used to estimate runoff for unguaged basins in the West African sub-region.

Two hundred, generally small (most commonly around 0.5 ha), plantations dominated by whitewood have been planted across the eastern side of the island. These plantations range up to 20 years in age and provide a guide to the expected growth rates of whitewood in plantation in those areas. Site and growth data collected from a range of those plots were used to determine the characteristics associated with the most productive plantations. This association of site variables with growth was correlated with pre-existing resource mapping to estimate the area and locations of land suitable (in terms of sustainable productivity) for whitewood plantation on the island. Some of the characteristics used in that estimation included soil depth, drainage, soil erodibility, slope and existing land use. Using this method it was estimated that around 33 000 ha of land on Espiritu Santo, currently not used or native forest, is highly suitable for whitewood development.";"Grant, J.C.

Brussels and the national governments stimulate farmers to integrate primary production with non-agricultural practices from which they can also benefit. In favour of this development different stakeholders are encouraged to collaborate to produce the so-called farmer-managed public goods. This paper explores critical success factors for the production and maintenance of these public goods. In two Dutch case study regions we show a chronology of major events from 1975 leading to a shift from primary agricultural production towards a successful multifunctional land use. We evaluated which critical success factors crucial for managing public goods manifest themselves in our case study regions. Besides six critical success factors described in literature (Property rights, Asymmetric information, Administrative complexity, Governance, Time lags and Market structure) four other factors appear to be crucial in governing farmer-managed public goods: (1) establishing a system of rewards; (2) a mix of governance forms; (3) visionary leadership with networks in both the public and the private sectors and (4) time for new ideas to mature and to build commitment among the actors.";"(Greet) Blom-Zandstra, Margaretha

Changes of land use/cover were measured through aerial photographs interpretations, while local perceptions and description of change were addressed through household interviews and field observations. The results of this study show that there have been variations over the years in terms of both the areas and spatial distribution of cultivated fields. The total land cultivated increased from 31% in the late 1970s to 35% in early 1990s, mainly because of agricultural expansion to sandy watercourses and former grazing areas. Water courses shrank by 55% between late 1970s and early 1990s providing new areas for cultivation. Over the last 45 years, the open and wooded grasslands, and tree-cover types covered about 40% of the total land area, ranging from 29% in 1960 to 43-45% between late 1970s and early 1990s. Spatial and temporal distribution of the cultivated fields and other vegetation cover types were influenced by differences in the scale of land degradation, and the soil-conservation initiatives that have been implemented.

The study first recounts people's perception of environmental change — what are the issues of greatest concern identified by local communities? Second, it explores people's responses to identified environmental problems and in particular the role of forests in these processes. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of changing land management practices, and how their implementation may affect the future adaptation strategies of such communities. Results suggest that people's current and potential responses and adaptation to environmental change are influenced by the availability and access to forests and forest resources, and the degree to which their livelihood strategies have diversified away from forest dependence. Thus we conclude that forest policies such as REDD+ will need to be responsive to diverse forest-based adaptation needs, rather than assuming a ‘one size fits all’ relationship between forest conservation and adaptation to climate change.";"Gross-Camp, N.D.

Os mecanismos de desapropriação e aquisição ali ainda são possíveis por serem mais baratas as terras do Nordeste, levando em conta a escassez de recursos e a necessidade de maximizar a eficácia governamental. Devido à expressiva presença negra, também essa escolha estabelece a transversalidade com a questão étnica.  A reforma agrária poderia, assim, torna-se uma política expressiva no Brasil, beneficiando segmentos sociais em maior escala e com resultados efetivos na redução da pobreza rural.------------------------------------The land reform issue is examined by three angles: the state action, the existing demand and the academic debate. From the analysis of different perspectives, indicates as a possible answer to the title of the text, which are concentrated human resources, financial and logistics in a region covering the northern half of Minas Gerais and that extends to Maranhao. The expropriation mechanisms and acquisition are still possible because the land are cheaper in the Northeast, taking into account the scarcity of resources and the need to maximize the governmental effectiveness. Because of the expressive presence of black people, this choice also establish a connection with the ethnic issue. Land reform could thus becomes an expressive policy in Brazil, benefiting social segments on a larger scale and with effective results in the reduction of rural poverty.";"Valente, Ana Lucia Eduardo Farah";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-07-31";"pt";"land reform;agrarian reform";"";"";"BRA";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016219571";"http://purl.umn.edu/108929";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201600003896";"Vegetation Responses to Pinyon–Juniper Treatments in Eastern Nevada";"";"Comparisons of tree-removal treatments to reduce the cover of single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla Torr. and Frém.) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma [Torr.] Little), and subsequently increase native herbaceous cover in black sagebrush (Artemisia nova A. Nelson), are needed to identify most cost-effective methods. Two adjacent vegetation management experiments were initiated in 2006 and monitored until 2010 in eastern Nevada to compare the costs and efficacy of various tree reduction methods. One Department of Energy (DOE) experiment compared a control to five treatments: bulldozing imitating chaining ($205 · ha⁻¹), lop-pile-burn ($2 309 · ha⁻¹), lop-and-scatter ($1 297 · ha⁻¹), feller-buncher and chipper ($4 940 · ha⁻¹), and mastication ($1 136 · ha⁻¹), whereas a second Bureau of Land Management (BLM) experiment compared one-way chaining ($205 · ha⁻¹) to a control treatment. Chaining and bulldozing resulted in the least reduction of tree cover among the treatments. In the DOE experiment, forb cover only decreased in the mastication treatment. Litter increased in all methods. Slash cover was lowest in the control and lop-pile-burn treatments, intermediate in the feller-buncher and mastication treatments, and highest in the bulldozing and lop-and-scatter treatments. By 2010, forb cover and the combined cover of dead shrubs and trees were increased and decreased, respectively, by chaining in the BLM experiment. Nonnative annual grass and biotic crust were absent or uncommon before and after treatment implementation. In both experiments, tree removal resulted in a nonsignificant increase in perennial grass cover even 4 yr post-treatment. An ecological return-on-investment (EROI) metric was developed to compare perennial grass cover and tree cover per unit area cost of each active treatment. By 2010, chaining or bulldozing, followed by mastication, showed the highest EROI for improving perennial grass and decreasing tree cover. Mastication is recommended for restoration of smaller tree-encroached areas, whereas land managers should reconsider smooth chaining, despite its negative perceptions, for rapid and cost-efficient restoration of large landscapes obligates.";"Provencher, Louis

"AGRIS:US201600197236";"Bayesian belief networks to analyse trade-offs among ecosystem services at the regional scale";"";"Knowledge on trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services is crucial for the design of land use strategies that optimize ecosystem service delivery. Correlation coefficients, obtained through pairwise comparison of ecosystem service provision maps, have been put forward as suitable indicators to quantify these interactions. However, for more in depth analyses of trade-offs and synergies where driving forces of interactions need to be determined, more sophisticated methods are needed. Although Bayesian belief networks have been frequently mentioned as promising tools to investigate interactions among ecosystem services, up till now, no structured approaches to do so have been suggested. This paper presents a way to analyse trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services together with their driving forces. Joint probability distributions of ecosystem service pairs, which can be calculated by using Bayesian belief network models, are used to quantify interactions. The paper demonstrates the approach by quantifying trade-offs and synergies among several ecosystem services in Flanders, Belgium. Our analysis identifies two bundles of ecosystem services which react synergistically. Wood production and several regulating services on the one hand and food production and soil formation on the other hand. Trade-offs are identified among food production and most of the other services that were included into the analysis. In addition to these general findings, the analysis shows that the identified interactions may change depending on the considered environmental conditions, specified through soil type, land cover and land use.";"Landuyt, Dries

"AGRIS:US201500220984";"Landscape level patterns of grasshopper communities in Inner Mongolia: interactive effects of livestock grazing and a precipitation gradient";"";"CONTEXT: Grasshoppers are a dominant herbivore assemblage globally and play an important role for ecosystem nutrient cycling. Yet, we lack a strong understanding of the relationship between grasshopper diversity and plant community composition at the landscape scale. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to test landscape scale relationships between plant and grasshopper communities. METHODS: We used a large-scale, replicated experiment at four sites, including grazed and protected pastures across a 350 km transect and 200–400 mm precipitation gradient in the steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed the relationships between plant and grasshopper parameters with ANOVAs and CCA. RESULTS: We collected 17 grasshopper species and 15,000+ individuals. The desert steppe (lowest precipitation) had the lowest grasshopper richness and diversity, but abundance was not different from the other sites. In two dry sites (desert steppe and Stipa steppe), livestock grazing decreased grasshopper diversity and increased abundance of the main pest species. In contrast, at the highest precipitation site (meadow steppe), grasshopper communities did not differ between grazing levels. Across all sites and grazing intensities, grasshopper abundance tended to be lowest and diversity highest in plant communities with intermediate levels of biomass and plant species richness. CONCLUSION: These results support the concept that appropriate land use management practices would be beneficial for increasing biodiversity, promoting grassland sustainability, and reducing outbreaks of the dominant pest grasshopper in Inner Mongolia. Our study suggests that different management approaches are necessary depending on the average annual precipitation and that the driest sites are most vulnerable to disturbance.";"Hao, Shuguang

"AGRIS:US201500220980";"Historical landscape dynamics of Inner Mongolia: patterns, drivers, and impacts";"";"CONTEXT: Understanding the causes and consequences of land use and land cover change in drylands is crucial for global sustainability. Inner Mongolia consists of arid and semiarid ecosystems of global importance. OBJECTIVES: Our main goal was twofold: to review the patterns and drivers of land use and land cover change in Inner Mongolia, and to discuss ecological impacts and strategies for promoting landscape and regional sustainability. METHODS: We took an interdisciplinary and retrospective approach, based on historical records and remote sensing data. RESULTS: Inner Mongolia has evolved from an ocean to a forested region and then to a dryland area in the past millions of years. As a cradle of Chinese civilization, Inner Mongolia has experienced a series of land transitions from localized primitive agriculture that occurred in prehistoric times to broad-scale nomadic pastoralism that lasted for a few 1000 years, and to sedentary pastoralism with increasing agriculture and urbanization since the 1960s. The general land use pattern has long been shaped by the interactions between nomadic pastoralism and agrarian culture. The major drivers of land use and land cover change include: climate, demography, socioeconomic structures, institutional changes, and technological innovations. CONCLUSIONS: The landscapes of Inner Mongolia have evolved historically through several phases, and the profound and unsustainable landscape transformations during the past 50 years have been driven primarily by land use policies. Strategies based on landscape sustainability science are needed to curb ecosystem degradation and promote sustainability in the region.";"Wu, Jianguo

"AGRIS:US201500107477";"Grazing impacts on the susceptibility of rangelands to wind erosion: The effects of stocking rate, stocking strategy and land condition";"";"An estimated 110 Mt of dust is eroded by wind from the Australian land surface each year, most of which originates from the arid and semi-arid rangelands. Livestock production is thought to increase the susceptibility of the rangelands to wind erosion by reducing vegetation cover and modifying surface soil stability. However, research is yet to quantify the impacts of grazing land management on the erodibility of the Australian rangelands, or determine how these impacts vary among land types and over time. We present a simulation analysis that links a pasture growth and animal production model (GRASP) to the Australian Land Erodibility Model (AUSLEM) to evaluate the impacts of stocking rate, stocking strategy and land condition on the erodibility of four land types in western Queensland, Australia. Our results show that declining land condition, over stocking, and using inflexible stocking strategies have potential to increase land erodibility and amplify accelerated soil erosion. However, land erodibility responses to grazing are complex and influenced by land type sensitivities to different grazing strategies and local climate characteristics. Our simulations show that land types which are more resilient to livestock grazing tend to be least susceptible to accelerated wind erosion. Increases in land erodibility are found to occur most often during climatic transitions when vegetation cover is most sensitive to grazing pressure. However, grazing effects are limited during extreme wet and dry periods when the influence of climate on vegetation cover is strongest. Our research provides the opportunity to estimate the effects of different land management practices across a range of land types, and provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of accelerated erosion resulting from pastoral activities. The approach could help further assessment of land erodibility at a broader scale notably if combined with wind erosion models.";"Aubault, Hélène

Given available land resources for growing energy crops on the island of Maui, four land resource scenarios were considered. If available land resources were used in the production of sugarcane and energy crops with added utilization of non-prime lands, Hawaii's ethanol goal for year 2020 could be achieved while maintaining two-thirds of Hawaii's current sugar production.

The expectations of the farmers regarding the management of water in the fens are confronted with those of other users (cereal growers, hunters, environmentalists), that are described. If the summer management of the water is no source of conflicts as regards the production of forage, it nevertheless requires to engage some process of concentration among the various users.

"AGRIS:US201600007807";"Internal Validation of Predictive Logistic Regression Models for Decision-Making in Wildlife Management";"";"Predictive logistic regression models are commonly used to make informed decisions related to wildlife management and conservation, such as predicting favourable wildlife habitat for land conservation objectives and predicting vital rates for use in population models. Frequently, models are developed for use in the same population from which sample data were obtained, and thus, they are intended for internal use within the same population. Before predictions from logistic regression models are used to make management decisions, predictive ability should be validated. We describe a process for conducting an internal model validation, and we illustrate the process of internal validation using logistic regression models for predicting the number of successfully breeding wolf packs in six areas in the US northern Rocky Mountains. We start by defining the major components of accuracy for binary predictions as calibration and discrimination, and we describe methods for quantifying the calibration and discrimination abilities of a logistic regression model. We also describe methods for correcting problems of calibration and future predictive accuracy in a logistic regression model. We then show how bootstrap simulations can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of prediction accuracy when models are calibrated and evaluated within the same population from which they were developed. We also show how bootstrapping can be used to assess coverage rates and recalibrate the endpoints of confidence intervals for predictions from a logistic regression model, to achieve nominal coverage rates. Using the data on successfully breeding wolf packs in the northern Rocky Mountains, we validate that predictions from a model developed with data specific to each of six analysis areas are better calibrated to each population than a global model developed using all data simultaneously. We then use shrinkage of model coefficients to improve calibration and future predictive accuracy for the area-specific model, and recalibrate confidence interval endpoints to provide better coverage properties. Following this validation, managers can be confident that logistic regression predictions will be reliable in this situation, and thus that management decisions will be based on accurate predictions.";"Gude, Justin A.

A historical analysis";"";"During the past century, humans converted extensive areas of tropical forest into cultivated lands. Three distinct processes, each predominant during a different historical period, have driven the destruction of the forests. This review describes each of these deforestation dynamics: natural resource degrading poverty traps that predominated during the colonial era, new land settlement schemes that prevailed for two decades after decolonization, and finally, financialized, large enterprise dynamics that have predominated during the past quarter century. Each dynamic has, over time, given rise to different opportunities for conservation. Peasants emigrated from the sites of the poverty traps, and regrowth began to cover these degraded landscapes. Smallholders in the new land settlement areas became better acquainted with tropical tree species and allowed some trees to recolonize their fields, creating silvopastoral and agroforested landscapes. The heads of large enterprises relied on credit to clear land, so government regulators found that they could curb corporate-led deforestation by restricting access to credit when landowners failed to comply with laws against forest clearing. These links between deforestation's dynamics during past eras and conservation policies during the present era illustrate how a historical understanding of tropical deforestation can provide the basis for effective conservation policies.";"RUDEL, THOMAS K.";"";"Cambridge University Press";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"deforestation;poverty;landowners";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600186097";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892914000228";"";"";"";"108-118"

Where habitat alteration is implicated, there is a need for spatially explicit conservation plans. Models built with geographic information systems (GIS) are frequently used to inform such planning. We explored the potential for using GIS models of functional landscape connectivity as a reliable proxy for genetically derived measures of population isolation. We used genetic assignment tests to characterize isolation of marbled salamander populations and evaluated whether the relative amount of modified habitat around breeding ponds was a reliable indicator of population isolation. Using a resampling analysis, we determined whether certain land-cover variables consistently described population isolation. We randomly drew half the data for model building and tested the performance of the best models on the other half 100 times. Deciduous forest was consistently associated with lower levels of population isolation, whereas salamander populations in regions of agriculture and anthropogenic development were more isolated. Models that included these variables and pond size explained 65-70% of variation in genetically inferred isolation across sites. The resampling analysis confirmed that these habitat variables were consistently good predictors of isolation. Used judiciously, simple GIS models with key land-cover variables can be used to estimate population isolation if field sampling and genetic analysis are not possible.";"GREENWALD, KATHERINE R.

"AGRIS:US2016214789";"THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GAMBIAN RANGELAND AND WATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT: LESSONS FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA";"";"This article examines the conception, design, implementation and monitoring of The Gambianrangeland and water development project based in Niamina Dankunku and Niamina Westdistricts of the country. It attempts to make a management evaluation of the project, gaining aninsight into the nature of the development problem and the approach adopted by the project forits solution. It then seeks to examine the lessons that southern African countries could learnfrom this experience in the light of similarities in socio-economic circumstances. The conceptionof the project was sound in so far as it attempted to tackle the problem of environmentaldegradation by a system of controlled management of scarce range resources. However, thequestion of increasing cattle off-take which could have also reduced grazing pressure on rangeresources was not addressed. The project's initial focus on the relatively well off category ofcattle owners was corrected by incorporating a food-aid component to address project's concernfor the poorer segment of the society. While it was a good idea, the use of food-aid took away theexpected financial contribution of the local community to project management and financed asignificant part of project activities.

"AGRIS:US2016207156";"Implications of Bulk Water Transfer on Local Water Management Institutions: A Case Study of the Melamchi Water Supply Project in Nepal";"";"To mitigate a drinking water crisis in Kathmandu valley, the Government of Nepalinitiated the Melamchi Water Supply Project in 1997, which will divert water fromthe Melamchi River to Kathmandu city’s water supply network. In the first phase,the Project will divert 170,000 cubic meters of water per day (at the rate of1.97M3/sec), which will be tripled using the same infrastructure as city waterdemand increases in the future. The large scale transfer of water would have far-reachingimplications in both water supplying and receiving basins. This paperanalyzes some of the major changes related to local water management and socioeconomicsbrought about by the Project and in particular the changes in the localwater management institutions in the Melamchi basin. Our study shows thattraditional informal water management institutions were effective in regulatingpresent water use practices in the water supplying basin, but the situation willvastly change because of the scale of water transfer, and power inequity betweenthe organized public sector on one side and dispersed and unorganized marginalwater users on the other. The small scale of water usage and multiple informalarrangements at the local level have made it difficult for the local users andinstitutions to collectively bargain and negotiate with the central water transferauthority for a fair share of project benefits and compensation for the lossesimposed on them. The process and scale of project compensation for economiclosses and equity over resource use are at the heart of the concerns and debatesabout the Melamchi water transfer decision. The Project has planned for a one-timecompensation package of about US$18 million for development infrastructurerelated investments and is planning to share about one percent of revenuegenerated from water use in the city with the supplying basin. The main issues hereare what forms of water sharing governance, compensation packages, and waterrights structures would emerge in relation to the project implementation andwhether they are socially acceptable ensuring equitable distribution of the projectbenefits to all basin communities. In addition, these issues of the Melamchi projectdiscussed in this paper are equally pertinent to other places where rural to urbanwater transfer projects are under discussion.";"Pant, Dhruba

"AGRIS:US201400175804";"Effects of land management on CO₂ flux and soil C stock in two Tanzanian croplands with contrasting soil texture";"";"Evaluation of carbon dynamics is of great concern worldwide in terms of climate change and soil fertility. However, the annual CO₂ flux and the effect of land management on the carbon budget are poorly understood in Sub-Saharan Africa, owing to the relative dearth of data for in situ CO₂ fluxes. Here, we evaluated seasonal variations in CO₂ efflux rate with hourly climate data in two dry tropical croplands in Tanzania at two sites with contrasting soil textures, viz. clayey or sandy, over four consecutive crop-cultivation periods of 40 months. We then: (1) estimated the annual CO₂ flux, and (2) evaluated the effect of land management (control plot, plant residue treatment plot, fertilizer treatment plot, and plant residue and fertilizer treatment plot) on the CO₂ flux and soil carbon stock at both sites. Estimated annual CO₂ fluxes were 1.0–2.2 and 0.9–1.9 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for the clayey and sandy sites, respectively. At the end of the experiment, crop cultivation had decreased the surface soil carbon stocks by 2.4 and 3.0 Mg C ha⁻¹ (soil depth 0–15 cm) at the clayey and sandy sites, respectively. On the other hand, plant residue application (7.5 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) significantly increased the surface soil carbon stocks, i.e., 3.5–3.8 and 1.7–2.1 Mg C ha⁻¹ (soil depth 0–15 cm) at the clayey and sandy sites, respectively, while it also increased the annual CO₂ fluxes substantially, i.e., 2.5–4.0 and 2.4–3.4 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for the clayey and sandy soils, respectively. Our results indicate that these dry tropical croplands at least may act as a carbon sink, though the efficiency of carbon accumulation was substantially lower in sandy soil (6.8–8.4%) compared to clayey soil (14.0–15.2%), possibly owing to higher carbon loss by leaching and macro-faunal activity.";"Sugihara, Soh

Industrial development appears both to precede and occur concurrently with residential development, while commercial development follows other types. Although residences appear to locate away from industrial land, zoning decisions favoring industry may attract rather than deter residential development within a jurisdiction. Regions with higher infrastructure taxes experience development later. Because school taxes fund local public goods important to homeowners, they have little influence on residential timing, but strong influences on industrial and commercial timing.";"Hite, Diane

We analyzed the land-cover changes between 2000 and 2006 inside 25,703 Natura 2000 sites in 24 EU Member States, and compared them with those observed outside the PAs. At the EU level, ‘Artificial surfaces’ and ‘Agricultural areas’ exhibit lower rates of transformation within PAs than outside. ‘Forests and semi-natural areas’ marginally increased inside PAs, while they marginally decreased outside. In States that joined the EU before 2000, landscape transformation rates were low, and inside PAs ‘Forest’ preservation was accompanied with a shift from intensive agricultural practices ‘Permanent arable land’ to more diverse ‘Agricultural mosaics’. In new Member States (most of them located in Eastern Europe), there was agricultural abandonment, with conversion to ‘Artificial surfaces’ or ‘Natural vegetation’, both within and outside PAs. Broad scale EU policies (like the Common Agricultural Policy) and socio-economic drivers (like the transition from planned to market economy) seem to be dominant factors in explaining land-cover transformations, while conservation policies may moderate these trends inside PAs.";"Kallimanis, Athanasios S.

Clearly, since 1990, the introduction of Farm Business Tenancies means that the two sets of results, while not directly comparable, allows the occupancy of land under unconventional forms of tenancy to be explored and contrasted. Furthermore, many factors influence the occupancy of land including taxation, inheritance laws, the profitability of farming, and structural and policy changes within the industry. Therefore, the occupancy of agricultural land in 2007 should be set against this backcloth of socio-political changes that impact upon the industry. Finally, this report is split into two sections, the first focuses on the occupation of land in England and Wales using weighted sample data, while the second explores some of the dynamics behind land tenure using the unweighted sample data.";"Butler, Allan J.

"AGRIS:US201600105419";"Assessing gender roles in a changing landscape: diversified agro-pastoralism in drylands of West Pokot, Kenya";"";"Previous studies in drylands have shown that while gender roles are becoming more flexible, privatization and formalization of land tenure tends to marginalize women in drylands while environmental degradation leads to differential changes in gender workload. Chepareria, a ward in West Pokot County, has undergone the above-mentioned tenure and environmental changes and is nowadays dominated by private enclosures as a land management approach. This study reviewed in which ways these rangeland enclosures have influenced gender roles in the dryland systems of Chepareria in West Pokot, with specific regard to division of labour, financial responsibilities and decision-making processes on the household level, and also tries to identify the underlying driving forces that have contributed to the observed changes.Our results indicate that the workload of women has increased under new land fragmentation processes in rangelands due to increased responsibilities in cattle herding and income generation, but also that due to this, women have gained higher influence in household decisions concerning the family economy. It was found that women to a larger extent than before are engaged in small-scale business such as the selling of farm products and poultry keeping, hence getting financial resources under their own control. In this way, women are involved in decision-making processes and income generation to a higher extent than before, though they are still excluded from certain traditionally male-dominated spheres both within and beyond the household, such as the sale of cattle and the handling of larger amounts of financial resources.Under the new land fragmentation processes in Chepareria, women are increasingly seen as crucial income earners and they are enjoying a higher degree of financial independence, more decision-making power and a louder voice than before in household and public matters.";"Karmebäck, Vera N.

"AGRIS:US201600191015";"Panglima Laot of Aceh: a case study in large-scale community-based marine management after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami";"";"Despite dating back over 400 years the relevance of traditional fisheries management in Aceh, Indonesia, still remains high. Aceh was, however, greatly affected by the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that claimed an estimated 167,000 lives, including 14,000 fishermen and 59 of the 193 traditional marine leaders (Panglima Laot). This tragic loss of life was accompanied by a substantial loss of local knowledge, such as the locations of hazardous fishing grounds. In this study we describe an innovative project that sought to rebuild a post-tsunami fisheries sector by re-engaging and empowering the Panglima Laot. During AprilâJune 2008 GPS (global positioning system) sounding devices were installed on 53 local fishing boats and hazardous fishing areas mapped based on local knowledge, and shared amongst fishermen. During JulyâDecember 2008 nearly five million GPS data points were collected, from which detailed bathymetric maps were produced and shared between fishermen and Aceh government officials. Significant project outputs included a map of fishing areas over 20,000Â kmÂ², which included three new seamounts, one of which expanded Aceh's provincial boundary by >Â 1.3 million ha, and a Panglima Laot decree that reduced fishing in hazardous areas of high coral density by 23.3%. Our findings have wide applicability. Locally, the introduction of GPS technology and sharing of traditional knowledge resulted in fishermen developing and implementing their own management strategies and demonstrating their ability to stay out of restricted areas. Provincially, this project provided a framework through which government agencies and academic institutions could effectively engage with local customary leaders and their fishing communities.";"Wilson, Crispen

"AGRIS:US201301598509";"Forest property rights in the frame of public policies and societal change";"";"Property rights over natural resources became a distinct area of inquiry in environmental economics and policy in the last decades, but their role has not yet been investigated thoroughly. Transition countries represent an excellent material of analysis of various policies and institutional developments concerning the regime of use and management of natural resources. The processes of societal transformation had deep impacts on the forestry sector, entailing land reforms and subsequent changes to its institutional and organisational framework. This paper presents an analysis of the reciprocal relationship between the evolving forest property rights and the conduct of policy and economic actors, in connection with their outcomes. The theoretical framework consists of institutional economics, whose core concept is that patterns of interaction between institutions and actors produce physical outcomes, assessable by criteria such as equity and efficiency. The study concentrated on three distinct periods and the applicable property regimes. Within this framework, the impacts of the characteristics of property regimes and the general framework of socio-economic conditions on the exercise of property rights were analysed. The analysis of the conduct of forest owners in relation to the institutional design was completed by the analysis of the other actors influential for land reforms. Romanian forestry sector, in evolution from the period shortly before World War II to present, represents the case of the study. Research data were collected by interviewing/questioning, participant observation and literature review. They were analysed through an integrated method of content analysis and a matrix analysis. An important conclusion is that not only the regime of forest property is determinant for the outcomes of resource use and management, but also the general settings in which they are embedded. Another essential point is that land reforms driven by either efficiency or equity rationales are not mere diversions of the benefit stream, but complex processes with serious implications for the status of the resource at stake.";"Irimie, Doru Leonard

One area of high conservation value because of its importance for connecting the GYE to wilderness areas of central Idaho is the Centennial Mountains and surrounding valleys (2500 kmÂ²) along the IdahoâMontana border just west of Yellowstone National Park. The current expansion of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and other large carnivore populations outside protected areas of Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park has placed a greater emphasis on potential linkage zones in the northern Rockies. Here we use black bears (Ursus americanus) as a test case to demonstrate the utility of using detection dogs and DNA analysis coupled with resource selection probability function (RSPF) models to examine habitat suitability for large carnivores in critical linkage zones. Detection dogs specifically trained to locate the scat of black bears and grizzly bears were used to sample the study area. Here we report the RSPF results for black bears and discuss the utility of detection dogs for sampling species of carnivores to undertake similar analyses. Utilizing location data from genetic analysis of 616 fecal samples for black bears, we developed a RSPF model to examine use of the landscape with respect to habitat parameters, public land management, private lands, and human activities. The most parsimonious model determining probability of use for black bears included parameters for elevation, coniferous forest, land stewardship, road density, distance to roads, and an interaction between human population density and road density at the scale of 500 m. The model identified specific core-habitat areas in the region that potentially are crucial for the Yellowstone population of grizzly bears as it expands into areas west of Yellowstone National Park. Here we demonstrate that detection dogs are a useful method for sampling large carnivores and, when coupled with genetics and RSPF models, offer an effective approach to addressing questions of habitat suitability in areas of high conservation importance.";"Beckmann, Jon P.

The introduction recalls common aspects and specific conceptualisations of property analysis in the field of economics, sociology and social anthropology and summarises main academic discourses about property rights in order to develop a differentiated understanding of property. In Section 1, general trends in property relations characterising modern rural societies are outlined. It is argued that economic and social changes in rural areas have brought about a process of revalorisation of rural property objects. Property rights can be a useful analytical concept to scrutinise and understand the transformation processes in rural areas and, moreover, a concept that has meaning in everyday talk. More important than accounting new property objects is the notion that revalorisation is connected with shifts in the balance of rights and obligations, of benefits and costs, and with qualitative changes of internal and outward social relations of rural societies.";"Laschewski, Lutz

Since NIPF landowners are so diverse, there is a need to better understand the determinants of their decisions so that policies could be in place to motivate them. A survey was carried out in 2005 to the nonindustrial private forest landowners of West Virginia to examine the factors affecting their forest management decisions. The study looked at four categories of decisions related to forest management: timber harvest, silvicultural activities (i.e., tree planting, herbicide application, fertilization, thinning, grapevine control, and timber stand improvement), property management activities (i.e., road construction, road maintenance, surveying/boundary maintenance, and access control), and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities. Four models were developed to examine factors affecting each category of forest management activity. The results showed that landowner, ownership, and management characteristics of NIPF landowners are associated with their forest management decisions. Specifically, age, education, profession, income, ownership size, period of forestland acquisition, distance of the forestland to the place of residence, whether the forestland was purchased or acquired through inheritance or as a gift, primary objective of forestland ownership, and presence of a written forest management plan were found to be significant determinants for at least one of the categories of forest management activities. The models explained 25%, 27%, 31%, and 24% of the variation in timber harvesting, silvicultural activities, property management activities, and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities, respectively. Understanding the underlying factors influencing forest management decisions of this diverse group of forest landowners could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments to motivate NIPF landowners in forest management.";"Joshi, Sudiksha

This would also allow the setting up of a regulatory regime whereby Hungary could maintain the national character of its land ownership policy without infringing the basic principles set forth in the Treaty of Rome (non-discrimination on the basis of nationality, free flow of capital and freedom of settlement). The new regime could also reduce the fragmentation of land, as farms would be inherited as a whole, a sum of all the relevant assets, without restricting the right of the devisor to free disposal of the farm. Decision-making by the co-owners of the jointly owned land concerning the disposal or use of the land would need to be given an institutionalised form – instead of using the rules of the Civil Code on jointly owned assets. If the lease agreements for agricultural land came under preliminary scrutiny by the authorities and if the minimum term of lease would be set at 7-9 years, granting the lessee the right to extend the contract on one occasion (allowing for an annual lease option with restricted accessibility), the current system of pre-lease rights could be eliminated and so would the tax-free rent revenue of land owners.Legislation should be passed to set up special forms of agricultural business entities which would be suitable to resolve – after a suitable transitory period – the mandatory transformation of business partnerships engaged in agricultural activities in line with the farm regulation.";"Orlovits, Zsolt";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"land administration";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016223010";"http://purl.umn.edu/99138";"";"";"";""

But the evidence on such interventions is remarkably mixed. This paper reviews the literature and discusses a number of challenges related to the analysis of the impacts of land administration programs, focusing on developing countries where the starting position is one of land administration systems based on the Napoleonic code, with existing individual rights that may be imperfect and insecure. We examine a set of conceptual and methodological challenges including :[br/] 1) a conceptual challenge related to the need to unbundle property rights and to establish the plausible causal chain for land administration interventions; [br/]2) the existence of other binding constraints on productivity, implying the need to consider heterogeneities in policy impacts and the complementarity between property rights and other productive interventions; [br/]3) the need to account for spillovers of land interventions on non-targeted households; [br/]4) methodological challenges related to the causal identification of the impacts of such interventions.";"Gignoux, Jérémie

Feral Swine have also been reported as infrequent predators of Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator) eggs, with only seven nests lost in three prior studies combined (Fogarty 1974, Ruckel and Steele 1984, Woodward et al. 1992). In response to increasing reports by Louisiana landowners of Alligator nest losses due to Feral Swine, we sent a questionnaire addressing this issue to licensed Louisiana Alligator farmers who are permitted to collect eggs from wild nests. Over half (51.4%) of the farmers reported loss of Alligator nests in 2011; some 590 nests were damaged or destroyed on 36 separate properties across the state. Four farmers, some of whom have twenty or more years of experience collecting Alligator eggs, reported this is the first year in which they have lost nests to Feral Swine. Other farmers reported seeing wild hogs while in the field or seeing sign of hogs, which suggests future potential losses may be incurred and that the range and population level of this non-native species is expanding in important Alligator nesting habitat in Louisiana. Nearly all farmers who had nests destroyed by Feral Swine (94.7%) reported hog damage is increasing on their properties. Some farmers reported that hog removal efforts limited their Feral Swine damage this year relative to past years. In addition to deleterious effects on wetlands habitats caused by Feral Swine, the financial impact of loss of the Alligator egg revenue is significant.";"Elsey, Ruth M.

An Analysis of Seed Industry Proposals";"";"This paper illustrates the potential negative effects of increasing the scope of plant breeders' rights (PBR) protection, as has been proposed for Europe by leading plant breeding firms. Such a policy could increase the costs for varietal development for breeding companies, particularly if their access to varieties of the market leader is constrained. This is represented as an  asymmetrical increase in breeders' cost functions in a simple model of endogenous quality choice under price competition. Increased scope of IPR protection leads to increased profits for the leading breeding company butdecreases in varietal quality and both farm and overall profits.";"Eaton, Derek J.F.

"AGRIS:RU2016000450";"Zemstvo idea: realisation problems in pre-revolutionary and Post-Soviet Russia";"Земская идея: проблемы реализации в дореволюционной и постсоветской России";"150 years ago in Russia bodies of local self-government named zemstvoes were formed. The special feature of the Russian zemstvo consisted in dual, dissimilar coexistence and comparison of crown (governmental) and zemstvo (public) bases, as some kind of unity and struggle of opposites, with in advance expected positive result for local governments owing to their greater identity to interests of the managing population. At the same time, the zemstvo idea had ""an ethics-social"" orientation, it was much wider than the service economic function, which was defined by authorities of zemstvoes. The main purpose of local government consisted in maintenance of social justice and public solidarity. Thanking to the zemstvo idea, which was bringing up and pulling together the town councilors, their activity could not be limited mainly to interests of nobles. Therefore, the word «zemstvo» was always associated with concept ""public"", finding continuation in such spheres, as national health and education, public care and public agronomics. In the post-revolutionary Soviet period, the state concept of management of local affairs with its principle of democratic centralism came to replace the public theory of local government, being oppositional in relation to an absolute monarchy. In the Post-Soviet period, the municipal forms of local government departed from indigenously Russian traditions of self-management even farther. The liberal idea dominating in the 90th years actively imposed western models of municipal self-management. The main feature of municipal forms of self-management existing nowadays is the absence of uniform economic space. They have not come nearer to the population yet and have not become the form of democracy.

150 лет тому назад в России были образованы органы местного самоуправления, называемые земствами. Особенность российского земства состояла в двойственном, неоднородном сосуществовании и сопоставлении коронного (правительственного) и земского (общественного) начал, как своего рода единство и борьба противоположностей, с заранее ожидаемым положительным итогом для органов местного самоуправления в силу их большей идентичности интересам хозяйствующего населения. Земская идея имела одновременно ""этико-социальную"" направленность, она была значительно шире той служебной хозяйственной функции, которая определялась предметами ведения земств. Главное назначение местного самоуправления по ней состояло в обеспечении социальной справедливости и общественной солидарности. Благодаря земской идее, воспитывавшей и сближавшей гласных, их деятельность не могла ограничиваться преимущественно дворянскими интересами. Поэтому слово ""земское"" всегда ассоциировалось с понятием ""общественное"", находя продолжение в таких сферах, как народное здравие и образование, общественное призрение и общественная агрономия. В послереволюционный советский период на смену общественной теории местного самоуправления, бывшей оппозиционной по отношению к абсолютной монархии, пришла государственная концепция управления местными делами с её принципом демократического централизма. В постсоветский период муниципальные формы местного самоуправления ещё больше отошли от исконно российских традиций самоуправления. Господствовавшая в 90-е годы либеральная идея активно навязывала западные образцы муниципального самоуправления. Главной чертой существующих ныне муниципальных форм самоуправления является отсутствие единого хозяйственного пространства. Они ещё не приблизились к населению и не стали формой народовластия.";"Efremenko, A.V., Yaroslavl State Agricultural Academy (Russian Federation)";"";"";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"ru";"land reform";"";"";"RUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=RU2016000450";"http://www.yaragrovuz.ru/images/Vestnik_APK/15-1/75_81_1-2015.pdf";"";"";"";"75-81"

Forests provide a full suite of goods and services to subsistence farmers in the Himalayan agro-ecological system. The effects of biomass outtake on woody species richness and composition were analysed in forests under communal and government management. Interviews on forest use and perception of forest condition and ecosystem service delivery were conducted in farmer households bordering the forests. Significantly more woody species were found in the community managed forests. Species richness was negatively correlated with walking distance from the nearest village and increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Community forests were generally less degraded than government managed forests, giving support to common pool resource management. Woody vegetation represented a crucial source of fuelwood, timber, fodder, and edible, aromatic and medicinal plants. Using a multidisciplinary framework to analyse ecosystem integrity and ecosystem service delivery enabled a finer understanding of these complex agro-ecological systems, giving support to evidence-based management and conservation planning for the future.";"MÃ REN, INGER E.

Human-altered landscapes can support dense populations of raccoons, increasing the potential for interaction between humans and these animals. We used raccoon feces provided by licensed fur trappers to investigate environmental variables that influence prevalence of B. procyonis at 2 sites in Wisconsin. Trappers submitted raccoon feces to us, along with information on sex, age (juvenile and adult), and approximate trap location for each animal. We used zinc sulfate (1.18 specific gravity) flotation to detect B. procyonis eggs in approximately 1 g of fecal matter from each host. We used ArcView software to determine the distance of each trap location to an urban area as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2000. We compared the habitat components in buffered home ranges (0.805 km around trap locations) of infected animals with those from uninfected animals using Mann-Whitney U-tests (P < 0.05). Variables investigated were human population, road density, housing units per census block, and land cover, including area of agriculture, forest, developed, shrubland, water, and grassland. We positively identified eggs in 64.9% of the animals sampled. Raccoons infected with B. procyonis had significantly larger area of agricultural habitats and significantly smaller areas of forested habitats in buffered home ranges than uninfected individuals. We found that raccoons near Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are commonly infected with B. procyonis, indicating that public education regarding protection from disease is warranted.";"Samson, Amanda

However, even species that use human-altered habitat types may be severely affected by forest loss. White-throated Robins (Turdus assimilis) frequently nest in coffee and pasture in southern Costa Rica, although several lines of evidence suggest the species could not exist solely in agricultural habitat. We used radio-telemetry to examine the area and proportion of different habitat types used by adult White-throated Robins. Mean area of use for the tracking period was 0.26 km² and varied from 0.07 to 0.58 km². No robins had areas of use solely in either primary forest or agricultural cover, although individuals were initially captured in both primary forest and a coffee plantation. All areas of use contained some forest, pasture, and coffee or regenerating forest. The mean percentages of the habitat types used by the birds were fairly equal with 30% forest, 33% pasture, and 38% coffee or regenerating forest. Our results, combined with other evidence, indicate that the White-throated Robin uses multiple habitat types but that it may require some threshold level of forest to sustain viable populations.";"Cohen, Emily B.

In this study, thematic mapper time-series data were derived from Landsat images for prolonged droughts that occurred in two satellite images (2002 and 2011). The data derived from these images were used for the detection of changes in land cover and water storage in the reservoirs. First, a vegetation cover map was produced using soil-adjusted vegetation index and field sampling. Subsequently, land use/cover maps were generated using supervised and hybrid image classification method. Using the spatial change detector (SCD v1.0) software extension, the layers were combined and the change map was generated. The overall accuracy of the produced thematic images was assessed in regards to quantity and allocation disagreements. A total of five classes were defined in this investigation: deep water, shallow water, vegetation, salt land and bare land. The results showed that during the period of study, water volume reduced and vegetation cover increased, especially around the reservoirs that are important as shelter for wintering migratory birds. Comparison of land use/cover maps showed the increase in total available surface of shallow water, which indicated an increase in the habitats for surface feeding and diving birds.";"Amiri, Fazel

A scientific evaluation index system for woodland intensive use is constructed. Range Standardization Method is adopted in order to eliminate the differences among indices; index weight is calculated by the objective variation coefficient weight method. Physio geographic condition, woodland area and forest resource of Wenhe Operating Zone in Yakeshi City, China are introduced. According to the 2004-2008 relevant statistical data, intensive use level of Wenhe Operating Zone is evaluated. Result shows that the intensive use level of this zone shows a general upward trend with relatively fast increase in a particular year, and slight increase in woodland input every year. From the year 2004 to 2005, intensive level of woodland decreases slightly. From 2005 to 2006, intensive level of woodland rises with slight increase in woodland output. From 2006 to 2007, intensive level of woodland rises rapidly with a substantial upward trend in output. From 2007 to 2008, intensive level of woodland declines sharply. Based on this, related countermeasures are put forward for the intensive use of woodland in Wenhe Operating Zone. Firstly, strengthen the input in production factors of forestry, especially the mechanical input, in order to avoid unnecessary waste. Secondly, scientifically evaluate the development potential, breeding mode and planting program of woodland. Conduct a unified plan for market, and develop wildlife breeding properly. Thirdly, scientifically plan the plantation and guarantee the survival rate; increase the post investment in plantation; scientifically plan the logging quota, and ensure a reasonable output and intensive use of wood.";"Zhang, Xia

It had an important function as a component of tribute paid to local landowners by villagers, which led to the persistence of manna gathering even when this was not sustainable for peasants themselves. Manna grass was always an expensive food due to its time consuming gathering, but appreciated for its sweet taste and often served as dessert. In the nineteenth century marshes shrank significantly and the payment of tribute disappeared from the local economy, which gradually led to the total abandonment of Glyceria use around 1914. This article provides a detailed overview of Glyceria use as food within the borders of the former Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom (now Poland, Lithuania, western Belarus and western Ukraine) based on archaeobotanical, historical and ethnographic sources. The evidence for the continued use of manna since at least medieval times is abundant in historical accounts and ethnographic studies, but little has been reported in archaeobotanical findings due to the relatively small amounts of Glyceria consumed.";"Łuczaj, Łukasz Jakub

Three methodological steps can be distinguished (partly based on studies explained elsewhere in this volume) (i) an evaluation of the available 'surplus' land, (ii) a modeled productivity and (iii) an economic assessment for 13 typical bioenergy crops. Results indicate that the total available land for bioenergy crop production - following a 'food first' paradigm - could amount to 900 000 km2 by 2030. Three scenarios were constructed that take into account different development directions and rates of change, mainly for the agricultural productivity of food production. Feedstock supply of dedicated bioenergy crop estimates varies between 1.7 and 12.8 EJ y-1. In addition, agricultural residues and forestry residues can potentially add to this 3.1-3.9 EJ y-1 and 1.4-5.4 EJ y-1 respectively. First generation feedstock supply is available at production costs of 5-15 xi GJ-1 compared to 1.5-4.5 xi GJ-1 for second generation feedstocks. Costs for agricultural residues are 1-7 xi GJ-1 and forestry residues 2-4 xi GJ-1. Large variation exists in biomass production potential and costs between European regions, 280 (NUTS2) regions specified. Regions that stand out with respect to high potential and low costs are large parts of Poland, the Baltic States, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine.

Essential natural vegetation records compiled from historical documents and regional optimal surface albedo dataset were used. The results show that the surface albedo decreased by 0.01–0.03 due to conversions from grassland to cropland in the Northeast China Plain and it increased by 0.005–0.015 due to conversions from forests to cropland in the surrounding mountains. As a consequence, in the Northeast China Plain, the surface net radiation increased by 4–8 W/m2, 2–5 W/m2, and 1–3 W/m2, and the climate was therefore warmed by 0.1°C–0.2°C、0.1°C–0.2°C、 0.1°C–0.3° in the spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In the surrounding mountain area, the net radiation d °C ecreased by less than 1.5 W/m2, and the climate was therefore cooled too slight to be detected. In summer, effects of surface albedo changes on climate were closely associated with moisture dynamics, such as evapotranspiration and cloud, instead of being merely determined by surface radiation budget. The simulated summer climatic effects have large uncertainties. These findings demonstrate that surface albedo changes resulted in warming climate effects in the non-rainy seasons in Northeast China Plain through surface radiation processes while the climatic effects in summer could hardly be concluded so far.";"Zhang, Xuezhen

The results showed that although SOC concentration and stock increased significantly at 0–20 cm along the chronosequence, the total SOC stock of the 0–200 cm layer was 13.8% lower in 30-year farmlands and 88.3% higher in 100-year farmlands than that in natural soil due to the corresponding decrease in 30-year farmlands and significant increase in 100-year farmlands at 40–200 cm depth. Cultivation also significantly increased TN concentration and stock at 0–20 cm, but the obvious increase of TN stock at 0–200 cm was only found in 100-year farmlands due to the slight change of TN stock at 40–200 cm except for 100-year farmlands. C and N stocks in the 40–200 cm layer of the cultivated farmlands contributed respectively 67.6 and 61.9% of the total SOC and TN stocks of 0–200 cm, further confirming the importance of C and N cycling in the deep layer. The continuous applications of N fertilizers combined with organic manures and irrigation with silt-laden river water contributed greatly to the increase of SOC and TN stocks. These results suggest that the oasis farmland has great potential capacity to accumulate SOC and TN only if long-term cultivation (> 30 years) and the enhancement of organic materials are implemented.";"Huang, Cai-Bian

The adequacy of forest policies to reflect regimes of property rights in their design and implementation is examined using content analysis. The analysis synthesises forest policies of four distinct historical time periods, and the embedding of property rights during those periods using Schlager and Ostrom's typology. The findings reveal the inadequacy of the existing state property rights regime to secure the livelihood of 3.5million people in marginalised and disadvantaged forest-dependent communities, and to achieve sustainability in the SMF by reversing the trend of rapid reduction of forest resources. The challenge, therefore, is to find an alternative property rights regime to address the missing link between conservation and livelihood-security of forest-dependent communities using sustainable management practices in the SMF.";"Roy, Anjan Kumer Dev

The increase in impervious areas disrupts the natural water balance. Reduced infiltration increases runoff and leads to higher flood peaks and volumes even for short duration low intensity rainfall. Due to their destructive effects, floods can significantly increase the expenses on mitigation efforts. The present study focuses on the Thirusoolam sub watershed, an urban watershed in Chennai. Land use changes associated with urbanization in the watershed are invariably reflected in the stream flow regime. This paper emphasizes on an integrated approach to flood management, considering the land use change into the hydrological model. Integrated Flood Management (IFM) aims to harmonize human activities and flood risks through appropriate interventions to modify the water regime, and adaptation of human behavior thereby reducing such risks. Therefore, the hydrological impacts of urbanization should be considered for effective urban planning. The outcome of the study would help in formulating policy guidelines and intervention strategies.";"Suriya, S.

Biological soil crust destruction is a central factor leading to land degradation and desertification. We study the effect of BSC structure on cyanobacterial activity. Micro‐scale structural analysis using X‐ray microtomography revealed a vesiculated layer 1.5–2.5 mm beneath the surface in close proximity to the cyanobacterial location. Light profiles showed attenuation with depth of 1%–5% of surface light within 1 mm but also revealed the presence of ‘light pockets’, coinciding with the vesiculated layer, where the irradiance was 10‐fold higher than adjacent crust parts at the same depth. Maximal photosynthetic activity, examined by O₂ concentration profiles, was observed 1 mm beneath the surface and another peak in association with the ‘light pockets’. Thus, photosynthetic activity may not be visible to currently used remote sensing techniques, suggesting that BSCs' contribution to terrestrial productivity is underestimated. Exposure to irradiance higher than 10% full sunlight diminished chlorophyll fluorescence, whereas O₂ evolution and CO₂ uptake rose, indicating that fluorescence did not reflect cyanobacterial photosynthetic activity. Our data also indicate that although resistant to high illumination, the BSC‐inhabiting cyanobacteria function as ‘low‐light adapted’ organisms.";"Raanan, Hagai

A socialâecological framework is a tool for evaluating how social factors affect ecosystems through human actions and how ecological factors in turn affect social systems through ecosystem services. Here, we consider linkages and tradeâoffs between social and biophysical factors that arise when unique microbial attributes such as complexity, dispersal, and rapid evolution are integrated into a socialâecological framework. Using case studies from food production systems, wastewater treatment facilities, and synthetic biology, we show that unintended disâservices can arise when microbial information is limited or is ignored as a result of socioeconomic policies and practices. In contrast, when knowledge about microorganisms is integrated into a socialâecological framework, we can identify how to best maximize microbial services. New scientific tools used to characterize microbial traits, communities, and functions will enhance our ability to monitor microorganisms in diverse systems. However, communication and collaboration among stakeholders â including policy makers, landowners, resource managers, and scientists â are also needed to foster more effective âmicromanagementâ of microbial services.";"Peralta, Ariane L

We adapted these theories to evaluate whether the emergence of decentralized land protection in a largely private landscape followed the principles of reserve design. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine: (1) Are there distinct clusters of PAs in time and space? (2) Are PAs becoming more spatially clustered through time? and (3) Does the resulting PA portfolio have traits characteristic of ideal reserve design? METHODS: We developed an historical dataset of the PAs enacted since 1900 in the northern New England region of the US. We conducted spatio-temporal clustering, landscape pattern, and aggregation analyses at both the landscape scale and for specific classes of land ownership, conservation method, and degree of protection. RESULTS: We found the frequency of PAs increased through time, and that area-weighted clusters of PAs were heavily influenced by a few recent large PAs. PA clustering around preexisting PAs was driven primarily by establishment of large PAs focused on natural resource management, rather than strict reserves. Since 1990, the complete portfolio has increased in aggregation, but reserve patches have become less aggregated and smaller, while patches that allow extractive uses have become more aggregated and larger. CONCLUSIONS: Our extension of landscape ecology theory to a diverse portfolio of PAs underscores the importance of prioritizing conservation choices in the context of existing PAs, and elucidates the landscape scale effects of individual actions within a portfolio of protected areas.";"Meyer, Spencer R.

Yet the influence of socio-economic factors, temporal and spatial distance on risk perception remains under-researched. Data on risk perception and response were collected from two sets of Indian villages. Participatory approaches were used to investigate variations by socio-economic status, food security, age and gender. Villagers’ risk priorities reflected clear spatial and temporal patterns depending on land ownership, community group and education levels. Poorer groups prioritised household-level risks to health and food security while global environmental risks were mentioned by only three of the wealthiest respondents.

Using a combination of a latitudinal and a longitudinal comparison, the results indicate that FFS-trained farmers have significantly more knowledge about crop husbandry practices than those in the non-participant comparison group. A 32% production increase and 45% income increase relative to the non-participants was estimated in the latitudinal analysis. The longitudinal comparison is showing significant adoption rates of 94, 93, 90, 66 and 35 % respectively for shade management, phytosanitary harvest, pruning, improved spraying practices and grafting of improved materials. There was a 47 % reduction in the frequency of spraying fungicides and a 17 % reduction in the number of sprayers applied per treatment following the implementation of the training. Labour inputs increased significantly for pruning, phytosanitary harvest, and shade management but decreased for spraying. A partial budget analysis reveals that the IPM practices lowered overall costs of production by 11 % relative to previous practices. The two different analytical tools (longitudinal and latitudinal) are convergent in their results, showing more evidence about the higher potential impact of the farmer field school training on the restructuring process of the cocoa sector in Cameroon";"Wandji, Njankoua

Gross and net changes between 11 land-cover classes were estimated for 5 dates of Landsat imagery (1973, 1980, 1986, 1992, and 2000). An estimated 673,000km²(8.6%) of the United States’ land area experienced a change in land cover at least one time during the study period. Forest cover experienced the largest net decline of any class with 97,000km² lost between 1973 and 2000. The large decline in forest cover was prominent in the two regions with the highest percent of overall change, the Marine West Coast Forests (24.5% of the region experienced a change in at least one time period) and the Eastern Temperate Forests (11.4% of the region with at least one change). Agriculture declined by approximately 90,000km² with the largest annual net loss of 12,000km²yr⁻¹ occurring between 1986 and 1992. Developed area increased by 33% and with the rate of conversion to developed accelerating rate over time. The time interval with the highest annual rate of change of 47,000km²yr⁻¹ (0.6% per year) was 1986–1992. This national synthesis documents a spatially and temporally dynamic era of land change between 1973 and 2000. These results quantify land change based on a nationally consistent monitoring protocol and contribute fundamental estimates critical to developing understanding of the causes and consequences of land change in the conterminous United States.";"Sleeter, Benjamin M.

Commonly occurring helminths belonged to 3 polymorphic species of the Ostertagiinae: Spiculopteragia asymmetrica/S. quadrispiculata, Ostertagia leptospicularis/O. kolchida, and O. drozdzi/O. ryjikovi. Trichostrongylus axei was found in very few cases. Ostertagia drozdzi/O. ryjikovi and the minor male morphotype, S. quadrispiculata, are reported for the first time in red deer from Spain. The 3 ostertagiine species are also reported for the first time in fallow deer from Spain. These 3 species of Ostertagiinae are primarily parasites of cervids, and nematode species characteristic of domestic ruminants were not present. Prevalence of infection by gastrointestinal parasites in cervids was high, ranging from 97.5 to 100%, across the 3 areas sampled. Mean intensity of infection and abundance showed a positive relationship to the population density of red deer. Helminth burdens were higher in fallow deer than in the sympatric red deer and may reflect the gregarious social structure and different foraging patterns of fallow deer.";"Santin-Duran, M.

We used an ecosystem services approach where only final benefits are valued to avoid double counting. The final benefits are ecosystem services or commodities which have an economic value. The supply of ecosystem services depends on the functioning of ecosystems, but rarely ecological and institutional boundaries coincide and often stakeholders in ecosystem services cut across a range of institutional zones and scales. Land use and management influence the system processes, properties and components that are the basis of services provision. Although much has been written about the need to quantify and value ecosystem services, there are fewer spatially explicit studies that delineate the supply and demand areas for ecosystem services and assess the trade-offs between ecosystem services over space and time especially on drylands. Based on the spatial distribution of resources and the existing competition over these resources, this paper assesses the current values attributed to the selected ecosystem services. Then, by mapping existing supporting infrastructure and drivers of land use change such as demographic pressure, we highlight trade-offs and synergies among alternative uses and opportunities for sustainable development. In particular, the paper identifies services that will be lost if a particular part of landscape is modified: e.g. benefits for livestock and wildlife can be affected by the lack of conservation of corridors and rangelands, while water supply and irrigated crops can be compromised by increased water demand as result of human population pressure mainly at the upstream sub-catchments. We demonstrate the value of spatial analysis to land use investments and management and highlight how conservation and management of ecosystem services require the understanding of the spatial links between ecosystems and human well-being.";"Silvestri, Silvia

"AGRIS:US201500183535";"Effect of rainfall variation and landscape change on runoff and sediment yield from a loess hilly catchment in China";"";"The semiarid Chinese Loess Plateau is notorious for severe drought, water erosion, and environmental degradation. Changes in landscape patterns and rainfall are key drivers that determine the dynamics of runoff loss and sediment yield from catchments. These factors have crucial implications for management of other fragile ecosystems around the globe. In this study, responses of surface runoff and sediment yield to land use and rainfall in a typical loess hilly catchment in 1997, 2005, and 2010 were analyzed. Several major findings are highlighted. First, most rainfall occurred in the growing season from June to September and increased only slightly during the observation years. Second, runoff and soil transport rates at the catchment outlet from June to August were far greater than in other months. A similar trend was observed for seasonal rainfall occurrence, indicating that the intra-annual water erosion patterns were largely dominated by monthly rainfall distribution. Third, compared with the time period 1997–2005, mean runoff and sediment transport modulus in 2005–2010 declined significantly. This can be attributed mainly to changes in land use/land cover, i.e., increases in forests, shrubs, and grasses, and decreases in sloping farmlands. Dam construction is also key in controlling runoff and sediment yield, but more attention must be paid to its possible negative environmental effects. In general, our study indicates that marked changes in landscape patterns and vegetation coverage may contribute to long-term soil loss dynamics, and intra-annual rainfall variation mainly contributes to monthly variation in runoff and sediment yield.";"Wei, Wei

"AGRIS:US201600197216";"Ruralâurban peripheries under socioeconomic transitions: Changing planning contexts, lasting legacies, and growing pressure";"";"The status of urban forests and other green open spaces has always been ambiguous within the context of rural-urban peripheries. On one hand, most European countries have introduced protected green zones around cities to contain their sprawl and to provide urban dwellers recreational space and sanitation services since the early days of city planning policies. On the other hand, the ecosystems of green open areas remain under high pressure due to high demand for suburban land, causing issues ranging from illegal dumping to ecosystem fragmentation and forest loss. In Eastern Europe, in particular in the former USSR, rural-urban peripheries went through series of socio-economic transitions that resulted in complex interplays of socialist and post-socialist institutions. In this paper we explore these interplays in the context of land-use dynamics of rural-urban peripheries of two middle-sized cities in Belarus (MahilioÅ­) and Russia (Pskov), with particular attention to open green spaces and environmental status of their ecosystems. We describe the properties of the rural-urban peripheries of MahilioÅ­ and Pskov, offer an overview of legal frameworks and actor networks involved in the planning policies, and describe land-use pressure on ecosystems. Then, we discuss dilemmas of spatial planning in ruralâurban, including spatial investment, regulation, and spatial intervention dilemmas. Planning process in the two cities demonstrates a search for compromise between a compact city cherished by the socialist planning tradition (and supported by plannersâ backgrounds and existing regulatory frameworks), and the increasingly noticeable tendency toward urban sprawl.";"Shkaruba, Anton

"AGRIS:US201600198843";"Determinants of enrollment in public incentive programs for forest management and their effect on future programs for woody bioenergy: evidence from Virginia and Texas";"";"Several federal- and state-sponsored programs, including cost-sharing arrangements, tax incentives, and technical assistance programs, are available to forestland owners, aiming to encourage desired forest management practices and outcomes. However, enrollment rates in such programs are low, and trends of forestland parcelization hint at an even smaller enrollment rate in the future. Therefore, it is important to understand how socioeconomic attributes of forestland owners and past experience with such programs affect the likelihood of enrollment in public incentive programs. Among others, this will help us provide tailored information to forestland owners who are less likely to use these opportunities through extension and outreach programs. Towards this end, we conducted a survey of 1800 forestland owners in Virginia and Texas. Our recursive partitioning, logistic regression, and CochranâArmitage trend test results suggest that forestland owners who are less likely to enroll in such programs have relatively smaller forestland acreage, a lower level of education, and shorter land ownership tenure. We also find that forestland owners with experience in public incentive programs tend to attach higher importance to potential programs, including those that do not directly benefit them. We also identify threshold values for explanatory variables such as acreage and tenure length.";"Wolde, Bernabas

"AGRIS:US2016220544";"Integrating Flood Management and Agri-Environment through Washland Creation in the UK";"";"In many river floodplains in the UK there has been a long history of flood defence, land reclamation and water regime management for farming. In recent years, changing policies with respect to farming, environment and flood management is encouraging a re-appraisal of land use in rural areas. In particular, there is scope to develop, through the use of appropriate promotional mechanisms, washland areas which will simultaneously accommodate winter inundation, support extensive farming methods, deliver environmental benefits, and do this in a way which can underpin the rural economy. This paper explores the feasibility of flood storage and washland creation, the likely economic impacts of this type of development, and the financial and institutional mechanisms required to achieve implementation. The outcome is the identification and assessment of a washland package within the UK agri-environment framework. However, given the diversity of circumstance and practice, it is suggested that a range of options, and not just those associated with management agreements and annual payments, is used for the management and administration of washland areas.";"Morris, Joe

One of the research objectives of the German-Uzbek Khorezm project, funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and led by ZEF, is to better understand options for land use and choice of technology at the farm level in order to evaluate and propose technological alternatives and policy options for sustainable land use in Khorezm. To address the latter, the integrated so-called Farm-Level Economic-Ecological Optimization Model (FLEOM) was developed. FLEOM optimizes farm-level land and resource use while at the same time assessing the respective economic and environmental impacts. The model captures the basic features of the regional agriculture and the interrelations of production activities most prevalent to the local farmers. FLEOM builds on an economic farm-household linear-programming (LP) optimization routine and a comprehensive agronomic data base established with the cropping system simulation model, CropSyst. A graphical user-interface programmed in Java provides for easy usability, by which settings and results of FLEOM are visualized in tables and figures or as maps via a GIS-environment. The present discussion paper provides a technical introduction to FLEOM and discusses first application results.";"Sommer, Rolf

Aeolian process was very strong and seriously affected by human disturbances on the Sonid grassland of Inner Mongolia Plateau. Sand transport rate of grassland increased quickly with the increase of desertification severities, especially at the very severe desertification stage of sand sheet emergence. Human disturbances can seriously destroy balanced-state soil surface to induce new soil wind erosion over and over again, in particular at the higher wind speeds. Spatial variation of wind erosion was strongly related to land use/cover change, and finally led to landscape change, while emergence of erosional bare patches might be the key link, especially around herdsmen’s settlements and along roads or fences. Avoiding grazing before windy season is very important for decreasing soil wind erosion, not only to protect vegetation cover, but also to reduce trampling-inducing destruction of the soil surface structure. Prohibition of overgrazing must be strictly obeyed under any possible climate conditions, and reclamation should be more careful. Reducing human disturbances by selective emigration and eco-compensation mechanism would be considered as a priority for reducing local wind erosion.";"Liu, Shulin

Maquenque, Panicum maximum (CIAT 36000), Paspalum notatum, and a chemical control (Glyphosate and mechanical control) established in the rows in a Valencia orange grove. The experiment followed a complete randomized block design (8 cover crops) and three replications, evaluated during the wet and dry seasons. Rhizosphere soil and grass and legumes roots were sampled in order to identified AMF and quantify the number of spores and the percentage of colonization. A total of 26 species were identified, including Acaulospora scrobiculata, A. morrowiae and, Scutellospora heterogama, which accounted for over 65% of the population. The percentage of root colonization ranged between 47% and 94% with spore counts between 63 and 300/100 g of dry soil. Cover crops with the highest colonization percentage and AMF diversity were B. brizantha, B. dictyoneura and P. notatum in their respective order. Glyphosate and mechanical control had a negative influence on the sporulation and colonization of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the root system.

Results show that the main participants in the market are both agriculture and real estate sectors (developers); agriculture buying 57� % and selling 68� % of transactions. The estimated supply and demand system shows that market forces indeed drive market water right prices. Demand is inelastic to price while supply is highly elastic. Furthermore, supplied and demanded water rights quantities are functions of water right price as well as the economic sector of buyer and sellers, sectoral profits, and geographic location of the water right.

Land use changes can increase C loss rates which are extremely difficult to reverse, in the short term, opposite to organic carbon (OC) which accumulates in soil in the long-term. The aim of this research is to improve and test methodologies to assess land cover change (LCC) dynamics and temporal and spatial variability in C stored in vegetation at a wide scale. LCCs between 1956 and 2007 in Andalusia (Southern Spain) were selected for this pilot study, assessed by comparison of spatial data from 1956 to 2007 and were reclassified following land cover flows (LCFs) reported in major areas in Europe. Carbon vegetation densities were related to land cover, and C vegetation stocks for 1956 and 2007 were calculated by multiplying C density for each land cover class with land cover areas. The study area has supported important changes during the studied period with significant consequences for vegetation C stocks, mainly due to afforestation and intensification of agriculture, resulting in a total vegetation C stock of 156.08Tg in 2007, with an increase of 17.24Tg since 1956. This study demonstrates the importance of LCC for C sequestration in vegetation from Mediterranean areas, highlighting possible directions for management policies in order to mitigate climate change as well as promoting land conservation. The methodologies and information generated in this project will be a useful basis for designing land management strategies helpful for decision makers.";"Muñoz-Rojas, M.

The conflicts in Sweden are found to stem from contradictory concepts concerning property (notably, ownership and the right of public access) and ideological differences in terms of whether forest resources should be regulated by government or governance. While the precise circumstances of this case are somewhat unique to Sweden, differences of opinion concerning property rights and regulations are common and so our findings will be broadly applicable when defining and analyzing forest-related conflicts, especially those involving multiple-use situations.";"Sténs, Anna

The present study adapted a dynamic optimization framework to analyze optimal land use decisions. Results show that ignoring negative climate change effects on tea production and forest carbon storage values leads to excessive deforestation and lower optimal forest stock levels. The analyses also suggest that optimal forest stock is inversely related with the discount rate and at discount rates higher than 5%, complete deforestation becomes the optimal land use choice. This points to the need to critically reassess discount rates currently applied to approval of projects in Ethiopia, which are generally higher than 5% and which do not distinguish projects with long-term environmental costs and benefits from others. It is therefore also necessary to introduce incentive mechanisms such as rewarding reductions in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation to prevent further clearing of forests.";"Girma, Hiywot Menker

In this paper, we analyse the effects on stream discharge of afforestation of a small watershed devoted to pasture using the HBV hydrological model. Streamflow data obtained over the first 10 years after planting were employed to evaluate the capacity of HBV model to simulate hydrological behaviour of catchment after afforestation. Obtained results indicate that the estimation of streamflow was accurate as reflected by statistics (R² = 0.90, NSC = 0.89 and PBIAS = 0.34). Afterwards, streamflow under pasture land use (if afforestation had not occurred) was simulated using hydrometeorological data collected during the period of study and model parameters optimized previously, together with two parameters, pcorr and cevpfo, that were adjusted for pasture conditions. The HBV model results indicate that afforestation produced a water yield reduction around 2000 mm (22% of total stream discharge) during the first 10 years of planting growth. The differences between forest and pasture land cover are increasing in all seasons year by year. The greatest streamflow reduction was observed in wet period (autumn and winter) with 76% of total reduction. In summer, streamflow reduction represents only 3% of total, however, represents 24.7% of discharge in this season. Streamflow reduction was related to increase of rainfall interception (mainly in wet periods) and the increase of evapotranspiration by plantation in dry periods.

It analyses the micro-dynamics of the Forest Rights Act using three dimensions: individual tenure rights, citizenship, and conflict to discuss the contested nature of household-level tenure rights to forest land. The arguments are based on data collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews from six Bhil tribal villages in Banswara district, Rajasthan. The findings indicate that the forest tenure reform promoted the individualisation of forest right claims – thereby increasing Bhil tribal inter-household-level conflicts – and that households' forest land tenure claims relate primarily to the formal recognition of their citizenship rights.

"AGRIS:US201400171634";"Using a multilevel approach to analyse the case of forest conflicts in the Terai, Nepal";"";"Recent years have witnessed an intensification of forest-related conflicts between various stakeholders in Nepal, particularly between the state and local people, over the control, management and use of forests in the southern plains of the Terai. This paper analyses the multiple dimensions of conflicts in Terai forestry policy and practice using a multilevel approach. Multilevel forest conflicts in the Terai are explained as a nested concept, existing at different overlapping levels (ranging from the global level to households). At one pole, Terai forestry can be understood in terms of conflicts of interest between Nepal's national concerns for development and global concerns for environmental protection. At the other pole, access to and control of lands and forests and opportunities for participation in a family environment (intra-household and interpersonal levels) are based on inequalities of gender (male domination of women) or age (family head or older members prevailing over younger family members). In between the two poles of global and household levels are other identifiable levels of conflict in Terai forestry: state versus community; inter-community (between various groups); and intra-community conflicts (along dimensions of class, caste, ethnicity, gender, religion, and age). This paper situates and applies the idea of multiple levels of conflict to various dominant regimes of forest management in the Terai and argues that the issue of land and forest control, and hence dimensions of forest conflicts in the Terai, are not only an issue of global–state–community conflict, but are also driven by undercurrents of ethnicity (e.g. hill-origin versus plain-origin people), migrants versus indigenous groups (inter-community conflict), and other intra-community differences. In so doing, the paper develops and applies a multilevel analytical approach to understand how different governance regimes influence, and are influenced by, social heterogeneity and conflict across multiple scales. It is argued that methodologically the multilevel approach outlined in this paper can be used as a comprehensive framework in the analysis of complex issues of forest and land use conflict elsewhere.";"Satyal Pravat, Poshendra

"AGRIS:US201301549137";"Sustainable land and water management policies and practices: a pathway to environmental sustainability in large irrigation systems";"";"Water cycle, land management, and environmental sustainability are intimately linked. Sustainable land and water management practices are vital for sustaining agricultural productivity and regional development. Unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity constraint over long periods can impose significant costs in terms of lost opportunities in farm production and regional development, say by causing waterlogging and salinity. On-farm and regional salt and water balance dynamics are modeled as a sustainability or carrying capacity constraint, proxied by regional salt and water balance; on-farm land and water management practices are then adjusted to meet the constraint, such that individual actions do not lead to a net change in the ground water and salt balance. Common actions across the farms would achieve the overall environmental sustainability. An irrigated area in southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia serves as a case study example. Integrated hydrologic, economic, agricultural, and environmental models called SWAGMAN series are used to evaluate the impacts of a range of on-farm interventions on farm income and environmental sustainability. The results show that policies such as restrictions on area under certain crops, and tradable groundwater recharge/salinity credits both offer higher total gross margin and net present value than the business as usual scenario, specifically in the long run--win-win options for the farmers and the environment. The modeling results thus confirm the widely held view that unsustainable land and water management practices that violate the system's carrying capacity can impose significant costs on regional communities. In-depth hydrological and economic analyses are needed to shape and guide society's vision for sustainable land and water management. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Khan, S.

"AGRIS:US201301580735";"indicator of forest dynamics using a shifting landscape mosaic";"";"The composition of a landscape is a fundamental indicator in land-cover pattern assessments. The objective of this paper was to evaluate a landscape composition indicator called 'landscape mosaic' as a framework for interpreting land-cover dynamics over a 9-year period in a 360,000 km2 study area in the southern United States. The indicator classified a land parcel into one of 19 possible landscape mosaic classes according to the proportions of natural, developed, and agriculture land-cover types in a surrounding 4.41-ha neighborhood. Using land-cover maps from remote sensing, the landscape mosaics were calculated for each 0.09-ha pixel in the study area in 1996 and 2005. Mosaic transition matrices estimated from the pixel change data were then used to develop two Markov chain models. A “landscape mosaic” model was a temporal model of the shifting landscape mosaic, based on the probability of landscape mosaic change for all pixels. A “forest security” model was the same, except that the Markov states were defined by both the landscape mosaic and the land-cover of each pixel, which allowed interpreting forest land-cover dynamics in the context of a shifting landscape mosaic. In the forest security model, the overall percentage of forest decreased from 33% in 2005 to 17% at steady-state, and there was little change in the relative distribution of existing forest area among landscape mosaic classes. In contrast, the landscape mosaic steady-state was reached later, and indicated that a maximum of 10% of total area was available for forest. The implication was that forest security depended ultimately on the dynamics of the landscape mosaics that contained forest, not on forest dynamics within those landscape mosaics.";"Riitters, Kurt H.

Empirical results show decreasing returns to scale in production. The mean economic efficiency is 0.39 with a range of 0.12 - 0.66. Education, access to extension, access to credit and membership in a farmers association positively and significantly influence economic efficiency. Innovative institutional arrangements that enhance extension and farmer training, accompanied with improved access to credit is likely to enhance potato production efficiency.";"Nyagaka, Daniel

"AGRIS:LV2011000360";"Land in the system of real estate objects and features of tax application in Latvia";"";"Since the economic recession in Latvia, the national debt in September 2010 amounted to 4.717 billion lats. The study confirms significant impact of downward trends of the economy of Latvia on the national budget performance indicators in 2009. One of the most commonly mentioned and controversial indicator is the real estate tax that has to be imposed also on the land. The aim of this study is to analyse and assess the system of the Land Fund of Latvia and features of tax application. The following three key objectives will be addressed in this research to achieve the determined aim: clarifying the concept of the land, types of property rights and ownership status; assessment and evaluation of allocation of national land-use according to targeted groups and the types of land use; and gathering information on taxes imposed on land and assessing property tax revenues from the land to provide the development assessment of the land fund system in Latvia. Recommendations for the improvement of the system of factors influencing the Land Fund of Latvia were developed as result of the study. The key recommendation is to develop a new monitoring and control system for the complete inspection of real estate objects classifying them according to the regions as well as the creation of integrated database based on administrable taxes according to the categories of real estate. The results of the study may be applied for identification of the impact of fiscal policy on the assessment of the development trends of real estate tax in Latvia.";"Geipele, S., Riga Technical Univ.

This practice is known to benefit soil and crops. However, the potential contamination of the environmental matrices has been rarely assessed because suitable models and data regarding the diffuse contamination of SS in agricultural fields are limited. By using land classification tools, we can evaluate the suitability of each soil parcel, the nature of the local soil, and the landscape parameters, and thus take more confident decisions regarding the management of this waste. In this study, we describe the development of a land classification tool to determine whether SS is suitable for organically amending a given agricultural soil. Bayesian networks (BNs) were used to assess the suitability of agricultural soils located in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). The case study includes a description of the area and the procedure used to develop the BN model. The results of this evaluation are presented in innovative ways, with spatial representation of the probability results to give a broader understanding of the classification problem.";"Passuello, Ana

Testing such impacts upon populations of organisms (i.e. at the catchment scale) has not proven straightforward and differences have emerged in the conclusions reached. This is: (1) partly because different studies have focused upon different scales of enquiry; but also (2) because the emphasis upon upstream land cover has rarely addressed the extent to which such land covers are hydrologically connected, and hence able to deliver diffuse pollution, to the drainage network. However, there is a third issue. In order to develop suitable hydrological models, we need to conceptualise the process cascade. To do this, we need to know what matters to the organism being impacted by the hydrological system, such that we can identify which processes need to be modelled. Acquiring such knowledge is not easy, especially for organisms like fish that might occupy very different locations in the river over relatively short periods of time. However, and inevitably, hydrological modellers have started by building up piecemeal the aspects of the problem that we think matter to fish. Herein, we report two developments: (a) for the case of sediment associated diffuse pollution from agriculture, a risk-based modelling framework, SCIMAP, has been developed, which is distinct because it has an explicit focus upon hydrological connectivity; and (b) we use spatially distributed ecological data to infer the processes and the associated process parameters that matter to salmonid fry. We apply the model to spatially distributed salmon and fry data from the River Eden, Cumbria, England. The analysis shows, quite surprisingly, that arable land covers are relatively unimportant as drivers of fry abundance. What matters most is intensive pasture, a land cover that could be associated with a number of stressors on salmonid fry (e.g. pesticides, fine sediment) and which allows us to identify a series of risky field locations, where this land cover is readily connected to the river system by overland flow.";"Reaney, Sim M.

A number of trade barriers such as import tariffs and domestic support have limited the scope for trade in biofuels. The purpose of this study is to analyze the implications of U.S. biofuel mandates, subsidies and import tariffs on global trade and welfare. We utilize the GTAP-BIO model, which was developed as a customized version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model capable of analyzing domestic and trade policy issues associated with biofuels (Birur, 2010). We supplement this model with updated and detailed sectoral level information on feedstock crops, different types of first and second generation biofuels and their byproducts. This highly refined data base facilitates the model for simulating changes in cropping patterns at individual crop level, land use changes, commodity prices, etc. We analyze the following policy scenarios in this study: (a) implementation of volume requirements consistent with the U.S RFS2 volumes for the year 2022 relative to a starting point of the base year 2004, (b) reduction in the ethanol specific import tariff from 54 ¢/gallon to 45 ¢/gallon, so that there will be “parity” between the U.S. and exporting country’s ethanol price, (c) Complete removal of the U.S. ethanol blenders’ credit and import tariff on ethanol, (d) combined implementation of (a) and (c) policy scenarios. This paper offers insights regarding the prospective policy options that can affect potential trade in biofuels amongst the major producing countries, such as the extent to which a removal of U.S. import tariff on ethanol affects pasture and forest land conversion in Brazil.";"Birur, Dileep K.

Ten years have passed since the earthquake occurred. Vegetation succession is the basis for establishing a restoration reference which plays an important role in vegetation restoration at landslide sites. Generally, growth conditions for grass are easier and the growth rate is faster than that for trees. Therefore, grass can be considered a pioneer species or an important reference for the early vegetation succession stage. This is the reason why grass is required to be extracted from other land covers. Integrating remote sensing, geographic information system and image classification into vegetation succession models is very important. In this study, the Markov chain model was applied for vegetation restoration assessment and discussion. Chiufenershan and Ninety-nine peaks were selected as the study areas. Five SPOT satellite images are used for land cover mapping and vegetation restoration simulations. Four categories of land covers were extracted, including forest, grass, bare land and water, respectively. From the transitive probability matrix (derived from any two land covers), the results show that vegetation restoration at the Chiufenershan and Ninety-nine peaks landslide areas is ongoing, but that has been disturbed by natural disasters.";"Chuang, Chin-Wei

"AGRIS:US201400164114";"Long-term water balance and conceptual model of a semi-arid mountainous catchment";"";"Long-term water balance investigations are needed to better understand hydrologic systems, especially semi-arid mountainous catchments. These systems exhibit considerable interannual variability in precipitation as well as spatial variation in snow accumulation, soils, and vegetation. This study extended a previous 10-year water balance based on measurements and model simulations to 24years for the Upper Sheep Creek (USC) catchment, a 26ha, snow-fed, semi-arid rangeland headwater drainage within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in southwestern Idaho, USA. Additional analyses afforded by the additional years of data demonstrated that the variability between streamflow and annual precipitation (r²=0.54) could be explained by the timing of precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions. Winter–spring precipitation and soil moisture deficit at the beginning of the water year accounted for 83% of the variability in streamflow, which was almost as accurate as applying the more complex physically-based Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) numerical model (r²=0.85) over the three dominant land cover classes. A conceptual model was formulated based on field observations, numerical simulations and previous studies. Winter precipitation and spring snowmelt must first replenish the deficit within the soil water profile and ground water system before water is delivered to the stream. During this period, surface water and ground water are tightly coupled and their interaction is critical to streamflow generation. Shortly after snow ablation, however, water flux in the root zone becomes decoupled from the ground water system and subsequent precipitation does little to contribute to streamflow for the current year, but serves to offset ET and the soil moisture deficit at the beginning of the following year. This study demonstrates the merits of long-term catchment-scale research to improve our understanding of how climate and land cover interact to control hydrologic dynamics in complex mountainous terrain.";"Chauvin, G.M.

Is a three‐dimensional (3D) woody vegetation structural classification applied to LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data better than a 2D analysis to investigate change in fine‐scale woody vegetation structure over 2 yrs in a protected area (PA) and a communal rangeland (CR)? LOCATION: Bushbuckridge Municipality and Sabi Sand Wildtuin, NE South Africa. METHODS: Airborne LiDAR data were collected over 3 300 ha in April 2008 and 2010. Individual tree canopies were identified using object‐based image analysis and classified into four height classes: 1–3, 3–6, 6–10 and >10 m. Four structural metrics were calculated for 0.25‐ha grid cells: canopy cover, number of canopy layers present, cohesion and number of height classes present. The relationship between top‐of‐canopy cover and sub‐canopy cover was investigated using regression. Gains, losses and persistence (GLP) of cover at each height class and the four structural metrics were calculated. GLP of clusters of each structural metric (calculated using LISA – Local Indicators of Spatial Association – statistics) were used to assess the changes in clusters of each metric over time. RESULTS: Top‐of‐canopy cover was not a good predictor of sub‐canopy cover. The number of canopy layers present and cohesion showed gains and losses with persistence in canopy cover over time, necessitating the use of a 3D classification to detect fine‐scale changes, especially in structurally heterogeneous savannas. Trees >3 m in height showed recruitment and gains up to 2.2 times higher in the CR where they are likely to be protected for cultural reasons, but losses of up to 3.2‐fold more in the PA, possibly due to treefall caused by elephant and/or fire. CONCLUSION: Land use has affected sub‐canopy structure in the adjacent sites, with the low intensity use CR showing higher structural diversity. A 3D classification approach was successful in detecting fine‐scale, short‐term changes between land uses, and can thus be used as a monitoring tool for savanna woody vegetation structure.";"Fisher, Jolene T.

In grassland, dust arrives from sources far away or is directly emitted and immediately part of the suspension load. The processes of dust emission or deposition can be mainly identified by vertical concentration measurements close to the ground and close to the sources. Often the concentration differences at the used measuring heights are too small to derive the direction of vertical fluxes precisely, especially at dust storms of light-to-medium intensities. For this reason, particle mass (PM₁₀, PM₁) and particle number concentrations were measured simultaneously at ground level and at heights of up to 80 m using a dust monitoring system lifted by a kite. The measured data of dust concentration gradients are used to calculate the vertical fluxes with the necessary certainty to derive the direction of the dust fluxes. Additionally, dust arriving from different directions and crossing different land use/land cover patterns was used to interpret the interaction of source/sink relationships along the transport direction upstream of the measuring point. Results show that dust measurements above grassland have to span greater height differences to derive vertical fluxes certainly, i.e., concentration gradients (Δc/Δz) of PM₁₀and PM₁provide an indication of the direction of the dust flux. Furthermore, the results indicate a close relationship between the particle size compositions of the dust and land use/cover patterns. Arable land in the surroundings causes an emission flux (vertical upward), especially of the coarser fractions >8 µm, whereas grassland causes deposition fluxes of size classes >2 µm during a dust storm of low intensity. Sources from far away are reflected by higher concentrations of finer particles, measured during a super-regional dust storm. Both, dust concentration gradients and particle size composition reflect the potential source areas and deposition processes adequately with regard to different land use/cover patterns up to 50 km away.";"Reiche, Matthias

A semi-distributed, conceptual rainfall–runoff model was adapted to conceptualize the empirically-based, dominant hydrological processes of the study area and was multi-criteria calibrated using different objective functions and empirical constraints on model simulations in a Monte Carlo framework to account for parameter uncertainty. The results suggest that land-use change had relatively little effect on the overall mean annual water yield (<3%). However, streamflow dynamics proved to be sensitive in terms of frequency, timing and magnitude of discharge extremes. For low flows and peak discharges of return periods greater than one year, land use had a minor influence on the runoff response. Below these thresholds (<1-year return period), forest cover potentially decreased runoff peaks and low flows by as much as 10%, and non-forest cover increased runoff peaks and low flows by up to 15%.

В статье рассмотрено влияние внесенного в осенний период мелиорирующего вещества хлорида кальция в дозе 2,4 т/га на свойства черноземных почв. По результатам почвенных анализов к концу первого года последействия было установлено влияние мелиоранта на такие показатели, как рН, щелочность, содержание хлоридов, обменных катионов и карбонатов. В течение зимнего периода с количеством осадков 200-300 мм хлориды, входящие в состав мелиорирующего вещества, вымываются на глубину до 50 см. Внесение мелиоранта способствует уменьшению суммы обменных катионов на 2,9 ммоль-экв./100 г почвы в весенний период и 9,2 ммоль-экв./100 г почвы в слое 0-20 см к концу первого года последействия.

"AGRIS:US2016212586";"INDIA'S PLANT VARIETY AND FARMERS' RIGHT LEGISLATION: POTENTIAL IMPACT ON STAKEHOLDER ACCESS TO GENETIC RESOURCES";"";"The demand for extending intellectual property protection to agriculture in developing countries has met with counterclaims for granting farmers' rights. Developing countries are currently attempting to fulfill these demands by evolving new IPR regimes that simultaneously protect the rights of breeders and farmers. What are the possible implications of establishing such a system of multiple rights on the utilization and exchange of genetic resources among various actors? Could the attempt to distribute ownership rights to various stakeholders pose the threat of an ""anticommons"", where resources are underutilized due to multiple ownership? The answers to these questions have important implications for the future of agricultural growth in developing countries. India is one of the first countries in the world to have passed a legislation granting rights to both breeders and farmers under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001. The law emerged from a process that attempted to incorporate the interests of various stakeholders, including private sector breeders, public sector institutions, non-governmental organizations and farmers, within the property rights framework. India's Act allows four types of varieties to be registered reflecting the interests of actors: New Variety, Extant Variety, Essentially Derived Variety and Farmers' Variety. Although this multiple rights system aims to equitably distribute rights, it could pose problems of overlapping claims and result in complicated bargaining requirements for utilization of varieties. A potential implication is an 'anticommons tragedy' where too many parties independently posses the right to exclude giving rise to underutilization of resources. India and other developing nations, in seeking to achieve the important goal of recognizing farmers. rights, must not overlook the need for promoting exchange of agricultural resources. India's Plant Variety and Farmers' Right Act is significant both in the domestic and international context as several other countries are trying to establish similar legislations. Advanced nations must recognize that compelling developing countries to grant breeders rights could result in systems that run counter to their interests. Developed and developing countries must make a concerted effort to ensure that emerging IPR regimes do not restrict stakeholder access to genetic resources.";"Ramanna, Anitha";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"IND";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212586";"http://purl.umn.edu/16105";"";"";"";""

Finding ways to resolve such conflicts is a challenge to all involved. 2. Within the UK a long and, at times, acrimonious conflict has developed around the conservation of hen harriers Circus cyaneus on moorland managed for red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. This paper follows our original forum article and the replies from colleagues in the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT). 3. Whilst differences of opinion remain, there are encouraging signs that both sides are striving for consensus. There is broad agreement that evidence is required on three fronts to address: (1) the ecological, economic and social consequences of alternative forms of land management in the uplands; (2) the efficacy of diversionary feeding of hen harriers; and (3) the utility of a brood management scheme to improve harrier conservation status and reduce the extent of the conflict. 4. Synthesis and applications: The conflict between hen harrier conservation and red grouse management has existed for decades with little sign of progress. For the first time, stakeholders, researchers and policy advisors are engaged in effective dialogue and are striving for solutions. There are encouraging signs that all sides are now willing to listen to alternative viewpoints and appear prepared to seriously consider compromises. It is to be hoped that a solution to the harrier-grouse conflict can be found as this will have considerable positive ramifications for management of heather moorlands in the UK and wider implications for the conservation of predators around the world.";"Redpath, Steve

The prospects ofland rezoning are modeled as a poison process which may or may not be influenced by farmer’swater abstraction decisions. Selling out of agriculture before land rezoning has an impatiencecost as the farmer does not gain the maximum speculative rewards. The analysis highlights therole of such speculative rewards in making farmers resilient to declining profitability inagriculture and also identifies the circumstances under which the water prices may be anineffective policy tool for allocating water.

"AGRIS:US201400064694";"Farmers' participation in soil and water conservation activities in the Chemoga Watershed, Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia";"";"Soil erosion by water constitutes a threat to the maintenance of the subsistence living of the Ethiopian rural population. Past efforts at Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) did not bring about significant results, mainly because of the top-down approach pursued. Uprooting this past oversight and instating a participatory approach has since then been strongly recommended as the correct strategy. This paper analyses the extent of farmers' participation in current SWC activities in the Chemoga watershed, East Gojjam Zone, Amhara Regional State. Formal household survey, informal and focus group discussions and field observation were used to generate the data. The results indicate that the majority of the farmers participated in the SWC against their will. The most important factor discouraging them from participating freely was the perceived ineffectiveness of the structures under construction. Awareness about soil erosion as a problem, labour shortage and land tenure insecurity were found to be less important in providing an explanation for the disinterest shown by most of the farmers towards the SWC activities. Therefore, the important factors that need immediate consideration for SWC efforts in the study area or the region at large are: (1) SWC structures have to be carefully designed and constructed taking into account ground realities, and (2) participation of the farmers has to be through their own conviction regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of the technologies. Alternative SWC technologies will have to be considered in this regard.";"Bewket, W.

The evolution of these forest policies is critically reviewed. It is argued that India is perfectly positioned to benefit from climate change mitigation efforts, due to a rich, albeit chequered, history in forest management. National forestry policies are examined to assess how they can complement international climate change mitigation instruments, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the more recent Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD or REDD+ with conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and aid national sustainable development objectives. There is a need to heed the experiences from India's evolving forest policies, particularly those concerning land tenure and resource rights, which lack specificity within international mechanisms. The active engagement of rural communities must be integral to any programmes that make any claim to development and to environmental integrity as a whole. Policy relevance India's forestry programmes are examined for their effectiveness in informing international initiatives such as the CDM and REDD+. Forestry policies in India can evolve to complement international climate mitigation tools. By examining current and historical forest legislation, and their subsequent impacts, it is shown how communities can sustain their system of forest management and retain/obtain rights to land and resources under the CDM and REDD+. Looking for such synergies within existing national policies to implement newer international initiatives can greatly facilitate and increase the momentum of global environmental change.";"Khatun, Kaysara";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"deforestation;climate change;sustainable development;land rights;land tenure";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500210691";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2013.768924";"";"";"";"384-402"

The results of the survey showed that there was a firm tendency ofconcentration among the Hungarian individual farms. Though their average size is about 3 ha,the number and area of farms over 50 ha size are rapidly growing and taking a significant partof the total individual agricultural area. The number of small farms is great but their totalfarming area is relatively small. The concentration takes place primarily due to renting.

To protect farmland countries use different land use policies. This paper will look specifically at two jurisdictions: The Netherlands and a particularly rich farming area in British Columbia, Canada. For these areas we will investigate how the institutions and laws present in these jurisdictions contribute to agricultural land preservation. We will analyse farmland values in a GIS-based hedonic pricing framework to answer this question. This combination enables us to analyse direct impacts of laws and regulations within the hedonic pricing framework.

Increases in perennial crops might also reduce local stream flows with adverseeffects on in-stream values. As such salinity control is likely to involve significanttradeoffs between public and private costs and benefits. This paper considers theimpact of planting differing areas of pastoral and woody perennials on farmprofitability (P), and water (W) and salt (S) exports from the Little River catchment inNew South Wales (NSW), Australia. The analysis uses two linear programming (LP)models. The first model represents a mixed crop and sheep system and the outputs ofthis model are integrated to provide inputs to a second catchment level model. Thestructure of the LP models is described and an analysis of the potential for perennialsto assist in salinity management is presented. The implications of the analysis forfarm systems and catchment scale changes in land use are considered.The study highlighted the importance of targeting management decisions to individualsub-catchments and of using relatively detailed farm level models as part of acatchment level study. The potential for perennials to contribute to profitable androbust farm systems and to reduce degradation to land from salt scalds and to streamsarising with elevated discharge and wash-off of salt is demonstrated.";"Finlayson, John D.

Developing robust proxies for Hg and/or MeHg determination also remains a challenge. Our study used Hg, MeHg, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration measurements and various DOC fluorescence indices to characterize Hg and DOC dynamics in a forested watershed of the US Northeast. Principal component analysis indicated that land cover/landscape position (i.e., headwater vs. wetland-influenced area vs. lake-influenced area) explained 44 % of the variance in Hg, MeHg, DOC concentrations, and DOC quality during the snow-free season, while seasonality (i.e., air temperature and discharge) explained only 21 % of the variance in the results. Furthermore, finding a good proxy for Hg that is valid across a range of landscape positions remains a challenge; however, regression analysis indicated that the fluorescence peak Humic C (excitation = 350 nm; emission = max (420–480)), which corresponds to the presence of melanoidins in water, explained 21 % of the variability in MeHg concentrations across both space and time (p = 0.001), and thus appears to be a possible proxy for MeHg determination in our study watershed. From a management perspective, land cover modifications (lake, reservoir, and wetland) are likely to play more important roles at regulating Hg, MeHg, and DOC exports at the watershed scale than long-term changes in the climate of this region.";"Vidon, P.

The GIS elaboration of the environmental factors considered for the definition of the suitable lands for olive trees cultivation, identified 3556 ha as suitable, of which 972 ha highly suitable belonging to class I, where olive trees cultivation could be profitable because of suitable land morphology and the possibility of a good mechanization due to low field slopes.";"Enrico Licausi

Such reality is not different in indigenous lands, and has been considered as an important obstacle for individuals who directly depend upon the appropriate management of natural resources to maintain their traditions. We investigated the seed rain, seed bank and natural regeneration of native woody species within a degraded pasture land in different distances from an adjacent seasonal semideciduous forest fragment to define methodological procedures based on ecological processes that might subsidize forest restoration in an indigenous land. Most seeds and seedlings picked from the seed rain and seed bank belonged to anemochoric and autochoric dispersing shrubby and herbaceous species originated in the pasture land. The woody species regeneration, on the other hand, reached higher levels, in terms of abundance and richness, as the forest fragment became closer. Zoochoric dispersal was predominant among such species and was mainly detected closer to the forest fragment. Several woody species picked in the forest fragment were also found in the pasture land, thus reinforcing their important role in supplying propagules and easing the successional process.";"Bertoncini, Alzira Politi

A major challenge will be how to use, and quality‐assure, information derived from different knowledge systems. We test how indigenous and local knowledge on natural resources in Miskito and Mayangna communities in Nicaragua, validated through focus groups with community members, compares with information collected on line transects by trained scientists. Both provide comparable data on natural resource abundance, but focus groups are eight times cheaper. Such approaches could increase the amount and geographical scope of information available for assessments at all levels, while simultaneously empowering indigenous and local communities who generally have limited engagement in such processes.";"Danielsen, Finn

The United States Bureau of Reclamation, in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service, has proposed a variety of plans to increase stream flows in the Snake River Basin to facilitate movement by juvenile salmon smolts to the ocean. This research examines two of the flow augmentation plans proposed by the Bureau of Reclamation as well as two alternative plans, one founded purely on existing priority-based water rights and another geared toward minimizing the effects of flow augmentations on farms profitability. Results from a basin-wide model of agricultural production in the Snake River Basin, the Snake River Agricultural Model, present evidence that (1) older water rights are used towards production of less valuable crops, (2) flow augmentation scenarios have unequal effects on farms profitability across agricultural regions within the basin, and (3) irrigation water is valued from US$4 to US$59 an acre-foot.";"Briand, G.

In order to achieve the above aim both summary statistics and multivariatemethodologies are employed. In particular, a two-step cluster analysis was used to explore thedifferent adoption levels of water saving practices and a categorical regression model was estimatedto explain this variation. Data were collected through a survey addressing 400 irrigators, carried outin 2008 in a typical Greek rural area.

Monthly observations spanning multiple years in seven major rivers in four different climate zones within the U.S. were analyzed for correlations between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and surface air temperature, precipitation, land cover and discharge. The major watersheds were the Altamaha River (GA), the Apilachicola River (FL), the Columbia River (OR), the Delaware River (NJ), the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers (CA) and the Susquehanna River (MD). One minor watershed, the Neponset River (MA) was also analyzed. Results indicate that temperature is the most important variable for DOC export when the variation of annual mean temperatures is large (e.g., >5°C) with sufficient precipitation levels. Land-surface characteristics and discharges are better correlated to DOC concentrations when the variations of annual mean temperatures are small (e.g. <2°C). However, results from the small watershed (Neponset) showed that land surface processes can vary annual DOC concentrations about ±1.65mg/L from mean value. This study is the first to examine DOC relationships in watersheds in multiple climate zones, and it was determined that weak correlations between temperature and DOC found in previous studies may be attributable to the fact that those studies examined small watersheds contained within a single climate zone. DOC flux per square meter was calculated based on incremental temperature increases. The results indicate that an increase of 1°C would result in a 0.476mg/L increase of in-stream DOC in large watersheds. Climate warming would have a greater impact on riverine DOC yields in cooler climate zones (up to 26% per °C) than on those in warmer climate zones (up to 6% per °C).";"Tian, Yong Q.

These surveys comprise the first round of a catchmentwide monitoring programme to obtain a measure of the distribution and abundance of 21 priority threatened fauna species that inhabit Dune Mallee Woodlands. A total of 127 fauna species were recorded, which included 19 of the possible 21 threatened fauna species. The 127 species comprised 37 reptile species, 15 bat species, three small mammal species and 72 bird species. The mean species richness recorded at each three hectare survey site for birds was 14.7, reptiles 7.1, small ground dwelling mammals 0.5 and bats 3.0. Mean abundance for birds was 42.7, reptiles 13.1, small ground dwelling mammals 1.0 and microbats 3.7. These surveys represent the most comprehensive inventory of fauna of the Dune Mallee Woodlands of the Lower Murray Darling catchment. Furthermore, these surveys are a platform upon which to detect changes in abundance and persistence of priority threatened fauna species, as a way of measuring outcomes of property management agreements and offset reserves where land management has been enhanced by actions such as exotic herbivore removal and predator control.";"Val, James

"AGRIS:US201301616899";"Relating soil carbon fractions to land use in sloping uplands in northern Thailand";"";"In this study from Khun Samun Watershed in northern Thailand we investigate land use and soil carbon relationships in 99 sloping upland soils that pertain to soil degradation/conservation and carbon storage/loss. Approximately 35% of the variability in total soil carbon could be explained by the available quantitative and semi-quantitative information, primarily clay content and CEC, and to a lesser degree by factors concerning land management. When categorical information such as land-use class and location was included, the explanatory power increased to 65% for total soil carbon, whereas for particulate and soluble carbon fractions the model predicted 71-95% of the total variability. The water soluble carbon fractions were high in systems with input of high C-to-N ratio material, whereas the permanganate oxidizable fraction was somewhat increased in the predominantly anoxic wetland rice site, and in fruit tree plantations. Coarse particulate organic matter carbon was strongly affected by land use. A causal relationship between land use and soil carbon or carbon fractions cannot be firmly established since historical data from these soils are lacking, but the significance of the various carbon fractions is discussed. It is proposed that the communities have selected land for particular purposes based on suitability, i.e. perceived inherent quality, accessibility and possibly other factors. Thus, the best land is apt to be used for the cultivation of fruit trees, teak and annual crops, leaving the poorest land for secondary forest. This study did not indicate that the cultivation of land is rapidly degrading the soil quality, either by carbon content, carbon fractions, or the profile gradients of total carbon or particulate carbon through the topsoil (0-20cm). Profile carbon gradients were significantly explained by land-use class, but not by the position in the landscape which indicates that erosion is not an overriding force. While the secondary forest had the strongest profile gradient of total carbon, it was not much higher than fallow and fruit tree plantations, and only significantly different from wetland rice, which had a very small gradient due to the frequent ploughing of the soil. The similarities in profile carbon gradients is ascribed to the actual land management, where planting of crops is commonly done by punching holes in the otherwise undisturbed topsoil, and subsequent weeding is done by manual slashing or with herbicides, thus effectively forming a zero-till practice.";"Aumtong, Supathida

"AGRIS:US201301616897";"contribution of crop-rotation organization in farms to crop-mosaic patterning at local landscape scales";"";"Farming activities are major drivers of the landscape-related ecological patterning because of their multiple influences on both non-arable and arable landscape elements and mosaics. Uncertainties still remain about the way individual farmer decisions and the aggregation of their activities in space contribute to these mosaics at local landscape scales, therefore about possible levers of action in farms for ensuring sustainable landscapes. The general objective of the present study was to give an assessment of the way farms contribute to crop-mosaic patterning at local landscape scales. We developed a method for comparing five contrasted local study cases of agriculture (five farm sets), by combining a statistical modeling of crop-rotation organization in farms, from empirical data, and a crop-mosaic simulation approach, applied in each case. Statistical rules of crop rotation allocation to fields in farms were defined from tests involving the following potential allocation factors: (1) farm household-enterprise, (2) field physical environment and (3) farm territory configuration. The statistical rules set up from each set of factors were implemented in rule-based simulations separately for each of the five local study cases. We used a raster representation of fields (one pixel by field), to concentrate on crop-rotation management-related effects, independently from the shape of fields and of diverse perennial landscape elements. An index of connectedness was measured for each mosaic, and was used as an indicator of crop-clustering effects due to crop-rotation organization in farms. The results showed that crop-clustering effects at local landscape scales differed according to the following factors of crop-mosaic patterning: (a) the spatial distribution of crop-rotation allocation factors over the field mosaic, (b) the specialization of crop rotations to their allocation factors, and (c) the development of crop rotations over time. These results also demonstrated that crop rotations, even if run as regular crop sequences over time, lead to significant year to year crop-mosaic variability. The results finally made explicit the differences between local study cases. We conclude from these results by pinpointing trade-offs to find between farm and landscape management.";"Thenail, C.

All the boundaries were buffer strips established following the guidance of an Agri-Environmental Support Scheme. Data on edaphic factors, boundary management practices and spatial coordinates were used as explanatory variables in the data analyses using variation partitioning by Redundancy Analysis and univariate statistics. The variation of the plant species composition and diversity was found to be strongly spatially structured. On the variation of species composition, spatial variables alone explained 35.0% and jointly with environmental factors 32.4% of the variation in species composition. Moreover, mowing, soil pH and P content and boundary width were shown to be important factors determining species composition. The species diversity was the lowest where the land use for agricultural production was most intensive and classification of species traits indicated high soil nitrogen levels. On the basis of this study, biodiversity in boundaries could be enhanced by appropriate management techniques and greater boundary width. Regional differences in agricultural land use should also be taken into account when planning practices for improving biodiversity.";"Tarmi, Sanna

Cover cropping is one type of technology increasingly being adopted by producers of multifunctional agriculture. Cover crops provide a range of benefits, both private and public. In this paper we identify factors affecting farmers’ choice to adopt cover crops. We examine the impact on nitrogen use from adopting cover crops and the resultant decrease in input costs. Using a two-stage approach that incorporates endogeneity of adoption in nitrogen management, we conclude that farmers adopting cover crop technologies, that increase production efficiency, tend to decrease nitrogen fertilizer use by 4.75%, as hypothesized by Smith (2002).";"Gabrielyan, Gnel

Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)‐plus provisions included in recent free trade agreements between the developed and developing countries show a tendency of the developed world to impose their high standards for protection of plant intellectual property on the developing world. While stronger intellectual property rights can increase international exchange in seed, market power effect can lead to a reduction in exports of seed to foreign markets. This article estimates the impact of intellectual property rights on U.S. seed exports. The estimation is performed at a crop level using Heckman selection model. The results reveal that the impact of intellectual property rights varies across different types of crops—open‐pollinated, genetically modified, and hybrid crops. While TRIPS provisions are important to facilitate transfer of genetically modified crops, they play a minor role for open‐pollinated and hybrid crops. The results also show that plant breeders’ rights envisioned by the UPOV system can be important to promote seed exchange when proper mechanisms are put in place to enforce these rights.";"Galushko, Viktoriya";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400055446";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2012.00620.x";"";"";"";"59-71"

Using available GIS data and an ‘off-the-shelf’ software application called TARGET, we find that the PES allocation criteria applied by authorities in 2002–2003 were more than twice as cost-efficient as criteria applied during 1999–2001. Results show that a policy relevant assessment of the cost-effectiveness of PES relative to other conservation policies can be carried out at regional level using available studies and GIS data. However, there are a number of data and conceptual limitations to using heuristic optimisation algorithms in the analysis of the cost-efficiency of PES. Site specific data on probabilities of land-use change, and a detailed specification of opportunity costs of farm land, labour and capital are required to use algorithms such as TARGET for ranking individual sites based on cost-efficiency. Despite its conceptual soundness for regional conservation analysis, biodiversity complementarity presents a practical challenge as a criterion for PES eligibility at farm level because it varies depending on the set of areas under PES contracts at any one time.";"Barton, D.N.

In Brazil, land use changes promoted by competing agricultural chains require a search for alternative modes of production for family farms. We analyse the technical and economic viability of intensification of dairy farming by smallholders in the “Balde Cheio” (Full Bucket) programme. On average, family farmers who joined the programme increased milk production three-fold whereas at regional level there was a significant reduction of 8% between 2003 and 2009. Comprehensive datasets from São Paulo state and four other regions across Brazil were collated and analysed to explore for whom, how and when intensive dairy production is a feasible option. Data envelopment analysis allowed us to compare inefficiencies among farms and highlight different strategies for technological changes. The empirical evidences in this study indicate the technical viability of the more intense use of resources towards family-based dairy farming systems. Higher productivity was due to a combination of more lactating cows/area (31%), higher productivity/cow (24%), better labour performance (37%) while using less land area (−7%). The gross margin/area almost doubled although milk prices had increased by only 7%. The economic outcome of the intensified systems was on average R$ 3000/ha which was competitive with R$ 600/ha for sugarcane leasing and R$ 700/ha for soybean production. Despite the smaller returns on land, large landowners can have a good household income with sugarcane or soybean, but for smallholders the intensification of dairy is the only option. Compared with the alternative of wage jobs in urban areas, we found it very competitive for 40 out of 50 farmers in the sample in terms of income per family member involved in the production process.";"Novo, André Monteiro

The examination of the relationships among different property formation procedures are part of this study. The methodology of the study was a systematic analysis of the property formation procedures provided by the Estonian Land Reform Act. The results of the study show that property formation during the course of land reform can be easy and simple in some cases. In other cases, property formation may be complicated. The determination of the area and boundaries of parcels to be formed is often an issue of discretion in such cases. The results of the study support the basis for better understanding land reform outcomes. It gives some explanation of the land fragmentation that is one of the outcomes of land reform.

In an international setting where foreign markets differ with respect to their intellectual property rights regime, a move by a technologically inferior firm to exploit a new unregulated market can result in imitation and PI. The impact of PI on innovation is determined by the degree of heterogeneity between firms and trade costs. Increasing trade costs shifts from the market share losses brought by PI from the more to the less productive firm. This induces the former to invest more in R&D. At this point, sales in the foreign market become a determinant of the R&D decision by the technologically inferior firm. For low levels of firm heterogeneity, PI increases output by this firm targeted for the unregulated market, hence increases its innovation efforts. A tariff policy accompanied by opening borders to PI only increases welfare when the technological gap between the two firms is sufficiently large.";"Mantovani, Andrea

Aiming at overcoming the disadvantages in subjectivity and complexity of the currently used assessment methods, an integrative fuzzy set pair model for assessing the land ecological security was developed by integrating fuzzy assessment and set pair analysis (SPA). The approximate degree of land ecological security to the optimal standard set was calculated to describe the secure level by combining multiple indices. The indices and weights were determined by a pressure-state-response model and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP), respectively. Aided by a geographic information system, this model was applied to evaluate comprehensively the status of land ecological security in Xiaolangdi Reservoir Region, China, taking the administrative division as the assessment unit. The results showed that 20% of the total area maintained a slightly secure status, while 50% of the study area was of a middle or seriously low grade of land ecological security. The remaining portion (30%) was the most ecologically insecure. From the spatial prospective, obvious variations were observed. The land eco-security gradually decreased from the Xiaolangdi Dam to its surrounding regions. It was concluded that the status of the integral land ecological security of Xiaolangdi Reservoir Region was in the middle level, and increasingly intense human activities speeded up the degradation of regional land ecosystem in recent years and thus induced the crisis of land ecological security.";"Su, Shiliang

Manure was readily available to 73% of the respondent farmers and it was obtained mostly from commercial and semi-commercial livestock production units within the area. Most of the manure was applied on land planted to high value crops such as maize, potatoes and vegetables. The common method of applying manure was by a spreader. The major factors that positively influenced the farmers’ decision to use manure were availability of manure, herd size, farmers’ experience in farming and the availability of extension services. Both land ownership and attendance of training did not seem to affect the farmers’ decision to use manure. Farm size was the factor that was found to negatively affect manure utilization. Other important considerations included labor and transport requirements for handling manure, lack of technical information on the fertilizer value and management of manure, increased growth of weeds and bad smell. Some suggestions are made on strategies that could improve the efficiency of utilization of manure for soil fertility management in this agroecosystem.";"Mkhabela, T.S.

However, the spatial resolution of freely available remote sensing data is too coarse to fully understand the spatial dynamics of crop status. The objective of this study was to downscale Landsat 7 (L7) reflectance from the native resolution of 30 × 30 m to that typical of yield maps (ca. 5 × 5 m) over two fields in northeastern Colorado, USA. The fields were cultivated with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the 2002–2003 growing season. Geospatial yield measurements were available (1 per ca. 20 m²). Geophysical (apparent soil electrical conductivity and bare-soil imagery) and terrain (micro-elevation) data were acquired (resolution <5 × 5 m) to characterize soil spatial variability. Geographically-weighted regressions were established to study the relationships between L7 reflectance and the geophysical and terrain data at the 30 × 30 m scale. Geophysical and terrain sensors could describe a large portion of the L7 reflectance spatial variability (0.83 < R² < 0.94). Maps for regression parameters and intercept were obtained at 30 × 30 m and used to estimate the L7 reflectance at 5 × 5 m resolution. To independently assess the quality of the downscaling procedure, yield maps were used. In both fields, the 5 × 5 m estimated reflectance showed stronger correlations (average increase in explained variance = 3.2 %) with yield than at the 30 × 30 m resolution. Land resource managers, producers, agriculture consultants, extension specialists and Natural Resource Conservation Service field staff would be the beneficiaries of downscaled L7 reflectance data.";"Scudiero, Elia

This may actually lead to an ambiguous definition of a particular land cover type when such different maps are compared at global level. In 1993, FAO and UNEP started efforts for development of a software tool know as LCCS which is a comprehensive standardized tool capable of providing land cover characterization to all possible land cover types in the world regardless of spatial relevance, mapping scale, data collection method etc. Adding to the global efforts of land cover legend harmonization and mapping, this study presents development of harmonized land cover legends for Namdapha National Park located in north-eastern Indian Himalayan region using LCCS and subsequent mapping. The potential of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in forest/land cover mapping is very well recognized. Therefore, adopting the developed harmonized legends for the study area, land cover mapping was done using RS-GIS approach.";"Lodhi, Mahendra S.

"AGRIS:US201500078431";"Do farming practices affect natural enemies at the landscape scale?";"";"Farming practices are rarely considered in the description of agricultural landscapes. However, the variety of cropping systems creates a particular kind of heterogeneity which can strongly affect the diversity of species living in agro-ecosystems, and consequently the ecosystem services they provide. In this study, we investigate the effects of landscape composition and configuration of organic and conventional farming practices on three groups of aphids’ natural enemies, compared to field habitat quality and land cover heterogeneity. A field survey was carried out in 2012 and 2013 in western France (Brittany). Ladybirds, carabid beetles and parasitoids were sampled in 40 pairs of organic and conventional winter wheat fields, distributed along a landscape gradient of organic farming areas. The relationships between farming practices and natural enemies were investigated with a PLS-path modeling approach, hardly ever used in ecology but presenting numerous advantages to analyze multivariate systems. Results showed that abundance and species richness of natural enemies were mainly affected by local farming practices, with a higher diversity in organic fields. To a lesser extent, landscapes also affected natural enemies, but only in relation to the length and configuration of hedgerows. Our results open up avenues for the design of agricultural landscapes since our results suggest that natural enemy diversity can be enhanced without a specific organization of organic fields. We discuss methodological issues regarding the description and the analysis of farming practices at the landscape scale. We argue that such investigations require high quality maps covering large spatial extents, and the use of statistical tools providing a good handling of complex relationships occurring in agro-ecosystems.";"Puech, Camille

Accordingly, wherever has one of the natural, ecological and/or cultural values it should be considered a protected area. Kave-Deh No-hunting Area is located on extremely east of Tehran Province in an area of 94,961 ha. Due to rich and diverse land cover, distinctive wildlife species, and unique monuments the area was selected as a case study to examine the possibility of its promotion to the protected area using Spatial Multi Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) Method. For this purpose, the relevant criteria were identified by Delphi method. After finalization of the most important criteria by Delphi panelists, the map layers were prepared at the scale of 1:100000, in the environment of GIS Software. Afterwards, the map layers were divided into factors and constraints of which factors were standardized by S-shaped membership functions of fuzzy logic. The dimensionless factor maps were weighted using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method in the environment of Expert Choice Software. Subsequently, a mathematical equation was extracted to conduct the land suitability analysis. The Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) Method was applied to overlay the map layers and obtain the final ‘nature conservation’ land use map. The final land suitability map showed that 34,687 ha of whole study area (equal to 37 %) have the potentiality for promotion to the protected area.";"Jozi, Seyed Ali

In this study, we conducted a germination experiment and a vegetation survey to evaluate the effects of different sediment loads on the seed banks of three wetland communities (dominated by Glyceria spiculosa, Zizania latifolia and Pycreus korshinskyi, respectively) under two hydrological regimes (0 and 10cm water depth). Results revealed significant differences in seed germination rates among the three plant communities and significant effects of sediment load on the germination rates. Species richness and seedling emergence decreased significantly at 0.5–0.75cm of sediment addition. Species responded differently to the addition of sediment. The number of seedlings of P. korshinskyi, Sagittaria trifolia, Alisma orientale, Monochoria vaginalis, Carpesium macrocephalum decreased gradually as the sediment addition increased from 0 to 2cm, while the number of seedlings of Fimbristylis dichotoma, Eleocharis ovata, Bidens bipinnata decreased to zero at 0.5cm of sediment addition. The number of species germinated under the non-flooded conditions was significantly higher than that under flooded condition. All plant communities showed a similar response to the sediment load under the two water regimes. Despite low similarity, the number of species germinated from seed banks was higher than the original number of species present in each plant community. To protect and restore the wetland vegetation community in the Sanjiang Plain, irrigation and land management strategies will need to be implemented to reduce the sediment load from the paddy fields to the wetlands.";"Wang, Guo-dong

The estimated probit models predicted that the rental market transferred land to those with relatively smaller holdings, but greater ability to make productive use of land, more assets to invest, more adults available for labour and fewer off-farm opportunities. Also land is rented out predominantly to younger farmers and to farmers not involved in off-farm jobs. Renting in is predicted to be relatively higher in the villages which are remote and weakly integrated into mainstream infrastructure and institutions. Land rental markets make an important contribution towards land use redistribution in the villages where land rental is high and where land distribution without land rental is relatively more unequal. The study recommends that existing policies restricting land rental should be eased, and investment towards infrastructure development and off-farm employment generating projects expanded.";"Akter, Shaheen

"AGRIS:US2016218547";"Global Property Rights in Genetic Resources: An Economic Assessment";"";"In recent years, growing economic globalisation has been accompanied by rising social support for market systems as a means of managing resource-use. In turn, the free market movement considers definite and secure property rights (especially private rights and, sometimes, communal rights) in resources to be the necessary basis for a desirable market system. Global policies for managing the Earth’s genetic resources have been influenced by this approach. As outlined in this article, there has been a global expansion of property rights in genetic resources, and further extensions have been advocated. In order to assess the possible social benefits and costs of granting property rights in genetic resources, they are classified. This classification is shown to be useful in discussing economic and legal reasons for granting or denying property rights in genetic resources. Furthermore, it is shown to be pertinent to the consideration of market failures that may accompany the granting of property rights in genetic resources and which limit the potential social economic benefits from establishing property rights in these resources. It is concluded that many advocates of managing genetic resources by means of secure property rights and market systems have been overly optimistic about the potential of this policy, its social benefits, its impact on the conservation of biodiversity, and its workability. There is a need for more informed debate on these matters before concluding that wholesale global extension of property rights in genetic material is desirable.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-11-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"001";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016218547";"http://purl.umn.edu/55095";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201600181284";"Conservation-priority grassland bird response to urban landcover and habitat fragmentation";"";"As urbanization in the landscape increases, some urban centers are setting aside habitat for wildlife. This habitat may be particularly valuable to declining or conservation-priority species. One group in particular need of conservation actions that may benefit from habitat located in urban areas is grassland birds. Declines of grassland bird species have been particularly severe in the Midwestern U.S., where most grassland cover has been lost, fragmented, and surrounded by unsuitable habitat. Conservation efforts have focused on protecting large grasslands surrounded by minimal amounts of trees and development. Although urban development is considered hostile to grassland birds, this assumption has received little attention. In heavily fragmented landscapes where habitat is limited, urban grasslands may be of significant value to grassland birds. We examined grassland bird response to development and additional landscape and habitat variables in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. In 2012 and 2013, we surveyed bird communities in grassland patches along a gradient of urbanization and patch sizes. Density of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) increased with amount of development, while density of Sedge Wrens (Cistothorus platensis) decreased. Development did not appreciably impact Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Dickcissels (Spiza americana), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), or Henslowâs Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). Patch size had a positive effect on species densities. These results indicate that for many conservation-priority grassland birds, urban landcover surrounding grasslands generally has neutral rather than negative effects on habitat use. Therefore, grasslands in developed landscapes may provide valuable contributions to regional conservation efforts.";"Buxton, Valerie L.

The main objective of this study is to explore whether this absence of empirical support for the present value model can be attributed to the restrictiveness of conventional time series methods. I suggest a panel unit root model with two regimes in which the adjustment process may be characterized by the presence of thresholds and discontinuities reflecting the presence of transactions costs and other barriers to adjustment. Using farmland value and cash rents data for 10 agricultural states of the U.S. between 1960 and 2008, empirical findings give modest improvement over the linear unit root process.

In May 2001 and 2011, we surveyed for singing male Cerulean Warblers, primarily by boat, along approximately 160 km of the Roanoke River from Weldon to Williamston in northeast North Carolina. We found Cerulean Warblers in three distinct groups along the Roanoke River during both survey years; however, we detected at least 32.4% fewer males in 2011 (n = 23) than in 2001 (n = 34). The landscape within 500 m of areas used by Cerulean Warblers had significanlty less crop cover, blackwater floodplain (i.e., swamp) forest, and variation in mean canopy height than unused landscapes we surveyed. These same differences existed at distances up to 1 km, but several additional dissimilarities became evident at this scale, including presence of more evergreen plantations and a greater fragmentation of the dominant forested land cover at used versus unused landscapes. We recommend continued monitoring of the Cerulean Warbler along the Roanoke River, increased habitat protection, and encourage an in-depth investigation into management strategies to sustain this population.";"Carpenter, John P.

Strong effects, resulted mainly from anthropogenic causes, in the hydrological regime are shown for this area using long term hydrological data and a GIS system for extracting land cover/use changes. A set of aerial imagery acquired in 1945 through 2002 were used to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal changes in land cover/use, focused mainly on the lake's surface area and its surrounding ecosystem (Natura 2000 area). The significance of the changes in land cover/use distribution within Pamvotis wetland is further discussed depicting the role of the anthropogenic influence on the fragile ecosystem that resulted in the shrinkage of lake's habitats extent. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the long-term changes on macrophyte community composition, species occurrence and relative abundance with water quality and water level changes over the past century, using historical data, aerial photos and GIS techniques. The results showed that for the last 25 years annual water level fluctuation ranged from 70 to 159 cm. Water level starts decreasing in mid June and increasing again gradually from November until March-April. Intra annual water level fluctuation seems to be affected by land use for agricultural purpose through intensive irrigation and the summer drought as well. A dramatic decline of the submerged vegetation is apparent mainly attributed to anthropogenic pressures. Regarding the land cover/use changes, the most notable and significant alterations are concerning the urban development around the lake, the disappearance of wet meadows and the extension of reed beds. Finally it seems that water budget data as well as the response of the key eutrophication parameters are affected from both hydrological alterations and point/non-point pollution sources.";"Papastergiadou, E.

In order to provide greater clarity, we propose that desertification assessments be placed within a state change-land use change (SC-LUC) framework. SC-LUC views desertification as state change occurring within the context of particular land uses (such as rangeland or cropland) and interacting with land use change. State changes amenable to reversal are distinguished from regime shifts, which are state changes involving persistent alterations of vegetation and/or soil properties (within rangelands) or soil properties that affect production (within croplands). Land use change pressures from rangeland to other uses may be low, fluctuating, or high and they may influence and be influenced by state change. We discuss how the SC-LUC perspective can guide more effective assessments of and responses to desertification.";"Bestelmeyer, Brandon T.

China's Grain for Green Project is a rapid landscape-scale shift in ground cover and land use with significant implications for biodiversity. From 1998 to 2005, we carried out field studies to examine the landscape-level impacts of this project, and to provide a practical example of the successes and failures of a large-scale attempt to restore a vulnerable environment. 2. In a northern part of China's Shaanxi Province, our results indicated that the total vegetation cover in areas covered by this project increased from 29·7% in 1998 to 42·2% in 2005. However, we also found evidence that large-scale afforestation in this vulnerable arid and semi-arid region could increase the severity of water shortages, decrease vegetation cover in afforestation plots, and adversely affect the number of species present. The exclusion of livestock from overgrazed areas and the elimination of cultivation in marginal areas had the biggest effects on the restoration of vegetation cover, whereas tree planting had a strong negative effect in vulnerable areas. 3. Synthesis and applications. In practical terms, the destruction of natural vegetation cover during afforestation should be avoided, as this makes the soil surface more vulnerable to erosion and reduces species diversity. Managers should reduce the intensity of farming and grazing on fragile land rather than relying on afforestation as the primary tool for ecological restoration in arid and semi-arid areas. Afforestation remains a valuable tool but should be limited to the planting of native or other species that will not exacerbate soil water shortages such as stable communities of natural desert steppe, maximum water-use efficiency dwarf shrubs, and possibly even lichen species in more severely degraded environments.";"Cao, Shixiong

Using log-linear regressions and long-term (6–21 years) data from 112 Swedish watercourses, we identified temporal and spatial patterns in browning-related parameters [iron, absorbance, and total organic carbon (TOC)]. Flow variability and lakes in the catchment were major influences on all parameters. Co-variation between seasonal, discharge-related, and trend effects on iron, TOC, and absorbance were dependent on pH, landscape position, catchment size, latitude, and dominant land cover. Large agriculture-dominated catchments had significantly larger trends in iron, TOC, and water color than small forest catchments. Our results suggest that while similarities exist, no single mechanism can explain the observed browning but show that multiple mechanisms related to land cover, climate, and acidification history are responsible for the ongoing browning of surface waters.";"Temnerud, Johan

"AGRIS:US201500032509";"Beyond desertification: new paradigms for dryland landscapes";"";"The traditional desertification paradigm focuses on the losses of ecosystem services that typically occur when grasslands transition to systems dominated by bare (unvegetated) ground or by woody plants that are unpalatable to domestic livestock. However, recent studies reveal complex transitions across a range of environmental conditions and socioeconomic contexts. The papers in this Special Issue illustrate how an improved understanding of these dynamics is generating more robust paradigms, where state changes and regime shifts occurring within the context of changes in land use and climate are modified by landform and antecedent conditions. New and emerging technologies are being used to characterize and evaluate processes and outcomes across various scales and levels of organization. At the same time, developments in education are taking advantage of these new perspectives to improve the ecological literacy of future generations, and to better inform land-management decisions. A framework that integrates these perspectives provides a more comprehensive approach for understanding and predicting dryland dynamics.";"Peters, Debra P. C.

Infection has since spread rapidly across the state and become endemic in the equine population. Environmental risk factors associated with equine WNV attack rates in Texas counties during the period 2002 to 2004 were investigated. Equine WNV attack rates were smoothed using an empirical Bayesian model, because of the variability among county equine populations (range 46-9,517). Risk factors investigated included hydrological features (lakes, rivers, swamps, canals and river basins), land cover (tree, mosaic, shrub, herbaceous, cultivated and artificial), elevation, climate (rainfall and temperature), and reports of WNV-positive mosquito and wild bird samples. Estimated county equine WNV attack rate was best described by the number of lakes, presence of broadleaf deciduous forest, presence of cultivated areas, location within the Brazos River watershed, WNV-positive mosquito status and average temperature. An understanding of environmental factors that increase equine WNV disease risk can be used to design and target disease control programs.";"Ward, Michael P.

Here we analyse possible habitat connectivity between the groups reported in Yunnan, using genetic, least-cost path and Euclidean distances. We detect genetic isolation between the northern and southern groups but not among the northern groups. We show that genetic distance is better explained by human disturbance and land-cover least-cost paths than by Euclidian distance. High-quality habitats were found to be more fragmented in the southern part of the study area and interspersed with human-influenced areas unsuitable for black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys, which may explain the genetic isolation of the southern groups. Potential corridors are identified based on the least-cost path analysis, and seven sensitive areas are proposed for restoration. We recommend (1) that restoration is focused on the current range of the monkeys, with efforts to reduce human disturbance and human population pressure and increase public awareness, and (2) the development of a long-term plan for habitat restoration and corridor design in the areas between groups.";"Li, Li

Assemblages in such habitat patches are not only limited by local habitat quality, but are also influenced by the suitability and distribution of different habitat types in the surrounding landscape. If we want to preserve a functionally diverse Lepidoptera fauna, both local and landscape scale environmental effects, including land use and management, should be considered. In the present study, we describe trait-based characteristics of noctuid dominated macro-moth assemblages (MMAs) in grassland remnants of an intensively cultivated agricultural area. By gathering environmental data from local to landscape scales, we aimed to identify the most influential scales, possible interactions between scales and the role of integrated arable fields in shaping MMAs. We conducted abundance weighted trait-based multivariate analysis of the assemblages based on six trait groups. Both local and landscape scale variables had important influence, acting on different traits of the assemblages. By variance partitioning, we could identify variables that exerted maximal effect at 50 m and 250 m radii circles. Variables describing local vegetation and identity of neighbouring crop were responsible for species richness and rarity status, while the area of arable and wooded habitats within 250 m were responsible for total catch and pest status related traits. There was significant interaction between principal components axes representing local and landscape variables. Rarity, more than other traits, was influenced by the interaction. Integrated fields had no effect on MMAs. The present study highlights the contributions of both local and landscape scales to the shaping of MMAs and suggests that the preservation of both local habitat quality and landscape heterogeneity are important if we would like to maintain species rich and functionally diverse Lepidoptera fauna.";"Samu, F.

Accounting for differences in technology levels across countries thus can go a long way towards understanding global inequality. One mechanism by which poorer countries can catch up with richer countries is through technological diffusion, the adoption by low-income countries of the advanced technologies produced in high-income countries. In this survey, we examine recent micro studies that focus on understanding the adoption process. If technological diffusion is a major channel by which poor countries can develop, it must be the case that technology adoption is incomplete or the inputs associated with the technologies are under-utilized in poor, or slow-growing economies. Thus, obtaining a better understanding of the constraints on adoption are useful in understanding a major component of growth.";"Foster, Andrew D.

Producers require dependable plant resources and management practices that improve the seasonal distribution and persistence of high quality herbage, sustainability and environmental integrity of the agricultural landscape. It was hypothesized that inorganic N and fecal coliform concentrations delivered in leachate to the soil/bedrock interface would be lowest in deciduous forest (HF) and highest in pasture (CP) with HF converted to silvopasture (SP) between the two. Piezometers were used to monitor water quality at the soil/bedrock interface under conventional pasture, SP, and hardwood forest. The pasture and SP were rotationally grazed by sheep during the spring to fall grazing season (2004-2008). Geometric mean fecal coliform bacteria concentrations (FC) were greatest in SP (18 FC 100 mL⁻¹) with no difference between CP (7.5 FC 100 mL⁻¹) and HF (5.6 FC 100 mL⁻¹). Mean NO₃-N concentration was lowest in SP (2.3 mg L⁻¹) and greatest in CP (4.4 mg L⁻¹) and HF (4.1 mg L⁻¹), which were not significantly different. Mean NH₄-N concentrations showed different trends with the lowest mean concentration in CP (0.5 mg L⁻¹) and the greatest in SP (2.5 mg L⁻¹) and HF (2.6 mg L⁻¹), which were not significantly different. SP was shown to be a management option in the study area that reduces nitrate leaching, but should be considered cautiously in near-stream areas and near wells where fecal bacteria pollution can be problematic. This study makes an important contribution to our knowledge about interactions between landscape management and environmental quality of the Appalachian region. A diversity of land and forage management options are needed to maximize forage and livestock productivity while protecting surface and groundwater quality of the region.";"Boyer, Douglas G.

Vegetative buffer strips (VBS) are postulated to be one management tool that can reduce VA transport to surface water resources. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate oxytetracycline (OTC) and sulfadimethoxine (SDT) sorption to agroforestry buffer, grass buffer, and cropland soils, (2) evaluate differences in VA sorption to soils collected from different vegetative management and soil series, and (3) elucidate relationships between soil properties and VA sorption. Sorption/extraction isotherms for OTC were well-fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model (r ² > 0.86). OTC was strongly adsorbed by all soils and the VA was not readily extractable. OTC and SDT solid to solution partition coefficients (K d) values are significantly greater for soils planted to VBS relative to grain crops. Significant differences in OTC and SDT K d values were also noted among the soil series studied. Linear regression analyses indicate that clay content and pH were the most important soil properties controlling OTC and SDT adsorption, respectively. Results from this study suggest that agroforestry and grass buffer strips may effectively mitigate antibiotic loss from agroecosystems, in part, due to enhanced antibiotic sorption properties.";"Chu, Bei

This study, conducted in 2005-2006, reveals how well NIPF landowners in Louisiana and Mississippi understand forest certification, willingness to pay to become certified, and general perceptions about the certification process and implementation requirements. We surveyed 1,200 randomly selected NIPF landowners from each state that owned 10 ac or more of timberland in 2005. A total of 591 usable surveys resulted in an overall adjusted response rate of 30%. Forty percent of respondents believe certification is necessary on public lands. However, their lowest level of agreement is with the need for certification on private forestlands. Respondents believe certification in the United States is driven by environmental nongovernmental organizations rather than by demand in the marketplace. Private landowner organizations and approved professional foresters are the most trusted entities to administer and monitor certification. Results also suggest that respondents are generally not averse to having certifiers monitor their forest management activities; however, a majority are unwilling to bear the cost of certification.";"Perera, P.

Effectiveness of the tax depends upon the foreign monopolist's ability to alter the price of the new technology and upon whether or not there is full enforcement of the IPRs.

"AGRIS:US201400177096";"Including CO2 implications of land occupation in LCAs—method and example for livestock products";"";"PURPOSE: Until recently, life cycle assessments (LCAs) have only addressed the direct greenhouse gas emissions along a process chain, but ignored the CO2 emissions of land-use. However, for agricultural products, these emissions can be substantial. Here, we present a new methodology for including the implications of land occupation for CO2 emissions to realistically reflect the consequences of consumers’ decisions. METHOD: In principle, one can distinguish five different approaches of addressing the CO2 consequences of land occupation: (1) assuming constant land cover, (2) land-use change related to additional production of the product under consideration, (3) historic land-use change, assuming historical relations between existing area and area expansion (4) land-use change related to less production of the product under consideration (“missed potential carbon sink” of land occupation), and (5) an approach of integrating land conversion emissions and delayed uptake due to land occupation. Approach (4) is presented in this paper, using LCA data on land occupation, and carbon dynamics from the IMAGE model. Typically, if less production occurs, agricultural land will be abandoned, leading to a carbon sink when vegetation is regrowing. This carbon sink, which does not occur if the product would still be consumed, is thus attributed to the product as “missed potential carbon sink”, to reflect the CO2 implications of land occupations. RESULTS: We analyze the missed potential carbon sink by relating land occupation data from LCA studies to the potential carbon sink as calculated by an Integrated Global Assessment Model and its process-based, spatially explicit carbon cycle model. Thereby, we account for regional differences, heterogeneity in land-use, and different time horizons. Example calculations for several livestock products show that the CO2 consequences of land occupation can be in the same order of magnitude as the other process related greenhouse gas emissions of the LCA, and depend largely on the production system. The highest CO2 implications of land occupation are calculated for beef and lamb, with beef production in Brazil having a missed potential carbon sink more than twice as high as the other GHG emissions. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significant contribution of land occupation to the total GHG balance of agricultural products, they need to be included in life cycle assessments in a realistic way. The new methodology presented here reflects the consequences of producing or not producing a certain commodity, and thereby it is suited to inform consumers fully about the consequences of their choices.";"Schmidinger, Kurt

The purpose of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of LULCC by using multi landscape metrics in the Lake Dianchi watershed, which is located in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of Southwest China. Landsat images from the years 1974, 1988, 1998, and 2008 were analyzed using geographical information system (GIS) techniques. The results reveal that land-use/land-cover has changed greatly in the watershed since 1974. This change in land use structure was embodied in the rapid increase of developed areas with a relative change rate of up to 324.4%. The increase in developed areas mainly occurred in agricultural land, especially near the shores of Lake Dianchi. The spatial pattern and structure of the change was influenced by the urban sprawl of the city of Kunming. The urban sprawl took on the typical expansion mode of cyclic structures and a jigsaw pattern and expanded to the shore of Lake Dianchi. Agricultural land changed little with respect to the structure but changed greatly in the spatial pattern. The landscape in the watershed showed a trend of fragmentation with a complex boundary. The dynamics of land-use/land-cover in the watershed correlate with land-use policies and economic development in China.";"Yaolong Zhao

The aim of this work was to assess the future implications of these processes on land use/land cover and biodiversity in northwest Iberia. To achieve our goal, we developed a virtual spatially explicit dynamic model to simulate regional socio-ecological dynamics. For the period between 1960 and 2040, we tested four different environmental scenarios ranging from small decreases in conifer forest and a stabilization of agricultural areas and shrublands to more radical shifts, substantial decreases in agricultural areas and massive expansion of eucalyptus stands. The model considers also fire, whose role increased significantly in the scenarios of expanded forests. Bird assemblages, which we used as a surrogate for biodiversity, showed complex patterns although with overall decreases in richness and abundance. Species with narrow niche and from Mediterranean open habitats were particularly sensitive to the ongoing changes simulated. Our results suggest that landscape management actions and planning assessments designed for conserving biodiversity should focus on the maintenance of the traditional agricultural mosaic combined with a regulatory legislation limiting the expansion of fast growing tree forests (e.g Eucalyptus stands). This strategy can contribute to maintaining a diversity of land use/land cover in a heterogeneous landscape and the prevention of the occurrence of large wildfires, fundamental for the implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans.";"Santos, MÃ¡rio

The goal of this study is to improve our understanding about the relationship between woody encroachment and its potential drivers by analyzing the temporal and spatial pattern of land-cover changes in the lower Omo region of southern Ethiopia. We used a combination of multi-temporal images, as well as climatic and demographic data for the analysis. Between 1985 and 2010 woody vegetation cover increased by 30.6% in the pastoral landuse type, while declining by 4.4% in the semipastoral areas. The increment was negatively associated with altitude and browser livestock density. However, contrary to the traditional presumption, it was not associated with grazer livestock density. Moreover, woody encroachment was higher in remote sites, farther from rivers and towns, where there is relatively lower human activities and livestock disturbance. The finding suggests the ecological significance of landuse type and livestock browsing to regulate the dynamics of woody vegetation in disturbance-adapted rangelands. Thus, a careful introduction of native larger browsers into woody encroached pastoral areas may help to facilitate rapid ecosystem recovery.";"Belay, T.A.

"AGRIS:BY2016000150";"On diagnostics of peat soils of different evolution stages";"О диагностике торфяных почв разных стадий эволюции";"In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there were presented research results of the study with the aim to offer a number of new criteria for quantitative diagnostics degraded peat soils, which were the result of a study of chemical and biological properties of peat soils of different stages of evolution. Based on established patterns of the variation of the ratio C:N, biological activity and the energy potential of the content of organic matter in peat soils, it is concluded that for the separation of agropeat soil and degropeat one threshold content of organic matter in the upper peat-mineral horizon should be considered as 35%. Using established patterns of the degree variation of these indicators parameters in different stages evolution peat soils proposed criteria for diagnosis. For the more efficient use of the anthropogenic-transformed peat soils it is necessary to have qualitative criteria and quantitative parameters of each stage of evolution. The main criterion for determining the properties of these soils is the content and quality of organic matter. The other properties of peat soils are in close connection with it: ash, density, moisture content, the ratio QN, nitrogen mobility fund, biological activity and energy potential. In this case, the dependence of the parameters of the last four indicators on the content of organic matter in soils is curvilinear in nature.";"Semenenko, N.N.

"AGRIS:FR2014003127";"Can family farms be considered as institutions?";"Les exploitations agricoles familiales sont-elles des institutions ?";"Faced with a changing economic environment (poor functioning of the groundnut sector, economic liberalization, etc.), rural households seek first and foremost to secure food for their families by diversifying their production and their economic activities in the village and in urban centres through temporary migration. In this context, the farm seen as an institution cannot be considered as a company in the sense of the classical economic theory. It corresponds more to a system of activities whose operation takes into account both market and family objectives. After looking at the concept of institution and its application to the family farm, this paper highlights the changes that have taken place in groundnut farms in terms of social organisation and operation. In addition, envisaging the family farm as an institution, the authors show how the coordination pattern has evolved within the farm and the family as a whole.

Face aux changements de l’environnement économique (dysfonctionnement de la filière arachide, désengagement de l’État, etc.), les ménages ruraux recherchent avant tout la sécurité alimentaire de leur famille en diversifiant leurs productions et leurs activités économiques au village et dans les centres urbains grâce à la migration temporaire. Dans ce contexte, l’exploitation agricole, vue comme une institution, ne peut pas être considérée comme une entreprise, au sens de la théorie économique classique. Elle correspond plus à un système d’activités dont le fonctionnement tient compte des logiques marchandes et familiales. Après un éclairage sur le concept d’institution et son application à l’exploitation agricole familiale, nous préciserons les changements survenus dans les exploitations du Bassin arachidier en termes d’organisation sociale et de fonctionnement. Ensuite,  en considérant l’exploitation agricole comme une institution, nous montrerons comment la nature des formes de coordination a évolué au sein de l’exploitation et de la famille élargie.";"Chia , Eduardo

This paper focuses on the linkages between an invasion of bracken fern and land use decisions in an agricultural frontier in southern Mexico. Agriculture in this region is practiced on an extensive basis, using traditional slash-and-burn techniques of temporary cultivation and continuous rotation through forest fallow. We investigate the factors that affect the decision of a subsistence farmer to either continue cultivating an invaded agricultural plot or permanently abandon the plot and cultivate elsewhere. We develop an agricultural household model of land use choices, where households maximize utility subject to constraints on land, labor, and income. We subsequently test the hypotheses raised, using data from a small household survey performed in the region in 2002.";"Schneider, Laura

In evaluating timber demand, the significant contributing factors like forest land cover, frequency of furniture manufacturing, price of timber substitute, population growth and railway density have been examined. Panel data over a longer period for a developing country like Bangladesh were not easily available. The data sources were very sporadic for the study — there was no common data pool. A panel dataset over a 17-year period was simulated and analyzed for the study. Increase of railway density and population growth rate have been identified as factors having highest leverage on pulling up the demand for country's timber resources. Although social forestry programs are playing a positive role in timber supply, it cannot keep pace with the increasing demand for timber for a vast population of over 150 million. Social forestry programs should be strengthened further, and concurrently, population growth rate needs to be checked to bridge the gap between demand and supply of timber in Bangladesh.

It is especially important that the renewable sources of energy available to us might play a decisive role in the uprise of the Hungarian countryside, as green energy production might be profitable even in areas where the land is less suitable for agriculture. There is a hot sea beneath 40% of the territory of the country. Energy derived from this sea could be used to attain various local and national goals. Utilising solar energy on a local scale is an opportunity to earn extra income, and opportunity which exists even in the most underprivileged villages and micro-regions.The national renewable energy strategy developed by the author would allow Hungary to cover 38.2% of its then 1300 PJ of energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030.

"AGRIS:US201600184824";"Fish Influences on Amphibian Presence and Abundance in Prairie and Parkland Landscapes of Minnesota, USA";"";"Many amphibian populations are declining, and increased understanding of the drivers of amphibian presence and abundance will help in their conservation. In 2005 and 2006 we estimated relative abundance of larvae of two common amphibian taxa, Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) and ranid tadpoles (Northern Leopard Frog Lithobates pipiens and Wood Frog Lithobates sylvaticus), in 75 shallow lakes in prairie and parkland areas in Minnesota. We used a two-step procedure in which we first modeled presence-absence with data from all lakes and then modeled abundance only in lakes where the amphibian taxa were present. For the two amphibian taxa, a generalized linear mixed effects model was used to examine the effects of dynamic factors like fish abundance and static (timeframe of study) variables like fish community type, depth, and adjacent land cover. Fish variables had the greatest influence but differed for the presence and abundance models. Salamander and tadpole presence was inversely correlated to the abundance of benthivorous fish, while salamander abundance was best explained by total fish abundance and tadpole abundance by fish community type. We did not detect influences of land cover types on the amphibian taxa we surveyed. Our findings are important because they complement previous studies documenting that negative correlations with fish extend beyond piscivores to include both planktivores and benthivores. Hydrological changes in our study landscape (e.g., installation of drainage networks, wetland consolidation) associated with agriculture and other land uses have likely increased the distribution and abundance of fish populations, thus dampening amphibian breeding success.";"Herwig, Brian R.

"AGRIS:US201301953339";"Large herbivores may alter vegetation structure of semi-arid savannas through soil nutrient mediation";"";"In savannas, the tree-grass balance is governed by water, nutrients, fire and herbivory, and their interactions. We studied the hypothesis that herbivores indirectly affect vegetation structure by changing the availability of soil nutrients, which, in turn, alters the competition between trees and grasses. Nine abandoned livestock holding-pen areas (kraals), enriched by dung and urine, were contrasted with nearby control sites in a semi-arid savanna. About 40 years after abandonment, kraal sites still showed high soil concentrations of inorganic N, extractable P, K, Ca and Mg compared to controls. Kraals also had a high plant production potential and offered high quality forage. The intense grazing and high herbivore dung and urine deposition rates in kraals fit the accelerated nutrient cycling model described for fertile systems elsewhere. Data of a concurrent experiment also showed that bush-cleared patches resulted in an increase in impala dung deposition, probably because impala preferred open sites to avoid predation. Kraal sites had very low tree densities compared to control sites, thus the high impala dung deposition rates here may be in part driven by the open structure of kraal sites, which may explain the persistence of nutrients in kraals. Experiments indicated that tree seedlings were increasingly constrained when competing with grasses under fertile conditions, which might explain the low tree recruitment observed in kraals. In conclusion, large herbivores may indirectly keep existing nutrient hotspots such as abandoned kraals structurally open by maintaining a high local soil fertility, which, in turn, constrains woody recruitment in a negative feedback loop. The maintenance of nutrient hotspots such as abandoned kraals by herbivores contributes to the structural heterogeneity of nutrient-poor savanna vegetation.";"van der Waal, Cornelis

This proposed approach transfers the responsibility of wildland-urban interface administration to the local community, giving them control in reducing their risks of property damage. A combination of community forest management using local labour and bioenergy power generation mitigates the cost of forest treatment, reduces the local cost of energy and revitalizes the community. The proposed solution achieves sustainable land management practices, sustainable ecology, sustainable energy production, and provides enhanced cost-benefits to the community. More important, it provides simultaneously renewable heat, transportation and power to the community using local labour and without reliance on external aspects beyond community control. This study proposes a viable method based on the installation of an appropriately sized combined heat and power bioenergy system. A remote off-grid community is modeled and simulated using three different small-scale bioenergy systems and two operating scenarios by way of example.";"Yablecki, Jessica

Here, we addressed under a same land cover the potential effect of the edaphic parameters on the soil bacterial communities, excluding potential confounding factors as climate. To do this, we characterized two natural soil sequences occurring in the Montiers experimental site. Spatially distant soil samples were collected below Fagus sylvatica tree stands to assess the effect of soil sequences on the edaphic parameters, as well as the structure and diversity of the bacterial communities. Soil analyses revealed that the two soil sequences were characterized by higher pH and calcium and magnesium contents in the lower plots. Metabolic assays based on Biolog Ecoplates highlighted higher intensity and richness in usable carbon substrates in the lower plots than in the middle and upper plots, although no significant differences occurred in the abundance of bacterial and fungal communities along the soil sequences as assessed using quantitative PCR. Pyrosequencing analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicons revealed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundantly represented phyla. Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria and Chlamydiae were significantly enriched in the most acidic and nutrient-poor soils compared to the Bacteroidetes, which were significantly enriched in the soils presenting the higher pH and nutrient contents. Interestingly, aluminium, nitrogen, calcium, nutrient availability and pH appeared to be the best predictors of the bacterial community structures along the soil sequences.";"Jeanbille, M.

However, quantification of landscape change from vegetation development and disturbance effects is difficult because of the large space and long time scales involved. Comparative simulation modeling experiments, using a suite of models to simulate a set of scenarios, can provide a platform for investigating landscape change over more ecologically appropriate time and space scales that control vegetation and disturbance. We implemented a multifactorial simulation experiment using five landscape fire succession models to explore the role of fire and vegetation development under various climates on a neutral landscape. The simulation experiment had four factors with two or three treatments each: (1) fire (fire and no fire), (2) succession (dynamic and static succession), (3) climate (historical, warm-wet, warm-dry), and (4) weather (constant, variable). We found that, under historical climates, succession changed more area annually than fire by factors of 1.2 to 34, but one model simulated more landscape change from fire (factor of 0.1). However, we also found that fire becomes more important in warmer future climates with factors decreasing to below zero for most models. We also found that there were few differences in simulation results between weather scenarios with low or high variability. Results from this study show that there will be a shift from vegetation processes that control today's landscape dynamics to fire processes under future warmer and drier climates, and this shift means that detailed representations of both succession and fire should be incorporated into models to realistically simulate interactions between disturbance and vegetation.";"Keane, Robert E.

Besides being crucial refugia for native fish, amphibians, snails, and plants, ciénegas constitute critical habitat for migratory birds. Here we analyze the distribution, conservation status and restoration potential of ciénegas in this region. Our results identified 97 ciénegas of which only 60 had information useful for our analysis. Of these, 46 ciénegas were considered functional, or extant, while the others were either dry or so altered that they no longer maintained their original ecological function. Using the ranking scheme of the National Gap Analysis Program we found that 80% of extant ciénegas fall into the lowest categories of land stewardship, Gap 3 or 4, indicating conservation stewardship is largely lacking across all land management agencies, public or private.

O presente trabalho teve como objetivo adaptar o sistema MicroLEIS - Land Evaluation Information System de origem espanhola, às condições do sudeste brasileiro; para tanto, foram consideradas 12 variáveis, discriminadas a seguir: A - Fator Relevo: 1) Declividade; B - Fator Solo: 2) Profundidade Útil; 3) Tipo de Textura; 4) Pedregosidade e/ou Afloramento; 5) Tipo de Drenagem; 6) Salinidade Total; C - Fator Risco à Erosão: 7) Erodibilidade; 8) Declividade; 9) Densidade da Vegetação; 10) Erosividade da Chuva; D - Fator Deficiência Bioclimática: 11) Risco de Geadas e 12) Água Disponível. Para estas variáveis, foram modificados os parâmetros de controle, de acordo com as condições dos solos paulistas, sendo que Salinidade Total foi trocada por Acidez (pH); em seguida, o SIAT foi interfaceado com um SIG - Sistema de Informação Geográfica - no caso o IDRISI, para facilitar a entrada, o processamento e a espacialização dos resultados. A estrutura do programa também foi modificada, de maneira que a linguagem de programação passou de Basic para C, além de receber um banco de dados (Clipper) e rotinas para tornar o programa mais amigável.

The site-specific nature of numerous agri-environmental issues necessitates analysis ata disaggregated level in order to capture the underlying heterogeneity of agricultural productivity and environmentalsensitivity across different parcels of land. This study adopts an integrated approach—a decision-making economicmodel for representative farms is combined with a stylized site-specific biophysical model, which quantifies theimpact of different policy instruments on agricultural production practices and on multiple environmental effects.This model estimates the government budget outlays and social welfare, which require monetary valuation ofenvironmental effects as well as of crop production. In addition to several agri-environmental policy scenarios, thisstudy investigates the impact of the rice production adjustment policy, wherein a rice production quota is allocated toeach region on the basis of the sales records for the previous two years. According to the simulation results, there isgreater increase in social welfare when farmers are paid in order to reduce chemical fertilizer applications rather thanby levying a nitrogen tax. Regarding carbon sequestration, the modelling exercise indicates that an agrienvironmentalpayment depending on the level of application of organic fertilizer (manure) is preferable; however,the social welfare derived by payments on the basis of the application of a minimum organic matter, which may avoidincreasing the fiscal budget burden (on account of the increased application of organic matter on paddy fields), ishigher than that derived by unit payments depending on the level of application of organic matter. The relaxation ofthe rice production quota results in an increase in social welfare. This integrated model approach is subject tolimitations with respect to the data, model parameters, as well as economic and biophysical relationships. However,this approach is a valuable tool for enabling policy makers to design and implement effective and efficient policies.";"Sasaki, Hiroki";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"JPN";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016209330";"http://purl.umn.edu/109399";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:PL2009A00085";"Impact of land-use and land-cover change on groundwater quality in the Lower Shiwalik hills: a remote sensing and GIS based approach";"";"Human activities have exerted small to large scale changes on the hydrological cycle. The current scenario regarding groundwater resources suggests that globally there is a water crisis in terms of quantity (availability) and quality. Therefore there is a great need for the assessment and monitoring of quality and quantity of groundwater resources at local level. This paper presents a case study of the lower Shiwalik hills, in Rupnagar, Punjab, India, to trace land-use and land-cover changes during the past 17 years, with an emphasis on groundwater quality and quantity. This study was performed in alluvial and hilly terrain. The results show that the quantity of groundwater increased with the help of natural and artificial recharge due to change in land-use and land-cover pattern (increased area of fallow land). The quality of groundwater deteriorated due to input of fertilizers for enhancing the short-term soil fertility. Using a Remote Sensing and GIS based approach, we show the final results in map form. In particular we highlight a potential groundwater exploration site, which could be useful for district level planning. Our research shows that the change in land-use and land-cover affects the quantity and quality of groundwater.";"Singh, Sudhir (Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Science, Nehru Science Centre, University of Allahabad, Allahabad-211002 Uttar Pradesh, India)

A large number of national and international initiatives lately experienced rapid development in the view of the biofuels and bioenergy targets announced in the European Union, United States and other countries worldwide. The main certification initiatives are analysed in detail, including certification schemes for crops used as feedstock for biofuels, the various initiatives in the European Union, United States and globally, to cover biofuels and/or biofuels production and use. Finally, the possible way forward for biofuel certification is discussed. Certification has the potential to influence positively direct environmental and social impact of bioenergy production. Key recommendations to ensure sustainability of biofuels/bioenergy through certification include the need of an international approach and further harmonisation, combined with additional measures for global monitoring and control. The effects of biofuels/bioenergy production on indirect land use change (ILUC) is still very uncertain; addressing the unwanted ILUC requires sustainable land use planning and adequate monitoring tools such as remote sensing, regardless of the end-use of the product.";"Scarlat, Nicolae

"AGRIS:US201500082836";"Multi-scale ecology of woodland bat the role of species pool, landscape complexity and stand structure";"";"Fragmentation of forest landscapes and structural degradation of woodlands have a holistic negative effect on biodiversity. Bats are considered as indicators of woodland’s structural quality. However, as bats commute long distances on a nightly basis, their diversity should also be limited by large-scale drivers such as landscape and species availability in the region. Therefore we examined roles of the local species pool, landscape structure and habitat properties on species richness of bats through three spatial scales with emphasis on top–down relationships. Our aim for conservation ecology was to evaluate habitat quality and the importance of stand origin, i.e. contrast between mature forests and old parks. Bats were surveyed in 28 landscape windows, which consisted of at least one park and forest site. In total we sampled 63 deciduous woodlands in Estonia. In each site we sampled two microhabitats: edge and stand interior. Bat species richness was mostly explained by large-scale drivers, such as local species pool and landscape composition within 1 km radius. Stand properties had a weaker effect, driven by understory clutter. At the finest scale, the importance of edge habitats was emphasized by greater species richness at the edge in comparison to the stand interior and the edge’s predictive power on species richness in the stand interior. Habitat origin (park vs. forest) was an important aspect only for small-scale species richness, specifically in woodland interiors. The conservation policy of woodland bats should be based on complex multi-scale planning, in which natural and anthropogenic woodlands can be considered as a single land-cover type. To provide optimal foraging habitat for bats, the forest landscape should be diversified with integrated small waterbodies and canopy gaps with sharp edges.";"Kalda, Rauno

"AGRIS:US201301644375";"Livestock and water: understanding the context based on the 'Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture'";"";"The recently completed 'Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture' (CA) assessed the benefits, costs and impacts of the past 50 years of water development. It highlighted important trends that frame the challenges in water resources management of today and into the future, and critically evaluated solutions that people have developed to cope with these challenges. Important past trends include increases in food production that have outpaced population growth, much of this due to a doubling of the global irrigated area between 1961 and 2003, and accompanying declines in the health of aquatic ecosystems resulting from demands for, and impacts of, water use in agriculture. The future will bring new pressures on water resources and ecosystems as demands from sectors other than agriculture increase (including water for biofuel production), populations rise and become more wealthy, which leads to demand for foods that are more water intensive to produce, and climate change increases uncertainty and risk in our agricultural systems. Modelling predictions and analysis of scenarios show that water demand may rise from between only 20 up to 90% over the next 50 years, depending on how we choose to manage water in agricultural systems in the future. Owing to the importance of meat in changing diets and the role of livestock in managing land degradation, livestock is central to many of the issues that will determine whether or not optimistic scenarios (minimised increased demand for agricultural water in the future) can be achieved. This paper briefly summarises the insights and results of the CA, and highlights the areas where livestock management is most closely related to major water challenges and global recommendations of the CA. The purpose of this introductory paper is to set the context within which the importance of enhancing livestock water productivity in mixed farming systems can be appreciated.";"Bossio, Deborah";"";"CSIRO Publishing";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"water management;land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301644375";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ09001";"";"";"";"179-186"
"AGRIS:US201500015953";"evil of sluits: A re-assessment of soil erosion in the Karoo of South Africa as portrayed in century-old sources";"";"Deep, linear gullies are a common feature of the present landscape of the Karoo of South Africa, where they were known locally in the early twentieth century as ‘sluits’. Recent research has shown that many of these features are now stable and are no longer significant sediment sources, although they are efficient connectors in the landscape. Because most of the gully networks predate the first aerial photographs, little is known in the scientific literature about the timing of their formation. One secondary source, however, throws interesting light on the origin of these features, and the early response by landowners to their rehabilitation. The Agricultural Journal of the Cape of Good Hope at the turn of the Twentieth Century carried a number of articles by farmers and agricultural officers concerning the “evil of sluits”. The authors gave accounts of widespread incision of valley bottoms by deep, wide gullies. Many of these gullies had been in existence for some thirty years but apparently had formed within living memory. A number of attempts to prevent further erosion had been put in place at the time of writing. This paper presents a review of land degradation, specifically gully erosion, and rehabilitation recommendations as given by authors writing in this journal. It reflects on the findings in the context of assessing land degradation processes through the local knowledge portrayed in the journal.";"Rowntree, K.M.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land degradation;landowners;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500015953";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.08.041";"";"";"";"98-105"

Of particular interest are the following:· National environmental protection policy· Strategy for poverty reduction and accelerated growth· National strategy for irrigation developmentThe institutions responsible for implementing these policies are handicapped by lack of skilled and experienced personnel, uncertainty, and financial constraints.  All of these problems must be urgently dealt with.  Inappropriate land law and weakened traditional management regimes also make it particularly difficult to solve the numerous land conflicts that arise.

The protective measures in these zones often clash with local interests in agriculture. Scenarios were used to evaluate the development of a groundwater protection zone in a farming area. Stakeholders are accorded strong influence on the scenarios. Scenario inputs comprised land cover, land use and farmers' plans and preferences, as registered in interviews with farmers. Scenarios were evaluated regarding the effect on nitrate leaching, extent of pesticide-free area and farm income. The scenarios proved effective in modelling coupled development in land use/land cover and nitrate leaching and pesticide-free area. Voluntary commitment to schemes, calculated according to stakeholder preferences, reduced nitrate leaching by up to 15%. Scenarios with additional inputs from experts who formulated more comprehensive landscape projects reduced the present loss by up to 30%. In both cases, the pesticide free areas were doubled. In general, the bottom-up approaches had a lesser effect on reducing nitrogen losses than did the top-down approaches.";"Vejre, Henrik

This study carried out in parts of the coast of southwestern Nigeria utilized topographic base maps and two-time Landsat TM imageries to assess the trend in land cover changes and ecosystems degradation for the three time periods 1965, 1986 and 2001. Remote sensing, geographic information systems and landscape pattern analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. The focus of the analysis was on land cover change, land degradation, and changes in landscape pattern resulting from interplay of natural and anthropogenic drivers. The results show increased trend in human-induced land cover change with concomitant severe negative impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods. About 98,000ha (30% of the area) was seriously degraded as at 2001. About 33,000ha (10%) was under permanent saline water inundation with about 21 communities already dislocated. Loss of fragile ecosystems including marshland (from 7.7% in 1965 to 1% in 2001) and mangrove (from 14.6% in 1965 to 3.1% in 2001) was intense, while over 300 ponds/small lakes which are important for the local fishing economy have disappeared. About eighteen communities were also dislocated by erosion in a section around the southeastern parts of the coastline. Landscape metrics generated, suggested increased ecosystems perturbation and landscape fragmentation. The paper also discussed the implications of these rapid changes for ecosystems stability, food security and sustainable rural livelihoods in the area.";"Fasona, Mayowa

The temporal dynamics and profile variability of soil moisture in relation to land cover combinations were studied along five slopes transect on the Loess Plateau during the rainy season of 2011. Within the 3 months of the growing season coupled with the rainy season, all of the soil moisture was replenished in the area, proving that a type stability exists between different land cover soil moisture levels. Land cover combinations disturbed the trend determined by topography and increased soil moisture variability in space and time. The stability of soil moisture resulting from the dynamic processes could produce stable patterns on the slopes. The relationships between the mean soil moisture and vertical standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) were more complex, largely due to the fact that different land cover types had distinctive vertical patterns of soil moisture. The spatial SD of each layer had a positive correlation and the spatial CV exhibited a negative correlation with the increase in mean soil moisture. The soil moisture stability implies that sampling comparisons in this area can be conducted at different times to accurately compare different land use types.";"Wang, Shuai

An efficient and accurate method of generating landslide susceptibility maps is very important to mitigate the loss of lives and properties caused by these landslides. This paper presents landslide susceptibility mapping on the Zigui-Badong of the Three Gorges, using rough sets and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs). Landslide locations were obtained from a landslide inventory map, supported by field surveys. Twenty-two landslide-related factors were extracted from the 1:10,000-scale topographic maps, 1:50,000-scale geological maps, Landsat ETM� +� satellite images with a spatial resolution of 28.5� m, and HJ-A satellite images with a spatial resolution of 30� m. Twelve key environmental factors were selected as independent variables using the rough set and correlation coefficient analysis, including elevation, slope, profile curvature, catchment aspect, catchment height, distance from drainage, engineering rock group, distance from faults, slope structure, land cover, topographic wetness index, and normalized difference vegetation index. The initial, three-layered, and four-layered BPNN were trained and then used to map landslide susceptibility, respectively. To evaluate the models, the susceptibility maps were validated by comparing with the existing landslide locations according to the area under the curve. The four-layered BPNN outperforms the other two models with the best accuracy of 91.53� %. Approximately 91.37� % of landslides were classified as high and very high landslide-prone areas. The validation results show sufficient agreement between the obtained susceptibility maps and the existing landslide locations.";"Wu, Xueling

Results indicate large conflicts and differences between land use planning based on natural condition evaluation and social needs. For sustainable soil and water resource use, land areas with moderate to high land use potential value can only be released for human activities if adequate soil and water conservation practices are maintained.

Herbaceous standing biomass onsite increased in the course of succession to peak at twice offsite levels within two decades. Biomass remained elevated for six decades then dropped to the background levels at the limit of sampling distance. Plant species richness onsite increased rapidly in the course of succession, then stabilized on older bomas. Species composition changed throughout succession, with pioneer herbs and grasses giving way to boma-edge species and woody vegetation later in succession. Soil nutrients, including carbon, nitrogen, magnesium and phosphorus, were highly elevated on abandoned settlements. The various nutrients declined at different rates during the course of plant succession. Potassium, phosphorus and magnesium levels remained at twice offsite levels for over a century, creating islands of high fertility and high plant biomass in the savanna landscape. We conclude that the perturbation caused by shifting nomadic settlements creates localized nutrient and plant diversity hotspots in savanna ecosystems that remain distinct from the surrounding savanna for decades, possibly centuries.";"Muchiru, A.N.

"AGRIS:US201600188514";"Incentives and Community Participation in the Governance of Community Forests in Nepal";"";"Increased participation of local users in decision-making about forests and gaining benefits from these forests are major goals of the community forestry program in Nepal. However, there is a lack of real participation in community forest governance amongst users, particularly by poor and marginalised members. By employing a mixed-method approach, this research explores the issue of participation in the governance of community forests, and in particular the role of incentives in increasing participation. A partial least square approach is undertaken to link the participation indicators to the various incentives. Access to benefits, enforcement of legal property rights and social cohesion through building of local institutions are identified as the key influential incentives that determine the effective participation of users in community forest governance. Other incentiveâincluding income supplements, community infrastructure development or payment for environment servicesâare insufficient to counter the opportunity cost of participation, and hence have a weak but still significant influence on usersâ decisions to participate. Power inequality due to socio-cultural norms, together with poor economic capabilities and weak bargaining power, could undermine the meaningful participation of poor and disadvantaged groups in the governance of community forests, unless the community forestry institutions are strengthened in order to be able to deal with the issues of inequitable access and restricted opportunities at the local level.";"Adhikari, Sunit

"AGRIS:US201400018100";"Desertification and livestock grazing: The roles of sedentarization, mobility and rest";"";"Pastoralism is an ancient form of self-provisioning that is still in wide use today throughout the world. While many pastoral regions are the focus of current desertification studies, the long history of sustainability evidenced by these cultures is of great interest. Numerous studies suggesting a general trend of desertification intimate degradation is a recent phenomenon principally attributable to changes in land tenure, management, and treatment. This paper explores the suggested causes of land degradation and identifies the land management and grazing treatments shared by many pastoral cultures. The singular commonality found in nearly all studies of degradation is the prevalence of partial or total rest. While historical observations rightly suggest that desertification is the result of both climatic and anthropic factors, recent focus has been placed upon the effect of sedentarisation. This paper attempts to coalesce these two streams of thinking with particular focus upon inclusive planning processes which may improve arid and semiarid rangeland ecosystems using livestock as a solution to the problem of land degradation.";"Weber, Keith T

"AGRIS:US201400158991";"Regime shift on the roof of the world: Alpine meadows converting to shrublands in the southern Himalayas";"";"Worldwide, changing climates and land use practices are escalating woody-plants encroachment into grasslands, reducing biodiversity and altering ecosystem functions. The loss of alpine grasslands is a major conservation concern as they harbor many rare and endemic species. Alpine meadows in Northwest Yunnan, China, represent a global biodiversity hotspot with high species richness, beta diversity, and endemism. Shrubs have expanded greatly in the region and threaten alpine meadow biodiversity. To measure rates of meadow loss due to shrub encroachment and identify its mechanisms, we reconstructed alpine land cover, climate, and land use change from 1950 to 2009 across Northwest Yunnan using satellite data, ground surveys, and interviews. Between 1990 and 2009, at least 39% of the alpine meadows converted to woody shrubs. The patterns of change suggest that a regime shift is occurring. Despite multiple perturbations to the climate and land use systems starting in the 1950s, alpine meadows remained resilient to shrub expansion until the late 1980s. Shrublands rapidly expanded then due to feedback mechanisms involving climate, woody cover, and grazing. Fire may no longer be an effective tool for controlling shrub expansion. This regime shift threatens both endemic meadow biodiversity and local livelihoods. More generally, these trends serve as a warning sign for the greater Himalayan region where similar vegetation changes could greatly affect livelihoods, hydrology, and climate.";"Brandt, Jodi S.

"AGRIS:US201400033665";"feature extraction software tool for agricultural object-based image analysis";"";"A software application for automatic descriptive feature extraction from image-objects, FETEX 2.0, is presented and described in this paper. The input data include a multispectral high resolution digital image and a vector file in shapefile format containing the polygons or objects, usually extracted from a geospatial database. The design of the available descriptive features or attributes has been mainly focused on the description of agricultural parcels, providing a variety of information: spectral information from the different image bands; textural descriptors of the distribution of the intensity values based on the grey level co-occurrence matrix, the wavelet transform and a factor of edgeness; structural features describing the spatial arrangement of the elements inside the objects, based on the semivariogram curve and the Hough transform; and several descriptors of the object shape. The output file is a table that can be produced in four alternative formats, containing a vector of features for every object processed. This table of numeric values describing the objects from different points of view can be externally used as input data for any classification software. Additionally, several types of graphs and images describing the feature extraction procedure are produced, useful for interpretation and understanding the process. A test of the processing times is included, as well as an application of the program in a real parcel-based classification problem, providing some results and analyzing the applicability, the future improvement of the methodologies, and the use of additional types of data sets. This software is intended to be a dynamic tool, integrating further data and feature extraction algorithms for the progressive improvement of land use/land cover database classification and agricultural database updating processes.";"Ruiz, L.A.

"AGRIS:US201400035499";"Predicting regional rice production in South Korea using spatial data and crop-growth modeling";"";"It is well recognized that aggregation of the inhomogeneous data for soils, management, and weather within a land unit for crop simulation plays a key role in the scaling-up task of crop simulation at regional scales. While the other spatial data could be obtained at a desired level, weather data might not be available in mountainous regions where the production system is comprised of many small farms. This study was carried out to develop a scaling-up scheme of a plot-based crop model to an area-based rice production forecasting system suitable for the Korean situation, with an emphasis on the weather data preparation. Daily meteorological surfaces on a 1 × 1 km grid spacing were generated by spatial interpolation of 63 point observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration network. Potential effects of elevation on daily temperature were implemented by applying a seasonal lapse rate function developed for the terrain. A land cover classification scheme based on a satellite data analysis was used to identify those pixels corresponding to paddy rice fields, and an empirically determined land cover effect (cooling) was applied to those pixels to obtain the final temperature surface over rice paddies. The rice paddy pixels falling within a given cultivation zone units (CZU) were extracted from the temperature surface to calculate the average weather representing that CZU. The other weather variables were interpolated by an inverse distance weighting. By this procedure, the spatially explicit climatic data set for crop simulation (daily maximum/minimum temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation) was prepared for 1455 CZU's making up the coterminous South Korea. Soil characteristics and management information representing each CZU were available from the Rural Development Administration of Korea. CERES-rice, a rice crop growth simulation model, was calibrated to have genetic characteristics pertinent to domestic cultivars in Korea. The model was run to predict rice production of 162 crop-reporting districts for the 3 years (1997-1999) during which official production statistics are available. The simulation was done with the past weather data as of September 15 each year, which is about a month earlier than the actual harvest date. Simulated yields of the 1455 CZUs were aggregated into the corresponding 162 crop reporting districts by acreage-weighted summation, and compared with the reported yield and production. Forecast yields were less sensitive to the inter-annual climate variation than the reported yields, and there was a relatively weak correlation between the forecast and the reported yields. Projected production of rice for each crop- reporting district, which is the product of yield and acreage, was close to the reported production with the r2 values over 0.97 in all 3 years.";"Yun, Jin I.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land cover;rural development";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"KOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400035499";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-521X(02)00084-7";"";"";"";"23-38"
"AGRIS:US201600059879";"Spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation start of season across the island of Ireland using the MERIS Global Vegetation Index";"";"Spring phenophases such as the beginning of leaf unfolding, measured in the Irish gardens of the International Phenological Garden (IPG) network, indicate an earlier spring occurrence hence a longer growing season. However, these measurements are limited to selected species of trees at a few point locations in the southern half of the country. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology, based on satellite remote sensing, to measure the vegetation start of season (SOS) across the whole island of Ireland on an annual basis, complementary to existing ground-based methods. The SOS metric was extracted for each year in a 7-year time series of 10-day composited, 1.2km reduced resolution MERIS Global Vegetation Index (MGVI) data from 2003 to 2009, based on curve fitting, using the time series analysis software, TIMESAT. Spatio-temporal variability in the SOS was detected across the island on an annual basis and highlighted in a series of anomaly images showing variation from the 7-year mean SOS. The 2006 SOS was late across the island while there were strong geographical gradients to the SOS anomalies in 2009 when it occurred later in the south and earlier in the north. There was a mix of early and late anomaly values throughout the country in the other years. Qualitatively, the spatial patterns in the timing of the SOS were related to the distribution of landcover types as indicated by the CORINE Land Cover map (CLC). Three statistically separable groups of CLC classes were derived from differences in the SOS, namely agricultural and forest land cover types, peat bogs, and natural and semi-natural vegetation types. These groups demonstrated that vegetation in cultivated areas like pastures has a significantly earlier SOS than in areas of unmanaged vegetation such as peat bogs. An initial climate analysis indicated that an anomalously cold winter and spring in 2005/2006 delayed the 2006 SOS countrywide; while a cold winter followed by a mild spring in 2009 caused considerable spatial variability in the 2009 SOS across the country, ranging from later SOS in the south to early SOS in the north. This study has demonstrated the utility of 10-day MGVI composites for derivation of an SOS metric which can be used as an indicator of spatial variability in vegetation seasonality and has highlighted how SOS varies according to landcover type. The availability of longer time series in the future will allow more focused studies on the sensitivity of the SOS metric to changes in climate as well as short term weather events.";"O’Connor, Brian

"AGRIS:US201400105297";"Comparison of statistical prediction methods for characterizing the spatial variability of apparent electrical conductivity in coastal salt-affected farmland";"";"Soil salinity has been known to be problematic to land productivity and environment in the lower Yellow River Delta due to the presence of a shallow, saline water table and marine sediments. Spatial information on soil salinity has gained increasing importance for the demand of management and sustainable utilization of arable land in this area. Apparent electrical conductivity, as measured by electromagnetic induction instrument in a fairly quick manner, has succeeded in mapping soil salinity and many other soil physical and chemical properties from field to regional scales. This was done based on the correlation that existed between apparent electrical conductivity and many other soil properties. In this paper, four spatial prediction methods, i.e., local polynomial, inverse distance weighed, ordinary kriging and universal kriging, were employed to estimate field-scale apparent electrical conductivity with the aid of an electromagnetic induction instrument (type EM38). The spatial patterns estimated by the four methods using EM38 survey datasets of various sample sizes were compared with those generated by each method using the entire sample size. Spatial similarity was evaluated using difference index (DI) between the maps created using various sample sizes (i.e., target maps) and the maps generated with the entire sample size (i.e., the reference map). The results indicated that universal kriging had the best performance owing to the inclusion of residuals and spatial detrending in the kriging system. DI showed that spatial similarity between the target and reference maps of apparent electrical conductivity decreased with the reduction in sample size for each prediction method. Under the same reduction in sample size, the method retaining the most spatial similarity was universal kriging, followed by ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighed, and local polynomial. Approximately, 70� % of total survey data essentially met the need for retaining 90� % details of the reference map for universal kriging and ordinary kriging methods. This conclusion was that OK and UK were two most appropriate methods for spatial estimation of apparent electrical conductivity as they were robust with the reduction in sample size.";"Yao, R. J.

"AGRIS:US201600059871";"Improving classification accuracy of airborne LiDAR intensity data by geometric calibration and radiometric correction";"";"Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are used to measure the range (distance from the sensor to the target) and the intensity data (the backscattered energy from the target). LiDAR has been used extensively to model the topography of the Earth surface. Nowadays, LiDAR systems operating in the near-infrared spectral range are also gaining high interest for land cover classification and object recognition. LiDAR system requires geometric calibration (GC) and radiometric correction (RC) in order to maximize the benefit from the collected LiDAR data. This paper evaluates the impact of the GC and the RC of the LiDAR data on land cover classification. The procedure includes the use of a quasi-rigorous method for the GC and the radar (range) equation for the RC of the LiDAR data. The geometric calibration procedure is used to adjust the coordinates of the point cloud by removing the impact of biases in the system parameters as well as deriving corrected ranges and scan angles (in the absence of the system’s raw measurements) for the RC process. The geometrically calibrated ranges and scan angles are then used to correct the intensity data from the atmospheric attenuation and background backscattering based on the radar (range) equation. The atmospheric attenuation, which has not been fully addressed in the previous literature, is modeled by considering the parameters of absorption as well as scattering derived from existing empirical models and public (free) molecular absorption database. A LiDAR dataset covering an urban area is used to evaluate the effect of the GC and RC of the LiDAR data on land cover classification. The results are evaluated using a true ortho-rectified aerial image acquired during the same flight mission. The classification results show an accuracy improvement of about 9.4–12.8% for the LiDAR data used after the GC and RC. The study provides a practical approach for the LiDAR system GC and RC which can be implemented by most of the data end users. The outcome from this research work is a data processing tool that maximizes the benefits of using the intensity data for object recognition and land cover classification, which will be quite important for LiDAR data users.";"Yan, Wai Yeung

In addition to discrete land cover transitions across the study region, patterns of agricultural intensification, urban expansion and afforestation in protected areas have enacted changes to the seasonal patterns of apparent greenness observed through STA greenness parameters. The results indicate that the seasonal variation in NDVI can be used to distinguish among different land cover transitions, and the primary differences among these transitions were in changes in overall greenness, peak annual greenness and the timing of the growing season. Associations between greenness trends and precipitation were weak, indicating a human-dominated system for the 26 years examined. Changes in the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatán appear to be associated with pasture cultivation, urban expansion-extensive cultivation and urban expansion-intensive cultivation, respectively.";"Neeti, Neeti

"AGRIS:US201500162626";"Forest proportion as indicator of ecological integrity in streams using Plecoptera as a proxy";"";"An assessment system suitable to support implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive's local water management plans should build on quantitative knowledge about a suite of well-documented indicator and umbrella species’ requirements for different stream orders. Assuring high communication value for improving local public awareness and participation for restoring ecological integrity in impaired headwater streams is critical. Loss and fragmentation of forests are major threats to ecological integrity. The aquatic macroinvertebrate order Plecoptera is commonly used as an indicator of the ecological integrity of streams. We measured abundance and taxonomic richness of Plecoptera in relation to land cover and water chemistry in second and third order catchments’ in 25 headwater streams in Central Europe's Carpathian Mountains. Plecoptera abundance and Plecoptera taxa richness were positively correlated to each other, as well as to forest proportion in the catchments, but negatively correlated to catchment area, inorganic carbon, alkalinity and conductivity. Segmented linear regression was then used to identify thresholds associated to forest proportion as a surrogate for catchment integrity. No threshold was found for Plecoptera abundance, but for taxa richness a threshold of 54% forest cover was found, below which Plecoptera was affected in second order streams. Using Plecoptera as a proxy for ecological integrity this study indicates that forest cover is an effective bioindicator in headwater catchments for predicting the ecological status of headwater streams. The non-linear relationship between forest cover and Plecoptera can be used as a science-based norm whereby land cover monitoring can be used to assess the ecological status of streams.";"Törnblom, J.

"AGRIS:US201500055575";"economic attractiveness of Short Rotation Coppice biomass plantations for bioenergy in Northern Ontario";"";"With an apparent abundance of idled and under-utilized agricultural land in Northern Ontario, there is interest in the ability of short-rotation forests to supply bioenergy and other possible bioproducts. Once established, Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) plantations can be harvested on (roughly) three-year cutting cycles until about age 22. Purpose-grown plantations such as these could be used as stand-alone sources of fibre or used in conjunction with sources such as natural forests or woody residues. Using a recently developed land cover model we found that approximately 405 500 ha of agricultural-type land exists across Northern Ontario. Numerous scenarios were developed to calculate SRC profitability on these areas. The analyses are intended to reflect a broad range of expectations on physical yields and prices, including management costs. Although SRC involves a considerable up-front investment, our simulations suggest a significant amount of land could have a break-even biomass price of $85/oven-dried tonnes (ODT) (+/- $5/ODT) at farm gate. This farm gate biomass price represents roughly current traditional biomass prices paid. Thus SRC would need to produce biomass at a comparable cost to be a competitive option. A number of technological and price changes could increase the attractiveness of SRC systems in Northern Ontario, including decreases in establishment and management costs (while maintaining yield expectations) and improved cultivars offering increased yields.";"Allen, Darren

The goal of this study was to understand how root growth responded to water stress resulting from erosion. For this purpose a pot experiment was conducted combining three eroded soils (lightly, moderately, severely) and four soil water levels (relative to field capacity of 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%) using nondisturbed Luvic Phaeozem soil from field by electric drill. The results showed that the response of soybean root growth to soil water was different for the three eroded soils and varied with growth stages of the plant. Under an optimal water supply, roots grew best in moderately eroded soils. Response of soybean root growth to water stress degree was similar under deficit water situation for three eroded soils, and under excess water stress situation, the root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted more seriously than that of moderately and severely eroded soils during the initial branching stage. Root growth was restricted only seriously to the lack of water conditions for moderately and severely eroded soils; however, root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted still seriously to both excess and a lack of water supply, and root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted more seriously to water stress than that of moderately and severely eroded soils from the branching to maturing stages. The root distributions with depths were not different among three eroded soils under optimal water supply, but root growth of lightly eroded soils was restricted more seriously to water stress than moderately and severely eroded soils for three soil layers, and water stress degree of root weight increased with depths. The study results could provide theoretical basis of improving land productivity for different eroded soils.";"Wang, Jing

"AGRIS:US201400190124";"Turkey’s globally important biodiversity in crisis";"";"Turkey (Türkiye) lies at the nexus of Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Turkey’s location, mountains, and its encirclement by three seas have resulted in high terrestrial, fresh water, and marine biodiversity. Most of Turkey’s land area is covered by one of three biodiversity hotspots (Caucasus, Irano-Anatolian, and Mediterranean). Of over 9000 known native vascular plant species, one third are endemic. Turkey faces a significant challenge with regard to biodiversity and associated conservation challenges due to limited research and lack of translation into other languages of existing material. Addressing this gap is increasingly relevant as Turkey’s biodiversity faces severe and growing threats, especially from government and business interests. Turkey ranks 140th out of 163 countries in biodiversity and habitat conservation. Millennia of human activities have dramatically changed the original land and sea ecosystems of Anatolia, one of the earliest loci of human civilization. Nevertheless, the greatest threats to biodiversity have occurred since 1950, particularly in the past decade. Although Turkey’s total forest area increased by 5.9% since 1973, endemic-rich Mediterranean maquis, grasslands, coastal areas, wetlands, and rivers are disappearing, while overgrazing and rampant erosion degrade steppes and rangelands. The current “developmentalist obsession”, particularly regarding water use, threatens to eliminate much of what remains, while forcing large-scale migration from rural areas to the cities. According to current plans, Turkey’s rivers and streams will be dammed with almost 4000 dams, diversions, and hydroelectric power plants for power, irrigation, and drinking water by 2023. Unchecked urbanization, dam construction, draining of wetlands, poaching, and excessive irrigation are the most widespread threats to biodiversity. This paper aims to survey what is known about Turkey’s biodiversity, to identify the areas where research is needed, and to identify and address the conservation challenges that Turkey faces today. Preserving Turkey’s remaining biodiversity will necessitate immediate action, international attention, greater support for Turkey’s developing conservation capacity, and the expansion of a nascent Turkish conservation ethic.";"Şekercioğlu, Çağan H.

The purpose of this research was to study quantitative land suitability of northern Baraan area located in eastern Isfahan. The study was a continuation of the previously accomplished qualitative land suitability evaluation of the area. The economic studies include economic data collection, matching inputs and outputs and gross margins analysis. Radiation-thermal production potential of the crops was calculated based on plant physiology and temperature (FAO model), which was 10.45, 10.11, 13.64 and 11.93 ton/ha for wheat, barley, maize and rice, respectively. Radiation-thermal production potential, observed and marginal yields and the results of the qualitative land evaluation were used to perform quantitative land evalution and to determine the corresponding suitability classes. The predicted yield in different land units varies between 1.64 and 9.17 ton/ha for wheat, 1.81 and 9 ton/ha for barley, 2.06 and 9.42 ton/ha for maize and 2.35 and 7.14 ton/ha for rice. Presence of significant statistical correlation between the observed and the predicted yield values reveals the validity of the evaluation methods used. The results from quantitative land evaluation show that most of the land units are slightly to moderately suitable for wheat, barley, maize and rice, while a few are not. The best land utilization type in each land unit can be selected through a combined consideration of quantitative land evaluation results, benefitability of each land unit and impact of the land use on the soil. Rice cultivation is not recommended in the study area, because of its adverse effect on soil physical properties and soil drainage.";"S. Ayoubi

"AGRIS:US2016213844";"The Choice of Land Tenure Contracts in the Presence of Transaction Costs in Rice Farming in West Java, Indonesia.";"";"This study assessed the preference for and efficiency of land tenure contract arrangements in rice farming in West Java, Indonesia. Specifically, it examined the transaction costs associated with land tenure contracts, the land tenure contract preference, the efficiency of land tenure contracts, and the policy agenda to address the problems of land tenure efficiency. Three types of land tenure contracts were considered: sharecropping, fixed rental and mortgage.  Farm plot data were used to econometrically investigate whether transaction cost had an effect on the choice of land tenure contracts and on the efficiency of land tenure contracts. The transaction cost coefficient of 0.097 (significant of 1% level) in the choice of land tenure indicates that as the value of transaction cost increases, the landlord will most likely choose sharecropping. However, if the transaction cost decreases, it is more likely that the landlord will choose mortgage or fixed rental. These findings show that contract choice of landlord’s is influenced by the transaction cost. The results show that sharecropping is the more efficient land tenure arrangement in West Java, Indonesia. Thus it does not support the Marshallian view of sharecropping as an inefficient land tenure arrangement. Sharecropping in the study area is benefiting both the landlord and the tenant farmers. Transaction cost dismisses as labor monitoring is needed to the barest minimum and higher marginal product is achieved. Adoption of sharecropping in West Java like support the government program of consolidating rice farm to attain scale in economics’ and utilization more efficiently farm labor.  The government needs to facilitate the dissemination of information on land transaction.";"Jamal, Erizal

Each accession was classified into one of three types (types A, B and C) based on two large deletions in the hypervariable regions between the accD–psaI and rps16–trnQ genes. Thirty haplotypes were identified by 32 mutations including 17 gaps (in/dels) and 15 base changes. Haplotype network analysis revealed that wild Chinese Ussurian pears could be grouped into subgroup I of type A. A haplotype, Hcp3, in subgroup I detected in Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces was considered to be a divergent centre in Chinese Ussurian pears. However, the genetic diversity of wild accessions revealed by the two hypervariable regions was quite low. In particular, 98 % of wild Ussurian accessions in Inner Mongolia shared an identical haplotype Hcp1 and are, therefore, monomorphic. In comparison, Chinese pear cultivars were more divergent. These results suggest that the cpDNAs from wild Ussurian pears in Inner Mongolia have specifically differentiated compared to those from pears of other areas. The number of wild Ussurian pears has been decreasing because of desertification and land development, therefore conservation is needed.";"Wuyun, Tana

"AGRIS:US201600191350";"Cultural ecosystem services of mountain regions: Modelling the aesthetic value";"";"Mountain regions meet an increasing demand for pleasant landscapes, offering many cultural ecosystem services to both their residents and tourists. As a result of global change, land managers and policy makers are faced with changes to this landscape and need efficient evaluation techniques to assess cultural ecosystem services. This study provides a spatially explicit modelling approach to estimating aesthetic landscape values by relating spatial landscape patterns to human perceptions via a photo-based survey. The respondents attributed higher aesthetic values to the Alpine landscape in respect to areas with settlements, infrastructure or intensive agricultural use. The aesthetic value of two study areas in the Central Alps (Stubai Valley, Austria and Vinschgau, Italy) was modelled for 10,215 viewpoints along hiking trails according to current land cover and a scenario considering the spontaneous reforestation of abandoned land. Viewpoints with high aesthetic values were mainly located at high altitude, allowing long vistas, and included views of lakes or glaciers, and the lowest values were for viewpoints close to streets and in narrow valleys with little view. The aesthetic values of the reforestation scenario decreased mainly at higher altitudes, but the whole area was affected, reducing aesthetic value by almost 10% in Stubai Valley and 15% in Vinschgau. Our proposed modelling approach allows the estimation of aesthetic values in spatial and qualitative terms for most viewpoints in the European Alps. The resulting maps can be used as information and the basis for discussion by stakeholders, to support the decision-making process and landscape planning. This paper also discusses the role of mountain farming in preserving an attractive landscape and related cultural values.";"Schirpke, Uta

Desertification in Turkey is generally caused by incorrect land use, excessive grazing, forest fires, urbanization, industry, genetic erosion, soil erosion, salinization, and uncontrolled wild type plants picking. Due to anthropogenic destruction of forest, steppe flora gradually became dominant in Anatolia. In terms of biodiversity, Turkey has a significant importance in Europe and Middle East. Nine thousands plant species naturally grown in Turkey, one third of them are endemic. Also, endemic species of vertebrates, thrive in the lakes and marshy areas. The studies of modelling simulation of vegetation on the effects of Mediterranean climate during the Roman Classical period by using vegetation history showed that, in 2000 years BP, Mediterranean countries were more humid than today. Turkey is a special place on the global concern in terms of desertification because of biodiversity, agricultural potential, high population, social and economical structure, topographical factors and strategic regional location. Communication among scientists, decision makers and international non-profit organizations must be improved.";"Camci Çetin, S.

Results indicate that forests was the class with the lowest level of vulnerability during the whole investigated period and with the growth rate (1960–2010) in the ESAI always below the one observed on a landscape scale. Non-forest natural land showed a moderate increase in the ESAI coupled with a relatively high vulnerability level. The temporal pattern of four indicators (climate, soil, vegetation and land management) composing the ESAI was analyzed to identify the variables which affect the level of vulnerability for each land-use class. Results contributes to the understanding of complex landscape-forest interactions in Mediterranean fragile ecosystems.";"Salvati, L.

The possibility of mapping the coverage and abundance of surface floating aquatic weeds was also tested. Landsat images from 1984, 1995, 2001 and 2011 were used to compute a normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), which was then used as a proxy for indicating areas infested by surface floating aquatic weeds. Forest and shrubs covered 310.8 km ² in 1984, but had deteriorated by 24.87% to 77.3 km ² in 2011, while the area under cultivation increased by 51.44% between 1984 and 2011. Runoff from surrounding farms could be responsible for washing soil nutrients into Lake Mutirikwi, enriching its water. A large aggregation of surface floating aquatic weeds concentrated upstream along tributaries of Lake Mutirikwi, mainly the Mucheke which received sewage from Masvingo town, with less coverage in the central parts of the lake. Vegetation indices such as NDVI proved successful as a proxy for mapping the coverage of surface floating aquatic weeds in Lake Mutirikwi in space and time.";"Dube, T

A cross-sectional analysis";"";"BACKGROUND: Dramatic disparities in a range of health outcomes persist in Alameda County, California. Age-standardised mortality rates range from 300 to 1300 deaths per 100 000 across census tracts in this county, with life expectancies lagging by 10 years in the most disadvantaged census tracts. Finding factors at the community level that affect neighbourhood health levels is a key step towards addressing these inequalities. Walking to work may be one of these factors, and is something that local policy makers could effectively act upon through city planning and maintenance initiatives. The objective of this research was to investigate the impact of walking to work on mortality at the census tract level, and to quantify the change in health inequalities that would result from increases in walking in high-mortality-risk neighbourhoods. METHODS: We analysed data from the American Community Survey at the census tract level using a linear regression model. We investigated the relation between walking to work and age-standardised all-cause mortality rates, after controlling for known determinants of health such as race, income, and occupation. We also conducted a counterfactual and risk assessment analysis to assess the expected health benefits if commuting behaviours were modified, and to determine the effect of various levels of walking on health inequalities. FINDINGS: Walking to work was significantly and negatively associated with both cardiovascular mortality rates and all-cause mortality rates. Neighbourhoods with the highest walk-commuting percentages also had some of the lowest incomes of the available census tracts. We found that even a moderate increase in walk commuting (25% increase) can lead to measurable gains in health, with five deaths averted per 1000 deaths. INTERPRETATION: Improved neighbourhood walkability through the inclusion and maintenance of continuous sidewalks and mixed land use could play an important role in reducing existing health disparities and improving overall health outcomes.

However, the studies on soil degradation status and its impacts in this region are very scanty. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of land degradation on crop production both in terms of area and yield in the Dry Zone of Myanmar. Remote sensing and geographic information system-based modelling was utilized to assess and map soil erosion rates. Household survey was conducted to understand the causes of land degradation and its impacts on crop productivity and livelihoods. It has been found out that the current rate of soil erosion ranged from 0 to 114 t ha –¹ yr –¹, and that the average rate of soil erosion increased from 14.2 to 54.6 t ha –¹ yr –¹ over a period from 2000 to 2012. The major types of land degradation were physical and chemical soil degradation. Farmers identified topographic condition, soil types, improper crop management practices and climatic factors as the main causes of soil erosion. The observed crop yields of monsoon rice, groundnut, sesame and cotton in the highly degraded area were 3–12 times lower compared with the yields of these crops grown in less degraded area. Livelihoods of the farmers in the high-degraded area were affected by crop yield reduction, increased cultivation cost and increased uncultivable land area. The impact of land degradation on crop production was dependent on the severity of degradation. This suggests that advanced conservation measures are immediately required and the supportive policy strategies need to be implemented to educate farmers and to strengthen extension services for sustainable land management in the Dry Zone of Myanmar.";"Tun, Kyawt K.K.

In recent decades, five global land cover maps have been produced based on remote sensing data sources and methodologies. Related research have shown that the availability and quality of the first four global land cover datasets are poor at the regional or the continental scale for a variety of reasons. There is still no consensus on the accuracy of the latest global land cover map. Based on comparison of the land cover dataset with the statistical cropland data from FAO and the FLUXNET site data, this paper discusses the accuracy of the fifth global land cover map, namely, the GLOBCOVER dataset, at different spatial scales. At the global scale, the cropland area obtained from the GLOBCOVER dataset is greater than that of the FAO statistical data by 47.06–84.49%, and the land cover types of the GLOBCOVER dataset have a 65.02% consistency with that of the FLUXNET site data. At the continental scale, the difference between cropland areas obtained from the GLOBCOVER dataset and the statistical cropland area vary from −43.42% to 502.36%; continents that have a more accurate cropland area compared to the FAO statistical data tend to be less consistent with the FLUXNET site data. In general, North America has a higher accuracy and Oceania has a lower accuracy. At the country scale, the accuracy estimates vary sharply over a wide range: between −100.00% and 190670.37%. It is recommended that future studies should pay careful attention to the data validation step before using the GLOBCOVER dataset for any particular problem. Future studies are also required for the development of a universal land cover classification system and advanced algorithms for remote sensing classification of global land cover maps.";"An, Yiming

Effective floodwater diversion measures are necessary, but they must be supplemented with equally effective field water management and soil moisture conservation measures if sustainable improvement of land and water productivity is to be achieved. This paper draws on studies conducted in the past 5 years, particularly in the Republic of Yemen, Pakistan and Eritrea. The studies employed both qualitative and quantitative methods and assessed the modernization package that could result in lasting enhancement of crop productivity in spate irrigated agriculture. The suggested modernization measures include: avoid overstretching the command area; limit the number of irrigation turns to two or an irrigation gift of 1000 mm; avoid field bund heights of more than 1 m; adopt a field-to-field water distribution system instead of an individual field water distribution system; opt for water rights and rules that entitle downstream fields to the more frequent small and medium floods thereby ensuring equity in both water quality and quantity; optimize soil water-holding capacity and infiltration rate through pre-and-post irrigation tillage, combined tillage as well as soil mulching.

"AGRIS:US2016213152";"Collective Action in Space: Assessing How Collective Action Varies Across an African Landscape";"";"This paper develops and applies a new approach for analyzing the spatial aspects ofindividual adoption of a technology that produces a mixed public-private good. The technologyis an animal insecticide treatment called a “pouron” that individual households buy and apply totheir animals. Private benefits accrue to households whose animals are treated, while the publicbenefits accrue to all those who own animals within an area of effective suppression.A model of household demand for pourons is presented. As for a private good,household demand for the variable input depends upon output price, input cost, and householdcharacteristics. Input costs for pouron treatments include both the market price of the pouronsand the transaction costs that the household must incur to obtain the treatments. Demand alsodepends upon the way that each household expects its neighbors to respond to one’s ownbehavior. Free-riding is expected in communities with no tradition or formal organization tosupport collective action. Greater cooperation is expected in communities that haveorganizations that reward cooperative behavior and punish deviant behavior.Data for estimation of the model were collected for all of the 5,000 households thatreside within the study area of 350 square kilometers in southwest Ethiopia. Geographicreference data were collected for every household using portable Geographic PositioningSystem units. GIS software was used to generate spatial variables. Variables for distance fromthe household to the nearest treatment center and number of cattle-owning neighbors within a 1-kilometer radius of the household were created. The density of cattle-owning neighbors wasused as a measure of the potential benefits from cooperation; this variable was expected to havea positive effect on household pouron demand in communities able to support effectivecollective action and a negative effect in communities not able to support effective collectiveaction. A set of community binary variables was interacted with the density variable to capturedifferences between communities. The results confirm the importance of the household-levelvariables. The results also indicate large differences in ability to cooperate between localadministrative units. Everything else equal, the areas least able to cooperate were locatedfarthest from the treatment center, were ethnically heterogenous, and had a different ethniccomposition than areas around the treatment centers.";"Swallow, Brent M.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

The method is fundamentally qualitative but can be quantified using preexisting sediment-yield data, where available, to verify predictions using other independent data sets. In the 674-km² Sespe Creek watershed of southern California, 30 unique “geomorphic landscape units” (GLUs, defined by relatively homogenous areas of geology, hillslope gradient, and land cover) provide a framework for discriminating relative rates of sediment yield across this landscape. Field observations define three broad groupings of GLUs that are well-associated with types, relative magnitudes, and rates of erosion processes. These relative rates were then quantified using sediment-removal data from nearby debris basins, which allow relatively low-precision but robust calculations of both local and whole-watershed sediment yields, based on the key assumption that minimal sediment storage throughout most of the watershed supports near-equivalency of long-term rates of hillslope sediment production and watershed sediment yield. The accuracy of these calculations can be independently assessed using geologically inferred uplift rates and integrated suspended sediment measurements from mainstem Sespe Creek, which indicate watershed-averaged erosion rates between about 0.6–1.0� mm� year⁻¹ and corresponding sediment yields of about 2� ×� 10³� t� km⁻²� year⁻¹. A spatially explicit representation of sediment production is particularly useful in a region where wildfires, rapid urban development, and the downstream delivery of upstream sediment loads are critical drivers of both geomorphic processes and land-use management.";"Booth, Derek B.

Land use changes mainly caused by human activities, is a common reason for wetlands degradation worldwide. Lake Stymfalia, located at Peloponnese, southern Greece, is an ancient wetland with a great ecological value. Lake Stymfalia has been severely degraded and transformed during the past 60 years due to agricultural activities in the surrounding areas and watercourses alterations. In this context, we investigated the land cover/ use changes and the role of the reed beds in the terrestrialization process of this shallow wetland. This particular effort utilized remotely sensed data and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques to estimate land use alterations for the period 1945-1996. Patch related landscape indices were generated to analyze impacts on landscape features. Spatial and thematic information concerning the surface area and the major land cover types of the lake for years 1945, 1960, 1972, 1987, 1992, and 1996 was obtained from aerial photographs and land surveys of the area, and was stored in the GIS database. The 1996 map was ground verified, corrected and updated to 2004 conditions. From the spatio-temporal analysis of the stored data, a permanent decrease of the open water surface has been observed between the years 1945 and 1996. The results indicated that the reed beds expanded dramatically, increasing by 89.3%, and is the predominant aquatic vegetation of the whole wetland. Open water areas and wet meadows decreased by 53.7 and 96.5% respectively. Landscape analyses and, in particular, the use of selected landscape metrics, proved useful for detecting and quantitatively characterising dynamic ecological processes. As land cover/use analysis of the wetland has shown much serious environmental degradation, conservation measures should be undertaken urgently.";"Papastergiadou, E. S.

The main objectives of this study were to (1) map the changes of birch woodland cover in Þjórsárdalur (14,000� ha) in southern Iceland, over a period of 350� years from late sixteenth to early twentieth century, and (2) explain the impact of socio-economic and natural forces on the woodland cover over three periods: 1587–1708, 1708–1880 and 1880–1938. We used a combined approach of historical reconstruction from diverse written archives, GIS-techniques and field work. About half of the Þjórsárdalur valley was covered by birch woodland in the late sixteenth century but over a period of 350� years 94� % of woodland had been depleted. The woodland was intensively used for firewood and charcoal making during the period with limited land management restriction. The main driving force for this development was socio-economic, where the form of ownership was a fundamental factor for the fate of the woodland. Harsh climate and volcanism further exacerbated the woodland during times when it had become fragmented and beyond its state of recovery.";"Sigurmundsson, Friðþór S.

This is measured in response to the intervention of land drainage systems applied to poorly and imperfectly draining managed grasslands in Ireland. This trade-off is examined spatially using integrated mapping within ArcGIS. National level datasets on land use were combined with an indicative drainage map. Drainage class was used as the dominant classifier for soil types. This allowed both the spatial heterogeneity of soil in terms of biophysical constraints/endowments and their complex interaction with land use to be mapped at a national level. Outputs from DNDC biogeochemical modelling based on Irish Soil Information System Data were used to develop an indicative soil organic carbon loss map used to derive the associated CO2 loss. Application of the Hybrid Soil Moisture Deficit model was used to determine the impact of drainage on productivity to compute the decreased number of days at which soils are untrafficable and this data was used to develop a productivity difference map.";"O’Sullivan, L., Teagasc, Johnstown Castle, Wexford (Ireland).

Using the example of the Pueblo Kichwa de Rukullakta, an ethnic Kichwa group in the Ecuadorian Amazon, we analyze land tenure arrangements at the household, community, and territory levels using a common property framework. The specific bundle of rights identified by the framework is held at the household level but households rely on community and territory level arrangements for their enforcement. Land claims at the community and territory level also serve to define the pool of legitimate rights holders at the next lower level. Due to the importance of scale in understanding indigenous land tenure generally, we suggest an adaptation of the common property framework to explicitly recognize the role of scale. This adapted framework identifies the function, characteristics, and means of enforcement for land claims at each scale of analysis.";"Bennett, Drew E.

"AGRIS:LV2016000543";"Current structure of land holdings and importance of small farms: evidences from Pakistan";"";"In agrarian economies like Pakistan, agriculture structure especially, pattern of ownership of land and size distribution are crucial indicator and principal form of wealth and political power. The present study represents an attempt to look in current structure of land holdings, land tenure, and land fragmentation by using Pakistan agriculture census report 2010. Opportunities and challenges faced by small farms in Pakistan are also discussed. Despite two land reforms (1959, 1972), to reform the feudal agrarian structure of the country, agricultural lands are highly skewed in favour of large farms. This dominancy of large farms in owning means of production leads to severe inequalities in the distribution of wealth and income which is major obstacle in provision of basic need to large proportion of population. Tenancy, a problem in the past because poor tenants were handicapped in accessing different institutes and services, is solved somehow. Despite different consolidation programs in the past, the fragmentation issue is there, 34 percent of total farm area is fragmented in Pakistan. Fragments are barrier in investment in farm development projects on farm level. A majority of farms (58%) in Pakistan are small farms, so for the prosperity of country, well-being of small farms is very important. Due to diversification of agriculture from cash crop to high value commodities, and concepts like tunnel farming, organic agriculture, horticulture and livestock, small farms tend to offer some opportunities. On the other hand, natural disasters, pest attacks, access to financial markets, unfavourable macro-economic policies are threatening the prosperity of small farms.";"Imran, M., Akdeniz Univ., Antalya (Turkey).

The acquisition and use of tractors by arable crop farmers in communal and resettlement state land were encouraged. This research examines the performance of the program in the Bindura District. Ninety farmers were interviewed using a multistage sampling technique of structured questionnaires to collect data on demographic background, investment levels and production in terms of costs and returns. The Stochastic Frontier Model revealed the significant impact of the program on participating farmers, highlighting the significance of land and other productive factors. While overall production and productivity remain low, triggering a hyper-inflationary situation due to supply constraints, practical implications for agribusinesses are foreseen.

"AGRIS:US201600130916";"Relationship Between Shoreline Armoring and Adjacent Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Chesapeake Bay and Nearby Atlantic Coastal Bays";"";"Shoreline armoring is an ancient and globally used engineering strategy to prevent shoreline erosion along marine, estuarine, and freshwater coastlines. Armoring alters the land water interface and has the potential to affect nearshore submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) by changing nearshore hydrology, morphology, water clarity, and sediment composition. We quantified the relationships between the condition (bulkhead, riprap, or natural) of individual shoreline segments and three measures of directly adjacent SAV (the area of potential SAV habitat, the area occupied by SAV, and the proportion of potential habitat area that was occupied) in the Chesapeake Bay and nearby Atlantic coastal bays. Bulkhead had negative relationships with SAV in the polyhaline and mesohaline zones. Salinity and watershed land cover significantly modified the effect of shoreline armoring on nearshore SAV beds, and the effects of armoring were strongest in polyhaline subestuaries with forested watersheds. In high salinity systems, distance from shore modified the relationship between shoreline and SAV. The negative relationship between bulkhead and SAV was greater further off shore. By using individual shoreline segments as the study units, our analysis separated the effects of armoring and land cover, which were confounded in previous analyses that quantified average armoring and SAV abundance for much larger study units (subestuaries). Our findings suggest that redesigning or removing shoreline armoring structures may benefit nearshore SAV in some settings. Because armoring is ubiquitous, such information can inform efforts to reverse the global decline in SAV and the loss of the ecosystem services that SAV provides.";"Patrick, Christopher J.

The occurrence of landslides following typhoons and earthquakes is a major indicator of natural disturbance. The hydrological response of the Chenyulan watershed to land use change was assessed from 1996 to 2005. Land use changes revealed by seven remote images corresponded to typhoons and a catastrophic earthquake in central Taiwan. Hydrological response is discussed as the change in quantities and statistical distributions of hydrological components. The land cover change results indicate that the proportion of landslide relative to total area increased to 6.1% after the Chi-Chi earthquake, representing the largest increase during the study period. The study watershed is dominated by forest land cover. Comparisons of hydrological components reveal that the disturbance significantly affects base flow and direct runoff. The hydrological modeling results demonstrate that the change in forest area correlates with the variation of base flow and direct runoff. Base flow and direct runoff are sensitive to land use in discussions of distinction. The proposed approach quantifies the effect of typhoons and earthquakes on land cover changes.";"Hong, Nien Ming

"AGRIS:US201600063970";"Uncertainty in ecosystem mapping by remote sensing";"";"The classification of remotely sensed images such as aerial photographs or satellite sensor images for deriving ecosystem-related maps (e.g., land cover, land use, vegetation, soil) is generally based on clustering of spatial entities within a spectral space. In most cases, Boolean logic is applied in order to map landscape patterns. One major concern is that this implies an ability to divide the gradual variability of the Earth's surface into a finite number of discrete non-overlapping classes, which are considered to be exhaustively defined and mutually exclusive. This type of approach is often inappropriate given the continuous nature of many ecosystem properties. Moreover, the standard data processing and image classification methods used will involve the loss of information as the continuous quantitative spectral information is degraded into a set of discrete classes. This leads to uncertainty in the products resulting from the use of remote sensing tools. It follows that any estimated ecosystem property has an associated error and/or uncertainty of unknown magnitude, and that the statistical quantification of uncertainty should be a core part of scientific research using remote sensing. In this paper we will review recent attempts to take explicitly into account uncertainty when mapping ecosystems.";"Rocchini, Duccio

"AGRIS:US201600001847";"Reclaiming the worker's property: control grabbing, farmworkers and the Las Tunas Accords in Nicaragua";"";"In this paper I explore a land grabbing resistance movement composed of unemployed coffee workers in Central Nicaragua. Between 1996 and 2000, a private agro-export conglomerate appropriated worker-owned coffee estates previously designated as the Area Propiedad del Los Trabajadores (APT), or the Worker's Property. Following mass protests between 2001 and 2004, worker representatives from the Asociación de Trabajadores del Campo (ATC) and government officials negotiated and signed the Las Tunas Accords which provided redistributed land from 18 of those coffee estates to 2500 families. Drawing on interviews with movement participants carried out between 2003 and 2012, I argue that the roots of the control grab and the resistance movement can be traced to the contradictions of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)-led agrarian reform in the 1980s, the conflicts over property in the post-war period and the failed consensus on how rural labor should organize and be represented in the face of land re-concentration and capitalist consolidation.";"Wilson, Bradley R.";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land reform;agrarian reform";"";"";"NIC";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001847";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2014.992338";"";"";"";"747-763"
"AGRIS:US201400144108";"Contrasting influences of stormflow and baseflow pathways on nitrogen and phosphorus export from an urban watershed";"";"Eutrophication of urban surface waters from excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs remains a major issue in water quality management. Although much research has focused on understanding loading of nutrients from storm events, there has been little research to understand the contribution of baseflow, the water moving through storm drains between rainfall events. We investigated the relative contributions of baseflow versus stormflow for loading of water and nutrients (various forms of N and P) by the storm drain network in six urban sub-watersheds in St. Paul, MN, USA. Across sites, baseflow made substantial contributions to warm season (May–October) water yields (27–66� % across sites), total N yields (31–68� %), and total P yields (7–32� %). These results show that while P was predominantly delivered by stormflow, N loading was similar between baseflow and stormflow. We found that baseflow was dominated by groundwater inputs, likely caused by interception of shallow groundwater by storm drains, but also that variability in N and P among sites was related in part to the connectivity of the storm drains to upstream lakes and wetlands in some watersheds. The substantial loading by groundwater-dominated baseflow, especially for N, implies that N management may require a broader focus on N source reduction, perhaps through improved land management, in order to prevent contamination of shallow groundwater via infiltration.";"Janke, Benjamin D.

This study analysed several factors that explained the forest-shrubland conversions, grassland conversions and cropland expansions in Lake Nakuru drainage basin and Eastern Mau forest reserve in Kenya from 1985 to 2011. Logistic regression models were developed using a combination of remote sensing-based land cover data, and geographical information systems-based geophysical and socio-economic data (i.e., temperature, rainfall, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness, curvature, soil pH, soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), population density and distance to road, river and town). The results were varied; for example, in the period 1985–2000, forest-shrubland conversions were linked to distance to road), distance to town, soil pH, soil CEC, rainfall, topographic wetness, curvature and aspect. The same factors, in addition to slope and distance to river, also determined the likelihood of forest-shrubland conversions in the period 2000–2011. Overall, significance of the determining factors varied depending on time and nature of land cover change. For example, topographical factors influenced grassland conversions in the period 1985–2000, while soil-related factors did not. But in the period 2000–2011, the converse was true. Therefore, policies for restoration, conservation and sustainable management of critical ecosystems (e.g., forests) should be spatially targeted and time-specific. These results broaden our knowledge of land cover dynamics in this locality, and provide a base for effective environmental policy formulation, planning and management.";"Were, Kennedy

"AGRIS:US2016222784";"Evaluating the efficiency of a N-input tax under different policy scenarios at different scales";"";"Nitrate pollution from agriculture is an important environmental problem, caused bythe excessive use of inorganic fertilizers. The internalization of this externality, via a tax onmineral nitrogen, could lead to a second best solution, reducing nitrate emissions. Severalauthors suggest that a reduction in agricultural support could produce similar results. Inthis paper we examine the effects of a nitrogen levy on nitrate pollution from agriculture innorthern France under two different policy scenarios corresponding to (i) the Agenda 2000and (ii) the Luxembourg reform of 2003, including the 2006 arrangement. The analysisaims at revealing what synergies or conflicts are created between a fertilizer levy and thepolicy scenarios, with respect to nitrate pollution mitigation. The applied methodology isbased on the coupling of the economic model AROPAj with the crop model STICS. For eachpolicy scenario, a nitrogen tax is simulated, involving different tax levels up to 100% theinput price. Results reveal that at higher tax levels the reformed CAP can lead to slightlygreater nitrate reductions than Agenda 2000, while the opposite applies when the tax is low.A down-scaling method is then used for the spatial distribution of the outputs, allowingfor a more detailed representation of the nitrate abatement effects of the N-tax at differentgeographical levels.";"Petsakos, Athanasios

Wildcat records were collected using camera trapping, and prey data were assessed through linear transects and small mammal trapping. Surveys were carried out in three study areas in northeast Scotland. Wildcat occupancy was best predicted by a combination of food and land cover variables. This species detection was associated with higher rodent abundance and areas of higher habitat diversity encompassing patches of mixed and coniferous woodlands. Wildcat presence was negatively linked with the prevalence of dwarf shrub areas. We suggest that wildcat conservation actions at local scale should take into account the availability of feeding resources and landscape heterogeneity.";"Silva, André P.

"AGRIS:US201600197749";"Integrating the spatial proximity effect into the assessment of changes in ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation";"";"The assessment of the value of ecosystem services is a valuable tool for biodiversity conservation that can facilitate better environmental policy decision-making and land management, and can help land managers develop interventions to compensate for biodiversity loss at the patch level. Previous studies have suggested that it is appropriate to assess the value of biodiversity for conservation planning by considering both the condition of the landscape and the spatial configuration of adjacent land uses that can be reflected as a proximity effect. This research examines the influence of spatial proximity on biodiversity conservation from the ecosystem service perspective based on the assumption that the variation in the proximity effect caused by land cover change has positive or negative impacts on ecological services. Three factors related to the spatial characteristics of the landscape were considered in this approach: the relative artificiality of the land cover types, the distance decay effect of patches and the impact of one land cover type on others. The proximity effect change (PEC) parameter reflected the relationship between the spatial proximity effect and biodiversity conservation. The results of a quantitative and spatial comparative analysis of the proposed method and the conventional method in Yingkou for the periods of 2000â2005 and 2005â2010 showed that the former can account for the temporal and spatial changes in ecosystem services for biodiversity conservation that were caused by patch-level changes as well as the interaction between the altered and adjacent patches from a spatial perspective. The metric can also identify the most critical areas for biodiversity protection and inform the efficient allocation of limited land resources for nature conservation to maximize the benefit to biodiversity by guiding the process of land-use change, particularly urbanization and agriculture. Future studies should focus on the other important factors that are applicable to the assessment of the value of biodiversity conservation in socio-ecological systems, where society and nature are mutually capable of fulfilling their roles.";"Liu, Yanfang

"AGRIS:US201400148349";"Sub-pixel mapping of remotely sensed imagery with hybrid intra- and inter-pixel dependence";"";"Sub-pixel mapping of remotely sensed imagery is often performed by assuming that land cover is spatially dependent both within and between image pixels. Intra- and inter-pixel dependencies are two widely used approaches to represent different land-cover spatial dependencies at present. However, merely using intra- or inter-pixel dependence alone often fails to fully describe land-cover spatial dependence, making current sub-pixel mapping models defective. A more reasonable object for sub-pixel mapping is maximizing both intra- and inter-pixel dependencies simultaneously instead of using only one of them. In this article, the differences between intra- and inter-pixel dependencies are discussed theoretically, and a novel sub-pixel mapping model aiming to maximize hybrid intra- and inter-pixel dependence is proposed. In the proposed model, spatial dependence is formulated as a weighted sum of intra-pixel dependence and inter-pixel dependence to satisfy both intra- and inter-pixel dependencies. By application to artificial and synthetic images, the proposed model was evaluated both visually and quantitatively by comparing with three representative sub-pixel mapping algorithms: the pixel swapping algorithm, the sub-pixel/pixel attraction algorithm, and the pixel swapping initialized with sub-pixel/pixel attraction algorithm. The results showed increased accuracy of the proposed algorithm when compared with these traditional sub-pixel mapping algorithms.";"Ling, Feng

"AGRIS:US201400148348";"Rule-based impervious surface mapping using high spatial resolution imagery";"";"Impervious surface mapping has become a recent concern in remote-sensing applications because of worldwide urban growth and the resultant environmental changes. However, many effective impervious surface mapping techniques developed for moderate-resolution imagery are not applicable to high spatial resolution imagery such as that of IKONOS and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) due to their limited number of spectral bands and the lack of middle-infrared bands. In response to this need, this article proposes a rule-based approach to extract impervious surface features from high spatial resolution imagery. Images of IKONOS, ALOS and Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) from three different cities were used for the approach. The general rules used for extracting impervious surface features from the images were deduced from the signatures of land cover classes but are not scene-specific. Based on these rules, impervious surface features were effectively discriminated from the categories such as soil and water, which were always confused with each other in previous work. The approach can achieve a high overall accuracy in imperviousness extraction efforts.";"Xu, Hanqiu";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"urbanization;land cover";"Urban Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400148348";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.703343";"";"";"";"27-44"

Six-date RADARSAT-2 high-resolution polarimetric SAR data in both ascending and descending passes were acquired in the rural–urban fringe of the Greater Toronto Area during the summer of 2008. The major land-use/land-cover classes include high-density residential areas, low-density residential areas, industrial and commercial areas, construction sites, parks, golf courses, forests, pasture, water, and two types of agricultural crops. Various polarimetric SAR parameters were evaluated for urban land-cover mapping and they include the parameters from Pauli, Freeman and Cloude–Pottier decompositions, the coherency matrix, intensities of each polarization, and their logarithm forms. The multi-temporal SAR polarimetric features were classified first using an SVM classifier. Then specific rules were developed to improve the SVM classification results by extracting major roads and streets using shape features and contextual information. For the comparison of the polarimetric SAR parameters, the best classification performance was achieved using the compressed logarithmic filtered Pauli parameters. For the evaluation of the multi-temporal SAR data set, the best classification result was achieved using all six-date data (kappa = 0.91), while very good classification results (kappa = 0.86) were achieved using only three-date polarimetric SAR data. The results indicate that the combination of both the ascending and the descending polarimetric SAR data with an appropriate temporal span is suitable for urban land-cover mapping.";"Niu, Xin

"AGRIS:US201400148346";"Spatially adaptive smoothing parameter selection for Markov random field based sub-pixel mapping of remotely sensed images";"";"Sub-pixel mapping is a process to provide the spatial distributions of land cover classes with finer spatial resolution than the size of a remotely sensed image pixel. Traditional Markov random field-based sub-pixel mapping (MRF_SPM) adopts a fixed smoothing parameter estimated based on the entire image to balance the spatial and spectral energies. However, the spectra of the remotely sensed pixels are always spatially variable. Adopting a fixed smoothing parameter disregards the local properties provided by each pixel spectrum, and may probably lead to insufficient smoothing in the homogeneous region and over-smoothing between class boundaries simultaneously. This article proposes a spatially adaptive parameter selection method for the MRF_SPM model to overcome the limitation of the fixed parameter. As pixel class proportions are indicators of the type and proportion of land cover classes within each coarse pixel, in the proposed method, fraction images providing pixel class proportions as local properties of each pixel spectrum are employed to constrain the smoothing parameter. Consequently, the smoothing parameter is spatially adaptive to each pixel spectrum of the remotely sensed image. Synthetic images and IKONOS multi-spectral images were employed. Results showed that compared with the hard classification method and the non-spatially adaptive MRF_SPM adopting a fixed smoothing parameter, the spatially adaptive MRF_SPM with the smoothing parameter constrained to each pixel spectrum yielded sub-pixel maps not only with higher accuracy but also with shapes and boundaries visually reconstructed more closely to the reference map.";"Li, Xiaodong

"AGRIS:US201400148342";"super-resolution mapping method using local indicator variograms";"";"Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a recently developed research task in the field of remotely sensed information processing. It provides the ability to obtain land-cover maps at a finer scale using relatively low-resolution images. Existing algorithms based on indicator geostatistics and downscaling cokriging offer an SRM approach using spatial structure models derived from real data. In this article, a novel SRM method is developed based on a sequentially produced with local indicator variogram (SLIV) SRM model. In the SLIV method, indicator variograms extracted from target-resolution classification are produced from a representative local area as opposed to using the entire image. This simplifies the application of the method since limited target-resolution reference data are required. Our investigation on three diverse case studies shows that the local window (approximately 2% of the entire study area) selection process offers comparable accuracy results to those using globally derived spatial structures, indicating our methodology to be a promising practice. Furthermore, comparison of the proposed method with random realizations indicates an improvement of 7–12% in terms of overall accuracy and 15–18% in terms of the kappa coefficient. The evaluation focused on a 270–30 m pixel size reconstruction as a potential popular application, for example moving from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to Landsat-type resolutions.";"Jin, Huiran

The model is used annually to estimate average land values by county, based on the value of production from cropland and non-cropland. The county land values developed from this procedure form the basis for the 2007 valuation of agricultural land for real estate tax assessment. The average ""all land value"" from this analysis is multiplied by the total acres of agricultural land on the county abstract to determine each county's total agricultural land value for taxation purposes. The State Board of Equalization compares this value with the total value assessed to agricultural property in each county. Each county is required by state statute to assess a total value of agricultural property within 5 percent of this value. The average value per acre of all agricultural land in North Dakota increased by 0.79 percent, from 2006 to 2007, based on the value of production. Cropland value increased by 0.36 percent and non-cropland value increased by 5.17 percent.

Hierarchical analysis was used to test the hypothesis that a land unit's edaphic factors could explain the differences in vegetation responses to grazing. We established the survey sites at increasing distances from a livestock camp or water point within each land unit, then analysed patterns of change in floristic and functional compositions, vegetation volume and soil properties within each land unit to reveal differences in vegetation responses to grazing. We also examined the variations in floristic and functional compositions across land units to identify the edaphic factors that may underlie these differences. Changes in vegetation and soil properties at increasing distances from a camp or water point within each land unit were into three different patterns. Ordination techniques consistently indicated that land unit groups categorised using edaphic factors corresponded to those categorised using response patterns. Our study revealed that edaphic factors were responsible for the observed landscape-scale differences in vegetation responses to grazing in the study areas. In addition, the mechanisms underlying vegetation responses to grazing may have been primarily determined by edaphic factors.";"Sasaki, Takehiro

"AGRIS:US201600127151";"Application of a Water Rights Trading Model Based on two-Stage Interval-Parameter Stochastic Programming";"";"In recent decades, increasing conflicts have occurred between different water users because of issues related to water resource allocation. To better allocate water resources, this study adopts the latest water rights trading model instead of the traditional water resources allocation model and combines it with a two-stage interval-parameter stochastic programming model (TISP). The combined model was applied to the Sanjiang Plain with multi-area, multi-source, and multi-water users, and the optimized promised water availability for every user in the area was obtained. The analysis shows that a higher promised water availability corresponds to a higher benefit but also promotes additional risks because of water shortages, whereas a lower promised water availability corresponds to a lower benefit, although it is more likely to result in water waste at high inflow levels. The combined model formed an effective link between water use benefits and water deficiency punishments that enabled us to obtain an optimized promised water availability that considers benefits and risks simultaneously. The second result is that the water rights trading model can improve the utilization efficiency of water resources, which are typically transferred from inefficient water use areas to efficient water use areas, resulting in a benefit to all areas. Additionally, in the water rights trading model, self-profit motivation at a micro-level can emerge in adaptation at a macro-level, which stabilizes the water resource system and reduces the possibility of system collapse because of extreme water shortages.";"Fu, Qiang

Efficient statistical evaluation of phenotyping data requires standardised data storage ensuring long-term data availability while maintaining intellectual property rights. This is state of the art at phenomics centres, which, however, are unavailable for most scientists. For them we developed a simple and cost-efficient system, the Phenotyper, which employs mobile devices or personal digital assistants (PDA) for on-site data entry and open-source software for data management. RESULTS: A graphical user interface (GUI) on a PDA replaces paper-based form sheet and data entry on a desktop. The user can define his phenotyping schemes in a web tool without in-depth knowledge of the system and thus adjust it more easily to new research aspects than in a classical laboratory information management system (LIMS). In the Phenotyper, schemes are built from controlled vocabulary gained from published ontologies. Vocabulary and schemes are stored in a database that also manages the user access. From the web page, schemes are downloaded as extended markup language (XML) files for the transfer to the PDA and the exchange between users. On the PDA, the GUI displays the schemes and stores data in comma separated value format and XML format. After manual quality control, data are uploaded via a web page to an independently hosted results database, in which data are stored in an entity-attribute-value structure to provide maximum flexibility. Datasets are linked to the original and curated data files stored on a file server. The ownership stamp, project affiliation and date stamp of a dataset are used to regulate data access, which is restricted to data belonging to the user or to his projects and data, for which the embargo period has ended. By export of standardised ASCII reports to long-term data storage facility, long-term accessibility allows searching, citing and use of raw data beyond the lifetime of the database. The Phenotyper is available to the scientific community for use and further development. CONCLUSIONS: The Phenotyper provides a well-structured, but flexible data acquisition and management structure for mobile on-site measurements for efficient evaluation and shared use of data.";"Köhl, Karin

The geographical space, in which LIS is set, which is also the objective of this study is Shales commune, Elbasani district. To provide data on agricultural land and elaboration of this database the most important qualities and characteristic of the soil are taken into account, as well as it has been made the classification of land suitability into four suitability classes (S1-S4) and an unsuitable (N). About 60% of the land surface in Shales commune is classified as unsuitable and the rest is classified in S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively, 2%, 19%, 16%, and 3% of the surface. Based in the land use information before and post 1998 it is analyzed the change of land use in communal level. The main changes have been occurred on the agricultural land fund. In this class the diversion of agricultural land use by arable crops in vineyards, olive groves, orchards were found, as well as changes are observed within agriculture land where 281.8 ha or 12.6% of suitable land is left fallow. The data show that the surface occupied by buildings outside the yellow line is 13.9 ha. The products of this study are the land suitability map, the use and land-use changes maps in the period 1998-2011. The results of this study suggest urgent measures for a sustainable management of the land and protection from further urbanization.";"Shpetim Tafaj

"AGRIS:US201301709670";"Designing a hedgerow network in a multifunctional agricultural landscape: Balancing trade-offs among ecological quality, landscape character and implementation costs";"";"Spatial planning aimed at multifunctional agriculture can be seen as a negotiation process on environmental, social and economic aspects of land use. Complexity arises due to the high number of stakeholders and due to the limited knowledge, which is often organized along disciplinary divides. This paper sets out from the premise that the role of agronomy in such land use planning processes can be strengthened by approaches that allow multi-objective and multi-scale evaluation of spatially explicit land use alternatives. We present an application of the explorative Landscape IMAGES framework, which employs the Differential Evolution optimization strategy and the concepts of Pareto optimality that are relatively easy to implement and to combine with spatially explicit indicator assessments. This technique yields a set of solutions, each representing a spatial configuration of hedgerows in a landscape along with the performance of the landscape in terms of Pareto rank and efficiency. The methodology was applied in a redesign of the structure of linear landscape elements in an agri-ecological zone in The Netherlands where 7 indicators representing ecological quality, landscape character and implementation costs were considered. The case study was developed in interaction with an NGO involved in landscape management planning and implementation. Spatial cohesion in the landscape was found to increase with larger total hedgerow length, but could also be improved without increasing the total length (and therefore costs of establishment and maintenance). Trade-offs existed with other objectives, since this change would involve replacing hedgerows currently positioned in the longitudinal direction (L) of the fields by hedgerows in the transversal direction (T). This change would compromise cultural heritage value as expressed in the L/T ratio, and it would require removal of mature hedgerows in some places and adding of new hedgerows elsewhere in the landscape, thereby increasing implementation costs. The approach was evaluated positively in terms of design validity, output validity and end-user validity. The role of the Landscape IMAGES framework in setting a research agenda to enhance the role of agronomy in multifunctional land use planning is discussed.";"Groot, Jeroen C.J.

It also identifies conditions under which irrigation has greater anti-poverty impacts. The analysis is based on primary data collected during the 2000--2001 agricultural year, from four selected irrigation systems and rainfed areas in Java. The results indicate that irrigation has significant poverty reducing impacts. Poverty varies across irrigation systems and across locations within the systems. In general, crop productivity is relatively higher and poverty is lower in middle parts of the systems compared to head and tail parts. Further, locational differences in poverty are more pronounced in larger systems where locational inequities in water distribution and productivity differences are also high. Crop productivity, the size of landholdings and location of households are important determinants of poverty, in addition to demographic factors such as family size. The smaller the systems with well managed infrastructure, relatively equitable water distribution and diversified cropping patterns supported with market infrastructure, the greater the poverty reducing impacts of irrigation. Overall, the study findings suggest that improving the performance of irrigation systems by enhancing land and water productivity, diversifying cropping patterns and improving water distribution across locations would help reduce poverty in presently low productivity-high poverty parts of the systems.";"Hussain, I.

The knowledge and information required to address the problem of assessing the impact of NPS pollutants like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), etc., on the environment crosses several sub-disciplines like remote sensing, Geographical Information System (GIS), hydrology and soil science. The remote sensing data, by virtue of its potential like synopticity, multi-spectral and multi-temporal capability, computer compatibility, besides providing almost real time information, has enhanced the scope of automation of mapping dynamic elements, such as land use/land cover, degradation profile and computing the priority categorisation of sub-watersheds. The present study demonstrates the application of remote sensing, GIS and distributed parameter model Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution Model (AGNPS) in the assessment of hazardous non-point source pollution in a watershed. The ARC-INFO GIS and remote sensing provided the input data to support modelling, while the AGNPS model predicted runoff, sediment and pollutant (N and P) transport within a watershed. The integrated system is used to evaluate the sediment pollution in about 2700 ha Karso watershed located in Hazaribagh area of Jharkhand State, India. The predicted values of runoff and sediment yield copared reasonably well with the measured values. It is important to emphasize that this study is not intended to characterise, in an exhaustive manner. Instead, the goal is to illustrate the implications and potential advantages of GIS and remote sensing based Hydrology and Water quality (H/WQ) modelling framework.";"Chowdary, V. M.

This sreseach was aimed to: (1) study the soil development of rainfed paddy soils derived from lacustrine and (2) evaluate rainfed paddy soils potency for paddy and corn in Paguyaman. Soil samples were taken from three profiles according to toposequent, and they were analyzed in laboratory. Data were analyzed with descriptive-quantitative analysis. Furthermore, assessment on rainfed paddy soils potency was conducted with land suitability analysis using parametric approach. Results indicate that all pedon had  evolved with B horizons structurization. However, pedon located on the summit slope was more developed and intensely weathered than those of the shoulder and foot slopes.The main pedogenesis in all pedons were through elluviation, illuviation, lessivage, pedoturbation, and gleization processes. The main factors of pedogenesis were climate, age (time) and topography factors. Therefore, P1 pedons are classified as Ustic Endoaquerts, fine, smectitic, isohypertermic; P2 as Vertic Endoaquepts, fine, smectitic, isohypertermic; and P3 as Vertic Epiaquepts, fine, smectitic, isohypertermic.

Three hundred and eighty-three sites on 3000 km transect, inland Queensland, Australia. Vegetation structure descriptions from the route notes of the first European exploration of the location by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1844-45 were georeferenced and compiled. Leichhardt's application of structural descriptors (e.g. 'scrub', 'open forest', 'plain') was interpreted as domains within a matrix of tall stratum and low stratum woody cover. Woody cover was also interpreted for the same locations using aerial photography that largely pre-dates extensive land clearing (1940s-1970s) and compared with their structural domain in 1844-45. The fire-sensitive tree, cypress-pine (Callitris glaucophylla) was singled out for case study because it has been widely proposed that the density of this tree has substantially increased under European pastoral management. The coarse resolution of this analysis indicates that the structure of the vegetation has been stable over the first 100 years of pastoralism. For example treeless or sparsely treed plains described by Leichhardt (1844-45) had the same character on the aerial photography (1945-78). Leichhardt typically described vegetation that includes cypress-pine as having a 'thicket' structure suggesting dense regenerating stands of small trees, consistent with the signature typical on the aerial photography. A large data set of geographically located descriptions of vegetation structure from the first European traverse of inland Australia compared with vegetation structure determined from aerial photography does not support the hypothesis that vegetation thickening has been extensive and substantial. On the contrary the study suggests that the structure of the vegetation has been relatively stable for the first 100 years of European settlement and pastoralism except for those areas that have been affected by broad-scale clearing.";"Fensham, R.J.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300836640";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01777.x";"";"";"";"141-156"

To examine techniques for restoring biocrusts, we conducted a replicated, factorial experiment on recently abandoned road surfaces by applying biocrust inoculation (salvaged and stored dry for twoÂ years), salvaged topsoil, an abiotic soil amendment (wood shavings), and planting of a dominant perennial shrub (Ambrosia dumosa). Eighteen months after treatments, we measured biocrust abundance and species composition, soil chlorophyll a content and fertility, and soil resistance to erosion. Biocrust addition significantly accelerated biocrust recovery on disturbed soils, including increasing lichen and moss cover and cyanobacteria colonization. Compared to undisturbed controls, inoculated plots had similar lichen and moss composition, recovered 43% of total cyanobacteria density, had similar soil chlorophyll content, and exhibited recovery of soil fertility and soil stability. Inoculation was the only treatment that generated lichen and moss cover. Topsoil application resulted in partial recovery of the cyanobacteria community and soil properties. Compared to untreated disturbed plots, topsoil application without inoculum increased cyanobacteria density by 186% and moderately improved soil chlorophyll and ammonium content and soil stability. Topsoil application produced 22% and 51% of the cyanobacteria density gâ»Â¹ soil compared to undisturbed and inoculated plots, respectively. Plots not treated with either topsoil or inoculum had significantly lower cyanobacteria density, soil chlorophyll and ammonium concentrations, and significantly higher soil nitrate concentration. Wood shavings and Ambrosia had no influence on biocrust lichen and moss species recovery but did affect cyanobacteria composition and soil fertility. Inoculation of severely disturbed soil with native biocrusts rapidly restored biocrust communities and soil stability such that restored areas were similar to undisturbed desert within three years. Using salvaged biocrust as inoculum can be an effective tool in ecological restoration because of its efficacy and simple implementation. Although salvaging biocrust material can be technically difficult and potentially costly, utilizing opportunities to salvage material in planned future disturbance can provide additional land management tools.";"Chiquoine, Lindsay P.

"AGRIS:US201500196600";"Future fire emissions associated with projected land use change in Sumatra";"";"Indonesia has experienced rapid land use change over the last few decades as forests and peatswamps have been cleared for more intensively managed land uses, including oil palm and timber plantations. Fires are the predominant method of clearing and managing land for more intensive uses, and the related emissions affect public health by contributing to regional particulate matter and ozone concentrations and adding to global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Here, we examine emissions from fires associated with land use clearing and land management on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the sensitivity of this fire activity to interannual meteorological variability. We find ~80% of 2005–2009 Sumatra emissions are associated with degradation or land use maintenance instead of immediate land use conversion, especially in dry years. We estimate Sumatra fire emissions from land use change and maintenance for the next two decades with five scenarios of land use change, the Global Fire Emissions Database Version 3, detailed 1‐km²land use change maps, and MODIS fire radiative power observations. Despite comprising only 16% of the original study area, we predict that 37–48% of future Sumatra emissions from land use change will occur in fuel‐rich peatswamps unless this land cover type is protected effectively. This result means that the impact of fires on future air quality and climate in Equatorial Asia will be decided in part by the conservation status given to the remaining peatswamps on Sumatra. Results from this article will be implemented in an atmospheric transport model to quantify the public health impacts from the transport of fire emissions associated with future land use scenarios in Sumatra.";"Marlier, Miriam E.

The system established for protected areas in Turkey aims to provide a foundation for conserving areas for recreation. One such area, Abant Natural Park, is convenient for visits from Turkey’s two most populated metropolitan areas, Istanbul and Ankara. It also attracts tourists from other regions and countries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the vegetation loss and land cover changes due to picnic/camping, transhumance, and construction over 40 years (1966–2004) in the park using data on visitor numbers, vegetation patches, corridors and connectivity. For evaluating landscape variables, remote sensing data and aerial photos were used. When aerial photos were imported into the ERDAS Imagine program, ground control points identified, and individual images orthorectified, land degradation was not found in the use of camping areas. Moreover, manmade areas (road, car park and hotel) observably increased, thus decreasing the forest lands. The findings show that the land use types that have had the greatest ecological impact are transhumance and construction of hotels, which also require infrastructure development. The intensity of the ecological effects mandates precautions to lessen the impacts and the need for continuing assessment to ensure sustainable use of the area.";"Çakir, Günay

This paper uses satellite data, primary field data and secondary information on Romania's social, political and economic dynamics, in a mixed‐method case study analysis of the drivers of, and responses to, environmental change and land degradation over the period 1984–2007. The analytical time frame encompasses the Socialist era, as well as transition to European Union membership, allowing identification of the ways in which the dominant political economic and social systems interact with biophysical factors and play out in the landscape. Although the Socialist era is often portrayed as environmentally destructive, results indicate that management during this time developed a relatively stable landscape, albeit at an economic and social cost. In the lead up to the collapse of Socialist governance, the landscape altered more, resulting in worsening land degradation and land cover change. Responses to land degradation have taken two main routes: land abandonment and tree planting. Although aspects of these responses are now more democratic and participatory, at the same time, they share some common ground with Socialist era approaches. Building on the positive aspects of Socialist management strategies yields important lessons in addressing land degradation challenges more broadly.

"AGRIS:US201400057174";"Global drivers setting desertification research priorities: insights from a stakeholder consultation forum";"";"Recent rapid changes in global scale drivers of desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD) have two important consequences for drylands. First, changes in these drivers, for example in food and energy prices, make improving interventions in drylands more urgent because of their potential impacts. Second, these changes introduce new knowledge gaps regarding both the potential impacts on social‐ecological dryland systems and the design of options to take advantage of opportunities. This paper identifies the most salient research needs in DLDD in drylands brought on by global drivers. The question was addressed through an iterative stakeholder consultative forum. First, relevant global scale drivers were identified through a literature review and preliminary consultation. Next, stakeholders and experts were further consulted to identify research priorities given rise to by these drivers. Identified research priorities were as follows: (i) assessing impacts of rising prices on DLDD in mixed market and subsistence production contexts; (ii) assessing options and limits of agricultural modernisation on fragile lands; (iii) developing methods for assessing land‐use trade‐offs and mapping productive lands; (iv) modelling and participatory methods for monitoring and evaluating soil carbon sequestration; (v) developing policy frameworks to regulate impacts of investment on the environment and local livelihoods; (vi) participatory modelling for regional and local adaptation planning; and (vii) valuation of non‐market land degradation outcomes including biodiversity loss. Concluding, we call for a forward‐looking interdisciplinary drylands research agenda with an increased emphasis on governance to address these priorities.

"AGRIS:US201400057177";"Farming systems in two less favoured areas in portugal: their development from 1989 to 2009 and the implications for sustainable land management";"";"Since the late 1980s, sustainable land management is one of the objectives of the European Commission in Less Favoured Areas. In this paper, we investigate the economic and environmental sustainability of farming systems in two less favoured areas in Centro and Alentejo areas of Portugal. The specific objectives were the following: (i) to characterise the farming systems; (ii) to analyse their development over a 20‐year period (1989–2009); and (iii) to investigate to what extent these farming systems contribute to sustainable land management. The diversity of the farming systems was identified through a survey and cluster analysis and compared with the Farm Accountancy Data Network classification on types of farming. Indicators on the economic and environmental sustainability were estimated, namely, farm net income, return to labour and rotation management, on the basis of a survey, Farm Accountancy Data Network database and Landsat imagery, respectively. Results indicate an increased focus on livestock in the past 20 years (1989–2009). In Centro, rotation management was not affected. The small ruminant farms have been able to retain a positive farm net income but that was only possible with a below average return to labour. In Alentejo, the increased focus on livestock, cattle in particular, led to an intensification of fodder production on certain plots. Mixed crop–livestock farms show a negative farm net income since 1995 and depend heavily on subsidies to remain viable. As other studies in southern Europe have shown, farm strategies have often been directed towards lowering labour inputs, lowering forage deficits through on‐farm produced resources and acquiring subsidies.

"AGRIS:US201400111986";"GIS methodological proposal to evaluate suitable areas for greenhouse installation";"";"Nowadays in Italy about 30% of greenhouses are conditioned and a part of them are also monitored by computers that, using specific softwares, are able to control temperature, humidity, CO2 content, intensity and light duration, etc., making the greenhouse microclimate as suitable as possible for vegetable crops and flower needs. Economically, this control and conditioning can be very expensive especially if greenhouses have been localized and built in an area that, for its climatic and/or morphological characteristics, is not appropriate. Therefore, to choose the right localization where to build up greenhouses a framework can be useful to decrease energy expending and technical inputs. This paper illustrates a GIS (Geographical Information System) methodological proposal with the aim to evaluate the suitability of Basilicata Region (Southern Italy) land for greenhouse installation with respect to energy saving. Ten years climatic data, recorded in 37 different stations, Basilicata morphological characteristics (elevation, slope, etc.) and land cover information have been inputted and processed to develop the proposed method, that takes advantage by geo-statistics (predictive Kriging) and map algebra potentialities that the modern GIS offers. Data have undergone geo-statistical analysis to create predictive layers, that by mean of map algebra operations have generated firstly two intermediate maps (climatic and morphological suitability for greenhouse setting) and then the final map, that shows the suggested Basilicata Region areas useful for greenhouse installation. Results have reported that in Basilicata Region there are two possible district areas suitable for greenhouse allocations in which climatic trends, morphological characteristics and general facilities better fix protected cultivations needs with reference to lower energy inputs.";"Castronuovo, D.

"AGRIS:US201500183798";"Assessing climate change impacts on the ecohydrology of the Jinghe River basin in the Loess Plateau, China";"";"Quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrology and ecosystem is important in the study of the Loess Plateau, China, which is well known for its high erosion rates and ecosystem sensitivity to global change. A distributed ecohydrological model was developed and applied in the Jinghe River basin of the Loess Plateau. This model couples the vegetation model, BIOME BioGeochemicalCycles (BIOME-BGC) and the distributed hydrological model, Water and Energy transfer Process in Large river basins (WEP-L). The WEP-L model provided hydro-meteorological data to BIOME-BGC, and the vegetation parameters of WEP-L were updated at a daily time step by BIOME-BGC. The model validation results show good agreement with field observation data and literature values of leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and river discharge. Average climate projections of 23 global climate models (GCMs), based on three emissions scenarios, were used in simulations to assess future ecohydrological responses in the Jinghe River basin. The results show that global warming impacts would decrease annual discharge and flood season discharge, increase annual NPP and decrease annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Increasing evapotranspiration (ET) due to air temperature increase, as well as increases in precipitation and LAI, are the main reasons for the decreasing discharge. The increase in annual NPP is caused by a greater increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) than in plant respiration, whilst the decrease in NEP is caused by a larger increase in heterotrophic respiration than in NPP. Both the air temperature increase and the precipitation increase may affect the changes in NPP and NEP. These results present a serious challenge for water and land management in the basin, where mitigation/adaption measures for climate change are desired. Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Associate editor D.

"AGRIS:US201400057178";"Understanding soil conservation decision of farmers in the gedeb watershed, ethiopia";"";"The aim of this study was to investigate the main factors that influence smallholders' adoption decision of soil conservation measures in the Gedeb watershed. Data from 498 household heads who live in the three districts of the watershed were analysed using the binary logistic regression model. We find that farmers need adequate cash to invest in soil conservation measures. Moreover, farmers would be more encouraged to implement soil conservation measures when they have larger areas of cropland. We explore the possibility that when farmers presume that they have fertile land, they exploit their land more. This hints at the need for extension advice about the benefit of sustainable use of farmers' cropland so that they can maintain their land and pass it on to the future generation. Farmers' awareness about the benefit of land management practices and recognition of the problem erosion is causing on their crop land are central to their decision to adopt soil conservation measures. Furthermore, to adopt these measures, farmers have to be convinced about the effectiveness of these measures. Thus, awareness creation and demonstration of the effectiveness of these measures is essential. Because of the transboundary nature of the problem, policy makers in downstream countries that are suffering from the off‐site impact (e.g. Sudan) would benefit from the information provided and support efforts in the implementation of soil conservation measures.

A multinomial regression model applied to survey data collected in rural Ethiopia underpins the analysis. Results from the discrete choice model indicate that active local-level institutions increase household dependency on open access forests, while land security reduces open access forest dependence. However, local level institutions are found to reduce the role of private fuelwood, while tenure security has not, at least yet, had any impact on private fuelwood collection activities. The results suggest that there is a need to bring more open access forests under the management of the community and increase the quality of community forestry management in order to realize improvements in forest conservation.";"Beyene, Abebe D.

However, it is highly threatened by overgrazing and continuous land degradation and, as a result, proper management is important to improve the livelihood of the people. This study investigated the effectiveness of exclosures established on communal grazing lands to restore soil properties and identified the relationship among soil properties, site and vegetation characteristics, and exclosure age. A space-for-time substitution approach to detect changes in soil properties following the establishment of exclosures on communal grazing lands was used. Replicated (n = 3) 5-, 10-, and 15-year-old exclosures were selected and paired, each exclosure with an adjacent communal grazing land. All exclosures showed higher soil organic matter (OM), total soil nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) than the adjacent grazing lands. The increases in soil properties between exclosures and grazing lands in the 0- to 0.2-m depth varied between 58 and 101% for OM, from 54 to 108% for N, from 26 to 128% for P, and from 18 to 28% for CEC over the grazing lands. Soil properties in exclosures and grazing lands showed significant (p < 0.05) correlations with biomass and vegetation cover indicating that vegetation restoration is a key to restore degraded soils through exclosure establishment. Establishing exclosures on communal grazing lands can be effective in restoring the degraded soils in the semi-arid lowlands of Ethiopia. However, further studies are required on the ecological and economic benefits of future exclosures, as expansion of exclosure could cause grazing pressure on the remaining communal grazing lands.";"Mekuria, Wolde";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land degradation;grazing;grazing lands";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ETH";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400182465";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2012.721858";"";"";"";"153-166"

However, information on how irrigation brings changes in physical and chemical properties of soils in a desert biome is not yet known, though pertinent to land use planning. This study reports influence of irrigation and cropping sequence on physico-chemical properties of soils in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, India. Treatments included three irrigation conditions (not irrigated, low-irrigated, and high-irrigated) and eleven cropping sequences, cotton-gram (C-G), mung bean-mustard (M-Mu), moth bean-wheat (Mo-W), moth bean-mustard (Mo-Mu), cotton-fallow (C-F), cotton-wheat (C-W), cotton-mustard (C-Mu), mung bean-wheat (M-W), moth bean-fallow (Mo-F), mung bean-fallow (M-F), and pearl millet-fallow (P-F). The irrigation reduced soil temperature (9.7 to 12.2%) and bulk density (5.3 to 6.6%), but increased silt (5.1 to 7.2%) and clay (3.8 to 5.4%) content, water holding capacity (50 to 58.3%), moisture content at field capacity (100 to 133.3%), concentration (2.3 to 3.1 times), and stock (2.2 to 3.0 times) of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (4 to 8 times), available phosphorus (1.82 to 2.1 times), and potassium (25.9 to 67.1%). These changes were higher in the high-irrigated than the low-irrigated conditions. Cropping sequences C-W, C-Mu, and C-G sequestered more SOC and retained higher microbial biomass carbon, whereas M-Mu, Mo-W, Mo-Mu and M-W maintained the highest level of phosphorus and potassium. These observations suggest that irrigation and cropping sequence are promising management options for enhancing carbon sequestration in soils, which may reduce desertification in the Thar Desert and other similar deserts in the hot tropics.";"Singh, S.

To achieve this, an integrated suitability assessment was conducted considering soil resources, relief/slope, and water resources and forms the focus of the present study. The soils were classified using Soil Taxonomy (ST). Land suitability for irrigated agriculture has been assessed using standard land suitability method of the FAO Land Evaluation Framework, using the criteria including salinity, hard pan, water table depth, gypsum, and texture. Because of the significance of slope and relief for managing and using soils in the study area, a separate assessment was conducted. The assessment culminated into 2416 ha (0.03%) highly suitable; 309,265 ha (5.4%) moderately suitable; 1550 × 10³ ha (27%) marginally suitable; 1753 × 10³ ha (31%) temporarily unsuitable; and 2108 × 10³ ha permanently unsuitable. Additionally, lack of sufficient fresh water resources is considered as one of the major problems facing agricultural expansion and sustainable development in the study area. Therefore, integration has been made between land suitability results and water availability, expressed by water salinity. For this purpose, an intersection has been carried out between the groundwater salinity map and the land suitability map using ArcGIS to find areas with high potential for agricultural expansion. The overall suitability revealed 220,000 ha with high potential for agricultural expansion considering land suitability and availability of fresh water, giving a chance to add 150,000 ha, to the existing cultivated area of 70,000 ha.";"Abdelfattah, Mahmoud Ali";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use planning;land suitability;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ARE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400182461";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2012.722579";"";"";"";"41-64"

Such strategies can build on existing freshwater conservation activities, and incorporate predicted climate change impacts. We illustrate this concept with three case studies. In the Upper Klamath Basin of the western USA, a shift in land management practices would buffer this landscape from a declining snowpack. In the Murray-Darling Basin of south-eastern Australia, identifying the requirements of flood-dependent natural values would better inform the delivery of environmental water in response to reduced runoff and less water. In the Savannah Basin of the south-eastern USA, dam managers are considering technological and engineering upgrades in response to more severe floods and droughts, which would also improve the implementation of recommended environmental flows. Even though the three case studies are in different landscapes, they all contain significant freshwater biodiversity values. These values are threatened by water allocation problems that will be exacerbated by climate change, and yet all provide opportunities for the development of effective climate adaptation strategies.";"Aldous, Allison

Thus, both aspects of biodiversity are worthy of conservation. Simultaneously conserving richness and evenness might be difficult, however, if, for example, the restoration of previously absent species to low densities brings a cost in reduced evenness. Using metaâanalysis, we searched for benefits to biodiversity following adoption of two common landâmanagement schemes: the implementation of organic practices by farmers and of controlled burning by naturalâland managers. We used rarefaction to eliminate sampling bias in all of our estimates of richness and evenness. Both conservation practices significantly increased evenness and overall abundance across taxonomic classifications (arthropods, birds, nonâbird vertebrates, plants, soil organisms). Evenness and richness varied independently, leading to no richnessâevenness correlation and no significant overall change in richness. Demonstrating the importance of rarefaction, analyses of raw data that did not receive rarefaction indicated misleadingly strong benefits of organic agriculture and burning for richness while underestimating true gains in evenness. Both organic farming and burning favored species that were not numerically dominant, reâbalancing communities as uncommon species gained individuals. Our results support the assertion that richness and evenness capture separate facets of biodiversity, each needing individual attention during conservation.";"Crowder, David W.

The policies considered here include the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by itself as well as combined with current biofuel tax credits or a carbon price policy. We use a dynamic, spatial, multi-market equilibrium model, Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model (BEPAM), to endogenously determine the effects of these policies on cropland allocation, food and fuel prices, and the mix of first and second-generation biofuels. We find that the increase in crop prices under the RFS is likely to be less than 20% in most cases and this increase is much smaller when the RFS is accompanied by volumetric subsidies or a carbon price policy since these policies induce a switch away from corn ethanol to cellulosic biofuels. The impact of the RFS on GHG emissions reduction in the U.S. is fairly modest in size but increases when the RFS is accompanied by volumetric subsidies or a carbon price policy. However, domestic savings in GHG emissions achieved by the RFS can be severely eroded by the indirect land use changes and the rebound effect on global gasoline consumption. The net reductions in global GHG emissions are largest when the RFS is accompanied by a carbon price policy.";"Chen, Xiaoguang

"AGRIS:US2016200705";"Benefit-cost Analysis of the Waffle: Initial Assessment";"";"An option to mitigating flood damages in the Red River Basin is the concept of using hundreds or thousands of ‘micro-basin’ storage areas comprised of roads and adjacent lands to retain a sufficient volume of water over a reasonable period in the spring to lower the flood crest heights on streams and rivers throughout the basin.  This concept has been referred to as the Waffle. The present value of costs and benefits of implementing, maintaining, and operating the Waffle were estimated for a 50-year period.  Costs included land enrollment expenses, landowner payments, infrastructure modifications and installations, and maintenance and administrative overhead.  Data relating river crest heights with probability of flood occurrence and expected damages to residential and commercial properties and public infrastructure provided the basis for estimating benefits of the Waffle.  The relationships between river crest heights and flood damages were adjusted for future population change and change in the value of real property over the 50-year period.  Benefits were derived from changes in crest heights and flood event probabilities due to the Waffle influencing the expected river crest heights for various flood events, and reflected the difference between flood damage with and without the Waffle in four urban areas in the Basin. The analysis used numerous scenarios that reflected different expectations in Waffle size, cost, water storage capacity, crest height reductions, and future population.  The combination of those situations produced 108 separate estimates of the net benefits of the Waffle.  Net benefits were positive in 106 of the 108 scenarios evaluated.  The magnitude of net benefits over the 50-year period were substantial: 85 percent of the scenarios evaluated resulted in over $300 million in net benefits and nearly half of the combinations had net benefits in excess of $500 million.  The results from two alternative analyses showed that the Waffle produced substantial net benefits when only used for relatively large floods (greater than 100-year events) and also revealed that the Waffle is not economically sensitive to the inclusion or absence of high-frequency flood damages from Fargo/Moorhead. Overall, the economic feasibility of the Waffle, given the limited scope of benefits included in the study, was almost entirely determined by mitigated flood damages from Fargo/Moorhead.  Without mitigated flood damages from Fargo/Moorhead, results from this study suggest the Waffle would only be economically in a limited number of situations (11 of 108 possibilities) if implemented on a basin-wide scale.  Recent improvements and additions to structural flood protection in Wahpeton/Breckenridge and Grand Forks/East Grand Forks eliminate the potential to mitigate flood damages from all but the largest flood events.  The positive results from this study suggest that dedicating additional resources to solving or answering many of the remaining issues with the Waffle would be justified.";"Bangsund, Dean A.

"AGRIS:US201400102919";"framework for adaptive monitoring of the cumulative effects of human footprint on biodiversity";"";"Effective ecological monitoring is imperative in a human-dominated world, as our ability to manage functioning ecosystems will depend on understanding biodiversity responses to anthropogenic impacts. Yet, most monitoring efforts have either been narrowly focused on particular sites, species and stressors — thus inadequately considering the cumulative effects of multiple, interacting impacts at scales of management relevance — or too unfocused to provide specific guidance. We propose a cumulative effects monitoring framework that integrates multi-scaled surveillance of trends in biodiversity and land cover with targeted evaluation of hypothesized drivers of change. The framework is grounded in a flexible conceptual model and uses monitoring to generate and test empirical models that relate the status of diverse taxonomic groups to the nature and extent of human “footprint” and other landscape attributes. An adaptive cycle of standardized sampling, model development, and model evaluation provides a means to learn about the system and guide management. Additional benefits of the framework include standardized data on status and trend for a wide variety of biodiversity elements, spatially explicit models for regional planning and scenario evaluation, and identification of knowledge gaps for complementary research. We describe efforts to implement the framework in Alberta, Canada, through the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute, and identify key challenges to be addressed.";"Burton, A. Cole

Three maps were obtained as results: a map showing the provision of recreation services, an aesthetic value map and a map of the correspondences and differences between both services. The data obtained in the participation processes were found useful for the validation of the maps. A weak spatial correlation was found between aesthetic quality and recreation provision services, with an overlap of the highest values for both services only in 7.2� % of the area. A consultation with decision-makers indicated that the results were considered useful to identify areas that can be targeted for improvement of landscape and recreation management.";"Casado-Arzuaga, Izaskun

Despite increasing conservation efforts, loss of biodiversity is still accelerating. Considering land scarcity and demand for alternative uses, efficiency in conservation strongly correlates with efficiency in land allocation. Systematic conservation planning can effectively prioritize conservation activities. Previous studies minimize opportunity costs for given conservation targets. However, these studies assume constant marginal costs of habitat protection. We extend this cost minimization approach by also considering a dynamic representation of marginal costs. The more land is allocated to nature reserves, the higher are opportunity costs, i.e., costs of forgone agricultural production. This increase in costs results from changes in the prices of agricultural commodities. We employ a deterministic, spatially explicit mathematical optimization model to allocate species habitats by minimizing opportunity costs for setting aside land for conservation purposes. The model is designed as a mixed integer programming problem and solved with GAMS/CPLEX. Our results show the need for integrating land market feedbacks into conservation planning. We find that ignoring land rent adjustments can lead to highly cost-ineffective solutions in reserve selection.";"Jantke, Kerstin

In this paper, we draw from our collective research and development experience with mobile pastoralists and discuss how non-governmental organisations have used ordinances and bureaucratic procedures to protect pastoral resources, in particular transhumance corridors that connect seasonal grazing lands in the far north region. We argue that the mobile pastoral system is best understood as an open system and explain what the implications are for the protection of pastoral resources. We argue that delimiting and protecting transhumance corridors is not the panacea, and we conclude with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.";"Moritz, Mark

Egypt's share of Nile waters is fixed at 55.5 billion cubic meters annually. As a result, Egypt will not be able to meet increasing water demand using freshwater from the Nile and has been developing non-conventional wastewater reuse strategies to meet future demands. The USAID Mission in Cairo began promoting strategies for water reuse in 2004, and guidelines for safe and direct reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural purposes were approved in 2005 (Egyptian Code 501/2005). Twenty-four man-made forests were established that have been useful for assessing the efficacy of using treated wastewater for afforestation. At present, approximately 4,340 hectares are under irrigation with treated wastewater, utilizing a total daily volume of 467,400 cubic meters. Wastewater has been applied to trees along roads, greenbelts in cities, and woody production systems. Currently, a joint USDA Forest Service—Agricultural Research Service technical assistance team has been evaluating the feasibility of scaling up such afforestation efforts throughout Egypt. We describe information about: 1) suitable tree species that have been identified based on local soil characteristics, water quality, and quantity of water supply; 2) the benefits and consequences of using these species; 3) strategies to maximize the potential of afforestation with regard to improving water quality, maximizing resource production, increasing biodiversity, and limiting commercial inputs; and 4) potential long-term impacts on the natural resource base from afforestation.

This paper presents ALSE, an intelligent system for assessing land suitability for different types of crops in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. mango, banana, papaya, citrus, and guava) based on geo-environmental factors that automates the process of evaluation and illustrates the results on an attribute table. Its main features include support of GIS capabilities on the digital map of an area with the FAO-SYS framework model with some necessary modifications to suit the local environmental conditions for land evaluation, and the support of expert knowledge through on spatial tools to derive criteria weights with their relative importance. A dynamic program for calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a weighting matrix is provided. Expertise and knowledge help ensure that ALSE databases represent realistic, practicable and functional systems. It is useful for decision makers to determine the quality of land for agricultural uses and is intended as a decision and planning support. Responsibility for any decisions based partly or wholly on the output of ALSE rests with the decision maker. ALSE ensures that the results are interpreted correctly within the relevant context, and contributes by maximizing land-use planning and decision support.";"Elsheikh, Ranya

In this paper we present the development of a semi-quantitative place-based method, aiming at assessing GI based on the provision potential of all main ES. Our method combines a wide spectrum of GIS data with expert assessments. Here we focus especially on how interaction with experts and local and regional actors impacted the method development. Our results showed that involving experts in dataset selection is very useful in compiling the most relevant data for the assessment of ES. Expert knowledge is also valuable in evaluating the actual coverage and quality of datasets. By involving both experts and local and regional actors in assessing ES provision potential we can add local knowledge to the general scientific understanding. Qualitative assessments can be complemented with quantitative data in our method. The resulting maps support land use planning, as they assist in identifying the multifunctional key areas of GI and in examining the provision potential of various ES. The group discussions involved in our method provided an additional benefit, as the experts and local and regional actors felt that this discussion platform enhanced their understanding of both GI and ES.";"Kopperoinen, Leena

Risk-based land  management is a concept that stands out more and more frequently in soil policies adopted by different European countries,  as well as within the framework of the future European directive on soil protection. This concept intends to act as a lever for  sustainable solution development in terms of rehabilitation by ensuring the following principles: (1) reduction of risks  (human health, ecosystems) allowing sites to be reused safely (concept of fitness for use); (2) prevention of any pollutant  dispersion risk (concept of environmental protection); (3) long-term care while minimising the burden of controlling,  maintenance and monitoring. These ideas have been taken as backdrop for the Walloon decree on soil remediation and  rehabilitation of disused economic activity sites. Risk control has been taken as a key point for any decision related to  historically polluted sites. However, to be effective, this option stands out that reliable and efficient methodological tools are  available for land evaluation (risk assessment). Three decision-making tools, specifically developed for the intended  applications in the Walloon Region, are presented in the paper: (1) a global risk evaluation method allowing ranking of  polluted sites; (2) a method to decide, at the end of the first step of the investigation procedure (preliminary soil  investigation), whether further investigations are required or not; (3) a methodological procedure to proceed to a detailed risk assessment at the end of the in-depth investigation step. Perspectives are proposed to improve these first tools. It has also  been shown that the challenge of sustainable solutions for the management of polluted sites finally depends on answers that  will be progressively developed by the scientific community.

"AGRIS:US201600011224";"Local assessment of changes in water-related ecosystem services and their management: DPASER conceptual model and its application in Taita Hills, Kenya";"";"Fresh water provisioning is a crucial ecosystem service (ES) in the agrarian societies of East Africa. Water resources are highly dependent on several other ES such as the water retention capacity of vegetation and the purification properties of soil. However, ES are constantly challenged by dynamic changes within water–land–vegetation–human relations. Environmental policies usually address immediate anthropic pressures but overlook multiple historical stressors, or ‘drivers’. This article presents a local assessment of changes in the water-related ES in the Taita Hills, Kenya, applying the Drivers, Pressures, Actions, State, Ecosystem services, Responses (DPASER) model, adapted from the Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses (DPSIR) framework, boosted with ecosystem services and human actions and combined into a historical perspective. A review of the legislation, interviews, participatory mapping, timelines and focus group discussions were used in data gathering. The results indicate that land demarcation in the 1960s and consequent land privatization have been the main drivers of change in water-related ES, since these determined the prioritization of agricultural production over conservation of forests, wetlands and rivers. This case study shows that the degradation of water-related ES is strongly linked to historical development of land ownership and loss of commonality, and suggests enhancement of inter-sectoral management.";"Hohenthal, Johanna

We integrated participatory methods with quantitative analysis, which has allowed us to successfully identify and prioritize the proposed actions. The participatory process has lead to social learning, relationship building and an enhancement of participants’ understanding of other perspectives. Moreover, quantitative analysis has allowed us to identify actions that would have more beneficial effects for the different properties held in the territory, so that we can prioritize needed actions depending on the properties that we want to improve. The participatory process highlighted the importance of taking measures for the more sustainable development of local communities in the biosphere reserve.

Climate change and land degradation are the most obvious of these disturbances and have received much attention. However, easily overlooked, indirect disturbances can also alter ecosystem structure and function. Dust deposition is a prime example of an easily overlooked disturbance process. We hypothesized that historic European settlement and land-clearance in eastern North America led to widespread wind erosion of upland soils and subsequent dust deposition onto otherwise undisturbed peatlands, potentially fertilizing these naturally nutrient-poor ecosystems and causing shifts in plant communities. We tested these hypotheses by analyzing 11 peat profiles collected across a broad region of eastern North America. We documented a strong correlation between the concentrations of Ambrosia pollen grains and microscopic mineral particles, interpreting this as a signal of dust deposition coincident with European settlement and land-clearance. Analysis of Sphagnum macrofossils revealed substantial site-to-site variability in both the degree and the direction of ecological response to dust deposition, but suggested that increasing magnitude of dust deposition increased the likelihood of a decline in the relative abundance of Sphagnum. Results also suggested that raised bogs were more sensitive to dust deposition than kettle peatlands. We conclude that European settlement and land-clearance resulted in widespread dust deposition on peatlands, leading to ecological changes in some of these ecosystems, and leaving behind a coherent dust horizon in the late-Holocene peatland stratigraphy of eastern North America. This easily overlooked indirect disturbance process could be ongoing today in areas of widespread soil disturbance and could potentially further alter dust-receiving ecosystems.";"Ireland, Alex W.

Land management approaches, such as construction of field wetlands, provide one group of mitigation options available to farmers. Although field wetlands are widely used for diffuse pollution control in temperate environments worldwide, there is a shortage of evidence for the effectiveness and viability of these mitigation options in the UK. The Mitigation Options for Phosphorus and Sediment Project aims to make recommendations regarding the design and effectiveness of field wetlands for diffuse pollution control in UK landscapes. Ten wetlands have been built on four farms in Cumbria and Leicestershire. This paper focuses on sediment retention within the wetlands, estimated from annual sediment surveys in the first two years, and discusses establishment costs. It is clear that the wetlands are effective in trapping a substantial amount of sediment. Estimates of annual sediment retention suggest higher trapping rates at sandy sites (0.5–6tha⁻¹yr⁻¹), compared to silty sites (0.02–0.4tha⁻¹yr⁻¹) and clay sites (0.01–0.07tha⁻¹yr⁻¹). Establishment costs for the wetlands ranged from £280 to £3100 and depended more on site specific factors, such as fencing and gateways on livestock farms, rather than on wetland size or design. Wetlands with lower trapping rates would also have lower maintenance costs, as dredging would be required less frequently. The results indicate that field wetlands show promise for inclusion in agri-environment schemes, particularly if capital payments can be provided for establishment, to encourage uptake of these multi-functional features.";"Ockenden, Mary C.

Unlike traditional technical assistance and outreach, knowledge is primarily shared among landowners as opposed to being derived from natural resource professionals. While potentially promising, few studies have investigated these approaches. Through a study of a landowner cooperative in Wisconsin, I report on a finding that considers both the effectiveness of a landowner cooperative in the Upper Midwest (USA) and the social network members rely on in decision-making. The former relies on an importance-performance analysis (IPA) of the services provided by the cooperative and the latter on an egocentric network analysis of members with an emphasis on strong and weak ties. Data were collected via a mail survey to which 146 members (81%) responded. The IPA indicates that the cooperative is providing services with which members are largely satisfied. The network analysis suggests that members, through strong ties, discuss their land with on average three others—primarily natural resource professionals (including cooperative staff), as opposed to other members, neighbors, and kin. However, by virtue of membership, they share weak ties with other members whom they see as trustworthy. The extent to which a network perspective might be applied to similar situations is discussed, as are conceptual implications and future directions.

"AGRIS:TR2010001482";"Carbon management and importance in terrestrial ecosystem";"Karasal ekosistemde karbon yönetimi ve önemi";"Recently, researchers indicated great changes in the chemistry of atmosphere due to faster oxidation of soil organic carbon. The increases of greenhouse gasses especially CO2 concentration can affect climate, plant physiology, microbial activity, soil organic matter, and decomposition. Soil can be a store or source for atmospheric CO2. The amount of soil organic carbon stored in the soil or release to the atmosphere depends on net ecosystem productivity and heterotrophic respiration. Soil management systems with intensive cultivation may stimulate oxidation of old organic matter, and create the soil a source of atmospheric CO2. Similarly, almost lost 50% of organic carbon was lost due to conventional tillage systems and cultivation. Minimum tillage and no-till practices reduce oxidation of soil organic carbon and result net C gain. Thus, atmospheric CO2 can be stored in   soils using these management systems.  The greater level of soil organic carbon can also increase soil quality and fertility.  This indicates our soils can be a greater potential to store atmospheric CO2.

Son yıllarda yapılan çalışmalar, toprak karbon stoklarındaki hızlı oksidasyonun çevrede özellikle atmosferin kimyasında önemli değişmelere neden olduğunu ortaya koymuştur. Atmosferdeki sera gazlarından özellikle CO2'nin miktarındaki artış, iklimi, bitkilerin fizyolojisini, toprağın mikrobiyal aktivitesini ve organik maddenin oluşumunu ve parçalanmasını önemli ölçüde etkiler. Topraklar atmosferdeki karbon için bir depo olabileceği gibi kaynak da olabilir. Bir ekosistemde toprakta depolanan veya topraktan atmosfere salınan C miktarı, net ekosistem üretimi ile ekosistemden atmosfere salınan toplam hetetrofik solunuma bağlıdır. Arazi kullanımına bağlı olarak yoğun toprak işleme, topraktaki organik C'un hızla oksidasyonuna neden olarak toprakların atmosferdeki CO2 için bir kaynak olmasına neden olur. Toprakların yıllardır yapılan geleneksel toprak işleme sonucu başlangıç karbonunun yaklaşık  % 50'si kaybolmuş bulunmaktadır. Minimum sürüm ve sürümsüz tarım teknikleri organik karbonun oksidasyonunu azaltarak toprağın net C kazanımına neden olur. Böylece çeşitli yollarla atmosfere salınmış olan C'nin yeniden toprakta depolanması sağlanabilir. Yüksek organik karbon aynı zamanda toprağın kalitesi ve verimliğini de artırır. Böylece topraklar atmosferdeki karbonun depolanması için  iyi bir kaynak görevi görür.";"Koçyiğit, R., Gaziosmanpaşa Univ., Faculty of Agriculture, Tokat (Turkey).

The National Resources Inventory estimates that 170 thousand acres of the Core were converted from agriculture to other uses between 1982 and 1987, while only about 46 thousand acres of the Fringe were so converted. The conversion rate was much greater in the Core than on the Fringe according to the NRIbut not according to the Census of Agriculture. The number of acres of agricultural land converted for each new resident ranged from 0.15 in Sherburne County to 2.49 in Pierce County. Viewed another way, the increase in urban land to house new residents ranged from 0.28 in Ramsey County to 1.23 acres per person in Isanti County.";"Wegner, Thomas D.

There were determined the key aspects of functioning of developed market of agricultural lands, which should be accounted and controlled by organs of state authority. There were systematized multiple forms and methods of state intervention into market rotation of lands. On this basis there was developed the purpose, tasks and methods of regulation of land rotation for the developing market of lands in the Republic of Belarus. The overall objective of state regulation of the lands rotation consists in the promoting the formation of landed property and land tenure rational structure. Among problems are the following: - Maintenance of target use and counteraction to change of the agricultural lands status; - Protection of the lands from negative influence for steady development of territories; - Creation of conditions for formation of diverse forms of land tenure with the purpose of the civilized land market formation; - Maintenance of a strict liability for infringements of the land legislation.";"Gridyushko, A.N., Belarus State Academy of Agriculture, Gorki (Belarus)";"";"";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"ru";"land policies;land use planning;land use;land administration;research;land management;land economics";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"BLR";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=BY2013000292";"http://elc.baa.by/vestnik2012-4/vestnik_bgsha_4_2012.rar";"";"";"";"11-15"

Vulnerability analysis was conducted on a sample of 802 households in eight districts of Nyanza and Western provinces. Farmers perceived Striga as the major cause of poverty and food insecurity. Both household income and child nutrition indicators showed alarming conditions for the majority of households. The coping strategies and informal safety nets were not capable of addressing the vulnerability issue successfully. A logistic regression model of determinants of poverty was estimated to examine the determinants and correlates of poverty. Results revealed certain characteristics of households that were more likely to be poor: poor access to land and farm assets; high dependency ratio; headed by older farmer with low education attainment; no off-farm work, no cash crops; depend on credit; Striga has been on the farm for long, high perceived yield loss to Striga given high dependency on maize for livelihoods; adopt no integrated Striga control options; and live in Bondo and Vihiga districts. The paper concludes with implications for policy to improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers in the Striga-affected areas of western Kenya.

Quelques enseignements";"";"Permanently maintained pastures in France are often located in less desirable areas of the country and are extensively used for grass based farming, dairy farming an mountainous regions), and suckler farming (cattle and sheep, down into the valleys). These production systems are of interest because they employ practices respectful of the environment and local biodiversity. We conducted observations of 73 cattle suckler farms (12 of which use organic agriculture) located in the Massif Central. We saw that they managed to maintain vast fodder areas, ranging from 1.2 ha of main fodder area per LU for calf producers or sheep producers in semi-montainous areas to 0.6 ha of main fodder area per LU for finishers. For the farms included in our sample, we describe the grass harvesting techniques used, input consumption, and the earnings associated with different production systems. The survival of these farms is tied to Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funding; recent changes to this program are analysed.

Les prairies permanentes qui se sont maintenues en France sont souvent localisées dans les zones défavorisées et exploitées extensivement par des élevages herbagers, laitiers (en montagne) ou allaitants (bovins et ovins, jusqu'en plaine). La priorité donnée à l'herbe pâturée et le très faible emploi d'intrants rendent ces systèmes intéressants car ils respectent déjà l'environnement et sa biodiversité.L'observation d'un échantillon de 73 élevages allaitants bovins (dont 12 en agriculture biologique) du pourtour du Massif central montre qu'ils permettent d'entretenir de vastes surfaces fourragères : la ""surface fourragère entretenue"" est de 1,2 ha SFP/UGB en système bovin Naisseur et ovin de demi-montagne, de 0,60 ha SFP/UGB pour les Naisseurs-engraisseurs. Modes de récolte de l'herbe, consommation d'intrants et revenu des différents systèmes de production de l'échantillon sont présentés.

"AGRIS:US2016214909";"Using Incentives to Buy Land-Use Change in Agriculture for Environmental Benefits";"";"In general, the use of incentive payments to landholders in environmental programs is poorly thought through. This article discusses situations where environmental incentive payments are more likely to be a cost-effective response by environmental funders. It is proposed that incentives can be used in two broad ways: to encourage trialling of new practices by landholders, or to compensate landholders for losses resulting from land-use changes. It appears that environmental funders often do not pay sufficient attention to the differences between these two approaches. The first approach only makes sense if the new practices are 'adoptable', and so are expected to remain attractive to landholders beyond the trialling phase. The importance of adoptability and the factors likely to influence the adoptability of an innovation are discussed. The question of who should pay is relevant to whether incentives are appropriate, but is largely political, rather than economic. The concept of market failure is of little practical relevance to environmental funders wishing to target and prioritise their investments. A set of key questions is proposed for environmental funders to address when considering the potential role of incentives.";"Pannell, David J.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016214909";"http://purl.umn.edu/25397";"";"";"";""

A year after revegetation began, 36 boxes were installed in each of the planted and regrowth areas in 2003, and these were monitored to 2013. Sixteen vertebrate species utilised boxes, which included breeding by four species and two species that were not detected by other survey methods. More boxes were used by fauna in the planting compared to regrowth in all but one audit. Significantly, more boxes were used by reptiles in regrowth than planting, but significantly more by birds in planting than regrowth. Nearly 90 per cent of boxes remained intact over the 10‐year period. While the study's capacity to attribute results to habitat types was limited, the results do add weight to the possibility that nest boxes made of good quality materials can provide valuable habitat for a wide range of species during the early recovery phase of reforestation projects.";"Smith, Geoffrey C.

Guanacos have declined because of competition with sheep for forage, high hunting pressure and habitat degradation. PenÃ­nsula ValdÃ©s is a protected area where sheep ranching is the predominant activity. A ranch formerly dedicated to sheep production was converted into a private wildlife reserve, from which all the sheep were removed in 2005. We studied changes in guanaco abundance inside and outside the reserve after sheep removal, and also plant cover of various vegetation types. We found that guanaco abundance was higher inside than outside the reserve, and increased by three-fold within 3 years. Total plant cover and grass cover were higher inside than outside the reserve. Our results showed that guanacos reacted rapidly to changes in management, and suggest that even at a high density guanacos would not be as damaging to the vegetation as sheep. Although management changes resulted in significant changes in guanaco abundance locally, the size of a protected area influences the persistence of wild populations. A large herbivore such as the guanaco needs to be managed across large areas. We believe it is necessary to implement a management plan for PenÃ­nsula ValdÃ©s that allows for the coexistence of sustainable livestock production and healthy wildlife populations.";"Burgi, MarÃ­a Virginia

Accuracy of the three maps was evaluated using field data. Classification that was based on participatory mapping gave best overall accuracy of 83.7% (κ = 0.783), followed by the decision tree that included textural variables (DT2: overall accuracy of 79.9%, κ = 0.757).

"AGRIS:US201600017068";"Role of Ecological and Economic Factors in the Management of a Spatially Structured Moose Alces alces Population";"";"We present a bioeconomic model for moose Alces alces management in Norway, where two sub-populations of moose are subject to different site-specific mortality rates caused by the spatial distribution of territorial wolf Canis lupus packs, and are coupled by the seasonal migration of moose. The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.";"Nilsen, Erlend B.

"AGRIS:US201301722360";"Methodology to Estimate the Future Extent of Dryland Salinity in the Southwest of Western Australia";"";"In the southwestern agricultural region of Western Australia, the clearing of the original perennial vegetation for annual vegetation-based dryland agriculture has lead to rising saline groundwater levels. This has had effects such as reduced productivity of agricultural land, death of native vegetation, reduced stream water quality and infrastructure damage. These effects have been observed at many locations within the 18 million ha of cleared land. This has lead to efforts to quantify, in a spatially explicit way, the historical and likely future extent of the area affected, with the view to informing management decisions. This study was conducted to determine whether the likely future extent of the area affected by dryland salinity could be estimated by means of developing spatially explicit maps for use in management and planning. We derived catchment-related variables from digital elevation models and perennial vegetation presence/absence maps. We then used these variables to predict the salinity hazard extent by applying a combination of decision tree classification and morphological image processing algorithms. Sufficient objective data such as groundwater depth, its rate of rise, and its concentration of dissolved salts were generally not available, so we used regional expert opinion (derived from the limited existing studies on salinity hazard extent) as training and validation data. We obtained an 87% agreement in the salinity hazard extent estimated by this method compared with the validation data, and conclude that the maps are sufficient for planning. We estimate that the salinity hazard extent is 29.7% of the agricultural land.";"Caccetta, Peter

This approach demands a number of skills—social enquiry, modelling and soft complex systems thinking, which are necessary to facilitate an effective cross-disciplinary dialogue. Underpinning the development of these transdisciplinary skills, and the acceptance of systems as complex and subject to multiple interpretations, is the need to move away from the desire to predict and towards enhancing the capacity to adapt. In terms of methodology, this means the exploration of a range of possible futures rather than the anticipation of any specific future path. In this paper, we present an example of the ‘Integrative Method’ in the context of Mediterranean desertification. The basis of this work has been the need to include stakeholders in the research, planning and implementation of policies and a willingness to step beyond disciplinary paradigms towards an integrative and transdisciplinary approach. This requires an approach that is grounded in systemic thinking, social enquiry, and the need explore the future through a range of conceptual and mathematical models which are accessible to policy makers.";"Oxley, T.

We used biophysical factors identified in previous studies as being influential in forest damage in our decision tree and hurricane wind risk maps. Results show that 31% and 0.5% of the total aboveground carbon storage in the LS and PB, respectively was located in high forest damage risk (HR) zones. Overall 15% and 0.7% of the total timber net volume in the LS and PB, respectively, was in HR zones.

Leading better lives is central to their political practices. In this paper, I aim to elaborate the political practices that attend to these aspirations, interrogations and contests. I examine existing approaches to studying political practices of the rural proletariat. I do this with a focus on India, where the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is in force since 2005. I locate the program against the backdrop of neoliberal transformations in India. I then examine the ways in which the rural proletariat engage with the program, even when other opportunities in the agricultural sector are available. Based on these examinations, I argue that the practices spawned by the program are to be understood as ‘encroachments’ into the extant social customs, norms and habits of rural India. This perspective, I contend, is more fruitful than locating the rural proletariat's engagement with the NREGA as a coping strategy or a tactic of resistance against rural elites.

"AGRIS:US201500204678";"effect of urban heat island on Izmir’s city ecosystem and climate";"";"Depending on the researches done on urban landscapes, it is found that the heat island intensity caused by the activities in any city has some impact on the ecosystem of the region and on the regional climate. Urban areas located in arid and semiarid lands somehow represent heat increase when it is compared with the heat in the surrounding rural areas. Thus, cities located amid forested and temperate climate regions show moderate temperatures. The impervious surfaces let the rainfall leave the city lands faster than undeveloped areas. This effect reduces water’s cooling effects on these lands. More significantly, if trees and other vegetations are rare in any region, it means less evapotranspiration—the process by which trees “exhale” water. Trees also contribute to the cooling of urban lands by their shade. Land cover and land use maps can easily be produced by processing of remote sensing satellites’ images, like processing of Landsat’s images. As a result of this process, urban regions can be distinguished from vegetation. Analyzed GIS data produced and supported by these images can be utilized to determine the impact of urban land on energy, water, and carbon balances at the Earth’s surface. Here in this study, it is found that remote sensing technique with thermal images is a liable technique to asses where urban heat islands and hot spots are located in cities.

"AGRIS:US201400149993";"Nile water pollution and technical efficiency of crop production in Egypt: an assessment using spatial and non-parametric modelling";"";"Agriculture is considered one of the vital activities in Egypt; it consumes about 83� % of the Egyptian Nile water quota. This activity is becoming negatively affected by water pollution causing negative repercussion on land productivity and subsequently food security. This paper assesses the water quality for agriculture along the mainstream of the Nile in Egypt through spatial distributions modelling of total dissolved solids (TDS), using spatial statistical analysis. The study’s sample frame consists of 78 sampling points collected in February 2008 and located on the Nile mainstream and its two branches, Rosetta and Damietta. Exploratory spatial data analysis is carried out on the TDS, followed by plotting and modelling the experimental semi-variogram. Then, cross validation is executed in order to determine the best fitting model. Finally, surface mapping is generated by performing spatial interpolation, using kriging technique. The generated surface map shows that the TDS levels increase from Upper to Lower Egypt, exceeds the standard limit in Beni-Suef and Rosetta branch. In fact, high levels of TDS are known to have a negative effect on Egyptian agriculture through harmfully affecting the soil and consequently the crop yields. Therefore, an analysis of the effect of water pollution on technical efficiency of crop production is conducted using a non-parametric mathematical programming approach to frontier estimation. The results of this estimation indicated that the TDS is overutilized in all governorates except Aswan.";"Abou-Ali, Hala

Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) result in many alterations of the basin water balance. Therefore, to contribute to the methodological development of Brazilian PES, this paper proposes a quantification of hydrological benefits based on conservation measures. We propose basing the PES program on adding the potential water storage increase (WSI) parameter estimated from the runoff curve number model. Two LULC change scenarios were run considering conservation measures on degraded areas. We found that indicators of ED and WSI were compatible tools for driving the eligibility of soil and water conservation measures. However, the water storage parameter seems to be better at managing the PES mechanism because it is based on water prices and can contribute to appreciation of the efforts performed by the rural producers. The use of the SCS-CN method presents greater feasibility as a tool for the implementation of PES programs in ungauged basins. Thus, an analysis of the success of the innovation proposal of the Brazilian PES program allows inferences to be made about the quantification and financial valuation of hydrological benefits of the potential storage increase and current water price.";"Rodrigues, Dulce Buchala Bicca

Internationally, the classical political economy approach to agrarian transitions has been challenged by positions arguing (a) that neoliberalism and the international corporate food regime have led to a new dominant contradiction between the peasantry and multinational agribusiness or (b) that the agrarian question for capital has been bypassed. It is shown that most analyses of the agrarian question in India, including those of Indian Left parties, tend to adhere either to the classical political economy approach, or their analyses are close to the peasantry versus the corporate food regime approach. In spite of this, it is here argued that an empirical analysis of agrarian transition in India lends credence to some aspects of the third position; that is, the argument that the agrarian question for capital has been bypassed.

We applied a morphological analysis tool, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), to explore GI in the Seoul metropolitan area. For input data to run MSPA, we used 30-m pixel-sized land cover data of 2000 and 2009 provided by the Ministry of Environment of Korea. Land cover data are used as foundational information for GI network mapping. Using MSPA, we examined morphological changes in hubs and links from 2000 to 2009 in the metropolitan area as well as in 32 municipalities in Gyeonggi-do, a major part of the metropolitan area. Our analysis showed that the area of hubs in the Seoul metropolis has decreased, while the number of links has dramatically increased, over this 10-year period. This implies that hubs have largely been fragmented into smaller ones with a rapid increase in links in a way that does not conserve and enhance GI. We also compared analysis of network area changes in the Seoul metropolitan area with the environmental conservation value assessment map (ECVAM) currently in use by the government to assess conservation value, and found that the network areas of 2009 mapped by MSPA corresponded to a 87.8 % level to the Grade I areas of the ECVAM, with variation by municipality. From these analyses, we conclude that MSPA is helpful in establishing conservation planning strategies optimized for local and regional contexts. The MSPA also provides a useful tool to complement the ECVAM for improving GI functions.";"Kang, Sangjun

Accordingly, the planned management of restoration has become an important issue in various parts of the world, where environmental conditions can vary widely. Although tree plantations are widely used as a management tool for restoration, there have been few studies addressing the practical aspects of the procedure. I examined effects of tree plantations within the framework of an evaluation of methods for restoring abandoned pasture on Hokkaido, northern Japan. I developed and analyzed vegetation maps spanning the past 57 years for the old-growth site influenced by artificial disturbance; the procedure revealed the pattern of change in the vegetation cover. Matrix model analysis showed that intensive use of plantations contributed to reduction of the area occupied by dwarf bamboo and pasture land (i.e., superior to simple abandonment). Furthermore, the field study of vegetation types and changes in species composition over 20 years suggests that plantations have contributed to a reduction in the effects of factors that inhibit revegetation. However, the establishment of monoculture plantations is frequently viewed skeptically as a procedure that is applied without fundamental ecological knowledge. For sustained management, adequate historical and ecological information on the restoration site should be provided to all stakeholders.";"Shoyama, Kikuko";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"JPN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500212814";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-008-0034-7";"";"";"";"11-23"

These direct changes can result in a series of impacts on regional climate. In this paper, the simulated results over China under the scenario of LUCC using weather research and forecasting model are presented. The period for the simulation is from December 2006 to December 2011. Two experiments are initialized by the LUCC datasets derived from the MODIS data of 2001 and 2008, respectively. The results show that the LUCC in most areas of China reduces the surface albedo and increases the surface temperature. Especially in the Hetao Plain, the magnitude of increased surface temperature is above 0.5� °C in winter, and the increase in winter is more obvious than in summer. The precipitation in the Hetao Plain increases. The sensible heat in most parts of East China is reduced, while the latent heat is increased in most areas of China.";"Wang, Yong-Li

In addition to rich species richness and diversity, Island systems are the sites of high endemism and any threat to these ecosystems will consequently lead to loss and extinction of species. To understand the dynamics including feedbacks of these changes in phytodiversity of North Andaman Islands, a conceptual framework is proposed which focuses on understanding the land-use and land-cover changes and its impact with phytodiversity. In considering land-use and land-cover changes this work highlights the direct and indirect drivers of changes—socio-economic, biophysical and climatic factors. Migration of population, their socio economic needs and government policies were identified as major driving forces threatening the phytodiversity of these Islands. Apart from human beings, natural disasters like tsunami and introduced herbivorous animals like elephants also contributed to forest destruction in these Islands. The integrated analysis based on such framework will provide insights for holistic resource management including ecological conservation.";"Prasad, P. Rama Chandra

It has been postulated that occupants living on higher levels of a building would benefit from better ventilation and direct sunlight and thus less likely to contract infectious respiratory diseases. On the contrary, those on lower floors amid the dense clusters of high-rises are more susceptible to TB infection because of poorer air quality from street-level pollution and lesser exposure to direct sunlight.

"AGRIS:US201600032713";"Innovation impacts on biomass supply in Maine's logging industry";"";"A robust supply chain is critical to ensure a sustainable supply of feedstock to the existing and emerging bioenergy and bioproducts industries. Logging contractors are a key group in this process, since they provide harvesting and transportation services, and their success is directly linked to innovation activities. Surprisingly, very little is known about the innovation system in the logging industry-especially about how it relates to biomass supply. Failure to understand how logging contractors adopt and implement biomass production technologies could lead to failed innovation efforts, unmet development goals, and a lack of properly equipped contractors. This article presents results from a series of case studies of highly innovative logging contractors in Maine. All of the firms had some experience producing biomass within their operations. The firms had also used multiple biomass harvesting technologies. This study highlights the variation in challenges that led to the adoption (or rejection) of biomass as a product innovation--with particular emphasis on harvesting technologies. A major finding of this study was the need for a high degree of collaboration between landowners, logging contractors, and biomass consuming facilities in the innovation process. The future development of the biomass industry is highly dependent on contractors adopting biomass harvesting and related technologies. The innovation process of logging firms is an area that is not sufficiently studied, and this research provides valuable insight into this important component of the forest biomass industry.";"Stone, Ian Joseph

In the paper, 13 landscape change types were proposed for the analysis of major developmental trends in the study area during the last 50 years. The described landscape change types derived from land cover databases of four time horizons, allowed us to identify and understand some of the spatial and temporal trends of landscape development related to main social and economic changes, which happened during the second half of the 20th century. Results show that during the last 50 years, the 63.9% of the study area changed.

Measurements of criteria air contaminants were made at ground level, 10 m, 30 m, and 60 m from curb side, and at 9 m height, 10 m from curb side along a traffic corridor carrying over 34,000 vehicles per day. Pollutant decay with distance or height was not statistically significant for O₃, CO, or SO₂. No clear distance decay pattern emerged for PM₂.₅. Compared to concentrations at ground level 30 m from curb side, concentrations at 10 m, 60 m, and 10 m at 9 m height were 83%, 45% and 54% higher, respectively. For NO, NO₂, and NOₓ, however, there was a statistically significant decline in concentrations with distance with the decay most apparent from 30 m to 60 m from the road. Concentrations at 10 m from curb side at 9 m height were equivalent to (all wind conditions) or less than (downwind conditions) those at 30 m and ground level. These findings suggest that for protection of public health in the near road environment, vertical distance is an important determinant of exposure to pollutants that are key indicators of traffic related air pollution.

Emerging carbon emission reduction legislation outlines a regulatory cap-and-trade system with provisions for significant domestic forest-related offsets. Given the opportunity for forest carbon offsets in the United States, there exists minimal enquiry regarding the attitudes of nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners regarding the management of their forestland for carbon sequestration and trading. The current research uses a nationwide survey of forest landowners and investigates the effect of land characteristics, land-use planning, and demographics on NIPF owners' attitudes toward these carbon sequestration opportunities. Overall, only 37% of respondents held positive attitudes regarding the management of their forestland for carbon sequestration and trading.

However, in many developing countries like Benin, former management strategies kept human from protected areas using coercion. Fortunately, more recent regimes attempt to give local populations more control on the management but little is known about local residents' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward the management of these areas. This study, carried out around the Pendjari National Park, determined factors which support local communities' positive perceptions towards biodiversity conservation in the park, analysed their assessment of current park management activities compared to former management approaches and draw the implications for effective participatory management of protected areas. We collected socio-demographic data from 164 residents on their awareness of conservation methods. We used Stepwise Discriminant Analysis to differentiate the variables that had the greatest power for discriminating between local residents' perception to conserve or not biodiversity and to manage the park. The findings indicated that the positive behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within Pendjari National Park was highly correlated with the current management strategy that involved more effectively local communities, the educational level of participants and their geographical origins. Participants' perceptions of biodiversity conservation were strongly related to locally perceived benefits. Although 89% of participants were favorable to the concept of biodiversity conservation within the park, the decision to ban encroachments due to agricultural activities increased negative opinion on this park management option. Our results suggested that understanding local residents' perceptions and using them as a starting point to improve the park-people relationship could help park management staff to involve more effectively local communities and improve their awareness about biodiversity conservation within the park.";"Vodouhê, Fifanou G.

The approach is based on a theoretical and empirical analysis of the bio-economic production interactions between marketed outputs and non-marketed ecosystem services at the micro level. To frame the economic nature of the problem, we employ a generalized joint production model in combination with cost minimization. The generalized joint production framework allows for the consideration of complementary, supplementary and competitive relationships between agricultural production and non-marketed ecosystem services generation and avoids double counting. From this theoretical model we distinguish three theoretical cases depending on the imposed minimum acceptable level of the non-marketed ecosystem services. We employ farm level panel data for the UK to empirically investigate these cases. More specifically, to represent and evaluate the production structure, we estimate first- and second-order elasticities derived from a flexible transformation function. Results show that the majority of farms produce agricultural output and ecosystem services in a complementary relationship. Generation of multiple ecosystem services on the same farm showed either a supplementary or competitive relationship. Changing the composition of the ecosystem services output would have very different implications for individual farms.";"Wossink, Ada

The optimal measures (erosion-preventive land planning, afforestation and amelioration techniques, hydromelioration, crop selection, crop rotation and tillage) for every agro-landscape type was developed. For Type I rectilinear-rectangular field design, one-row forest stripes, intensive crop rotations and energy-saving tillage are preferable. All crops may be cultivated. For Type II agro-landscapes rectilinear-contour field design, erosion-preventive hydraulic structures on extended catchment areas, narrow-row cereal crops are used. Black fallows are substituted with sown and green-manured fallows, soil-protection tillage can be at the depth of 16-18 cm deep. In Types III and IV agro-landscapes, a contour-parallel territory design, erosion-preventive hydraulic structures, grassed waterways, preventive grass stripes, and soil-protection crop rotations with 25-75% of perennial grasses, and deep soil-protective tillage are used.

Выделено 5 основных типов агроландшафтов: I тип - агроландшафты на пологих склонах до 1 град., не подверженные водной эрозии, с низким уровнем экологического риска; II тип - агроландшафты на склонах до 2 град., эрозионно-опасные, слабосмытые, снижение продуктивности достигает до 20%, уровень риска - умеренный; III тип - агроландшафты на склонах крутизной 2-3 град. и 3-5 град., со слабосмытыми (до 80%) и среднесмытыми (до 20%) почвами, снижение продуктивности достигает 21-30%, уровень экологического риска - повышенный; IV тип - склоны крутизной 5-7 град., земли слабосмытые (до 70%) и среднесмытые (30%), продуктивность снижается более 40%, уровень риска - умеренный кризис; V тип - земли, непригодные для интенсивного использования, уровень риска - повышенный кризис. Для каждого типа агроландшафта был разработан оптимальный набор мероприятий (противоэрозионная организация территории, приёмы лесомелиорации, гидромелиорации, подбор культур, севооборотов, обработка почвы). Для I типа агроландшафтов предпочтительна прямолинейно-прямоугольная организация полей, однорядные лесные полосы. Могут высеваться все культуры, использоваться интенсивные севообороты и энергосберегающие приёмы обработки почвы. Для агроландшафтов II типа используется прямолинейно-контурный способ организации, противоэрозионные гидротехнические сооружения на больших водосборах, культуры сплошного сева, чистые пары заменяются на занятые и сидеральные, почвозащитная обработка может выполняться на глубину 16-18 см. В III и IV типах агроландшафта применяется контурно-параллельная организация территории, противоэрозионные гидротехнические сооружения, залуженные водотоки, буферные полосы, почвозащитные севообороты с насыщением от 25 до 75% многолетних трав, глубокие почвозащитные обработки.";"Vol'nov, V.V., Altai Research and Development Inst. of Agriculture, Barnaul (Russian Federation)

Unfortunately, gathering primary, siteâspecific data is costly. As a result, a popular alternate method is to conduct a âbenefit transferâ (applying economic value estimates from one location to a similar site in another location). Among the potential pitfalls of such an approach, the correspondence (or lack thereof) between the locations is probably the most important for evaluating the probable validity of the benefit transfer. A common type of benefit transfer in ecosystem service valuation applies an estimate of value per hectare to all areas having the same landâcover or habitat type, and is particularly susceptible to errors resulting from lack of correspondence. Enhancing the use of benefit transfers in this and other ecosystem service applications requires paying closer attention to simple guidelines, developed by economists, for improving validity and accuracy.";"Plummer, Mark L";"";"Ecological Society of America";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600193205";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/080091";"";"";"";"38-45"

Our case study, carried out in the Beni department of Bolivia, does not contradict this assertion, but shows that collective rights have been granted in areas where ecological contexts and market facilities were less favourable to intensive land use. Previous experiences suggest investigating political processes in order to understand the criteria according to which access rights were distributed. Based on remote sensing and on a multi-level land governance framework, our research confirms that land placed under collective rights, compared to individual property, is less affected by deforestation among Andean settlements. However, analysis of the historical process of land distribution in the area shows that the distribution of property rights is the result of a political process based on economic, spatial, and environmental strategies that are defined by multiple stakeholders. Collective titles were established in the more remote areas and distributed to communities with lower productive potentialities. Land rights are thus a secondary factor of forest cover change which results from diverse political compromises based on population distribution, accessibility, environmental perceptions, and expected production or extraction incomes.";"Bottazzi, Patrick

We studied the endozoochorous dispersal of viable seeds by the grey partridge Perdix perdix in agricultural landscape. We assessed the content of intact seeds in 609 grey partridge droppings coming from 21 sampling sites in Poland that included three land-cover types (winter cereals, winter oil-seed rape and stubble fields). We found 159 intact seeds of 13 plant species. Most of them are classified as plants without any evolved adaptations to dispersal. The number of intact seeds retrieved from droppings was positively correlated with the proportion of seeds and negatively correlated with total proportion of leaves in the diet. This result may indicate that the consumption of large numbers of seeds increases the possibility that some of them will resist digestion and be excreted with faeces. Our results showed that the highest number of intact seeds recovered from the droppings coming from stubble fields was the consequence of the importance of weed seeds in the diet of grey partridge in this type of land-cover. The grey partridge is a poor seed disperser and rather, it plays an important role as a predator of weed seeds.";"Orłowski, Grzegorz

The study summarizes land use change, land management and planning practices in the urban fringe over a period of 20 years with the aim of introducing a sustainable land use policy in highly fragmented suburban land. The processes and dynamics of land use change are explored using cartographic and landscape metrics analysis. The liberal-conservative planning practices have resulted in ad hoc allocation solutions which have created dramatic changes in land use in Estonia during the 1990s and 2000s. The patchy and scattered suburban land is formed by occupying former agricultural land, natural grasslands and forests. In the framework of physical planning, the land use, spatial and urban changes are related to master plans. The nature of the evolution of land management and the deficiencies of institutional framework are discussed as factors in inefficient land use in the sprawling suburbs. A further debate on the feasibility of encouraging land use diversity in peri-urban zones is advocated.";"Roose, Antti

This small-scale study used bat activity as a measure of the use of riparian and up-slope zones along headwater streams by bats, and to determine whether past timber harvesting influenced the use of these areas by bats by comparing regrowth with no retained riparian buffers and mature forest. This study found no significant differences in bat activity between treatments, but did find a trend of higher bat activity in riparian zones compared to up-slope zones, particularly in regrowth forest. However, many sites had little to no bat activity indicating activity was influenced by factors not measured in this study. Despite limited data, this study highlights the potential value of retaining riparian habitat in harvested forests for bats, as is practised elsewhere in Australia, and the need for future research into the effectiveness of forest retention measures for wildlife.";"Cawthen, Lisa

"AGRIS:CZ2010000286";"Sustainable land management by restoration of short water cycles and prevention of irreversible matter losses from topsoils";"";"Sustainable land management requires that water and matter (nutrients and base cations) are efficiently recycled within ecosystems so that irreversible losses of matter from topsoils are minimised. Matter losses are connected to water flow. The division of water into evapotranspiration that is loss-free, and seepage to groundwater or surface water flow that both carry material losses, is decisive in determining total losses of dissolved matter in a given catchment. Investigations of areal matter losses confirmed the instrumental role of vegetation cover. Areal matter losses measured in agricultural catchments in Germany were on average between 1-1.5 tons of dissolved matter per ha per year, i.e. some 50 to 100 times higher than those from unmanaged land in a virgin forest. Such high losses continuously reduce soil fertility and can hardly be compensated by fertilisation. Some suggestions on how to achieve sustainable management of agricultural land and maintain high soil fertility are presented - the priority is to close water and matter cycles through the incorporation of more natural vegetation cover into our landscapes and to restore the energy-dissipative properties of ecosystems.";"Ripl, W.,Technische Univ.

To counteract the wasteful use of good quality farmlands by other land uses, we have developed a quantitative method for land evaluation. By splitting up soil map symbols, we have drawn up suitabilility maps for cultivation and for grazing. Farming factors, such as slope, closeness to the farmhouses and size of the farmland blocks, were integrated in the soil suitability map with the help of a geographic information system. The multiplication of the weighted coefficients linked to these factors lead to a global farmland evaluation map. This method has been tested in 10 districts of the Walloon Region.

An important implication of such sorting arises if variation in preferences over environmental attributes is correlated with household activities affecting the local ecosystem, such as the replacement of native vegetation with lawns, and the removal of course woody habitat from a lake. In this case the sorting process may engender differential evolution of local ecosystems (lakes) with the same initial ecological state. The model examined in the paper has the potential to statistically examine this issue, and therefore holds promise for understanding the behavioral implications of land use policies designed to protect local ecosystems. By facilitating the grouping of different types of households onto different lakes, for instance, lakeshore zoning policies may engender differentiation in the ecological evolution of lakes beyond what would be expected from the zoning policies themselves.";"Provencher, Bill

Our study focused on the Amazon basin, where small-scale farmers widely practice shift- ing cultivation. The objective was to identify the diversity in land use after initial slash-and- burn land clearing among migrant peasants. Our research aimed at documenting typical crop sequences, plant species composition and specific lengths of particular phases of shifting cultivation cycles on the basis of farmers re-lated field histories. Land use was examined in two settlements: Antonio Raimondi and Pimen-tal in Ucayali region, Peru. Data was gathered via semi-structured questionnaires that focused on the socio-demographic characterization of agriculture-dependent households and their land use characteristics. More in-depth as-sessments of crop occurrence, cropping se-quence and length of the different shifting cul-tivation cycles were conducted on 114 fields in Pimental and 44 fields in Antonio Raimondi. In-terview analysis showed that in both villages, forest cover has substantially decreased over the last 10 years. Results also indicate consid-erable variation in swidden-fallow systems. Whereas settlers in Antonio Raimondi plant annual crops after slashing and burning the forest, settlers in Pimental gave more impor-tance to perennial crops. Progress in deforesta-tion and land degradation is relatively more pronounced in the younger settlement (Antonio Raimondi). These differences are likely caused by the different social backgrounds of settlers and histories of each site. Small-scale farmers in the study area are now facing a problem with the transition from shifting cultivation to sed-entary farming. Farmers in areas with a preva-lence of annual cropping use a significantly shorter fallow period, which causes a higher rate of forest degradation. As annual cropping seems to be unsustainable in relation with for-est degradation, farmers should either use a longer natural fallow to sustain longer cropping cycles, or shift to tree-based land use systems.";"Bohdan Lojka

This paper describes the SMAPEx sampling strategy and presents an overview of the data collected during the three experiments: SMAPEx-1 (July 5-10, 2010), SMAPEx-2 (December 4-8, 2010) and SMAPEx-3 (September 5-23, 2011). The SMAPEx experiments were conducted in a semi-arid agricultural and grazing area located in southeastern Australia, timed so as to acquire data over a seasonal cycle at various stages of the crop growth. Airborne L-band brightness temperature (~1 km) and radar backscatter (~10 m) observations were collected over an area the size of a single SMAP footprint (38 km × 36 km at 35° latitude) with a 2-3 days revisit time, providing SMAP-like data for testing of radiometer-only, radar-only and combined radiometer-radar soil moisture retrieval and downscaling algorithms. Airborne observations were supported by continuous monitoring of near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture along with intensive ground monitoring of soil moisture, soil temperature, vegetation biomass and structure, and surface roughness.";"Panciera, Rocco

"AGRIS:US201500224302";"Land use change and pollinator extinction debt in exurban landscapes";"";"For the first time in more than a century, people across the planet are migrating en mass from cities to rural areas. In this process of ‘exurbanisation’ humans are rapidly converting natural and agricultural regions into low‐density housing. Despite the scale of this exurban development and its potential negative impact on biodiversity, little is known about how this specific type of land conversion impacts wild pollinators. In this study, we conduct an extensive survey of the wild pollinators of the peach agroecosystem and investigate the impact of current and historic land use at multiple spatial scales on pollinator community composition within agroecological landscapes that have recently undergone exurban development. We reveal that the overall composition of the wild pollinator community is significantly associated with current local agricultural and natural land cover. Specifically, local agricultural land use was associated with ground‐nesting bee community composition, whereas natural lands were associated with cavity‐nesting bee composition, revealing that nesting materials drive community composition for these two groups in exurban habitats. In contrast, community composition for butterflies and flies, which made up the smallest proportion of our communities, were not strongly associated with any particular land use type, likely due to their non‐central place foraging strategy. Most interestingly, our results indicate that historic land use remains a significant factor impacting the current abundance of all pollinators in the peach agroecosystem, offering the first evidence of extinction debt in this rapidly expanding exurban landscape.";"Cusser, Sarah

"AGRIS:US201301825148";"Recovery of soil properties and functions in different rainforest restoration pathways";"";"Rainforests in the tropics and subtropics are declining rapidly, leading to significant changes in soil physical and chemical characteristics and biochemical cycles that connect vegetation and soil. Effects of such changes on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools are still poorly understood and contradictory results have been reported in different studies. We studied changes in C and N dynamics associated with deforestation and reforestation in the Big Scrub region of subtropical eastern Australia, where over 99% of the former rainforest cover was converted by European settlers for pasture or agriculture. In this area, the most common reforestation pathways are tree-planting for ecological restoration purposes, autogenic regrowth dominated by the invasive tree species camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), and management of this regrowth to accelerate the development of a more native tree community. Nineteen soil properties were measured at 25 sites, five within each of: remnant rainforest, pasture, ecological restoration plantings 10-15-year old, camphor laurel regrowth 20-40-year old, and rainforest regrowth 3-6 years after poisoning of camphor trees within older regrowth. Of eight components of N cycling measured, four differed significantly between site-types: nitrate-N, plant-available nitrate-N and nitrification rates were highest in rainforest and lowest in pasture, with revegetated sites showing intermediate levels; while plant-available ammonium-N showed a reverse pattern. Among revegetated sites, camphor-dominated regrowth showed slightly less regeneration of N dynamics than treated camphor and replanted sites. Among soil attributes related to the soil C cycle and soil microbial activity, there was little variation with deforestation or reforestation. Four of five other soil attributes (pH, bulk density, fine root biomass, and plant-available phosphate-P) showed significant variation among site-types, with specific patterns varying. All three reforestation pathways were able to restore soil properties to varying degrees, although the rate of recovery was lowest in untreated camphor regrowth.";"Paul, Miriam

We model the equilibrium in the private land conservation market and the social welfare maximization problem of the government. We estimate the supply of conservation easements in the San Francisco Bay Area counties. Our results show that conservation easements are own price inelastic, but nevertheless are sensitive to the opportunity cost of land.

Tree canopy plays a crucial role in the environment, providing benefits such as clean water and air, erosion prevention, climate control, and sustained ecological resources and native species habitat. Additionally, tree canopy plays an economic role by increasing housing values, alleviating expenditures related to erosion destruction, decreasing spending on sewer standards, increasing energy efficiency, and reducing medical costs related to health issues, such as asthma, that are associated with environmental degradation.  To study how local government policies may be related to changes in tree canopy, an empirical study was performed using Greater Metropolitan Atlanta as the study area.  The statistical analysis identifies local government policies that are effective, such as specific tree ordinance clauses and zoning regulations.  Policies that are ineffective (e.g., a tree board) are also identified.";"Dorfman, Jeffrey H.

Because sedimentation tends to fill-in and shrink lakes, our results provide some indication of the potential property damages associated with sedimentation.

An interdisciplinary approach employing hydrology, geographic information systems, and a recreation visitation function model, is used to estimate the damages from upstream coal mining to lakes in Ohio. The estimated recreational damages to five of the coal-mining-impacted lakes, using dissolved sulfate as coal-mining-impact indicator, amount to $21 Million per year. Post-reclamation recreational benefits from reducing sulfate concentrations by 6.5% and 15% in the five impacted lakes were estimated to range from $1.89 to $4.92 Million per year, with a net present value ranging from $14.56 Million to $37.79 Million.

Results indicate willingness to participate in land use-related training is a function of education, perceived benefit, and length in service.  These findings have important programmatic and policy implications.  Training programs should be geared towards those planning officials who are beginning to serve.

This paper reports the results of a study carried out in the Lesser Himalayan foothills in India (Dun valley) on potential distribution modeling for Malabar nut using Maxent model. The Worldclim bioclimatic variables, slope, aspect, elevation, and the land use/land cover (based on IRS LISS-III) data and 46 spatially well-dispersed species occurrence points were used to predict the potential distribution of J. adhatoda in ca. 1877km² study area. Jackknife test was used to evaluate the importance of the environmental variables for predictive modeling. Maxent model was highly accurate with a statistically significant AUC value of 92.3. The approach could be promising in predicting the potential distribution of medicinal plant species and thus, can be an effective tool in species restoration and conservation planning.";"Yang, Xue-Qing

This process involves a consideration of the geomorphology, geology, engineering geology, geological hazards, and other geological factors and is the basis of urban construction land planning and management. With the support of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), grid analysis, and geo-spatial analysis techniques, four factor groups comprising nine separate subfactors of geo-environmental attributes were selected to be used in the evaluation of the suitability level for construction land in Hangzhou. This was based on K-means clustering and back-propagation (BP) neural network methods due to their advantages in fast computing, unique adaptive capacity, and self-organization. Simultaneously, the evaluation results based on K-means clustering and BP neural network were compared and analyzed, and the accuracy evaluation was set. The results showed that the geo-environmental suitability evaluation results of construction land based on K-means clustering and BP neural network were similar in terms of the distribution and scale of construction land suitability level. At the same time, the results of the two evaluation methods were consistent with the variability in suitability level, engineering geology, and hydrogeology of Hangzhou. The results also showed that the real advantage of the methods proposed in this paper lies in their capacity to streamline the mapping process and to ensure that the results are consistent throughout. The suitability level of the urban construction land based on the geo-environment in Hangzhou was divided into four construction sites: land for building super high-rise and high-rise buildings, land for building multistorey buildings, land for low-rise buildings, and nonbuilding land. The results of the suitability evaluation for each category will provide a scientific basis for decision-making in urban development in Hangzhou.";"Xu, Kai

The rapid growth of the human population, climate change and pollution on a catastrophic scale has caused the quality of land resources to be compromised. Remote sensing is a useful tool in land cover change detection providing information to decision makers. The aim of this study was to evaluate land cover changes in the Mtunzini area in South Africa over the past 18 years; determine why changes have occurred and predict land cover patterns for future years. In this study a supervised classification was used to detect land cover classes of the Mtunzini area from 1992 to 2009 using four Landsat images in the time series analysis. The supervised classification had an accuracy of 80.80 % which was used to model land cover changes. Commercial sugar cane and forest plantation classes increased throughout the time series. It was estimated in the modelling procedure that bushland (42.11 %) and bare soil (35 %) would be changed to commercial sugar cane. This is indicative of the expanding agriculture sector in Mtunzini. Natural vegetation is predicted to be disturbed: 18 % of bushland and 15.07 % of dense bush are expected to be replaced by rural dwellings. This is owing to a potential increase in the rural population and a reduced local economic growth. This study highlights the need for increased vigilance of the forestry industry and commercial sugar cane farms which may be encroaching on natural vegetation and livelihoods of local residents. Strategic planning and proper management of natural vegetation types is needed as these land cover types are decreasing rapidly.";"Pillay, Kamleshan

However, most studies of aspen change have been at local scales and our understanding of aspen dynamics at broader scales is limited. At local scales, aspen loss has been attributed to fire exclusion, ungulate herbivory, and climate change. Understanding the links between biophysical setting and aspen presence, growth, and dynamics is necessary to develop a large-scale perspective on aspen dynamics. Specific objectives of this research were to (1) map aspen distribution and abundance across the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), (2) measure aspen change in the GYE over the past 50 years (3) determine if aspen loss occurs in particular biophysical settings and (4) investigate the links between biophysical setting and aspen presence, growth, and change in canopy cover. We found that aspen is rare in the GYE, occupying 1.4% of the region. We found an average of 10% aspen loss overall, much lower than that suggested by smaller-scale studies. Aspen loss corresponded with biophysical settings with the lowest aspen growth rates, where aspen was most abundant. The highest aspen growth rates were at the margins of its current distribution, so most aspen occur in biophysical settings less favorable to their growth.";"Brown, Kathryn

We simulated 50,000 wildfires that replicated recent fire events in the area and generated detailed maps of burn probability (BP) and fire intensity distributions. We also recorded the ignition locations and size of each simulated fire and used these outputs to construct a fire source–sink ratio as the ratio of fire size to burn probability. Fire behavior was summarized for federal land management designations, including biological conservation reserves, recreational sites, managed forest, and wildland urban interface. Burn probability from the simulations ranged from 0.00001 to 0.026 within the study area (mean=0.0023), and exhibited substantial variation among and within land designations. Simulated fire behavior was broadly related to gradients in fire regimes, although the combined effects of fuel, topography, and simulated weather resulted in fine scale patterns not reflected in ecological and vegetation data. Average BP for the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) nesting sites ranged from 0.0002 to 0.04. Among the 130 different wildland urban interface areas, average BP varied from 0.0001 to 0.02. Spatial variation in the source–sink ratio was pronounced, and strongly affected by the continuity and arrangement of surface and canopy fuel.

Geographical Information Systems and remote sensing were used to estimate the impact of land use changes on habitats over a 35 year period from 1975 to 2010. The first images used MSS captures from 1975 with a spatial resolution of 80 m; precision was gained from 1980 with the use of LandSat satellite images (spatial resolution of 30 m in multi-band modes) and then with satellite images from Spot 4, Spot 5 and Google Earth Pro. The images were classified using GEO Image and then analyzed and laid out with the aid of ArcGis and Quantum GIS 1.7.0 software programs. The data was verified using a confusion matrix, which provided between 85 and 95% global precision rates. This qualitative data on the evolution reveals that despite important conservation measures (including Ramsar site, National Park, and Natural Park status) both deltas have been subject to substantial changes over this time period. Important declines in natural habitats such as sansouires, beaches, dunes and reed beds have been replaced by increased areas of urbanization and annual agricultural crops.

However, a rigorous evaluation of correction methods has not been conducted. We compared original, maximum, and minimum equivalent soil mass (ESM) corrections to the fixed depth (FD) method and direct C concentrations. In a simulation exercise of a tillage event that decreased BD without change in total C concentration to a depth of 0.3m, the original and maximum ESM methods estimated changes in total C storage of -0.34 to 0.54MgCha⁻¹, well within the range of field soil C variability. In contrast, the minimum ESM method estimated changes ranging from -1.19 to 1.01MgCha⁻¹. In a field experiment on reduced and intensive tillage, soil C changes (0-0.18m) were measured from May to August 2006. The maximum ESM method generally overestimated soil C changes by -0.16 to 0.60MgCha⁻¹ and the minimum ESM method underestimated them by -2.67 to 0.23MgCha⁻¹ compared to the original ESM method. Field-scale soil C changes (0-0.15m) were also measured from August 2003 to June 2005 and decreased by an unrealistic 6.64MgCha⁻¹ over the first 6 months after tillage when the FD method was used. In contrast, the effect of tillage on soil C could be reasonably estimated by directly comparing changes in C concentration. In a compacted agricultural soil, we found more errors in simulated C differences when using the maximum than the minimum ESM method. Regardless of the direction of BD changes, the minimum ESM method was a better choice than the maximum ESM method in native and restored grassland systems where soil C concentrations decreased through the soil profile. We conclude that (1) the FD method is often not suitable and might be less accurate than direct C concentration measurements, and (2) the maximum/minimum ESM method can be accurate depending on the conditions (e.g., increasing or decreasing BD, systems conversion type), but (3) that the original ESM method is optimal for detecting soil C changes due to land use changes or management effects.";"Lee, Juhwan

This study presents an appraisal of the impacts of SLR on the coastal natural resources and its dependent social communities in the low-lying area of Vellar–Coleroon estuarine region of the Tamil Nadu coast, India. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from SRTM 90M (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) data, along with GIS (Geographic Information System) techniques are used to identify an area of inundation in the study site. The vulnerability of coastal areas in Vellar-Coleroon estuarine region of Tamil Nadu coast to inundation was calculated based on the projected SLR scenarios of 0.5 m and 1 m. The results demonstrated that about 1570 ha of the LULC (Land use and Land cover) of the study area would be permanently inundated to 0.5 m and 2407 ha for 1 m SLR and has also resulted in the loss of three major coastal natural resources like coastal agriculture, mangroves and aquaculture. It has been identified that six hamlets of the social communities who depend on these resources are at high-risk and vulnerable to 0.5 m SLR and 12 hamlets for 1 m SLR. From the study, it has been emphasized that mainstreaming adaptation options to SLR should be embedded within a coastal zone management and planning effort, which includes all coastal natural resources (ecosystem-based adaptation), and its dependent social communities (community-based adaptation) involved through capacity building.";"Saleem Khan, A.

"AGRIS:US201600078992";"Examination of the Demographic and Environmental Variables Correlated with Lyme Disease Emergence in Virginia";"";"Lyme disease is the United States’ most significant vector-borne illness. Virginia, on the southern edge of the disease’s currently expanding range, has experienced an increase in Lyme disease both spatially and temporally, with steadily increasing rates over the past decade and disease spread from the northern to the southwestern part of the state. This study used a Geographic Information System and a spatial Poisson regression model to examine correlations between demographic and land cover variables, and human Lyme disease from 2006 to 2010 in Virginia. Analysis indicated that herbaceous land cover is positively correlated with Lyme disease incidence rates. Areas with greater interspersion between herbaceous and forested land were also positively correlated with incidence rates. In addition, income and age were positively correlated with incidence rates. Levels of development, interspersion of herbaceous and developed land, and population density were negatively correlated with incidence rates. Abundance of forest fragments less than 2 hectares in area was not significantly correlated. Our results support some findings of previous studies on ecological variables and Lyme disease in endemic areas, but other results have not been found in previous studies, highlighting the potential contribution of new variables as Lyme disease continues to emerge southward.";"Seukep, Sara E.

However, few studies have empirically integrated the environmental, spatial, and dietary patterns of wildlife epidemiology. We investigate how urbanization, habitat type, and dietary behavior are associated with coyote (Canis latrans) parasitism structure along a gradient of rural to urban land cover using multivariate redundancy analyses. Coyote fecal samples were collected in eight urban and six rural sites in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Parasite and diet components were identified using common flotation procedures and fecal dietary analysis, respectively. Redundancy analysis was used to identify the best land cover, connectivity, and dietary predictors. We tested for significance using multiple permutation tests and ANOVAs. Significant factors affecting enteric parasite prevalence included dietary and land cover factors (R ² = 0.4130, P < 0.05). Variation in dietary behavior was observed between urban and rural sites (R ² = 0.4712, P < 0.05), as anthropogenic diet items (i.e., garbage, crabapples) were strongly influenced by urbanization. Our research supports that developed habitat, grassland cover, and dietary choice interact to possibly influence the exposure of coyote hosts to enteric parasites and pioneers future investigation of disease ecology for natural populations in anthropogenic landscapes.";"Watts, Alexander G.

Solastalgia refers to the distress caused by damage to the surrounding natural environment and it has not been examined for its relationship to psychological health. Doing so opens avenues of research that inquire into how land management might be able to support improved community resilience and psychological health outcomes after a wildfire. In 2012, we conducted a household survey mailed to all 1387 households in the five communities surrounding the fire. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale assessed psychological distress. In the multivariate analysis, higher solastalgia score and an adverse financial impact of the fire were associated with clinically significant psychological distress. Annual household income ≥ $80,000 and a higher family functioning score were associated with less psychological distress. Part-time residents were no more likely to have psychological distress than full-time residents. We conclude that dramatic transformation of a landscape by an environmental event such as a wildfire can reduce its value as a source of solace.

Light reflection of agrocoenosis in the period of soil resting and the subsequent cultivation of spring-sown soft wheat while its blossoming on the fallow lands was studied according to the pictures of high resolution (5 m per pixel) made by the RapidEye spacecraft (Germany). The research was conducted in the forest-steppe zone of the Ishim-Irtysh interstream area of Western Siberia in 2011-2014. While synthesizing the pictures received in the different ranges of frequencies the priority of near infrared range of a range of solar radiation reflection (0.845-0.885 microns) which brings more part of energy in comparison with short-wave visible part of a range is offered. In the article the offer to calculate the absorption amount of solar radiation by ecosystems using the comparison of the greatest possible size of radiation arriving at the Earth surface to its reflection by this or that ecosystems or its components is proved for the first time. Each component absorbs selectively the part of solar energy for biomass formation or for accumulation of humus and other soil processes. Information of space pictures on soil condition differs from the aerial photographs which are the basis for a traditional technique of soil mapping. The latter isn’t determined by an open field surface which absorbs more than 90% of the coming radiation, but according to the spectral analysis of the reflected part of an agrocenosis of field cultures prevailing in the region, or biogeocenosis of typical natural ecosystems.

Усовершенствован способ почвенно-агрохимического обследования земель сельскохозяйственного назначения в равнинных регионах без построения цифровой модели рельефа. Способ основан на дифференцированном изучении влияния диапазонов съемки путем усложненного кластерного анализа светоотражения экосистем. Учитывалась возможность варьирования цветовыми каналами в системе RGB для раздельного учета поглощения солнечной радиации почвенным и растительным покровом. По космическим снимкам высокого разрешения (5 м на пиксель) космического аппарата RapidEye изучалось светоотражение агроценозов в период парования поля и последующего возделывания на нем яровой мягкой пшеницы в фазе ее цветения, а также на залежных землях, намечаемых к повторному освоению, в лесостепной зоне Ишим-Иртышского междуречья Западной Сибири в 2011-2014 гг. На этапе синтезирования снимков, полученных в разных диапазонах частот, предлагается приоритет ближнего инфракрасного диапазона спектра отражения солнечной радиации (0,845-0,885 мкм), который несет относительно большую часть энергии по сравнению с коротковолновой видимой частью спектра. Впервые обосновывается предложение рассчитывать величину поглощения экосистемами солнечной радиации сопоставлением максимально возможной величины радиации, поступающей на поверхность Земли, с ее отражением той или иной экосистемой или ее компонентами. Каждый из них избирательно поглощает свою долю солнечной энергии на формирование биомассы либо на накопление гумуса и другие почвенные процессы. Информация космических снимков о состоянии почвенного покрова отличается от информации аэрофотоснимков, положенных в основу традиционной методики почвенного картирования тем, что она определяется не по открытой поверхности поля, которая поглощает более 90% приходящей радиации, а по спектральному анализу отраженной её части агроценозами преобладающих в регионе полевых культур, либо биогеоценозами типичных природных экосистем.";"Berezin L.V.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"ru";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"RUS;DEU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=RU2016001606";"http://www.vestnik.omgau.ru/wp-content/files/20_5.pdf";"";"";"";""

However, the usefulness of satellite-based images for monitoring rotationally-grazed pastures in the northeastern United States might be limited because paddock size is often smaller than the resolution limits of the satellite image. This research compared NDVI data from satellites with data obtained using a ground-based system capable of fine-scale (submeter) NDVI measurements. Gross primary productivity was measured by eddy covariance on two pastures in central Pennsylvania from 2003 to 2008. Weekly 250-m resolution satellite NDVI estimates were also obtained for each pasture from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Ground-based NDVI data were periodically collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008 from one of the two pastures. Multiple-regression and regression-tree estimates of GPP, based primarily on MODIS 7-d NDVI and on-site measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), were generally able to predict growing-season GPP to within an average of 3% of measured values. The exception was drought years when estimated and measured GPP differed from each other by 11 to 13%. Ground-based measurements improved the ability of vegetation indices to capture short-term grazing management effects on GPP. However, the eMODIS product appeared to be adequate for regional GPP estimates where total growing-season GPP across a wide area would be of greater interest than short-term management-induced changes in GPP at individual sites.";"Skinner, R.H.

The particular focus of the evaluation is on the extent to which the proposed ""single farm payment"" can be de-coupled from production and yet avoid the abandonment of land on which production is expected to be profitable. An analytical framework is developed which indicates the most important non-policy factors are the profitability of the land, the variability of yield and the grower's degree of risk aversion. The conclusion of a numerical analysis using this framework is that 85% de-coupling is unlikely to lead to abandonment of land in any arable region of the EU, and that 95% de-coupling is also unlikely to lead to abandonment in the majority of arable areas.";"Fraser, Rob W.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-02-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212161";"http://purl.umn.edu/58448";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016208197";"LAND MARKETS IN AGENT BASED MODELS OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE";"";"Replaced with revised version of paper 02/22/08.
Land markets play a crucial role in agricultural structural change. The dynamics on land marketsmainly depend on the interactions between individual farms. Agent-based modelling (ABM) providesone way to take the specific characteristics of land transactions into account, as it allows to modelinteractions between different agents as well as spatial relationships in a straightforward manner.However, reviewing the literature one can find only a few attempts of endogenized land markets inABM. Furthermore, it seems that the allocation mechanisms of these endogenized land markets arechosen rather arbitrarily and not much attention is given to an intensive discussion of the impact ofthe respective allocation mechanisms to simulation results. To close this gap the aim of this paper isthreefold: First we want to give a brief review of existing ABM with endogenized land allocationmechanisms and we identify a theoretical framework which serves as a guidance to develop a suitableand extendable land market (sub-) model. Second, we derive a number of relevant designconsiderations necessary to endogenize land transactions in an agent based modelling framework.Based on this we propose three different land market implementations which are based on auctionmechanisms. In order to be able to evaluate the different implementations not only in relative but alsoin absolute terms we furthermore propose an approach to create a global optimal allocation in termsof the resulting economic land rent. For this we use a mathematical programming approach to solvethe underlying allocation problem and the concept of average shadow prices to price the allocatedplots.In the third part we show the practical implications of different allocation mechanisms. This is doneusing the spatial and dynamic agent-based simulation model AgriPoliS as experimental laboratory. Inthat way we can analyse the properties of the respective allocation mechanisms in a realisticframework which is based on a detailed empirical calibration.

"AGRIS:US2016208190";"Land Degradation in the Developing World: Implications for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment to 2020";"";"Among the most problematic issues considered as part of IFPRI’s 2020 Vision initiative, which seeks to develop an international consensus on how to meet future food needs while reducing poverty and protecting the environment, are the environmental questions. And the issues addressed in this discussion paper is particularly difficult. How is land degradation affecting the ability of farmers to produce adequate food supplies today, and what is the prognosis for the year 2020? As populations grow, farmers are forced to cultivate smaller and smaller plots, where the soil eventually becomes depleted, or they expand onto marginal lands-fragile hillsides, semi-arid areas, cleared forestland. Once these lands become damage, can they be repaired?These questions are hard to answer because little has been done to quantify and categorize the degraded lands. We need to know where degradation is occurring, what forced have caused it, and what steps must be taken to rehabilitate degraded land. More than anything we need to know what policies work to promote good land husbandry in developing countries, where farmers mostly degrade the land out of necessity, not greed.The workshop that led the land to thus paper is only a first step in a concerted effort to identify the regional “hot spot” where degradation is now rampant and the “bright spots” here remediation is already underway. The most important contribution of the participants of this workshop, however, is the list of 10 policy recommendations they devised to encourage better management of agricultural lands. If the 2020 Vision is to become a reality, we must begin to put their recommendation into practice.";"Scherr, Sara J.

World production of soybeans is predicted to increase by 2.2% annually to 371.3 million tons by 2030 using an exponential smoothing model with a damped trend. Finally, three scenarios and their implications are presented for increasing supply as land availability declines. The scenarios highlight for agribusiness policy makers and managers the urgent need for significant investments in yield improving research.

"AGRIS:US201400036339";"Desertification and livestock grazing: The roles of sedentarization, mobility and rest";"";"Pastoralism is an ancient form of self-provisioning that is still in wide use today throughout the world. While many pastoral regions are the focus of current desertification studies, the long history of sustainability evidenced by these cultures is of great interest. Numerous studies suggesting a general trend of desertification intimate degradation is a recent phenomenon principally attributable to changes in land tenure, management, and treatment. This paper explores the suggested causes of land degradation and identifies the land management and grazing treatments shared by many pastoral cultures. The singular commonality found in nearly all studies of degradation is the prevalence of partial or total rest. While historical observations rightly suggest that desertification is the result of both climatic and anthropic factors, recent focus has been placed upon the effect of sedentarisation. This paper attempts to coalesce these two streams of thinking with particular focus upon inclusive planning processes which may improve arid and semiarid rangeland ecosystems using livestock as a solution to the problem of land degradation.";"Weber, Keith T

"AGRIS:US201400049136";"Identifying Priority Areas for Forest Landscape Restoration to Protect Ridgelines and Hillsides: A Cost‐Benefit Analysis";"";"This research presents a case study using cost‐benefit analysis to identify priority areas for forest landscape restoration to protect the ridgelines and hillsides in a single county of the southern Appalachian region, which may be applicable to other communities with similar issues. Private and public benefits per dollar spent are estimated for 15 target restoration sites. The results of this study show the potential for increased benefits to the community from reforestation projects, but those benefits can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the area of the target reforestation site, the number of houses surrounding the target site, property values, and the proximity of houses to the site. Much of the private benefit accrues to households living close to the reforestation site while public benefits are mainly generated by indirect use values associated with the cleansing of air and water pollutants. Assuming the explicit cost of reforestation is paid by local governments, the sites generating the most public benefit per dollar could be considered high‐priority reforestation sites based on equity. Alternatively, the sites with the highest private return per dollar could be viewed as high‐priority sites if the payment system allows direct payment for reforestation of private land. The latter payment system could be implemented through a conservation easement program that restricts the development rights of private landowners and permits private donations to support the program. Le présent article porte sur une étude de cas dans laquelle une analyse coûts‐avantages a été réalisée afin de déterminer des zones prioritaires de restauration de paysages forestiers destinées à protéger les lignes de crêtes et les coteaux dans un comté du sud des Appalaches. Cette étude de cas pourrait s’appliquer à d’autres communautés confrontées à des problèmes similaires. Nous avons estimé les avantages publics et privés par dollar dépensé de 15 sites de restauration cibles. Les résultats de notre étude montrent que les communautés pourraient tirer des avantages accrus des projets de reforestation, mais que ces avantages varient grandement en fonction de certains facteurs, tels que la zone où se trouve le site de reforestation cible, le nombre d’habitations entourant le site cible, la valeur des propriétés et la proximité des habitations par rapport au site. Une grande partie des avantages privés découlent du fait que les habitations se trouvent à proximité du site de reforestation, tandis que les avantages publics découlent principalement de la valeur d’usage indirecte liée à l’assainissement de l’air et de l’eau. Dans l’hypothèse où le coût explicite de la reforestation est assumé par les administrations municipales, les sites procurant le plus d’avantages publics par dollar dépensé pourraient être considérés comme des sites de reforestation hautement prioritaires en fonction de la valeur nette (equity). En revanche, les sites procurant le plus d’avantages privés par dollar dépensé pourraient être considérés comme des sites hautement prioritaires si le système de paiement permet le versement de paiements directs pour la reforestation des terres privées. Ce système de paiement pourrait être intégré dans un programme de servitudes de conservation qui restreint les droits d’aménagement des propriétaires fonciers privés et accueille les dons de particuliers en guise d’appui au programme.";"Chadourne, Matthew H.

"AGRIS:US201500010344";"Modern influences on chironomid distribution in western Ireland: potential for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction";"";"Ireland provides a unique setting for the study of past climates, as its climate is dominated by westerly airflow from the North Atlantic and readily responsive to changes in North Atlantic circulation patterns. Although there has been substantial research on Ireland’s past environments, quantitative palaeolimnological research, especially chironomid-based research, has been lacking. In order to further develop chironomid-based palaeolimnological investigations, a calibration set was constructed to determine the dominant environmental controls on modern chironomids in western Ireland. Chironomid subfossils were collected from surface sediments of 50 lakes. The lakes were characterised with 36 environmental variables, including physical attributes, lake water characteristics, lake sediment characteristics and land cover within each catchment. In this exploratory study, no specific environmental variable was targeted and lakes were chosen to span gradients of latitude, elevation, depth and trophic status. Redundancy analysis showed that six environmental variables—mean July air temperature, lake depth, dissolved organic carbon, and percentage catchment land cover of agriculture, peat bog and scrubland—captured a large and statistically significant portion of the variance in the chironomid data. July temperature and agricultural land cover were the most dominant environmental variables, with July temperature proving the most suitable for inference model development. A classical weighted-averaging model was developed to estimate July air temperature, with a coefficient of determination (r ⱼₐcₖ ² ) of 0.60 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.57 °C. Results suggest that summer temperature is the dominant influence on chironomid distribution across a wide variety of lake types, and the relatively small RMSEP should allow for more accurate reconstructions of Ireland’s relatively subdued Holocene temperature fluctuations.";"Potito, Aaron P.

The cultivation of classified species of pine, poplar and eucalyptus on agricultural land, using agronomic methods, has spread across the globe. A third of the world’s supply of cylindrical trees originates from such plantations, which comprise 3-5% of all forest area. Hungary’s climate is favourable for the planting of acacia and poplar. The experimental results of the study are persuasive in terms of introducing this procedure domestically. Each hectare of annual saplings is equivalent to the price of 4-5 tonnes of wheat; the internal rate of interest is 7.4-8.7%. Following various dressing processes, the cut of timber is a competitive export commodity reserve, with comparative advantages and a favourable RCA index. Acacia could also play a significant role in energy production.The demand for structural changes in agriculture has constantly been raised. According to the trial-works investigations of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute (AKI) close to a third of sown area is loss-making even with agricultural subsidies. Taking into account the world market situation regarding food, and changes in the system of agricultural subsidies, AKI deems it necessary to change the type of cultivation being carried out on 450-650 thousand hectares of arable land. About half of the land to be withdrawn is suitable for the plantation-style planting of acacia and poplar. The returns on planting can increase timber exports. With development of the stock, opportunities arise for chemical processing of the wood (cellulose, methanol, etc.). Tree plantations can be viewed as an intensive culture requiring a high degree of human labour. The under-skilled workforce, the young and the old can be employed here. In order to make decisions related to long-term land usage, the earliest possible initiation of economic efficiency calculations and effectiveness tests are desirable. For the purposes of developing profitable land usage, the goal is the planting of 20-25 thousand hectares of forest annually, from regional development resources.";"Erdos, Laszlo";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016222576";"http://purl.umn.edu/57686";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400019592";"Arid old-field restoration: Native perennial grasses suppress weedsand erosion, but also suppress native shrubs";"";"Rates of cropland abandonment in arid regions are increasing, and abandoned fields in such regions can have low levels of ecosystem function and biodiversity. Long-lived, drought-tolerant shrubs are dominant components of many arid ecosystems, providing multiple ecosystem services such as soil stabilization, herbaceous plant facilitation, carbon storage and wildlife habitat. On abandoned agricultural fields, shrub restoration is hindered by multiple challenges, including erosion, water stress and invasive species. We hypothesized that applying short-term irrigation and seeding native perennial grasses would facilitate native shrub establishment by reducing erosion and weed abundance. Using a blocked split-plot design, we evaluated the separate and combined impacts of short-term irrigation and perennial grass seeding on five-year restoration outcomes (including direct measurements of wind erosion) at two former agricultural fields in North America’s arid Great Basin. After two years, irrigation had increased the density and biomass of seeded grasses by more than ten-fold. The combination of irrigation and seeded grasses was associated with significantly lower wind erosion, weed density and weed biomass. Three years after irrigation ended, seeded grasses remained significantly more abundant in formerly irrigated than non-irrigated plots. Formerly irrigated plots also had significantly less bare ground, annual plant cover and weed biomass than non-irrigated plots. Large plant-canopy gaps were fewer in irrigated and seeded plots. Although seeded grasses reduced erosion and invasion, they failed to facilitate native shrub establishment. Shrub cover and density were highest in plots that had been drill-seeded and irrigated, but lacked perennial grasses. Our results indicate that short-term irrigation has persistent restoration benefits, and that a tradeoff exists between the benefits and costs of seeding perennial grasses into degraded arid shrubland sites.";"Porensky, Lauren M.

"AGRIS:FR2016208242";"Partial enclosure of the commons";"";"We examine the efficiency, distributional, and environmental consequences of assigning spatial property rights to part of a spatially-connected natural resource, a situation which we refer to as partial enclosure of the commons. The model reflects on a large class of institutions and natural resources for which complete enclosure by a sole owner may be desirable, but is often institutionally impractical. When a sole owner is granted ownership of only a fraction of the spatial domain of the resource and the remainder of the resource is competed for by an open access fringe, interesting spatial externalities arise. We obtain sharp analytical results regarding partial enclosure of the commons including: (1) While second best, it always improves welfare relative to no property rights, (2) all resource users are made better off, (3) positive rents arise in the open access area, and the resource will maintain higher abundance. Under spatial heterogeneity, we also characterize spatial regions that are ideal candidates for partial enclosure - typically, society should seek to enclose those patches with high ecological productivity and high self-retention, but whether high economic parameters promote or relegate a patch may depend on one’s objective. These results help inform a burgeoning trend around the world to partially enclose the commons.";"Costello, Christopher

This imposition has been the consequence, it is argued, of the new development paradigms implemented in Andean peasant communities since the end of land reform in the 1970s. The new paradigms emphasize identity and organizational aspects of indigenous populations at the expense of anything connected with the class-based campesinista agenda, which was still operational in the indigenous movement in the early 1990s. The essay concludes with some thoughts on the remarkable parallels between the 1990s neoliberal and counter-reformist models of action, and the pre-reformist indigenist policies of the period that ended in the 1960s.";"DE ZALDÍVAR, VÍCTOR BRETÓN SOLO";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land reform;rural development";"";"";"ECU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301534696";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2008.00181.x";"";"";"";"583-617"

Questions were about practices, reasons for ranching, and what influences ranching's future. Ranchers share much in common. Most enjoy ranching, ""feeling close to the earth,"" living in a ""good place for family life,"" and the camaraderie in the ranching community. They regularly carry out range improvements. Most believe that society is becoming ""hostile to ranching."" A dislike for outsider intervention and land use control prevails. Urban ranchers cared significantly less about the fate of their ranch if sold, and feared local land use planning much more. Rural ranchers overwhelmingly wanted their ranch to remain a productive ranch even if sold. No new ranchers appeared in the urban sample for the last 10 years. As urbanization proceeds, we suggest that a point is reached where ranchers recognize the social, ecological, and economic landscape as urban and see it as no longer suitable for ranching. Expecting to sell for development, and/or expecting zoning to change to allow it, becomes the rational view. Land conservation efforts, including relatively acceptable though as yet not widespread conservation easement programs, should begin before that happens.";"Liffmann, R.H.

The negative impacts of the practice on forest and biological resources, soil erosion and land degradation have been a serious concern for several decades now to administrators and planners as well as to the academic community. In the current context, the practice has undergone drastic changes and has become increasingly unviable, gradually leading to the marginalization of farmers practising it. Although shifting cultivation in this area has been the focus of intensive studies, particularly in terms of the underlying ecological dynamics, few have attempted to analyse the factors contributing to the marginalization of the practice. This paper examines micro-scale issues that contribute to reducing productivity (and hence marginalization), and which are of immediate concern to the shifting cultivator. The paper focuses on fundamental issues influencing the reduction in fallow cycle lengths, the impact of rural–urban migration on labour requirements for agriculture, the consequences of inadequate employment and cash generation facilities on labour availability and crop productivity, as well as government efforts to promote agricultural productivity in these areas. The main focus of the paper is on the impact of each of these factors and their synergystic effect on the marginalization of shifting cultivation.";"Choudhury, Dhrupad

A significant increase in the transaction prices of agricultural real estate in recent years has been caused by the impact of limited agricultural land supply and external factors related to the functioning of Polish agriculture in the economy of the European Community. The value of agricultural real estate is affected by many factors that are taken into account when determining the value of real estate. In the article there is an attempt to identify other conditions resulting from external factors, and the management of agricultural land in terms of Polish membership in the European Union. The analysis included sales of agricultural property from Agricultural Property Agency (ANR) resources (state market) and the private market. The data were obtained from the Central Statistical Office for the years 2005- 2013. Also, an analysis of the regional variations in transaction prices observed at the level of provinces (data for 2013) has been made. As confirmed by the research results, the agricultural real estate market in Poland increasingly depends on external factors (not taken into account when determining the value of agricultural property).";"Kurowska, K., University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn (Poland)";"";"Latvia University of Agriculture";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land policies;farmland;land economics;research;agriculture;land ownership";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"POL;LVA";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=LV2016000279";"http://tf.llu.lv/conference/proceedings2015/Papers/111_Kryszk.pdf";"";"";"";"688-693"

However, there have been few studies on land surface sub-grid scale heterogeneity and calculating microwave wetland surface emissivity when directly assimilating gridded Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) satellite brightness temperature (BT) data to estimate soil moisture. How to assimilate gridded AMSR-E BT data for land surface model (LSM) grid cells including various land cover types, especially wetland, is worthy of careful study. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method is able to resolve the non-linearity and discontinuity in forecast and observation operators, and is widely used in land data assimilation. In this study, considering the influences of land surface sub-grid scale heterogeneity, a satellite data simulation scheme based on the National Center for Atmosphere Research (NCAR) Community Land Model version 2.0 (CLM2.0), microwave Land Emissivity Model (LandEM), Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm and AMSR-E BT observation data is presented to simulate AMSR-E BT data and calibrate microwave wetland surface emissivity; then, a soil moisture data assimilation scheme is developed to directly assimilate the gridded AMSR-E BT data, which consists of the CLM2.0, LandEM and EnKF. The experimental results indicate that the calibrated microwave wetland surface emissivities possess excellent transportability, and that the assimilation scheme is practical and can significantly improve soil moisture estimation accuracy. This study provides a promising solution to improve soil moisture estimation accuracy through directly assimilating gridded AMSR-E BT data for various land cover types such as bare soil, vegetation, snow, lake and wetland.";"Zhang, Shenglei

Primary data obtained using structured questionnaire were employed in the study and the data were collected from a sample size of 100 maize farmers comprising of 70 males and 30 females. The key finding of the study is that gender was significant at 1% probability level and had a positive influence on income of the maize farmers and this was attributed to the disparity in the access to production resources and supportive services by the male and female maize farmers with men having more favourable access to production resources especially land and other supportive services than women. Based on this finding, it is recommended that gender inequality in the distribution of resources, information and other farm inputs should be minimized so as to ensure that women have access to resources for production just as men do thereby enhancing their productivity and income.";"Oyinbo Oyakhilomen";"Ahmadu Bello University";"";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"farmers";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=RU2015203607";"http://www.rjoas.com/issue-2014-01/article_03.pdf";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201301807743";"Numerical study of fog deposition on vegetation for atmosphere-land interactions in semi-arid and arid regions";"";"The aim of the present study was to evaluate fog (cloud water) deposition on vegetation and its contribution to the balance of water and energy in semi-arid and arid regions. Fog deposition onto the woodlands in semi-arid environments in Saudi Arabia was estimated using a detailed land surface model (SOLVEG) that included fog deposition on vegetation in meteorological conditions simulated using a three-dimensional mesoscale meteorological model (MM5). MM5 proved capable of reproducing meteorological variables and successfully detected fog events, although it did overestimate the liquid water content of the fog. Despite the margin of an error due to that overestimation, SOLVEG calculations indicated that fog deposition provides a more effective source of water for plant growth than the heavy rainfall typically observed in semi-arid and arid areas. Water evaporation from the surfaces of the leaves (leaf surface water) eases the plant's water stress by reducing the need for transpiration, even if the leaf surface water due to fog deposition does not drip onto the soil and is thus not a source of water for the plants. Latent heat being released through evaporation from the leaf surface water and soil reduces the temperature of the soil and leaves during the daytime, which in turn then eases heat stress in woodlands. Moreover, the decreased transpiration rates that result from the increase in evaporation from the leaf surface water due to fog deposition is an effective source of water for use in photosynthesis for the plants suffering from severe water stress in semi-arid and arid environments. Our results suggest that fog deposition can affect the accuracy of the water and heat exchange that take place in the atmosphere-land interface in semi-arid and arid regions.";"Katata, Genki

Focusing on responses of local hunters to landowners’ recent promotion of hunting tourism, one central finding is that the hunters tend to engage with the hunting grounds as part of landscapes they identify strongly with. While recognizing the principle of private ownership to hunting rights, local hunters raise moral and political objections to how the ownership is performed.

"AGRIS:US201300879344";"Wildfire Hazard Assessment and Map for La Plata County, Colorado, USA";"";"In response to the needs of local fire managers, we developed a map of wildfire hazard for La Plata County in southwestern Colorado, USA. Our measure of fire hazard had two components: (i) the probability, should fire occur under dry weather conditions, that fire behavior will be extreme, and (ii) the human values that may be lost or damaged if extreme fire behavior occurs. Using a classification approach in a GIS environment, we developed quantitative indices of potential heat release, flame length, and rate of spread for each vegetation type in the County. This is based on output of the Behave fire behavior system and adjusted for effects of slope and aspect. We then overlaid a map of residential developments to identify locations where homes are most vulnerable to wildfire damage. Results revealed a zone in the central part of the county where extensive exurban development is occurring within pine, juniper, and oak vegetation, leading to a high potential for extreme fire behavior. This assessment is notable in that (1) it treats a wide range of land ownership types including public lands, private lands, and American Indian reservations; (2) it encompasses substantial variability in vegetation/fuel types, from low-elevation semi-arid grasslands and woodlands to alpine forests and meadows to cultivated and residential lands; and (3) it maps wildfire hazard at relatively fine resolution (1 ha) for a large area (ca 4,500 km2) based on quantitative indices of wildfire behavior. Formal validation of this kind of map is nearly impossible, but we tested the final product by asking local experts to evaluate our interpretations for specific locations with which they were familiar. Feedback from the experts led us to revise some of our initial fire behavior indices, by developing custom fuel models. The same experts concluded that the final product was very accurate. By developing a relatively simple mapping algorithm, and drawing upon spatial data sources readily available to local land managers, our wildfire hazard map for La Plata County provides a template for more extensive fire hazard mapping throughout southwestern Colorado and portions of adjacent states, for use in prioritization of fire mitigation treatments and public education.";"Romme, W.H.

The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare effects of two agricultural practices, conventional using mouldboard ploughing (CP) and no-tillage (NT), on soil fertility and on root growth of maize. The study is conducted on two adjoined fields on Chernozem in Eastern Austria. Soil samples are taken to assess essential physical and chemical soil parameters. Qualitative and quantitative observations on maize root system are conducted. Rooting patterns and spatial extension of seminal roots are examined on soil profile walls. Soil cores are taken on different positions and split into subsamples. Roots of each subsample are washed out and morphological parameters are measured. Results show differences in soil parameters primarily in the top soil where aggregate stability, bulk density, air-filled porosity, plant-available water, nitrogen and phosphorus contents were higher in NT than in CP. Maize roots in the ploughed field spread widely, while in the no-tillage one the root growth was deeper. Better shoot growth and higher yields are mainly obtained in NT than in CP.";"Himmelbauer, Margarita L.

However, whilst meteorological data are difficult to interpolate from point measurements at the desired resolution, region-wide digital data, e.g. elevation models or land cover data, are usually readily available.Aims: The potential of environmental variables, other than meteorological data, to create a bioclimatic classification of landscapes at the mesoscale was tested by the joint use of spatial data and the flowering dates of Forsythia suspensa at 70 phenological stations in southern Bavaria, Germany.Methods: A linear discriminant analysis was carried out to identify relevant land use variables that were correlated with phenology and, using these results, to regionalise the observed flowering dates within the framework of a Geographic Information System.Results: The generated map represented dates of onset at the regional scale, mostly influenced by the extent of impervious (hard, sealed) surfaces and forest, altitude and distance to urban areas. Thus, we overcame restrictions resulting from the difficulties of spatially interpolating available climatological data, and from the limited number of phenological datasets.Conclusions: We demonstrated that the selected variables were capable of adequately modelling regional bioclimatic zonation, and that phenology was a useful proxy of regional climate variation arising from both natural and anthropogenic factors.";"Jochner, Susanne

Based on factor analysis method and the collection of data in the last 50 years, this paper researches the spatial changes of driving factors during the course of land desertification in Minqin, Gansu Province. The results of factor analysis indicate that the driving force of human factor on land desertification accounted for 56.33% in 1956-2004 and for 66.19% in 1981-2004, the driving force of nature factor on land desertification accounted for 11.29% in 1956-2004 and 8.11% in 1981-2004, and the synthesis of driving forces of human and natural factors accounted for 11.19% in 1956-2004 and for 14.88% in 1981-2004. This indicated that human driving force on land desertification was increasing in Minqin County gradually.";"Ma, Yonghuan

"AGRIS:US201500007408";"Influence of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on atmospheric dynamics over the arid region of Rajasthan state, India";"";"The present study examines the long-term effects of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in Rajasthan state, India on land-atmosphere fluxes and, possibly in precipitation and aerosol loading. By comparing the satellite observations from Landsat MSS (1972–73) and IRS-P6 AWiFS (2006–07) considerable LULC changes are observed, an increase in crop-land and vegetated areas of ∼57% in the eastern and ∼68% in the western Rajasthan. The increase in agriculture intensification from irrigation activities after the construction of the Indira Gandhi canal (IGC) seems to affect the land-atmosphere fluxes, i.e. increase in atmospheric humidity and latent heat and reduction in sensible heat. On the other hand, the multi-decadal variability (1951–2007) in annual rainfall amount and total number of rainy days reveals significant year-to-year fluctuations, exhibiting a slight increasing trend over arid western Rajasthan. However, the overall analysis shows that the variability in precipitation is much more influenced by the general monsoonal circulation (i.e. meteorological dynamics and intensity of the monsoon) and partly can be associated with local phenomena, such as LULC changes and modifications in land-atmosphere fluxes. Similarly to precipitation, the long-term (1979–2008) aerosol index (AI) variations over the region seem to be affected by atmospheric and meteorological dynamics and not by LULC changes.";"Kharol, Shailesh Kumar

"AGRIS:US201500163388";"Temporal stability of vegetation indicators of wetland condition";"";"Vegetation indices are widely employed to evaluate wetland ecological condition, and are expected to provide sensitive and specific detection of environmental change. Most studies evaluate the performance of condition assessment metrics in the context of the data used to calibrate them. Here we examined the temporal stability of the Florida Wetland Condition Index (FWCI) for vegetation of depressional forested wetlands by resampling sites in 2008 that were previously sampled to develop the FWCI in 2001. Our objective was to determine if FWCI, a composite of six vegetation-based metrics, provides a robust measure of condition given inter-annual variation in environmental conditions (i.e., rainfall) between sampling periods. To that end, we sampled 22 geographically isolated wetlands in north Florida that spanned a wide land use/land cover intensity gradient. Our results suggested the FWCI is robust. We observed no significant paired difference in FWCI across or within land use categories, and the relationship between FWCI in 2001 and 2008 was strong (r²=0.88, p<0.001). This was despite surprisingly high composition change. Mean Jaccard community similarity within sites between years was 0.30, suggesting that most of the herbaceous taxa were replaced, possibly because of different antecedent rainfall conditions or sampling during different phenological periods; both are contingencies to which condition indices must be robust. We did observe some evidence of convergence toward the mean in 2008, with the fitted slope relating 2001 and 2008 FWCI scores significantly below one (0.63, 95% CI=0.53–0.73). The most variable FWCI component metric was the proportional representation of obligate wetland taxa, suggesting that systematic changes may have been induced by different hydrologic conditions prior to sampling; notably, however, FWCI computed without this component still exhibited a slope significantly less than 1 (0.72, 95% CI=0.61–0.88). Moreover, there was evidence that species lost from reference sites (higher condition) were replaced by taxa of lower floristic quality, while species lost from agricultural sites (consistently the lowest condition land use category) were replaced by species of higher quality. A significant positive association between FWCI and the ratio of coefficients of conservatism (CC) of species lost to those gained suggests some overfitting in FWCI development. However, despite modest evidence of overfitting, FWCI provides temporally consistent estimates of wetland condition, even under conditions of substantial taxonomic turnover.";"Deimeke, Elizabeth

As such, many jurisdictions in the United States where brook charr are present use this species as an indicator of ecosystem health. In Michigan, groundwater-dominated streams are currently being impacted by increased groundwater withdrawal and land use/land cover changes which alter stream temperatures and their flow, and thus have the potential to significantly influence brook charr production and behavior. We quantified the influence of groundwater withdrawal and land use alteration on thermal habitat availability for brook charr using a groundwater modeling tool that estimated changes in baseflow to a stream segment based on changes to the groundwater system due to groundwater withdrawal and changes in rates of recharge related to landscape changes within a watershed. Projected stream temperature changes were calculated using a stream temperature modeling tool and compared to the range of temperature preferenda for brook charr in order to evaluate the potential impact of policy decisions regarding water extraction and land use/cover changes. The models predicted relatively small changes in both stream baseflow and consequently, stream temperature, with increased groundwater withdrawal rates. Land use/land cover alterations which we analyzed were shown to either mitigate or enhance the loss of brook charr thermal habitat as a result of groundwater withdrawal, depending on its relationship to recharge dynamics. This study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between water, land, and fisheries managers to ensure brook charr population viability, productivity, and sustainability in the face of environmental change, increasing water use and development in the watershed.";"Waco, Kerryann E.

"AGRIS:US201600092350";"Demography beyond the population";"";"Population ecology, the discipline that studies the dynamics of species’ populations and how they interact with the environment, has been one of the most prolific fields of ecology and evolution. Demographic research is central to quantifying population‐level processes and their underlying mechanisms and has provided critical contributions to a diversity of research fields. Examples include the spread of infectious diseases, eco‐evolutionary dynamics and rapid evolution, mechanisms underlying invasions and extinctions, and forest productivity. As the fates of individual organisms are influenced by, and subsequently underlie, many other patterns and processes, we suggest that connecting demography beyond the population level offers promising avenues of innovation in ecology and evolution. Under the premise that population‐level processes are an ideal common currency within ecology and evolution, we organized the British Ecological Society Symposium, Demography Beyond the Population. This event attracted international researchers who are applying demographic theory and approaches to a broad range of questions. This special feature builds off of the symposium and illustrates the ability of demography to connect across diverse research areas in ecology and evolution, including functional traits, transient dynamics, quantitative genetics, environmental drivers and feedbacks, land management and other topics. In addition to highlighting the contributed manuscripts, this editorial provides a brief background on the development of the discipline and suggests how demographic tools may be used in novel ways to study more than just populations. Synthesis. This special feature integrates novel lines of research in the vast field of demography that directly interact with other ecological and evolutionary disciplines. The cross‐disciplinary potential of demography is further emphasized by the fact that its 20 manuscripts are spread across all six journals of the British Ecological Society. Together, these articles highlight that there is much to be gained by linking demography to other disciplines and scales in ecology and evolution.";"Griffith, Alden B.

"AGRIS:US201400034995";"current bioenergy production potential of semi-arid and arid regions in sub-Saharan Africa";"";"This article assesses the current technical and economic potential of three bioenergy production systems (cassava ethanol, jatropha oil and fuelwood) in semi-arid and arid regions of eight sub-Saharan African countries. The results indicate that the availability of land for energy production ranges from 2% (1.3 Mha) of the total semi-arid and arid area in South Africa to 21% (12 Mha) in Botswana. Land availability for bioenergy production is restricted mainly by agricultural land use, but also by steep slopes and biodiversity protection. The current total technical potential for the semi-arid and arid regions of the eight countries is calculated to be approximately 300 PJ y-1 for cassava ethanol production, 600 PJ y-1 for jatropha biodiesel or 4000 PJ y-1 for fuelwood. The analysis of economic potentials shows that in many semi-arid regions, cassava ethanol, jatropha oil and fuelwood can compete economically with the reference energy sources. However, fuelwood, jatropha oil, and cassava ethanol production costs in most arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa are often above average national market prices of gasoline, diesel, and fuelwood. Nevertheless, for example, in arid Kenya 270 PJ could be produced annually with fuelwood at production costs of less than 3 US$ GJ-1. Despite high production costs, it is important to investigate and invest in sustainable bioenergy production in semi-arid and arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa because of its potential to drive rural economic and social development.";"Wicke, Birka

California rangeland ecosystems have experienced substantial conversion to residential land use and more intensive agriculture. OBJECTIVES: To understand the potential impacts to rangeland ecosystem services, we developed six spatially explicit (250 m) climate/land use change scenarios for the Central Valley of California and surrounding foothills consistent with three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenario narratives. METHODS: We quantified baseline and projected change in wildlife habitat, soil organic carbon (SOC), and water supply (recharge and runoff). For six case study watersheds we quantified the interactions of future development and changing climate on recharge, runoff and streamflow, and precipitation thresholds where dominant watershed hydrological processes shift through analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The scenarios show that across the region, habitat loss is expected to occur predominantly in grasslands, primarily due to future development (up to a 37 % decline by 2100), however habitat loss in priority conservation errors will likely be due to cropland and hay/pasture expansion (up to 40 % by 2100). Grasslands in the region contain approximately 100 teragrams SOC in the top 20 cm, and up to 39 % of this SOC is subject to conversion by 2100. In dryer periods recharge processes typically dominate runoff. Future development lowers the precipitation value at which recharge processes dominate runoff, and combined with periods of drought, reduces the opportunity for recharge, especially on deep soils. CONCLUSION: Results support the need for climate-smart land use planning that takes recharge areas into account, which will provide opportunities for water storage in dry years. Given projections for agriculture, more modeling is needed on feedbacks between agricultural expansion on rangelands and water supply.";"Byrd, Kristin B.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess landscape connectivity between Natura 2000 sites in the biodiversity-rich western Mediterranean region. METHODS: We used the wood mouse as a focal species with short-range dispersal and obtained genetic data for 393 individuals uniformly distributed between two Natura 2000 sites in SW Portugal. We created a map of connectivity between the two sites that was based on a stack of analyses including reciprocal causal modeling and least-cost path modeling coupled with resistant kernel analysis. RESULTS: Wood mice in the study area were genetically diverse and connected by gene flow over a large area. We did not find evidence of major population subdivision in the study area. Gene flow was limited by geographic distance, with significant genetic similarity between individuals within 3 km of each other. Vegetation cover and land use explained more of the variation in genetic distance than geographic distance alone. In particular, agroforestry areas and transitional woodland were associated with higher costs to movement than forest or arable land uses. This result may have been influenced by the difficulty in classifying land use in the open montado. CONCLUSIONS: The Natura 2000 sites we studied are well connected by multiple corridors for dispersal. Our analysis also highlighted the importance of the Serra de Grândola, part of the European Long Term Ecological Research Network but not yet included in Natura 2000.";"Mullins, Jacinta

"AGRIS:LV2016027044";"Comprendre la dynamique régionale des exploitations de polyculture élevage pour accompagner le développement rural dans les Coteaux de Gascogne";"";"The Coteaux de Gascogne region, an upland area in south-western France, is a site where studies related to the future of landscapes and the sustainability of natural resource management are well documented. The local agricultural system is induced by a “house centred” society with the particularity of passing on the inheritance and farm estate identically from one generation to the next. This system generates a mosaic landscape made up of field crops, grasslands and woodlots. Local agriculture has experienced deep changes since the 1950s in relation with modernization and farm enlargement processes. Traditional farming systems were very diversified and turned towards subsistence. Nowadays, farming systems are market-oriented mixed crop-livestock farming, in which cattle is the main species raised. We have started a participatory research with local stakeholders for prospecting the future of livestock farming in the study area. We carried out a spatially explicit and exhaustive survey of the farms in 4 adjoining villages to assess the variety of family-farms, their agricultural land-management and their changes over recent decades. In this paper we present an initial typology assessing the current variety of the family-farms structure and functioning. The types of spatial and functional organization of farm territories appear to depend on farm size and access to land resources. In current socio-economical conditions, difficulty for farm transfer at the time of a farmer’s retirement and competition between crop and animal productions appear as main topical issues that challenge the future of local livestock farming. Their impacts on the sustainability of the local livestock sector and on landscape characteristics are major issues that will be considered in the modelling and scenarios of land-use and landscape change to be worked out in a subsequent step of the participatory research project.

Les Coteaux de Gascogne constituent un des terrains de recherche sur l’avenir des paysages ruraux et la durabilité de la gestion des ressources naturelles. Cette petite région du Sud-Ouest de la France est historiquement fondée sur un système social dit « à maison » caractérisé par une permanence des patrimoines fonciers et des exploitations agricoles. Le système agraire qui lui est lié génère une mosaïque de paysages composée de grandes cultures, de prairies liées à l’élevage bovin et de bois. L’agriculture locale a connu, depuis les années 1950, de profonds changements liés à la modernisation et à l’agrandissement des exploitations. A l’origine très diversifiées et tournées vers l’autoconsommation, les exploitations s’inscrivent aujourd’hui dans l’économie de marché tout en conservant une orientation de polyculture-élevage. Dans une perspective d’élaboration de scénarios d’évolution relatifs à l’élevage, nous avons mis en place un dispositif de recherche en partenariat. Il a été convenu, avec les partenaires, que la première étape de nos travaux porte sur l’amélioration de la connaissance des changements en cours dans les exploitations et la compréhension des stratégies des familles agricoles. A partir d’une enquête exhaustive et spatialisée des exploitations utilisant le territoire de quatre communes, nous avons, en premier lieu, élaboré une typologie pour disposer d’une représentation de la diversité de leurs situations. Les modes d’organisation spatiale et fonctionnelle des territoires d’exploitation montrent des situations contrastées liées à leur dimension et à leur accès aux ressources foncières. La transmission des exploitations et l’avenir de l’élevage bovin sont des questions pressantes qui constituent des éléments à intégrer dans les modèles et scénarios à élaborer.";"Choisis, Jean Philippe

"AGRIS:US2016223229";"The likely regional impacts of an agricultural emissions policy in New Zealand: Preliminary analysis";"";"Hendy and Kerr (2005b) find that an emissions charge on agricultural methane and nitrous oxide of $25 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent would be likely to reduce New Zealand‘s net land-use related emissions for commitment period one in the order of 3%, with full accounting. The costs per farmer and as a percentage of profit would be very high. This paper considers the regional impacts of such a policy in New Zealand by allocating the emission charge across space according to the location of animals. We then combine our emissions charge information with data on the socio-economic characteristics of the affected areas. Obviously rural areas are heavily affected. In many respects, for example median income, ethnic mix, and percentage of working people with a university degree, the rural areas most affected have very similar socio-economic characteristics to other parts of rural New Zealand. Only in two ways do they appear to differ. Our findings indicate that areas with high emission costs tend to have high employment rates, but that they also have a disproportionately high number of unqualified people.";"Sin, Isabelle

"AGRIS:US201301595212";"How do individual transferable quotas affect marine ecosystems?";"";"Published papers were reviewed to assess ecosystem impacts of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) and other dedicated access systems. Under ITQs, quota shares increase with higher abundance levels, thus fishers may request lower total allowable catches (TACs) and pay for monitoring and research that improves fishery sustainability. Mortality on target species generally declines because catches are closer to TACs and because ghost fishing through lost and abandoned gear decreases. High-grading and discarding often decline, but may increase if landings (and not catches) count against ITQs and when there is little at-sea enforcement. Overall, ITQs positively impact target species, although collapses can occur if TACs are set too high or if catches are routinely allowed to exceed TACs. Fishing pressure may increase on non-ITQ species because of spillover from ITQ fisheries, and in cases where fishers anticipate that future ITQ allocations will be based on catch history and therefore increase their current catches. Ecosystem and habitat impacts of ITQs were only sparsely covered in the literature and were difficult to assess: ITQs often lead to changes in total fishing effort (both positive and negative), spatial shifts in effort, and fishing gear modifications. Stock assessments may be complicated by changes in the relationship between catch per unit effort, and abundance, but ITQ participants will often assist in improving data collection and stock assessments. Overall, ITQs have largely positive effects on target species, but mixed or unknown effects on non-target fisheries and the overall ecosystem. Favourable outcomes were linked to sustainable TACs and effective enforcement.";"Branch, Trevor A.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301595212";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2008.00294.x";"";"";"";"39-57"

Accordingly, the value of land is determined by dividing net income by the capitalization rate. One of the major issues giving rise to misunderstanding in expropriation cases is the misuse of the capitalization rate. Currently, the overextending of expropriation cases contributes to investment latency and the escalation of expropriation costs. In this regard, the proper capitalization rate for the region where land is situated should be determined primarily for appraising the value of land. The purpose of this study was to show how to calculate the capitalization rate, especially for the members of valuation committees and experts, as well as related persons and institutions.

"AGRIS:US201600091816";"compositional and configurational heterogeneity of matrix habitats shape woodland carabid communities in wooded-agricultural landscapes";"";"CONTEXT: Landscape heterogeneity (the composition and configuration of matrix habitats) plays a major role in shaping species communities in wooded-agricultural landscapes. However, few studies consider the influence of different types of semi-natural and linear habitats in the matrix, despite their known ecological value for biodiversity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of the composition and configuration of matrix habitats for woodland carabid communities and identify whether specific landscape features can help to maintain long-term populations in wooded-agricultural environments. METHODS: Carabids were sampled from woodlands in 36 tetrads of 4 km² across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity including an innovative representation of linear habitats was quantified for each tetrad. Carabid community response was analysed using ordination methods combined with variation partitioning and additional response trait analyses. RESULTS: Woodland carabid community response was trait-specific and better explained by simultaneously considering the composition and configuration of matrix habitats. Semi-natural and linear features provided significant refuge habitat and functional connectivity. Mature hedgerows were essential for slow-dispersing carabids in fragmented landscapes. Species commonly associated with heathland were correlated with inland water and woodland patches despite widespread heathland conversion to agricultural land, suggesting that species may persist for some decades when elements representative of the original habitat are retained following landscape modification. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-natural and linear habitats have high biodiversity value. Landowners should identify features that can provide additional resources or functional connectivity for species relative to other habitat types in the landscape matrix. Agri-environment options should consider landscape heterogeneity to identify the most efficacious changes for biodiversity.";"Neumann, Jessica L.

Exploring the links between socio-metabolic disturbance and landscape ecology performance (Mallorca, Spain, 1956–2011)";"";"CONTEXT: The role of agricultural landscapes in biodiversity conservation is an emerging topic in a world experiencing a worrying decrease of species richness. Farm systems may either decrease or increase biological diversity, depending on land-use intensities and management. OBJECTIVES: We present an intermediate disturbance-complexity model (IDC) of cultural landscapes aimed at assessing how different levels of anthropogenic disturbance on ecosystems affect the capacity to host biodiversity depending on the land matrix heterogeneity. It is applied to the Mallorca Island, amidst the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. METHODS: The model uses the disturbance exerted when farmers alter the Net Primary Production through land-use change as well as when they remove a share of it (HANPP), together with Shannon–Wiener index (H′) of land-cover diversity. The model is tested with a twofold-scalar experimental design (1:50,000 and 1:5000) of a set of landscape units along three time points (1956, 1989, 2011). Species richness of breeding and wintering birds, taken as a biodiversity proxy, is used in an exploratory factor analysis. RESULTS: The results clearly show that when intermediate levels of HANPP are performed within intermediate levels of complexity (H′) in landscape patterns, like agro-forest mosaics, great bird species richness and high socio-ecological resilience can be maintained. Yet, these complex-heterogeneous landscapes are currently vanishing due to industrial farm intensification, rural abandonment and urban sprawl. CONCLUSIONS: The results make apparent the usefulness of transferring the concept of intermediate disturbance-complexity interplay to cultural landscapes. Our spatial-explicit IDC model can be used as a tool for strategic environmental assessment of land-use planning.";"Marull, Joan

"AGRIS:US201600091814";"Policy impacts on regulating ecosystem services: looking at the implications of 60 years of landscape change on soil erosion prevention in a Mediterranean silvo-pastoral system";"";"CONTEXT: Policy decisions form a major driver of land use change, with important implications for socially and environmentally susceptible regions. It is well known that there can be major unintended consequences, especially where policies are not tailored to regionally specific contexts. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we assess the implications of 60 years of agricultural policies on soil erosion prevention (SEP) by vegetation, an essential regulating ecosystem service in Mediterranean Europe. METHODS: To assess these implications we produced and analysed a time series of land cover/use and environmental conditions datasets (from 1951 to 2012) in relation to changing agricultural policies for a specific region in the southern Portugal. A set of indicators related to SEP allowed us to identify that land use intensification as increased soil erosion in the last 60 years. RESULTS: Particularly in the last 35 years, as a consequence of headage payments for cattle, the agricultural policy had a significant effect in the density and renewal of the tree cover, resulting in drastic effects for the provision of the SEP service. These are more significant after 1986, coinciding with the implementation of several Common Agricultural Policy instruments focused on increasing the modernization and productivity capacity of farm systems. CONCLUSIONS: The results show some unintended effects of agricultural policy mechanisms on ecosystem service provision and highlight the need for context-based policies, tailored to the environmental constrains and potentials of each region.";"Guerra, Carlos A.

"AGRIS:US201400004043";"Ground vegetation as an indicator of site quality: effect of non-site factors on the productivity of newly established chestnut plantations in northwestern Spain";"";"The growth of 67 young hybrid (Castanea� ×� coudercii A. Camus) and pure sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) plantations was studied in relation to ground vegetation (GV) and non-site factors such as type of site preparation, weed control (WC), disease-related damage and prior land use. The classification and regression trees procedure was used to analyse the data. Ground vegetation communities accounted for a large amount of variability in the site index (SI) and were found to be useful as predictors of chestnut site quality. The presence of broom communities indicated the best site for establishing chestnut plantations, whereas bracken and bramble communities indicated poorer conditions, although those sites can still be considered suitable for growing chestnut. Terrain covered with herbaceous communities also indicated intermediate or even good site conditions. The poorest sites were the heathlands. As regards non-site factors, only weed control was found to be a significant variable. Ground vegetation caused a significant reduction in tree growth, indicating the importance of carrying out regular weeding to improve productivity. The most positive effect of weeding on height growth was detected in terrain covered by gorse and broom, and the least positive effect was observed in heathland. The findings are important for forest management purposes, as evaluation of ground vegetation will enable rapid prediction of site productivity classes in afforested areas and help in selecting the best land for planting this species in reforestation programmes.";"Álvarez-Álvarez, Pedro

If effective, this massive regional effort will induce significant improvement in the vegetation conditions. At this time, the effectiveness of the GGP has not been well documented. Using Ansai County as a case study, we characterized the impact of the GGP on the land covers and landscape characteristics of this area by using multi-temporal Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ images of 1978, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. The results indicate that the land cover patterns and landscape characteristics in the county were greatly altered in a considerably short period. The implementation of the GGP increased the newly forested land substantially to 21.4% of the study area by 2010 at the cost of both cropland and shrub–grassland, which decreased by 46.3% and 18.8%, respectively, from 1995 to 2010. Consequently, the coverage of forested land (both older forest and newly forested land) increased from 12.4% in 1995 to 37.7% in 2010. Moreover, the GGP increased landscape fragmentation as indicated by a decreasing mean patch size and changes in class-level landscape indicators varied with land cover categories. The GGP induced improvement in vegetation conditions may benefit soil erosion alleviation and carbon sequestration in the Loess Plateau. However, the potential for the GGP to provide long-term positive ecological effects requires further study.";"Zhou, Decheng

Reducing in-stream pathogen contamination requires an understanding of the combined impacts of land cover, climatic conditions, and anthropogenic activities at the watershed scale. In this study these factors are considered by assessing linear relationships between in-stream E. coli water quality data, watershed indexes, and rainfall for the Squaw Creek Watershed, IA, USA. The watershed indexes consider the undisturbed land cover which encompasses the natural land cover area, wetlands, and vegetated stream corridors, and the disturbed land cover extent which includes areas receiving manure from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), tile-drained areas, and areas in cropped and urban land. In addition to disturbed and undisturbed land, we also calculated indexes for barren land and slope. Bivariate analysis was used to assess the linkage between E. coli concentrations, watershed indexes and the cumulative rainfall 15, 30, 45, and 60 days prior to water sample collection. To predict in-stream E. coli concentrations, we developed multivariate regression models, and predictions were compared with observed E. coli concentrations at 46 sampling locations over four sampling periods in two years. Results show that areas receiving manure, wetlands, drained land, and cropped land all influence in-stream E. coli concentrations significantly (p<0.001). The coefficient of determination was higher when indexes were corrected using the cumulative rainfall 30 days prior to the sampling event. Model skill varied from 0.29 to 0.55. More than 95% of the predictions across all spatial locations fall within one order of magnitude of the observed values. This Geographic Information System (GIS) based approach for predicting in-stream E. coli concentrations appears to be a useful technique for assessing the impacts of land management on water quality.";"Pandey, Pramod K.

Some writers believe that granting landholders commercial property rights in wildlife might be effective in dealing with this matter and result in the sustainable use of wildlife.  This paper explores this view using economic theory.  In doing so, it takes into account the total economic valuation concept.  While granting of commercial property rights is found to be effective for conserving some species, it is predicted to be a complete failure as a means of conserving other species.  In addition, particular attention is given to the economics of the utilisation and conservation of non-captive fugitive (or mobile) wildlife.  The economic theory involved is contrasted and compared with that for the exploitation of open-access resources.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-08-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016209310";"http://purl.umn.edu/48964";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400145300";"Baseline map of organic carbon in Australian soil to support national carbon accounting and monitoring under climate change";"";"We can effectively monitor soil condition—and develop sound policies to offset the emissions of greenhouse gases—only with accurate data from which to define baselines. Currently, estimates of soil organic C for countries or continents are either unavailable or largely uncertain because they are derived from sparse data, with large gaps over many areas of the Earth. Here, we derive spatially explicit estimates, and their uncertainty, of the distribution and stock of organic C in the soil of Australia. We assembled and harmonized data from several sources to produce the most comprehensive set of data on the current stock of organic C in soil of the continent. Using them, we have produced a fine spatial resolution baseline map of organic C at the continental scale. We describe how we made it by combining the bootstrap, a decision tree with piecewise regression on environmental variables and geostatistical modelling of residuals. Values of stock were predicted at the nodes of a 3‐arc‐sec (approximately 90� m) grid and mapped together with their uncertainties. We then calculated baselines of soil organic C storage over the whole of Australia, its states and territories, and regions that define bioclimatic zones, vegetation classes and land use. The average amount of organic C in Australian topsoil is estimated to be 29.7� t� ha⁻¹ with 95% confidence limits of 22.6 and 37.9� t� ha⁻¹. The total stock of organic C in the 0–30� cm layer of soil for the continent is 24.97� Gt with 95% confidence limits of 19.04 and 31.83� Gt. This represents approximately 3.5% of the total stock in the upper 30� cm of soil worldwide. Australia occupies 5.2% of the global land area, so the total organic C stock of Australian soil makes an important contribution to the global carbon cycle, and it provides a significant potential for sequestration. As the most reliable approximation of the stock of organic C in Australian soil in 2010, our estimates have important applications. They could support Australia's National Carbon Accounting System, help guide the formulation of policy around carbon offset schemes, improve Australia's carbon balances, serve to direct future sampling for inventory, guide the design of monitoring networks and provide a benchmark against which to assess the impact of changes in land cover, land management and climate on the stock of C in Australia. In this way, these estimates would help us to develop strategies to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change.";"Viscarra Rossel, Raphael A.

"AGRIS:US201400149691";"Estimation of variables explaining urbanization concomitant with land-use change: a spatial approach";"";"Urbanization in India is rapidly increasing. Dispersed development along highways or surrounding cities and in rural areas is resulting in serious loss of agricultural land, open space, waterbodies, and ecologically sensitive habitats. The management and monitoring of such resources require an understanding of change in land use and land cover. Vadodara City in Gujarat, India, has been chosen as the study area because it is a rapidly developing city with increasing urbanization and industrialization. Rapid growth of the population and haphazard expansion of local planning has led to substantial loss of agricultural land, resulting in several land-use changes. Such changes have been analysed using remotely sensed data in conjunction with conventional data. This study was carried out to detect the changes that have occurred in the study area over a period of 129 years (1880–2009) at the Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan (VMSS) level, i.e. the inner city level, and for 126 years (1880–2006) at the Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) level, i.e. the greater city area. The results reveal that the city expanded from 9.14 km² in 1880 to 136.68 km² in 2006, exhibiting a high rate of urbanization. Estimation of various variables, such as Shannon's entropy (SE), the urban sprawl index (USI), land consumption rate (LCR), and land absorption coefficient (LAC) related to urbanization, brought out interesting facts about the city.The results show that sprawl is high. This sprawl has evenly dispersed distribution across the space with absorption of land increasing over a period of time, but at the same time the absorbed land requires more planning and proper utilization as evident from lower LCR values. Such an understanding is a prerequisite for the sustainable planning required to counteract the perceived negative social, economic, and environmental impacts of urban sprawl.";"Sandhya Kiran, G.

"AGRIS:US201400149692";"Validation of MODIS, MISR, OMI, and CALIPSO aerosol optical thickness using ground-based sunphotometers in Hong Kong";"";"Aerosol observations are essential for understanding the Earth's radiation budget and the complexities of climate change, as they are involved in the backscattering of solar radiation and the formation of cloud condensation nuclei. In Hong Kong, the most direct effect is on air quality. Atmospheric haze caused by the emission of aerosols from industrial and vehicular sources creates visibility lower than 8 km for approximately 20% of the time, having risen at 6% per decade since 1980, but regional emissions are at least as influential as local ones. The 179,000 km² covered by Hong Kong and neighbouring Guangdong Province cannot be adequately covered by the 76 monitoring stations set up by the two governments, and satellite images offer the only potential source of regional air quality data. However, the current satellite-based aerosol optical thickness (AOT) products are intended for global air quality monitoring, and may contain errors over a humid coastal city such as Hong Kong and its surrounding industrialized regions. This research compares the AOT retrieved from several AOT operational products, namely the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD04 product, the MODIS 500 m product, the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) product, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) multiwavelength aerosol product, and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) product, with ground-based AOT from sunphotometers in Hong Kong. These sunphotometers include two AERONET stations, and are deployed in Hong Kong over urban, suburban, and coastal areas. The rigorous correlations, root mean square errors, and mean absolute differences available from the multilocational field data within one city region provide a strong base for validating the AOT products from different sensors and at different spatial scales over different land surface types. The results suggest that the AOT products, especially those from MODIS 10 km, provide reliable and accurate observations for daily air quality monitoring over a variety of land-cover types, as well as for identifying emission sources for coordinated actions by the governments of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.";"Wong, Man Sing

"AGRIS:US201400149696";"Assessment of forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon using Landsat data";"";"The rapid environmental changes occurring in the Brazilian Amazon due to widespread deforestation have attracted the attention of the scientific community for several decades. A topic of particular interest involves the assessment of the combined impacts of selective logging and forest fires. Forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires may vary in scale, from local to global changes, mostly related to the increase of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Selective logging activities and forest fires have been reported by several studies as important agents of land-use and land-cover changes. Previous studies have focused on selective logging, but forest fires on a large scale in tropical regions have yet to be properly addressed. This study involved a more comprehensive investigation of temporal and basin-wide changes of forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires using remotely sensed data acquired in 1992, 1996, and 1999. Landsat imagery and remote-sensing techniques for detecting burned forests and estimating forest canopy cover were applied. We also conducted rigorous ground measurements and observations to validate remote-sensing techniques and to assess canopy-cover impacts by selective logging and forest fires in three different states in the Brazilian Amazon. The results of this study showed a substantial increase in total forested areas impacted by selective logging and forest fires from approximately 11,800 to 35,600 km² in 1992 and 1999, respectively. Selective logging was responsible for 60.4% of this forest disturbance in the studied period. Approximately 33% and 7% of forest disturbances detected in the same period were due to impacts of forest fires only and selective logging and forest fires combined, respectively. Most of the degraded forests (∼90%) were detected in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará. Our estimates indicated that approximately 5467, 7618, and 17437 km² were new areas of selective logging and/or forest fires in 1992, 1996, and 1999, respectively. Protected areas seemed to be very effective in constraining these types of forest degradation. Approximately 2.4% and 1.3% of the total detected selectively logged and burned forests, respectively, were geographically located within protected areas. We observed, however, an increasing trend for these anthropogenic activities to occur within the limits of protected areas from 1992 to 1999. Although forest fires impacted the least area of tropical forests in the study region, new areas of burned forests detected in 1996 and 1999 were responsible for the greatest impact on canopy cover, with an estimated canopy loss of 18.8% when compared to undisturbed forests. Selective logging and forest fires combined impacted even more those forest canopies, with an estimated canopy loss of 27.5%. Selectively logged forest only showed the least impact on canopy cover, with an estimated canopy loss of 5%. Finally, we observed that forest canopy cover impacted by selective logging activities can recover faster (up to 3 years) from impact when compared to those forests disturbed by fires (up to 5 years) in the Amazon region.";"Matricardi, Eraldo A.T.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area. Considering the above background, this study was conducted with the objectives of developing a land degradation assessment model using a GIS based approach.";"Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed, South Eastern University of Sri Lanka";"";"";"AGRIS";"2013-10-07";"";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"LKA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=CH2016305473";"http://www.scipress.com/ILNS.53.80.pdf";"";"";"";"80-86"
"AGRIS:US201500081953";"Spatial Patterns of Breeding Success of Grizzly Bears Derived from Hierarchical Multistate Models";"";"Conservation programs often manage populations indirectly through the landscapes in which they live. Empirically, linking reproductive success with landscape structure and anthropogenic change is a first step in understanding and managing the spatial mechanisms that affect reproduction, but this link is not sufficiently informed by data. Hierarchical multistate occupancy models can forge these links by estimating spatial patterns of reproductive success across landscapes. To illustrate, we surveyed the occurrence of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Canadian Rocky Mountains Alberta, Canada. We deployed camera traps for 6 weeks at 54 surveys sites in different types of land cover. We used hierarchical multistate occupancy models to estimate probability of detection, grizzly bear occupancy, and probability of reproductive success at each site. Grizzly bear occupancy varied among cover types and was greater in herbaceous alpine ecotones than in low‐elevation wetlands or mid‐elevation conifer forests. The conditional probability of reproductive success given grizzly bear occupancy was 30% (SE = 0.14). Grizzly bears with cubs had a higher probability of detection than grizzly bears without cubs, but sites were correctly classified as being occupied by breeding females 49% of the time based on raw data and thus would have been underestimated by half. Repeated surveys and multistate modeling reduced the probability of misclassifying sites occupied by breeders as unoccupied to <2%. The probability of breeding grizzly bear occupancy varied across the landscape. Those patches with highest probabilities of breeding occupancy—herbaceous alpine ecotones—were small and highly dispersed and are projected to shrink as treelines advance due to climate warming. Understanding spatial correlates in breeding distribution is a key requirement for species conservation in the face of climate change and can help identify priorities for landscape management and protection.";"FISHER, JASON T.

There are many landslide susceptibility analyses such as statistical, bivariate and data mining approaches exist in the literature. This paper presents the use of fuzzy logic relations for landslide susceptibility mapping on part of Selangor area, Malaysia, using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing data. At first, landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images, supported by extensive field surveys. Topographic and geological data and satellite images were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and image processing. Thirteen landslide conditioning factors such as slope gradient, slope exposure, plan curvature, altitude, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance from drainage, distance from road, lithology, distance from faults, soil, landcover and normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi) were extracted from the spatial database. These factors were analyzed using fuzzy logic relations to produce the landslide susceptibility maps. Using the landslide conditioning factors and the identified landslides, the fuzzy membership values were calculated. Then fuzzy algebraic operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values for landslide susceptibility mapping. Finally, the ROC curves for all landslide susceptibility models were drawn and the area under curve values were calculated. Landslide locations were used to validate results of the landslide susceptibility maps and the validation results showed 94% accuracy for the fuzzy gamma operator employing all parameters produced in the present study as the landslide conditioning factors. Results showed that, among the fuzzy relations, in the case in which the gamma operator (λ = 0.975) showed the best accuracy (94.73%) while the case in which the fuzzy algebraic Or was applied showed the worst accuracy (84.76%). The landslide susceptibility maps produced by the fuzzy gamma operators shows similar trends as those obtained by applying logistic regression procedure by the same author and indicate that fuzzy relations results perform slightly better than the earlier method. Qualitatively, the model yields reasonable results which can be used for preliminary land-use planning purposes.";"Pradhan, Biswajeet";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"MYS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400147752";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-010-0147-7";"";"";"";"471-493"
"AGRIS:US201301860929";"Response of Two Sagebrush Sites to Low-Disturbance, Mechanical Removal of Piñyon and Juniper";"";"In the Great Basin of the western United States, expansion of Pinus monophylla (singleleaf piñyon) and Juniperus osteosperma (Utah juniper) out of historic woodlands and into Artemisia spp. (sagebrush) shrubland communities can facilitate the invasion of exotic downy brome (Bromus tectorum) and lead to decreases in ecological and economic values of shrublands. This expansion has, therefore, been the focus of management efforts, including the thinning or removal of trees in areas that were historically shrubland. Our study examined the effects of tree thinning at two sites located in eastern Nevada, near the center of the Great Basin. Such projects can be controversial, so our goal was to estimate and document the ecological effects of low-disturbance tree thinning at these two sites. Both sites were mechanically thinned using a feller-buncher and were aerially seeded with native grasses. Aerial seeding had no apparent effect at either site. The site that had lower tree cover before treatment (Ely, NV) showed an increase in native forbs and a small increase in invasives. The site that initially had very high tree cover and low shrub cover (Mt. Wilson, NV) showed increases in native forbs and species diversity and a substantial increase in invasives. We conclude that low-disturbance methods for thinning encroaching trees can have positive ecological effects in shrublands but that the initial cover of both trees and native herbaceous species should be considered to determine the potential of the site to recover naturally from the seedbank and the risk of invasion by downy brome.";"Baughman, Carson

In the case of Southeast Asia, oil palm cultivation is one of the most lucrative possible land uses. Existing mechanisms for awarding certified emission reductions (CERs) might not be adequately flexible to changing commodity prices or to meet the needs of landowners who heavily discount future returns from their land. Real options could be a useful valuation tool for negotiating an annual contract that guarantees a minimum payment or “strike price” to the landowner depending on the potential returns from cultivation of their land. The real option based algorithm computes a competitive payment dependent on the relevant commodity prices contributing to land cover change. This article proposes a method whereby the risk is shared between the seller and buyer, providing a per hectare payment that favors the conservation of forests containing higher biomass per hectare.";"Morel, Alexandra C.

"AGRIS:US201500015971";"Trade-offs between maintenance of ecosystem services and socio-economic development in rural mountainous communities in southern Spain: A dynamic simulation approach";"";"Mountainous rural communities have traditionally managed their land extensively, resulting in land uses that provide important ecosystem services for both rural and urban areas. Over recent decades, these communities have undergone drastic changes in economic structure, population size and land use. Our understanding of the exact mechanisms that drive these changes is limited, and there is also a lack of integrative approaches to enable decision makers to steer rural development towards a more sustainable path. In this study, we build a dynamic simulation model to calculate the trade-offs between the provisions of two ecosystem services – landscape aesthetic value and water supply for human use – and the economic development associated with different land use changes. The study area for the simulation comprises two rural communities located in southern Spain. Our results show trade-offs between economic development and the provision of the selected ecosystem services in the selected study area. Land use intensification results in economic development but is not enough to prevent population loss and has a negative impact on both the water supply and on aesthetic services. We conclude that more proactive management policies are needed to mitigate a loss in ecosystem services. Simulation models like ours may facilitate the choice of these policies, as they could test the result of land use planning policies contributing therefore, to a more integrative and sustainable management of rural communities.";"Vidal-Legaz, Beatriz

This paper presents the uncertainty in hydromorphological and ecological model output for a large lowland river depending on the classification accuracy (CA) of a land cover map. Using four different models, we quantified the uncertainty for the three distributaries of the Rhine River in The Netherlands with respect to: (1) hydrodynamics (WAQUA model), (2) annual average suspended sediment deposition (SEDIFLUX model), (3) ecotoxicological hazards of contaminated sediment for a bird of prey, and (4) floodplain importance for desired habitat types and species (BIO-SAFE model). We carried out two Monte Carlo (n = 15) analyses: one at a 69% land cover CA, the other at 95% CA. Subsequently we ran all four models with the 30 realizations as input. The error in the current land cover map gave an uncertainty in design water levels of up to 19 cm. Overbank sediment deposition varied up to 100% in the area bordering the main channel, but when aggregated to the whole study area, the variation in sediment trapping efficiency was negligible. The ecotoxicological hazards, represented by the fraction of Little Owl habitat with potential cadmium exposure levels exceeding a corresponding toxicity threshold of 148 μg d⁻¹, varied between 54 and 60%, aggregated over the distributaries. The 68% confidence interval of floodplain importance for protected and endangered species varied between 10 and 15%. Increasing the classification accuracy to 95% significantly lowered the uncertainty of all models applied. Compared to landscaping measures, the effects due to the uncertainty in the land cover map are of the same order of magnitude. Given high financial costs of these landscaping measures, increasing the classification accuracy of land cover maps is a prerequisite for improving the assessment of the efficiency of landscaping measures.";"Straatsma, Menno W.

"AGRIS:US201500015979";"Forming social capital—Does participatory planning foster trust in institutions?";"";"Participatory planning that includes interest groups and municipal representatives has been presented as a means to deal with the increasing difficulty to reach arrangements due to progressively scarce land resources. Under dispute is whether collaborative forms of planning augment social capital or whether they might actually cause the destruction of such a valuable social commodity. In this paper we focus on trust in institution as a specific dimension of social capital because we argue that this is one of the effects the convenors of such participatory planning procedures are most interested in. We pursue a pre-post design and survey advisory group members of five on-going river-related planning processes in Switzerland. Controlling for generalised trust, we investigate how trust in institutions is affected over time by the quality of such processes and the degree of participation they offer. We find that generalised trust is highly correlated with initial levels of trust and so is process quality. Particularly the latter finding challenges the usually assumed direction of causality according to which process quality influences trust building. Additionally, we find a positive (non-significant) effect of process quality on changes in trust, while a higher degree of participation rather seems to hinder trust building. We suppose this indicates that under the conditions of limited time and resources more attention should be paid to how to improve the quality of participatory processes than putting much effort in increasing the degree of participation.";"Menzel, Susanne

"AGRIS:US201600190047";"Impact of land use intensity on sandy desertification: An evidence from Horqin Sandy Land, China";"";"It has been widely accepted that high land use intensity contributes to sandy desertification in Northern China. However, it is surprising that it is even not easy to find an explicit definition and proper indicator for the term âland use intensityâ in the sandy desertification related literatures. To better understand the association between sandy desertification and its driving factors, especially in the context of the synergistic roles of both climatic and anthropogenic variables, an indicator for land use intensity was developed in this paper for quantifying the relative role of land use output on different kinds of vegetation cover. The results indicated land use intensity increased rapidly from 1980 to 1995, obviously decreased from 1995 to 2000, and increased slowly after 2000 as a result of the continued increase of socioeconomic pressures and the fluctuating changes in vegetative cover.An ARDL model was established and applied to analyze the correlation between the area of bare sand land and land use intensity with the influence of annual precipitation in temporal dimension. The area of bare sand land was significantly affected by land use intensity in the long run. However, in the short run, the area of bare sand land was mainly impacted by the auto-correlation effect of itself in temporal dimension and by the annual precipitation. The improvement of the sand dunes obviously reduced the risk of sandy desertification under the condition of specific land use intensity.Before analyzing the correlation between land use intensity and sandy desertification, specific skills were applied to improve the model, including data interpolation and regression verification, since there would be regression biases resulting from the acquisition and processing of time-series data of different sources. Results showed that the area of bare sand land (St)and the land use intensity (LIt) were time-independent. Lag terms of these two variables were added to improve original model.Changes in socioeconomic pressures and ecological restoration projects had obvious influences on land use intensity. Along with the steady increase of socioecological pressures on land and the changes in vegetative cover resulting from various ecological protection strategies and ecological restoration projects, shifts in land use intensity followed a different trend with the population and the social-economic demands. Nonetheless, the continuous increase of socioeconomic demands will increase land use intensity in the long run, so that the risk of sandy desertification remains high.";"Ge, Xiaodong

"AGRIS:FR2014005582";"La valeur économique des paysages des villes périurbanisées";"";"In this research, we propose a method for describing rural landscapes in peri urban areas and evaluating their impact on house and land prices. This method matches quantitative geography and econometric methods used for hedonic analysis. A geographical model is used for producing variables describing the landscape an observer can look at when located in a specific house or a land parcel. This model takes account of these parts of the landscape that are hidden by houses, buildings, hills, forests,. . . The variables produced by the model describe the size of the area that can be seen and its repartition across various types of land use (agriculture, forest, buildings, roads, water,. . . ). They are used as explanatory factors for the price paid for buying the house or land parcel, using hedonic regression. This method has been simultaneously used in six areas: the periurban areas of the cities of Dijon, Besançon, Lyon, Marseille and Brest and the whole Nord-Pas de Calais region. We are then able to compare results obtained using the same methodology for various areas, with various types of landscapes. Moreover, for Dijon, Besançon and the Nord-Pas de Calais regions, we can compare variables produced using different sources of information. For Dijon and Besançon, they differ with respect to the thinness and the quality of the satellite images used for analysing landcapes, the best one being much more expansive. For the Nord-Pas de Calais, we compared two types of geographical information systems. Our results confirm that the quality of the landscape that can be seen when located at a house or in a land parcel significantly influences its price. A landscape, with notably green areas, has a value that is capitalized into house and land prices. However, the measure of this value is highly variable across regions and is highly sensitive to the quality of the data used by the geographical model. Therefore, at this stage of the research work, our results cannot be used for operational purposes.

La recherche présentée ici propose une méthode de description et d’évaluation des caractéristiques d’un paysage qui combine la géographie quantitative et l’économétrie des modèles hédoniques. Un modèle géographique produit des indices caractérisant les paysages à partir d’une reconstitution de la vue depuis le sol, en tenant compte des effets du relief et des masques que les objets hauts opposent à la vue. Il décrit la quantité de paysage vu par un observateur au niveau du sol en la répartissant entre 13 types d’occupations du sol. Les variables produites par le modèle géographique sont utilisées dans des régressions hédoniques qui permettent d’évaluer l’impact des attributs paysagers ainsi mesurés sur les prix des transactions immobilières. Nous avons appliqué cette méthode à six zones géographiques périurbaines, autour des villes de Dijon, Besançon, Lyon, Marseille et Brest et pour l’ensemble de la région Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Nous pouvons ainsi comparer les résultats obtenus en appliquant la même méthode sur le même type de données, dans des contextes différents, notamment par le type de paysage. De plus, pour Dijon, Besançon et le Nord-Pas-de-Calais, nous disposons de plusieurs sources d’information géographique différant par leur qualité, notamment la finesse des images satellitaires utilisées ; ce qui nous permet d’analyser l’impact de la qualité des données sur la qualité de la description des paysages et sur les évaluations économiques qui en résultent. En règle générale, les résultats obtenus montrent que la contribution des attributs paysagers au prix des biens fonciers et immobiliers est faible mais significative. Les paysages, en particulier les objets « verts » (couverts arborés et agricoles), sont valorisés par les ménages à travers leur capitalisation dans les valeurs immobilières, en particulier dans l’espace périurbain. Cependant, les résultats obtenus sont très sensibles à la qualité et à la finesse des sources d’information utilisées pour décrire le paysage. Ils sont également très variables d’une zone géographique à l’autre, sans que l’on dispose actuellement de facteurs explicatifs de cette variabilité.";"Brossard , Thierry

However, the concept of poorly enforced property right and particularly risk of eviction as a measure of insecurity of land tenure has not been adequately examined in the context of degradation of CPR. A game theoretic framework is developed where degradation of forest grazing land is explained in terms of changes in perceived risk of eviction from the encroached land. Logit regression is applied to empirically analyse the impact of perceived fear of reduced access and other variables on the state of degradation. For this purpose, a sample of seven villages is considered in tribal dominated region in West Bengal, India. It is observed that apart from a number of socio-economic variables like poverty, mutual trust and other incomes, perceived fear of eviction (represented as a dummy variable) arising from insecurity of forest land tenure, has a significant impact on forest degradation status in the study region.";"Datta, Soumyendra Kishore

The sites are spread over four countries with different climates, vegetation and management. Annual Rh from the different sites ranged from 110 to 540 g C m⁻². The maximum annual Rh occurred when the water table (WT) level was between −10 and −25 cm and the air temperature was above 6.2 °C. The model successfully simulated seasonal trends for the majority of the sites. Regression relationships (r²) between the EC-derived and simulated Rh ranged from 0.28 to 0.76, and the root mean square error and relative error were small, revealing an acceptable fit. The overall relative deviation value between annual EC-derived and simulated Rh was small (−1 %) and model efficiency ranges across sites from −0.25 to +0.41. Sensitivity analysis highlighted that increasing temperature, decreasing precipitation and lowering WT depth could significantly increase Rh from soils. Thus, management which lowers the WT could significantly increase anthropogenic CO₂, so from a carbon emissions perspective, it should be avoided. The results presented here demonstrate a robust basis for further application of the ECOSSE model to assess the impacts of future land management interventions on peatland carbon emissions and to help guide best practice land management decisions.";"Abdalla, M.

The REVEALS model was applied on 636 pollen records from lakes and bogs to reconstruct the past cover of 25 plant taxa grouped into 10 plant‐functional types and three land‐cover types [evergreen trees, summer‐green (deciduous) trees, and open land]. The model corrects for some of the biases in pollen percentages by using pollen productivity estimates and fall speeds of pollen, and by applying simple but robust models of pollen dispersal and deposition. The emerging patterns of tree migration and deforestation between 6k bp and modern time in the REVEALS estimates agree with our general understanding of the vegetation history of Europe based on pollen percentages. However, the degree of anthropogenic deforestation (i.e. cover of cultivated and grazing land) at 3k, 0.5k, and 0.2k bp is significantly higher than deduced from pollen percentages. This is also the case at 6k in some parts of Europe, in particular Britain and Ireland. Furthermore, the relationship between summer‐green and evergreen trees, and between individual tree taxa, differs significantly when expressed as pollen percentages or as REVEALS estimates of tree cover. For instance, when Pinus is dominant over Picea as pollen percentages, Picea is dominant over Pinus as REVEALS estimates. These differences play a major role in the reconstruction of European landscapes and for the study of land cover–climate interactions, biodiversity and human resources.";"Trondman, A.‐K.

However, during 40 years of study of reforestation in the subtropical southeastern USA, repeated observations of above‐ and belowground carbon documented that significant gains in soil organic matter (SOM) in surface soils (0–7.5 cm) were offset by significant SOM losses in subsoils (35–60 cm). Here, we extended the observation period in this long‐term experiment by an additional decade, and used soil fractionation and stable isotopes and radioisotopes to explore changes in soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen that accompanied nearly 50 years of loblolly pine secondary forest development. We observed that accumulations of mineral soil C and N from 0 to 7.5 cm were almost entirely due to accumulations of light‐fraction SOM. Meanwhile, losses of soil C and N from mineral soils at 35 to 60 cm were from SOM associated with silt and clay‐sized particles. Isotopic signatures showed relatively large accumulations of forest‐derived carbon in surface soils, and little to no accumulation of forest‐derived carbon in subsoils. We argue that the land use change from old field to secondary forest drove biogeochemical and hydrological changes throughout the soil profile that enhanced microbial activity and SOM decomposition in subsoils. However, when the pine stands aged and began to transition to mixed pines and hardwoods, demands on soil organic matter for nutrients to support aboveground growth eased due to pine mortality, and subsoil organic matter levels stabilized. This study emphasizes the importance of long‐term experiments and deep measurements when characterizing soil C and N responses to land use change and the remarkable paucity of such long‐term soil data deeper than 30 cm.";"Mobley, Megan L.

The paper then develops a framework that captures the analytics of water demand management in terms of both the impact pathways of and operational linkages among the options and their underlying institutions. Using this framework, the paper outlines a strategy for water demand management that can exploit well the inherent synergies among the options, and also align them well with the underlying institutional structure and its environment. Similarly, based on an analysis of the NRLP, the paper also indicates the strategy for implementing the NRLP and thereby promoting water supply management within the financial, institutional and political constraints.

"AGRIS:US2012210453";"LOCAL SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM";"";"The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), first enacted in 1985, seeks to achieve both conservation and agricultural supply control objectives through voluntary, long-term (10 year contracts) retirement of cropland.  By fall 2000, the program had enrolled about 31.4 million acres nationwide, and North Dakota ranked third among the states, with 3.2 million contracted acres, or 11 percent of the state's total cropland.  Although long-term land retirement offers a variety of environmental benefits, as well as providing a stable income to participating landowners, large-scale land retirement can pose adverse economic impacts for nearby communities, primarily because agricultural supply and service sector businesses may be adversely affected.  This study was undertaken to examine the local socioeconomic effects of the Conservation Reserve Program in rural areas of North Dakota.

Interviews with agricultural and community leaders in six rural areas of North Dakota revealed that the CRP was perceived to have both positive and negative effects.  The program was considered a substantial benefit to landowners, providing them with a guaranteed income from some of their least productive land.  In addition, the environmental benefits of the program, including reduced soil erosion, improved water quality, and enhanced wildlife populations, were widely recognized.  Negative effects cited by the leaders focused on the adverse impacts of cropland retirement on the farm supply and service sector and the role of the CRP in declining farm numbers and rural depopulation.  

A survey of more than 1,000 CRP contract holders provided additional perspective regarding the program's effects.  Leading reasons for enrolling land in the CRP were to reduce erosion/increase soil fertility (24%), reduce income risk (23%), CRP was economically attractive (22%), and provide a transition to retirement (11%).  The contract holders also reported that the land they enrolled in the CRP had lower yields than other land in the area, by an average of 5 percent.  Forty-two percent of the respondents had enrolled 150 acres or less and only 21 percent had enrolled more than 450 acres.  Of the contract holders who had once farmed but were no longer farming, only 23 percent indicated that the CRP influenced their decision to quit farming.  On the other hand, of the respondents who were currently farming, 31 percent indicated that the CRP had been instrumental in keeping them on the farm.

When the leaders were asked for suggestions to improve the program, their responses reflected three major themes.  One group felt that the CRP should focus on highly erodible land and that recent changes in enrollment criteria have allowed too much productive farmland to be enrolled.  Another group of respondents argued for periodic haying of the CRP land (e.g., every third or fourth year), a measure they thought that would both improve the wildlife habitat value of the land and provide a feed base for livestock producers.  Finally, a number of leaders in each study area suggested options to increase recreational access to CRP land.  They believe that increased economic activity associated with recreational activities (primarily hunting) may offer their communities a means to offset some of the economic losses associated with land retirement.";"Hodur, Nancy M.

This paper examines the potential contributions that short-rotation forest crops grown on marginal agricultural lands can make in producing biomass for wood-base power plants and in supplying wood to the forest industry. A large-scale regional scheduling model was used to allocate forest and agricultural lands in order to minimize wood production costs for forest industry as well as power plant uses. Alternative potential sites for a wood-based power plant were examined in terms of wood production costs and of transportation implications. Preliminary recommendations as to the most appropriate agricultural lands and sites for power plants are made. The higher productivity of agricultural lands leads to reduced harvesting of forest lands. The associated indirect environmental benefits and the direct environmental benefits from putting agricultural lands under tree cover are the subject of additional research.";"Rose, Dietmar W.

Modern NPPs were recovered from recently deposited surface sediment in 20 small crater lakes in western Uganda, located along environmental gradients of vegetation (moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forest, wooded and open grass savannah), land use (pastoralism, crop agriculture, plantations) and lake characteristics (basin morphometry, water chemistry and aquatic production). We analyzed 9700 NPP specimens, which could be assigned to 265 distinct morphotypes, of which 239 belong to six major taxonomic groups: spores and other remains of fungi (198 morphotypes), spores of ferns and mosses (19 morphotypes), microscopic zoological remains (14 morphotypes), colonies, coenobia or zygo-/aplanospores produced by filamentous algae (7 morphotypes) and microscopic aquatic plant remains (1 morphotype). The remaining 26 morphotypes could not be assigned to a specific taxonomic category. Using primary taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic literature, 73 (28%) of the recovered morphotypes could be identified at the species, genus or family level, thereby conferring ecological indicator value to them. This study may facilitate the use of fossil NPPs to help reconstruct past climatic and anthropogenic impacts on African ecosystems, as already broadly established in other study regions outside Africa.";"Gelorini, Vanessa

Farms are categorized by geographic region, farm type, farm size, gross cash sales, farm tenure, net farm income, debt-to-asset, and age of farmer to analyze relationships between financial performance and farm characteristics. Five year averages, 1999-2003, and farm financial trends for the 1995-2004 period are also presented.

Year-to-year changes in median net farm income averaged nearly 40 percent from 1995 to 2004.  Median net farm income fell slightly in 2004 to $44,912, after reaching a 10-year high, $49,181 in 2003.  Financial performance was lowest in 1997 and 1998 when over one-half of farms could not make scheduled term debt payments.  In 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2004 the rate of return on equity exceeded the rate of return on assets, which indicates that debt capital was employed profitably. The interest expense as a percent of gross revenue was 5.6 in 2003 and 2004, the lowest in the past 10 years.  It had improved six consecutive years.

From 1995 to 2004 the Red River Valley has had stronger profitability, solvency and repayment capacity measures than other regions. Crop farms from 1995-2004 have been larger, as measured by gross sales, and have had better solvency and profitability than livestock farms. Farms with sales less than $100,000 were twice as likely to have debt-to-asset higher than 70 percent than were farms with sales greater than $250,000. Farms that own some crop land, but less than 40 percent and are more likely to be crop farms, farm more acreage, and have larger sales, are typically the most profitable.";"Swenson, Andrew L.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012210457";"http://purl.umn.edu/23543";"";"";"";""

This prevents agricultural efficiency from reaching desired levels. Land consolidation involves redistributing land ownership so that individual farmers own fewer, larger, more compact and more contiguous land parcels. In Turkey, generally voluntary land consolidation projects are performed, while some financial limitations and political conditions prevent land consolidation reach to its desired level. For this reason, only 2.2% of the agricultural areas have been consolidated so far. Ideally, farmers adopt consolidation and are pleased by its results; this helps maintain the sustainability of the land structure formed by consolidation and accelerate acceptance of consolidation in other areas. In this study, the factors that are effective on farmers' adopting land consolidation and their contentment were investigated. For this purpose, the results of the survey carried out in the selected villages within the Bursa-Karacabey plain were assessed using a logit model. According to the results obtained from this consolidation study, the criteria farmers value are the utilization of the irrigation system, reduction of inter-farmer conflicts, shaping parcels into a form proper for mechanized agriculture, and forming parcels of large dimensions by consolidating parcels. A higher level of contentment was observed among the farmers who were provided with above mentioned factors.

La propiedad de la tierra en Turquía está muy fragmentada, tal y como sucede en los países de Europa central. Este fenómeno impide que el rendimiento llegue a los niveles deseados. La concentración parcelaria implica la redistribución de la propiedad, lo que provoca que los agricultores individuales obtengan menos parcelas, pero más contiguas y compactas y de mayor tamaño. En Turquía, se han aplicado en general proyectos voluntarios de concentración parcelaria, pero las limitaciones financieras y las condiciones políticas del país impiden que la concentración parcelaria llegue al nivel deseado. Por ello, solo el 2,2% de la tierra cultivable está consolidada hasta ahora. Normalmente, los agricultores aceptan la concentración y están satisfechos con los resultados. Esto ayuda a mantener la nueva estructura de la tierra obtenida y acelera la aceptación de la concentración en otras zonas. En este estudio, se investigaron los factores que afectan a los agricultores para aceptar la concentración parcelaria y su nivel de satisfacción. Con este fin, el modelo logit se aplicó a los pueblos localizados en la llanura de Bursa-Karacabey y se vio que en un trabajo de concentración bien planificado, los agricultores están más satisfechos si sus demandas se tienen en cuenta, si las parcelas están irrigadas, si los conflictos entre los agricultores se reducen, si la forma de la parcela es adecuada para la agricultura mecanizada, y si aumenta el tamaño de las parcelas.";"Akkaya Aslan, S.T.

Using Landsat and ground observation for validation it was possible to discriminate 11 land cover classes. In 2002 57% of the land surface of Borneo was covered with forest of which 74% was dipterocarp and more than 23% peat swamp forest. The average deforestation rate between 2002 and 2005 was 1.7% yr⁻ ¹. The carbon-rich ecosystem of peat swamp forests showed a deforestation rate of 2.2%. Almost 98% of all deforestation occurred within a range of 5 km to the forest edge. Fire is highly correlated with land cover changes. Most fires were detected in degraded forests.

Vulnerability or livelihood insecurity emerges when poor people as individuals or social units have to face harmful threats or shocks with inadequate capacity to respond effectively. In such situations, people often have no choice but to turn to their immediate environment for support. Evidence suggests that rising levels of human vulnerability are driving increased dependency on biodiversity and ecosystem services, which in turn, and along with other threats, is rendering ecosystems more vulnerable. This paper explores the dynamic and complex linkages and feedbacks between human vulnerability and ecosystem vulnerability, drawing on data from the southern African region. Human vulnerability is conceptualized as a threat to ecosystem health, as driven by the interplay between a number of current and emerging factors. We focus on poverty, HIV/AIDS and more intense climate extremes as examples of stressors on livelihoods and direct and indirect drivers of ecosystem change. We discuss how some of the responses to increased vulnerability may pose threats to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem management and sustainable development, whilst considering potential solutions that rely on a thorough understanding of coupled social–ecological systems and the interplay between multiple stressors and responses at different scales.";"Shackleton, Sheona E.

Even though most current studies highlight positive outcomes, there are also negative effects of social learning with respect to natural resource management. This paper explores the influence of social learning outcomes on the adoption of soil conservation practices in Amba Zuria, Ethiopia. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and in workshops. The interviews were transcribed and analysed with the qualitative data analysis software ATLAS.ti. In addition, a review of pertinent documents and literature complements the analysis. We found that social learning results in positive outcomes in interactions among the actors, broader understanding on soil conservation, trust and mutual understanding, and the creation of opportunities to apply both indigenous and scientific knowledge. These outcomes, in turn, foster the adoption of stone terraces to conserve soils. No such positive results were found for farmers who were not involved in the learning process and who did not adopt stone terraces. The non-adoption can partly be explained by their exclusion from sharing the positive outcomes of social learning. The study also shows limitations related to the short duration of the learning platforms, insufficient representation of women and irregular patterns of learning schedules. Hence, Ethiopian soil conservation strategies should put emphasis on social learning in order to strengthen the collective processes of soil conservation measures.";"Dessie, Yinager

"AGRIS:US201600059859";"Relevance assessment of full-waveform lidar data for urban area classification";"";"Full-waveform lidar data are increasingly being available. Morphological features can be retrieved from the echoes composing the waveforms, and are now extensively used for a large variety of land-cover mapping issues. However, the genuine contribution of these features with respect to those computed from standard discrete return lidar systems has been barely theoretically investigated. This paper therefore aims to study the potential of full-waveform data through the automatic classification of urban areas in building, ground, and vegetation points. Two waveform processing methods, namely a non-linear least squares method and a marked point process approach, are used to fit the echoes both with symmetric and asymmetric modeling functions. The performance of the extracted full-waveform features for the classification problem are then compared to a large variety of multiple-pulse features thanks to three feature selection methods. A support vector machines classifier is finally used to label the point cloud according to various scenarios based on the rank of the features. This allows to find the best classification strategy as well as the minimal feature subsets allowing to achieve the highest classification accuracy possible for each of the three feature selection methods. The results show that the echo amplitude as well as two features computed from the radiometric calibration of full-waveform data, namely the cross-section and the backscatter coefficient, significantly contribute to the high classification accuracies reported in this paper (around 95%). Conversely, features extracted from the non Gaussian modelling of the echoes are not relevant for the discrimination of vegetation, ground, and buildings in urban areas.";"Mallet, Clément

"AGRIS:US201400139357";"change vector analysis technique for monitoring land cover changes in Copsa Mica, Romania, in the period 1985–2011";"";"During the communist regime, Romania’s planned economy focused exclusively on production neglecting the environment protection. The lack of less polluting production technologies and of environmental protection measures led to excessive pollution in certain industrialized areas. This is the case of the town of Copsa Mica in Sibiu County, which in 1987 was considered one of the most polluted towns in Europe. The present study assesses the change vector analysis (CVA) technique using a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image time series to monitor land cover changes caused by carbon black and heavy metal pollution. CVA was applied to the tasseled cap greenness (TCG) and tasseled cap brightness (TCB) indices, as well as to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and bare soil index (BI). Various maps were generated for the periods 1985–1994, 1994–2003, 2003–2011, and 1985–2011, and threshold values were determined for the detection of land cover change/no change. The change direction and magnitude values were cross-tabulated and classified. The technique was assessed based on the change versus no-change error matrix. The results show that in the area of Copsa Mica, land cover changes occurred because of a considerable decrease in the area affected by carbon black and heavy metal pollution. The CVA technique proved efficient in monitoring the land cover changes caused by pollution and especially by carbon black pollution. Soil pollution by heavy metals is reflected in the bare soil surfaces present in the imagery.";"Vorovencii, Iosif";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"150;ROU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400139357";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3831-5";"";"";"";"5951-5968"

We asked whether removal of CWD affected the structure and functioning of an arid woodland ecosystem in mid-western Argentina. These woodlands are protected by national laws and inhabited by indigenous local pastoralists who have land rights to use natural resources, including wood for fuel and construction material. We hypothesized that removal of CWD affected negatively the populations of wood-nesting pollinators, the reproductive performance of Prosopis flexuosa (the dominant tree species), plant cover, richness and composition, and nutrient cycling in the soil. We conducted a manipulative experiment consisting of four pairs of 70m radius circular plots, each pair with an experimental (CWD removal) and a control (no removal) plots. Experimental CWD extraction affected negatively flower visitor abundance, although the magnitude of this effect decreased over time. In contrast, extraction had a significant, positive effect on seed production of P. flexuosa. No significant effects of extraction were found on cover, richness and composition of understory plants and soil properties. Thus, CWD did not have the generally negative effects expected under our hypotheses.";"Vázquez, Diego P.

We studied the response of plant diversity and spatial variability of species and trait composition to grazing vs. non-grazing (>20 years) using different grain sizes of sampling in three subalpine plant communities. Species composition, diversity, and the aggregated values of 4 leaf traits were assessed at 7 grain sizes (within quadrats ranging from 25cm2 to 1m2) in 9 grazed and ungrazed paired plots. Evenness and species richness showed a strongly community-dependent response as they increased following grazing exclusion in the less productive community and decreased in the two more productive ones. Although species richness was influenced by grazing exclusion at grains larger than 625cm2, evenness was affected at the finest grain investigated (25cm2). In contrast, spatial variability of species composition was similarly affected across the three plant communities and increased following grazing exclusion from the 100cm2-grain size. Grazing led to a sharper decline of spatial variability with increasing quadrat size revealing that the grain of spatial heterogeneity was finer in grazed plots relative to that in ungrazed ones. The response of spatial variability of aggregated trait values was less consistent, possibly because of functional redundancy between species. However, grazing exclusion increased the spatial variability of the aggregated values of leaf dry matter content and leaf carbon and nitrogen content. We suggest that spatial variability of species composition could be useful for detecting within-community changes in response to grazing management as it was detectable using a very fine scale of sampling and responded similarly to grazing treatment in every community. Such spatial variability in species composition can induce spatial organization of plant traits that may be important for community functioning.";"Deléglise, Claire

We suggest that in communities with high costs for collective action, a tenure bundle that includes management, withdrawal and exclusion rights yet omits alienation rights may be optimal for community forestry.

A preliminary benefit–cost analysis (BCA) screening method is used for maximum extent practicable (MEP) analysis, identifying promising management practices, and identifying societal and economic tradeoffs for local stormwater problems. Ballona Creek, a major urban storm drain in Los Angeles, California, USA, is used to illustrate the practicality of the benefit–cost evaluation. The Ballona Creek example demonstrates the economic limits of stormwater management in an urban region and attests to the value of coordinated basinwide management compared to uncoordinated management by individual landowners. Evaluation results suggest that in urban areas, the benefit of stormwater quality improvements might be far greater if accompanied by comprehensive redesign of drainage networks and neighboring land uses. In this case, benefit–cost analysis is found to be useful for evaluating and understanding stormwater management alternatives despite the uncertainties in characterizing stormwater quality and the effects of stormwater management on improving receiving water quality.";"Kalman, Orit

"AGRIS:US201500162602";"Using a sub-pixel mapping model to improve the accuracy of landscape pattern indices";"";"The assessment of landscape spatial patterns is a key issue in landscape management. Landscape pattern indices (LPIs) are tools appropriate for analyzing landscape spatial patterns. LPIs are often derived from raster land cover maps that are extracted from remotely sensed data through hard classification. However, pixel-based hard classification methods suffer from the mixed pixel problem (in which pixels contain more than one land cover class), making for inaccurate classification maps and LPIs. In addition, LPIs generated by hard classification methods are characterized by grain sizes (the sampling unit sizes) that limit the derived landscape pattern to a certain scale. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) models can enable fine-scale estimation of the spatial patterns of land cover classes without requiring additional data; hence, this is an appropriate downscaling method for land cover mapping. The fraction images generated by soft classification estimate the area proportion of each land cover class within each pixel, and using these images as input enables SPM models to alleviate the mixed pixel problem. At the same time, by transforming fraction images into a finer-scaled hard classification map, SPM models can minimize the influence of grain size on LPIs calculation. In this research, simulated landscape thematic patterns that can provide different landscape spatial patterns, eight commonly used LPIs and a SPM model that maximizes the spatial dependence between neighbouring sub-pixels were applied to assess the efficiency of deriving LPIs from sub-pixel model maps. Results showed that the SPM model can more precisely characterize landscape patterns than hard classification methods can. Landscape fragmentation, class abundance, the uncertainty in SPM, and the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data influenced LPIs derived from sub-pixel maps. The largest patch index, landscape division, and patch cohesion derived from remotely sensed data with different spatial resolutions through the SPM model were suitable for inter-comparison, whereas the patch density, mean patch area, edge density, landscape shape index, and area-weighted mean shape index derived from the sub-pixel maps were sensitive to the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data.";"Li, Xiaodong

"AGRIS:RU2016001458";"Assessing the state support of agriculture";"Оценка государственной поддержки сельского хозяйства";"Assessing the value of the state support for the agriculture is important for solving the problems of regional and federal agrarian policy. In the result of calculations carried out under the state support assessment procedure of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) based on comparing domestic and world (reference) process for products and resources inadequate conclusions on the support of agriculture in Russia and its agrarian policy are made. According to the results of applying said procedure it turns out that Russia is one of world leaders in the support to agriculture. For comparing the results for different countries the reference prices must apparently satisfy the so called fit hypothesis. Import and export commodities must be similar in quality composition. The dynamics of prices for similar commodities in dollars for different countries must correlate, as substantially those are world prices of export or import of the same kind of products. Prices for different countries may differ by the value of transport expenses (from the producer to the port of consumer’s country). Analyzing the reference prices for 5 products (wheat, milk, beef and veal, pork, poultry meat) for Russia, the USA and the EU from 2007 till 2012 has shown that these demands are not fulfilled. Therefore, the fit hypothesis for reference prices is not confirmed. Large differences in the value of such prices do not permit stating that the groups of products with the same name are similar in the quality composition for different countries. During calculating reference prices they are not corrected with reference to the quality. These prices in definite years for different countries of goods of the same name in dollars vary in different directions. Reference prices differ for various countries not only by the value of transport expenses wherein the differences are not stable and not proportional to prices. The approaches to estimating the value of state support to agriculture should be improved, including regionally.

Оценка величины государственной поддержки сельского хозяйства важна для решения вопросов региональной и федеральной аграрной политики. В результате расчетов, проводимых по методике оценки господдержки Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития (ОЭСР), основанной на сопоставлении внутренних и мировых (референтных) цен на продукцию и ресурсы, делаются неадекватные выводы о поддержке сельского хозяйства России и ее аграрной политике. По результатам применения указанной методики оказывается, что Россия – один из мировых лидеров в поддержке сельского хозяйства. Для сравнимости результатов по разным странам референтные цены должны, очевидно, удовлетворять т.н. гипотезе совместимости. Товары импорта и экспорта должны быть однородны по качественному составу. Динамика цен на одноименные товары в долларах для различных стран должна коррелировать, т. к. по сути это мировые цены экспорта или импорта одного и того же вида продукции. Цены для разных стран могут отличаться на величину транспортных расходов (от производителя до порта страны потребителя). Анализ референтных цен по 5 продуктам (пшеница, молоко, говядина и телятина, свинина, мясо птицы) для России, США и ЕС с 2007 по 2012 г. показал, что эти требования не выполняются. Следовательно, гипотеза сопоставимости для референтных цен не подтверждается. Большие различия в величине таких цен не позволяют утверждать, что группы товаров с одним и тем же наименованием однородны по качественному составу для разных стран. При расчете референтных цен не производится корректировка с учетом качества. Эти цены в определенные годы для разных стран на одноименные товары в долларах изменяются в противоположных направлениях. Референтные цены для разных стран отличаются не только на величину транспортных расходов, причем различия нестабильны и не пропорциональны ценам.

These methods assume self-preservation of the ratio between ET and a given reference variable over the daytime hours. The analysis was performed using eddy covariance data collected at 12 AmeriFlux towers, sampling a fairly wide range in climatic and land cover conditions. The choice of energy budget closure method significantly impacted performance using different scaling methodologies. Therefore, a statistical evaluation approach was adopted to better account for the inherent uncertainty in ET fluxes using eddy covariance technique. Overall, this approach suggested that at-surface solar radiation was the most robust reference variable amongst those tested, due to high accuracy of upscaled fluxes and absence of systematic biases. Top-of-atmosphere irradiance was also tested and proved to be reliable under near clear-sky conditions, but tended to overestimate the observed daytime ET during cloudy days. Use of reference ET as a scaling flux yielded higher bias than the solar radiation method, although resulting errors showed similar lack of seasonal dependence. Finally, the commonly used evaporative fraction method yielded satisfactory results only in summer months, July and August, and tended to underestimate the observations in the fall/winter seasons from November to January at the flux sites studied. In general, the proposed methodology clearly showed the added value of an intercomparison of different upscaling methods under scenarios that account for the uncertainty in eddy covariance flux measurements due to closure errors.";"Cammalleri, C.

However most of previous research was directed to the investigation of impact of already passed legislation on restructuring of collective and state farms and emergence of private farms. The present work considers the politics of decision-making in Ukraine, which hasnt been investigated a lot up to now. The main goal of the paper is to show the dependence of steps in land reform on the political changes taking place in the country.

For sage-grouse habitat management to be most effective, an understanding of the functional response of sage-grouse to changes in resource availability is critical. We investigated temporal variation in diet composition and nutrient content (crude protein, calcium, and phosphorus) of foods consumed by preincubating female sage-grouse relative to food supply and age of hen. We collected 86 preincubating female greater sage-grouse at foraging areas during early (18-31 March) and late (1-12 April) preincubation periods during 2002-2003. Females consumed 22 food types including low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula Nutt.), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), 15 forb species, 2 insect taxa, sagebrush galls, moss, and a trace amount of unidentified grasses. Low sagebrush was the most common food item, but forbs were found in 89% of the crops and composed 30.1% aggregate dry mass (ADM) of the diet. ADM and species composition of female diets were highly variable between collection periods and years, and coincided with temporal variation in forb availability. Adult females consumed more forbs and less low sagebrush compared to yearling females. Because of higher levels of crude protein, calcium, and phosphorus, forbs were important diet components in comparison with low sagebrush, which had the lowest nutrient content of all foods consumed. Our results indicate that increased forb abundance in areas used by female sage-grouse prior to nesting would increase their forb consumption and nutritional status for reproduction. We recommend that managers should emphasize delineation of habitats used by preincubating sage-grouse and evaluate the need for enhancing forb abundance and diversity.";"Gregg, Michael A.

Moreover, this major criterion of water quality remained consistently far below the limit recommended by the World Health Organization.

This study performs land-cover classification in a heterogeneous Massachusetts landscape by comparing three ensemble learning techniques (bagging, boosting, and random forests) and a non-ensemble learning algorithm (classification trees) using multiple criteria related to algorithm and training data characteristics. The ensemble learning algorithms had comparably high accuracy (Kappa range: 0.76-0.78), which was 11% higher than that of classification trees. Ensemble learning techniques were not influenced by calibration data variability, were robust to one-fifth calibration data noise, and insensitive to a 50% reduction in calibration data size.";"Ghimire, Bardan

Percent cover of L. maackii in 20 woodlots in southwestern Ohio was regressed on values for spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) derived for each image. The land cover of L. maackii was best explained by the Simple Ratio (SR) using TM data (R ² = 0.537). The regression results for SVIs from TM vs. ALI suggest that the ALI image was acquired too late in the fall to accurately detect this invasive shrub.";"Johnston, Sarah E.

Limited and unpredictable rainfall and low soil fertility have reduced agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. For this reason, crop management technologies have been developed, with a special focus on the Mediterranean region, to enhance crop production by increasing land productivity and sustaining soil fertility under influence of climate changes and population increases. The main objective of this study was to analyse dryland Mediterranean cropping systems, and to discuss and recommend sustainable cropping technologies that could be used at the small‐scale farm level. Four crop management practices were evaluated: crop rotations, reduced tillage, use of organic manure, and supplemental and deficit irrigation. Among the tested interventions, incorporation of crop residues coupled with supplementary irrigation showed a significantly positive effect on crop productivity, yield stability and environmental sustainability.";"Benlhabib, O.

To have better representation of biogenic emissions, we have updated in the model the land cover and leaf area index in China using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite measurements, and we have developed a new classification of vegetation with 21 plant functional types. Estimated annual BVOC emission in China averaged over 2001–2006 is 18.85 Tg C yr⁻¹, in which emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, and other reactive volatile organic compounds account for 50.9%, 15.0%, and 34.1%, respectively. The simulated BVOC emissions in China have large interannual variations. The values of regionally averaged absolute percent departure from the mean (APDM) of isoprene emissions are in the range of 21–42% in January and 15–28% in July. The APDM values of monoterpene emissions are 14–32% in January and 10–21% in July, which are generally smaller than those of isoprene emissions. Model results indicate that the interannual variations in isoprene emissions are more dependent on variations in meteorological fields, whereas the interannual variations in monoterpene emissions are more sensitive to changes in vegetation parameters. With fixed anthropogenic emissions, as a result of the variations in both meteorological parameters and vegetation, simulated O₃ concentrations show interannual variations of 0.8–5 ppbv (or largest APDM values of 4–15%), and simulated SOA shows APDM values of 5–15% in southwestern China in January as well as 10–25% in southeastern and 20–35% in northeastern China in July. On a regional mean basis, the interannual variations in BVOCs alone can lead to 2–5% differences in simulated O₃ and SOA in summer.";"Fu, Yu

Water harvesting focuses on improving the productive use of rainwater on the local scale (field to subcatchment scale) before the runoff water leaves the geographical unit in question. The aim is to mitigate the effects of temporal water shortages to cover both domestic and agricultural needs. This paper provides a review on water harvesting techniques focusing on microcatchment methods, and information on performance of a small‐basin water harvesting system (negarim) under a typical arid environment in Turkey as a case study. In the negarim case study, we analysed rainfall, runoff, catchment area, soil water storage and crop evapotranspiration. The microcatchment area (36� m²) included five surface treatment methods (natural, plastic cover, stone cover, hay cover and compaction), which were studied in a pistachio plantation by monitoring soil water balance in the root zone. The overall efficiency of the water harvesting system was determined as the ratio of the amount of water stored and used by the crop to the amount of rainfall received in the catchment area. It was demonstrated that the overall efficiency of the system varied from 2.9� % to 79� % depending on the surface treatments and the root zone capacity. Plastic cover had the greatest efficiency. Gains in runoff improvement were lost when the soil moisture in the cultivated area was near field capacity. Surface treatments had a significant effect on plant height and stem diameter. Plant height with different treatments was 158� cm with plastic cover, 128� cm with surface compaction, 121� cm with hay cover, 117� cm with stone cover and 102� cm of control. Among the surface treatments, plastic cover was superior to the other treatments on plant growth, but the use of plastic may cause environmental problems.";"Yazar, A.

As an important component of the terrestrial ecosystem, changes in vegetation coverage reflect changes in the environment, especially with respect to arid areas. A change of vegetation coverage will trigger desertification, degradation of the eco-environment, and regional climate change. Hence, we studied the spatio-temporal distribution pattern of vegetation coverage and ephemerals in the Junggar Basin during the last few decades based on normalized difference vegetation index. The following conclusions were drawn. The vegetation coverage of the basin shows an overall upward trend, mainly because of the expansion of farmland. In particular, the southern rim has already formed an apparent continuous oasis belt, and the central part of the basin has low vegetation coverage due to a rugged environment but is relatively stable, whereas the northern part has a relatively small oasis distribution pattern. With respect to annual variation, the vegetation coverage of the basin reached the peak in July of every year, whereas the peak in the desert was in May or June; ephemeral plants clearly flourished during this phase. Ephemeral plants were distributed in the whole basin; the most prosperous region was the southern of the basin edge, and the plants decreased gradually from the edge to the center of the basin. The desert area of the central basin was the least prosperous area, but the southern and mid-eastern parts of the desert were prosperous. The expansion of the oasis has mainly had an impact on the 50-km range of the oasis edge, and the greatest impact is at the 5- to 20-km range of the oasis edge.";"Duan, Cheng

"AGRIS:US201400088467";"Identifying realistic recovery targets and conservation actions for tigers in a human‐dominated landscape using spatially explicit densities of wild prey and their determinants";"";"AIM: Setting realistic population targets and identifying actions for site and landscape‐level recovery plans are critical for achieving the global target of doubling wild tiger numbers by 2022. Here, we estimate the spatially explicit densities of wild ungulate prey across a gradient of disturbances in two disjunct tiger habitat blocks (THBs) covering 5212� km², to evaluate landscape‐wide conditions for tigers and identify opportunities and specific actions for recovery. LOCATION: Western Terai Arc Landscape, India. METHODS: Data generated from 96 line transects in� 15 systematically selected geographical cells (166.5� km²) were used to estimate spatially explicit densities of six wild ungulate prey species at a fine scale (1� km²). Employing distance‐based density surface models, we derived species‐specific estimates within three major forest land management categories (inviolate protected areas (PA), PAs with settlements and multiple‐use forests). By scaling estimated prey densities using an established relationship, we predicted the carrying capacity for tigers within each THB. RESULTS: Species‐specific responses of the six wild ungulates to natural‐habitat and anthropogenic covariates indicated the need for targeted prey recovery strategies. Inviolate PAs supported the highest prey densities compared with PAs with settlements and multiple‐use forests, and specifically benefited the principal tiger prey species (chital Axis axis and sambar Rusa unicolor). The estimated mean prey density of 35.16 (±5.67) individuals per km² can potentially support 82 (62–106) and 299 (225–377) tigers across THB I and THB II, which currently support 2 (2–7) and 225 (199–256) tigers, respectively. This suggests a potential c.� 68% increase in population size given existing prey abundances. Finally, while THB I represents a potential tiger recovery site given adequate prey, PAs where resettlement of pastoralists is underway represent potential prey recovery sites in THB II. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This systematic approach of setting realistic population targets and prioritizing spatially explicit recovery strategies should aid in developing effective landscape conservation plans towards achieving global tiger conservation targets.";"Harihar, Abishek

On the island of Sulawesi in the vicinity of the Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), many smallholders contribute to conversion processes at the forest margin as a result of their agricultural practices. Specifically the area dedicated to cocoa plantations has increased from zero (1979) to nearly 18,000 hectares (2001). Some of these plots have been established inside the 220,000 hectares of the LLNP. An intensification process is observed with a consequent reduction of the shade tree density.This study assesses which impact carbon sequestration payments for forest management systems have on the prevailing land use systems. Additionally, the level of incentives is determined which motivates farmers to desist from further deforestation and land use intensification activities. Household behaviour and resource allocation is analysed with a comparative static linear programming model. As these models prove to be a reliable tool for policy analysis, the output can indicate the adjustments in resource allocation and land use shifts when introducing compensation payments.The data was collected in a household survey in six villages around the LLNP. Four household categories are identified according to their dominant agroforestry systems. These range from low intensity management with a high degree of shading to highly intensified shade free systems.At the plot level, the payments from carbon sequestration are the highest for the full shade cocoa agroforestry system, but with low carbon prices of € 5 tCO2e-1 these constitute 5 percent of the cocoa gross margin. Focusing on the household level, however, an increase of up to 18 percent of the total gross margin can be realised. Furthermore, for differentiated carbon prices up to € 32 tCO2e-1 the majority of the households have an incentive to adopt the more sustainable shade intensive agroforestry system. A win-win situation seems to appear, whereby, when targeting only the shade intensive agroforestry systems with carbon payments, the poorest households economically benefit the most and land use systems with high environmental benefits are promoted.";"Saint-Macary, Camille

"AGRIS:US201500211428";"Image simulation from multitemporal landsat images";"";"Multitemporal datasets can provide information on the different acquisition patterns of pixel values. The resultant generation of simulated images based on these patterns becomes practical and easy. In this paper, we propose a simple model for creating a simulated image based on a set of multitemporal satellite images and meteorological data utilizing a temporal correlation of multitemporal images. The satellite images and meteorological data used for the model can be easily accessed through open data sources. A dataset of 55 Landsat images was used to determine the relationship between the spectral radiance of the pixels and solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, rainfall, and visibility based on a multilinear regression analysis. This multilinear regression equation was then used to generate the simulated images obtained on the target dates. The results indicate that more than 91% of the pixels of the simulated images have correlation coefficients greater than 0.98 in all experimental cases. The correlation coefficients increased significantly when the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a reference image were applied to the man-made areas. The quality of the simulated images generated by this model primarily depends on changes in land cover. However, this effect can be reduced using NDVI interpolated from images obtained during the same season, or by employing a reference image acquired close to the date on which the simulated image is generated.";"La, Hien Phu

Across the northern Mediterranean countries, governments have adopted policies and implemented incentive and regulatory instruments to manage this phenomenon. For transition countries, the application of these instruments is less effective due to the weakness of the institutional framework.The Albanian coastal area is suffering for the last ten years from an anarchic urbanisation of its former agricultural land. This issue is analysed though the study of the land market trends in the 1992-2005 period. Data on market transactions and the characteristics of sold land offer information on the land uses and insights on the future development of the area.Our study is based on a field research in the region Durrës-Kavaja (central area of the country), which constitutes an area heavily concerned by this phenomenon. We identified the main characteristics of the land market and their effects on urbanisation and land development.The conflict between agriculture and urbanisation appears to be won by the latter, leading to the establishment of new urban dwelling areas. The existing policies and instruments can neither prevent urbanisation nor influence its type.The study concludes on the necessity to define a stronger development policy, based upon incentive and regulatory instruments

Les politiques de gestion du foncier dans les zones littorales doivent gérer une pression d'urbanisation toujours croissante. Dans les pays du Nord de la Méditerranée, ces politiques parviennent tant bien que mal à gérer cette pression à travers une série d'instruments tels que les zonages régissant les droits de construction, les achats de surface d'intérêt spécifique et, parfois, une fiscalité adaptée.

We then tested whether accounting for spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve bioclimatic models after statistically controlling for the effects of land cover. Nova Scotia, eastern Canada. Species distribution data were taken from a recent (1999-2003) herpetofaunal atlas. Generalized linear models were used to relate the presence or absence of each species to climate and land-cover variables at a 10-km resolution. We then accounted for spatial autocorrelation using an autocovariate or third-order trend surface of the geographical coordinates of each grid square. Finally, variance partitioning was used to explore the independent and joint contributions of climate, land cover and spatial autocorrelation. The inclusion of land cover significantly increased the explanatory power of bioclimatic models for 10 of the 11 species. Furthermore, including land cover significantly increased predictive performance for eight of the 11 species. Accounting for spatial autocorrelation improved model fit for rare species but generally did not improve prediction success. Variance partitioning demonstrated that this lack of improvement was a result of the high correlation between climate and trend-surface variables. The results of this study suggest that accounting for the effects of land cover can significantly improve the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic models for anurans and turtles at a regional scale. We argue that the integration of climate and land-cover data is likely to produce more accurate spatial predictions of contemporary herpetofaunal diversity. However, the use of land-cover simulations in climate-induced range-shift projections introduces additional uncertainty into the predictions of bioclimatic models. Further research is therefore needed to determine whether accounting for the effects of land cover in range-shift projections is merited.";"Tingley, R.

Using data at the levels of the farm household, parcel and plot, we develop an econometric modeling framework to analyze land management decisions and their impact on crop productivity. Our econometric model allows for endogenous household decisions regarding livelihood strategy choice, use of labor and external inputs, and participation in organizations. We found support for the inverse farm size-land productivity relationship which suggests that improved land access could increase total crop production. Land tenure has no impact on crop productivity, but adoption of soil conservation practices is higher on owner-operated than leased plots. Ownership of machinery and equipment and livestock ownership both positively influence crop productivity. Education positively affects perennial crop productivity. The gender of the household head has no significant effect on crop productivity, but does influence some land management and input use decisions. Even though household participation in training programs and organizations has only limited effects on crop productivity, agricultural extension plays a key role in promoting adoption of soil conservation practices. Location assets have limited impacts on crop productivity but do influence land management decisions. Road density and better market access have a positive effect on perennial crop productivity. Population density has limited direct impact on crop productivity, though it may have indirect effects by affecting farm size and livelihood strategies.";"Jansen, Hans G.P.

While many studies have examined its aggregate impacts, few have investigated how it affects the poor. This paper helps fill this gap by applying a new procedure to explore the ex post impacts of improved maize varieties on poverty in rural Ethiopia. Plot‐level yield and cost changes due to adoption are first estimated using instrumental variable and marginal treatment effect techniques where possible heterogeneity is carefully accounted for. A backward derivation procedure is then developed to link treatment effect estimates with an economic surplus model to identify the counterfactual household income that would have existed without improved maize varieties. Poverty impacts are finally estimated by exploiting the differences between observed and counterfactual income distributions. Improved maize varieties have led to a 0.8–1.3 percentage drop of poverty headcount ratio and relative reductions of poverty depth and severity. However, poor producers benefit the least from adoption due to the smallness of their land holdings.";"Zeng, Di

We present the structure of an iterative conservation auction that ranks bids according to a scoring rule intended to procure spatially adjacent conservation land use projects. Laboratory experiments are conducted to compare the performance of this auction under two information conditions. Under one condition subjects have knowledge about the spatial goal implemented by the scoring rule and in the other case they don’t. The results indicate that rent-seeking is intensified with more information and increased bidder familiarity with the auction.

The statistical relationship between observed data and simulation data of net radiation has a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and model efficiency of 0.93. Therefore, it can be used to simulate the radiation balance of Beijing. This study analyzes the variation in the radiation balance for different underlying surfaces. To simulate radiation balance differences, we set four pure land-cover types (forest, grass, roads, and buildings). Keeping all other conditions inputted unchanged, we model the radiation balance by changing the land-cover type. The results show that the effects of different underlying surfaces on radiation differ, and that there is much upward long-wave radiation, accounting for 84.3% of the total radiation energy falling incident on the land surface. The annual averages of net radiation for the four land-cover types are in the range of 38.2–53.4 W/m2. The net radiation of the grass surface is minimal while that of the roads surface is maximal. Additionally, with urbanization the net radiation values of common types of land-cover change, such as conversion from forest to roads, grass to roads, and grass to buildings, all have increasing trends, indicating that net radiation usually increases with urban sprawl.";"Cui, YaoPing

This study used a multiple visit cost-route method to estimate labour inputs and financial profitability of agroforestry-based and conventional (with and without fertiliser) soil fertility management practices in eastern Zambia. Results show that aggregated over a five-year cycle, labour inputs used under agroforestry practices were lower than fertilised maize fields but higher than non-fertilised continuous cropped maize. Agroforestry practices were more profitable (NPV ranging between $233 and $327 ha-1) than unfertilised maize fields (NPV of $130 ha-1) but less profitable than fertilised maize fields. The NPV for the latter is $499 ha-1 under a 50% government subsidy on fertiliser but, it fell to $349 ha-1 when the subsidy effect is removed. In terms of return per unit investment cost, agroforestry practices performed better with a benefit to cost ratio ranging between 2.77 to 3.13 in contrast to 2.65 (subsidised fertiliser) and 1.77 (non-subsidised fertiliser). The returns to labour per person day was $2.56 in (non-subsidised) fertilised maize field, $3.16 in subsidised fertiliser field, $2.63 in Gliricidia fields, $2.41 in Sesbania fields, $1.90 in Tephrosia fields, and $1.10 in non-fertilised maize fields. The results do not support the popular notion that agroforestry practices are more labour intensive. It suggests that in addition to total labour use requirements, the temporal distribution of labour use during the farming season is important. It is concluded that agroforestry practices are profitable, and could contribute to food security.";"Ajayi, Olu Clifford

"AGRIS:US201400149337";"Multi-scale land cover dynamics of semiarid scrubland in Baja California, Mexico";"";"Land use and cover changes trigger multi-factorial responses with tangible and intangible effects. Driving forces governing changes are scale-, place- and time-dependent; because of their complexity, a multi-scalar analysis is required to determine conjoint causation. Studies using multi-scalar approach in semiarid scrubland ecosystems are scanty. This paper investigates land use changes on the largest semiarid scrubland ecosystem of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, using a multi-scalar analysis approach. It further provides insight into the likely underlying causes for land use trends. Multi-temporal databases were compiled for 1978, 1990, 2000 and 2003 from various sources; population was projected for the same years. Land cover processes were validated through intensive fieldwork. Map overlapping with the aid of geographic information systems allowed computation of land cover transformation rates. New algorithms were developed to better understand land cover trends. Multi-variate analysis was also performed to provide a synthetic statistical overview. Results showed that land cover change occurred at different times, at variable scales, due to distinct drivers. As a consequence, the current regional scenario has been shaped by distinguishable socio-economic changes. The semiarid scrubland ecosystems in the Baja California Peninsula experienced contrasting trends detectable only at site and local scales. Regionally, the replacement of original vegetation (scrubland) for other land cover category is following trends similar to those in the rest of Mexico and most semiarid ecosystems worldwide. These findings support the hypothesis that land use and cover changes must be analyzed at different times and scales to deeply understand underlying forces.";"Rosete Vergés, Fernando Antonio

"AGRIS:US201600063950";"ES4LUCC: A GIS-tool for remotely monitoring landscape dynamics";"";"Given the potential impacts of land cover changes on surface processes, accurate mapping of landscape dynamics is a crucial task in environmental monitoring. The use of commercial software for remote sensing of landscape changes requires appropriate expertise in sensor technology and computing resources that are not always available to decision makers. This paper presents the development of an experimental prototype of a lightweight and user-friendly GIS tool – ES4LUCC – a semiautomatic software for change detection and classification of land use/cover. The tool is based on image processing techniques applied on multi-temporal remotely sensed spectral and surface model data. The GIS-based tiling approach allows to non-specialists of remote sensing to manage high-dimensional data even from low performance computing platforms. The paper synthesizes the implemented digital image processing that form the basis of ES4LUCC, including data correction, classification and change detection, map refinements. It also describes the software architecture, the main IDL modules and the integration with GIS through a tight coupling approach and.dll calling functions. The main modelling process is controlled through a powerful GUI developed as part of the ArcMap component of ESRI ArcGIS. The software is tested by using bi-temporal color-infrared ADS40 and Light detection and ranging data acquired on a 80-km transect of the Marecchia river (Italy). The outputs of ES4LUCC give an understanding of the natural- and human-induced surface processes, such as urban planning, agricultural and forest practices, fluvial dynamics and slope instability. The model provides reliable maps (90.77% overall classification accuracy) that represent useful layers for environmental landscape management.";"Forzieri, Giovanni

The land cover classification was performed using Object Based Image Analysis in Trimble eCognition Developer 8 software. The retrospective land cover changes analysis in 3 lake catchments (KleszczÃ³w, Moszne, BiaÂ³eWÂ³odawskie Lakes)was performed on the basis of archival aerial photos taken in 1952, 1971, 1984, 1992, 2007 and one satellite scene from 2003 (IKONOS).On the basis of land cover map structure, Shannon diversity index was estimated with the moving window approach enabled in Fragstats software. The conducted research has shown that the land cover structure of the West Polesie Biosphere Reserve is diverse and can be simply described by selected landscape metrics. The highest level of land cover diversity, as showed by Shannon Diversity Index, was identified in the western part of the West Polesie Biosphere Reserve, which is closely related to the agricultural character of land cover structure in those regions. The examples of three regional retrospective land cover analyses demonstrated that the character of land cover structure has changed dramatically over the last 40 years.";"Chmielewski, Szymon

A factorial experiment was designed to assess the effects of land use, litter type, soil organisms and season on litter decay in the prevailing natural and agricultural systems (i.e. Cerrado remnants, grasslands and soybean croplands) in Mato Grosso. Decay rates were estimated by using the litterbag method. Two different mesh sizes were used to evaluate the effects of soil macro- and mesofauna (coarse mesh; 5mm) and of soil microorganisms (fine; 20Î¼m). The original litter found in each land use area (Cerrado leaf-litter, Brachiaria-grass or soybean residues) was used to estimate the decay of in situ litter; a standard substrate (maize litter) was employed to evaluate the effect of the environment. Finally, the experiment was carried out during a dry and a rainy season to differentiate the effect of the other factors from the seasonal effect. We found that: (1) the effects of land use and management practice were only significant in the dry season; (2) decomposability of litter was not predicted by the initial C:N ratio of the litter types; (3) soil fauna contributed to the litter breakdown with 13â57%; (4) decay rates were overall higher in the rainy season; (5) all evaluated factors (in following order: season>soil organisms>litter type>land use) and their interactions explained about 70% of the variance in the decay rates in the study area. Change in land use affected litter decay mainly through a shift in the litter quality; the introduced plant species produced highly decomposable litters.";"PeÃ±a-PeÃ±a, Karina

Such models have their limitations: they cannot specify the interaction between agriculture and the rest of the economy, and their spatial dimension is usually limited. Land use simulation models, on the other hand, usually depend on other models for assessing the demand for land. The consistency of those models with the assumptions and databases of the land use model is often not examined. This article reports on a research project where the links between a macroeconomic model, an agricultural sector model and a land use model were explicitly explored in order to arrive at a consistent model chain. This integrated framework was put to the test by applying it to two contrasting scenarios, which compare impact on agricultural incomes, land use and land management.";"Kuhlman, Tom

The static approachdoes not consider the dynamic environment in which the adoption decision is made and thusdoes not incorporate the speed of adoption and the effect of time-dependent elements inexplaining adoption. The adoption speed of an innovation is important in various aspects.Based on data from a survey of a random sample of 331 smallholder households in westernKenya, this study investigated determinants of time to adoption of mineral fertilizer, animalmanure and compost using Duration analysis. Results revealed that factors that influencedtiming of the adoption varied by the practices. Whilst education level of the household head,cattle ownership, location of the farm, access to extension services, and participation in landmanagement programmes accelerated the adoption of different practices, age of householdhead, relative farming experience and market liberalization retarded the adoption. Gender ofhousehold head gave mixed results. To speed up adoption of the practices requires policiesthat promote farmers’ participation in land management programs, access to extensionservices and markets in addition to stratified targeting of different practices to specificlocations and farmers.";"Odendo, Martins

"AGRIS:US2016218262";"The impact of large-lot zoning and open space acquisition on home building in rural communities";"";"Local governments in the United States use a wide range of tools to preserve rural landscapes. Some of these tools, like the purchase or transfer of development rights, are generally welcomed by farmers and other large landowners. Other tools, like increasing the minimum lot size in a town’s agricultural zone, are more controversial because they are believed to have negative effects on landowner wealth.  In this contentious policy environment, it would be useful to know which land use tools actually work to control residential growth, thus achieving the consensual objective of rural preservation.It is reasonable to suppose that large-lot zoning and open space preservation will both reduce the number of homes in a community when it is fully developed.  The short and medium-term effects of these policies, however, are less certain.  Indeed, there is some evidence that permanently-preserved open space increases short-run home building through an “amenity magnet” effect.  Similarly, an increase in minimum lot size could trigger the immediate development of agricultural land by reducing the option value of waiting.This study uses data on 83 communities in the Highlands region of New Jersey to help answer these questions about the unintended consequences of these two rural conservation tools.  The dataset includes GIS-based information on developable land, open space inventory, and minimum lot size zoning for the period 1995 to 2002.  The study concludes that the relationship between minimum lot size and homebuilding in a community can be described as a concave quadratic.  The pace of homebuilding rises to a maximum at a weighted average minimum lot size of 4.15, and then starts to fall.   The percentage of a community that is permanently-preserved open space was found to have no significant effect on homebuilding, other things equal.";"Gottlieb, Paul D.

The conservation farming program was a key area of investment by NSW Agriculture and an evaluation process fulfils accountability and resource allocation requirements.This analysis evaluates the investments by the former NSW Agriculture in conservation farming and reduced tillage programs from the late 1970s to 2002.The benefit-cost ratios (BCR) for no till only and no till plus reduced tillage practices up to 2002 were 4.1:1 and 9:1, respectively. The net present values (NPV) of the benefits from these efforts up to 2002 were $78 and $205 million, respectively. When program activities are extended to 2020 the BCRs were 11.4:1 and 20.5:1 and the NPVs were $302 million and $568 million, respectively.There are likely to be other benefits such as environmental benefits of reduced soil erosion (and reduced infrastructure remediation costs) and improved soil structure. Without the RD&E programs of NSW Agriculture and other agencies the slower growth in productivity is likely to have retarded farm and industry profitability, with associated effects on industry and community strength.";"Scott, J.

Both systems of law reflect distinctively different economic structures. That oversight laid the foundations for the conflicts between the customary law and practice and the Anglo-American common law, its notions and conceptions of tenure. The conflict that developed has become one of the most formidable obstacles to socioeconomic development in Ghana since colonial times.One of the objectives of this work is to shed light on the linkages between the exploitative capitalist sector and the traditional communal system. In the process, we hope to show that service by the traditional system of the capitalist sector of the economy lies at the root of economic underdevelopment in Ghana. If we achieve our objectives, then we should be able to demonstrate that legislative measures aimed at establishing a machinery for land registration can neither solve the problems of underdevelopment nor effectively eliminate the manifestations of conflict in the shape of litigation and economic underdevelopment. Instead, it would in its effect consolidate the usurpation and privatization of communal lands to be concentrated in the hands of a minority of the rich, speed up the pace of landlessness and social stratification, and lead to political instability. We seek to demonstrate that the present privatization policies, planned within the framework of the International Monetary Fund's and the World Bank's globalization schemes, would aggravate these problems and sharpen the contradictions.";"Agbosu, Lennox Kwame";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2000-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"GHA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204758";"http://purl.umn.edu/12796";"";"";"";""

On average, mills source fifty percent of their fibre from the market. However, using a fractional logit model, we test whether theories from transaction cost economics influence this decision. Results are consistent with transaction cost economics; firms decrease the proportion of fibre sourced from a market with increasing fibre specificity, capital intensity, forest ownership concentration and uncertainty.";"Niquidet, Kurt

"AGRIS:US201500077690";"Sustainability of Mediterranean irrigated agro-landscapes";"";"In this work we show the feasibility of empirical testing of socio-environmental models with a relatively simple model of a traditional agro-ecosystem: the Huerta Murcia (Spain). This Mediterranean traditional irrigated land is based on adaptive strategies of irrigation and crop management and has important functions for the conservation of natural and cultural resources. During the last decades, this agro-landscape has been threatened by several factors linked to low profitability of agricultural production under present conditions, the emergence of new irrigated lands outside the river valleys and the land conversion to non-agricultural uses. A dynamic system model has been built to analyse all these processes. Results obtained for the 1932–1995 calibration period show that the model successfully tracks the observed data series for the available variables (area of traditional irrigated lands, number of landowners, population, average farm size and water pollution) and that the Huerta had lost more than 2000ha, explained by competition for land use and the decreasing profitability of farming due to the reduced farm size, the appearance of water deficit and the increasing water pollution. After model testing, including dimensional consistence tests, sensitive analysis and extreme condition tests, a set of policy scenarios (1995–2025) were explored. Land planning policies seem to be more effective than agricultural policies. Then, the observed actual behaviour (1995–2008) of Huerta Murcia was compared to results expected under the analysed scenarios results show an actual rate of loss of Huerta (1995–2008) higher than expected under the base trend (business as usual) scenario. This accelerated loss can be explained by the successive changes in the Municipal Urban Plan, leading to a notable increase in buildable area and to increasing expectations about population growth. When the actual scenario (1995–2008) is implemented by updating exogenous variables or forcing inputs and introducing the potential (virtual) population increase, as derived from the plans, the model is able to predict the whole set of 1995–2008 observed data series with no further calibration against data. This might be considered as a sort of model validation with an independent dataset, which constitutes a remarkable contribution in the area of socio-ecological modelling.";"Martínez-Fernández, Julia

"AGRIS:US201500077699";"Simulating the value of collaboration in multi-actor conservation planning";"";"The loss of habitat and biodiversity worldwide has led to considerable resources being spent on conservation interventions. Prioritising these actions is challenging due to the complexity of the problem and because there can be multiple actors undertaking conservation actions, often with divergent or partially overlapping objectives. We explore this issue with a simulation study involving two agents sequentially purchasing land for the conservation of multiple species using three scenarios comprising either divergent or partially overlapping objectives between the agents. The first scenario investigates the situation where both agents are targeting different sets of threatened species. The second and third scenarios represent a case where a government agency attempts to implement a complementary conservation network representing 200 species, while a non-government organisation is focused on achieving additional protection for the ten rarest species. Simulated input data was generated using distributions taken from real data to model the cost of parcels, and the rarity and co-occurrence of species. We investigated three types of collaborative interactions between agents: acting in isolation, sharing information and pooling resources with the third option resulting in the agents combining their resources and effectively acting as a single entity. In each scenario we determine the cost savings when an agent moves from acting in isolation to either sharing information or pooling resources with the other agent. The model demonstrates how the value of collaboration can vary significantly in different situations. In most cases, collaborating would have associated costs and these costs need to be weighed against the potential benefits from collaboration. Our model demonstrates a method for determining the range of costs that would result in collaboration providing an efficient use of scarce conservation resources.";"Gordon, Ascelin

"AGRIS:US201600017933";"Conservation of Forest Birds: Evidence of a Shifting Baseline in Community Structure";"";"Quantifying changes in forest bird diversity is an essential task for developing effective conservation actions. When subtle changes in diversity accumulate over time, annual comparisons may offer an incomplete perspective of changes in diversity. In this case, progressive change, the comparison of changes in diversity from a baseline condition, may offer greater insight because changes in diversity are assessed over longer periods of times. Our objectives were to determine how forest bird diversity has changed over time and whether those changes were associated with forest disturbance. We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data, a time series of Landsat images classified with respect to land cover change, and mixed-effects models to associate changes in forest bird community structure with forest disturbance, latitude, and longitude in the conterminous United States for the years 1985 to 2006. We document a significant divergence from the baseline structure for all birds of similar migratory habit and nest location, and all forest birds as a group from 1985 to 2006. Unexpectedly, decreases in progressive similarity resulted from small changes in richness (<1 species per route for the 22-year study period) and modest losses in abundance (−28.7–−10.2 individuals per route) that varied by migratory habit and nest location. Forest disturbance increased progressive similarity for Neotropical migrants, permanent residents, ground nesting, and cavity nesting species. We also documented highest progressive similarity in the eastern United States. Contemporary forest bird community structure is changing rapidly over a relatively short period of time (e.g., ∼22 years). Forest disturbance and forest regeneration are primary factors associated with contemporary forest bird community structure, longitude and latitude are secondary factors, and forest loss is a tertiary factor. Importantly, these findings suggest some regions of the United States may already fall below the habitat amount threshold where fragmentation effects become important predictors of forest bird community structure.";"Rittenhouse, Chadwick D.

"AGRIS:US201600091586";"Hydrological Processes and Model Representation: Impact of Soft Data on Calibration";"";"Hydrologic and water quality models are increasingly used to determine the environmental impacts of climate variability and land management. Due to differing model objectives and differences in monitored data, there are currently no universally accepted procedures for calibration and validation in the literature. In an effort to develop accepted model calibration and validation procedures or guidelines, a special collection of 22 research articles that present and discuss calibration strategies for 25 hydrologic and water quality models was previously assembled. The models vary in scale temporally as well as spatially from point source to the watershed level. One suggestion for future work was to synthesize relevant information from this special collection and to identify significant calibration and validation topics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the importance of proper model processes representation and its impact on calibration and scenario analysis using the information from these 22 research articles and other relevant literature. In general, if the processes are not accurately represented (i.e. if surface water runoff and/or evapotranspiration is over or underestimated), the nutrient and/or sediment balance will be misjudged. These errors may be amplified at the watershed scale where additional sources and transport processes are simulated. The calibration and validation procedure should consider the accuracy/adequacy of the representation of environmental processes at the appropriate scale of the model given the modelling objectives. To account for processes in calibration, a diagnostic approach is recommended using both hard and soft data. The diagnostic approach looks at signature patterns of behavior of model outputs to determine which processes, and thus parameters, need further adjustment during calibration. This overcomes the weaknesses of traditional regression based calibration by discriminating between multiple processes within a budget. Hard data is defined as long term, measured time series, typically at a point within a watershed. Soft data is defined as information on individual processes within a balance that may not be directly measured within the study area, and may be just an average annual estimate, and may entail considerable uncertainty. The advantage of developing soft data for the calibration is that it requires a basic understanding of processes (water, sediment, nutrient, and carbon budgets) within the spatial area being modeled and constrains the calibration.";"Arnold, J.

The International Lab-our Organization estimated that in 1990, 21 percent of the Sub-Saharan Africa's 227 million labour force was working in the informal economy. As the informal sector continued to grow both in urban and rural areas, there was a decline or stagnation in the growth of formal employment. The informal sector's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) is increasing, although not much is known in most countries because the sector hardly enters the official statistical records. This study analyzes Uganda's informal sector size, contribution, formal-informal sector linkages, causes, constraints and policies aimed at formalizing or enhancing its contributions. The methodology used involved a review of relevant policy documents, including UBOS's survey reports on the informal sector. Of particular relevance are the 2002/03 household Uganda Business Inquiry and the 2001/02 Uganda business Register. the household surveys documenting the informal sector in Uganda define the informal sector as an enterprise employing less than 5 persons...";"Muwonge, Abdu

This study aimed to analyse the environmental suitability of a highly fragmented region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's 25 recognized biodiversity hotspots, for forest bird species. Eight forest bird species were selected for the analyses, based on point counts (n = 122) conducted in AprilâSeptember 2006 and JanuaryâMarch 2009. Six additional variables (landscape diversity, distance from forest and streams, aspect, elevation and slope) were modelled in Maxent for (1) actual and (2) simulated land cover, based on the forest expansion required by existing Brazilian forest legislation. Models were evaluated by bootstrap or jackknife methods and their performance was assessed by AUC, omission error, binomial probability or p value. All predictive models were statistically significant, with high AUC values and low omission errors. A small proportion of the actual landscape (24.41 Â± 6.31%) was suitable for forest bird species. The simulated landscapes lead to an increase of c.30% in total suitable areas. In average, models predicted a small increase (23.69 Â± 6.95%) in the area of suitable native forest for bird species. Being close to forest increased the environmental suitability of landscapes for all bird species; landscape diversity was also a significant factor for some species. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that species distribution modelling (SDM) successfully predicted bird distribution across a heterogeneous landscape at fine spatial resolution, as all models were biologically relevant and statistically significant. The use of landscape variables as predictors contributed significantly to the results, particularly for species distributions over small extents and at fine scales. This is the first study to evaluate the environmental suitability of the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest for bird species in an agricultural landscape, and provides important additional data for regional environmental planning.";"FERRAZ, KATIA MARIA PASCHOALETTO MICCHI DE BARROS

"AGRIS:US201400103519";"Effect of catchment properties on runoff coefficient in a karst area of southwest China";"";"Frequent human activities and climate change in the karst region of southwest China since the 1950s have led to the investigation of response of runoff to climate and catchment properties. Runoff coefficient (Rc) as an expression variable of the catchment response to rainfall is important to describe runoff dynamics and to estimate available streamflow for utilization. In this study, the equations of Rc associated with its attributors of climate condition and catchment property were derived using the Budyko framework. The equations were used to estimate relationship between the Rc and the attributors in the karst catchments in Guizhou province of southwest China. Analysis in the selected 23 karst catchments demonstrates that the spatial distribution of Rc is dominated by the catchment properties, such as the catchment properties of geology, slope and land use and land cover, rather than climate condition of drought index. Correlation analysis indicates that the catchment with a large slope usually has a high value of Rc, and a large proportion of carbonate rock in a catchment reduces Rc in the study area. Temporal increasing trend of Rc during 1961–2000 was found for most catchments in the study area. This increasing trend was primarily resulted from changes of catchment properties, e.g. deforestation in large areas of Guizhou province during the 1950s–1980s.

Fertilizer use, population distribution, land cover, and social census data were used in this study. A terrestrial nitrogen cycle model with a 24-h time step and 0.5° spatial resolution was developed to estimate nitrogen leaching from soil layers in farmlands, grasslands, and natural lands. The N-cycle in this model includes the major processes of nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, immobilization, mineralization, leaching, and nitrogen absorption by vegetation. The previously developed Total Runoff Integrating Pathways network was used to analyze nitrogen transport from natural and anthropogenic sources through river channels, as well as the collecting and routing of nitrogen to river mouths by runoff. Model performance was evaluated through nutrient data measured at 61 locations in several major world river basins. The dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations calculated by the model agreed well with the observed data and demonstrate the reliability of the proposed model. The results indicate that nitrogen loading in most global rivers is proportional to the size of the river basin. Reduced nitrate leaching was predicted for basins with low population density, such as those at high latitudes or in arid regions. Nitrate concentration becomes especially high in tropical humid river basins, densely populated basins, and basins with extensive agricultural activity. On a global scale, agriculture has a significant impact on the distribution of nitrogenous compound pollution. The map of nitrate distribution indicates that serious nitrogen pollution (nitrate concentration: 10–50 mg N/L) has occurred in areas with significant agricultural activities and small precipitation surpluses. Analysis of the model uncertainty also suggests that the nitrate export in most rivers is sensitive to the amount of nitrogen leaching from agricultural lands.";"He, Bin

Delay can be optimal because allowing the natural decay of radiation can lower significantly the costs of achieving targets for exposure. Using some benchmark data for Japan I estimate that optimal delay is positive for most reasonable parameter values.

Case study: Secaşul Mare river basin settlements (Transylvanian Depression, Romania)";"";"According to the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR 1990–1999), the risk indicates potential losses due to particular natural phenomenon, and these could be reduced by improving of prevention and education. People perceive these losses differently depending on phenomenon occurrence, severity, and impact in time. Starting from this idea, this research presents public perception on land degradation through erosion in a small area from the central part of Romania (south-west of Transylvanian Depression). The research was based on a questionnaire consisting of 16 questions. The items were structured by issues: awareness assessment regarding hazard and risk phenomena, assessment of type of property and land use, assessment of knowledge and information on the possible production of negative effects by natural phenomena, and evaluation of land owners’ attitudes towards the occurrence of erosion on their land. Results reveal that the public perception on erosion is weak. This process is perceived as insignificant due to lack of phenomenon knowledge and especially because of scarcity preoccupation in land’s quality monitoring. Even though the owned lands are affected by erosion forms, the owners are not aware of the phenomenon that generates them. Material damages caused by erosion, loss of soil quality, and land fertility decrease are less perceived because the economic losses fill only at long term. This perception leads to underestimating erosion risk compared to other natural phenomena and to a passive attitude towards this particular phenomenon.";"Costea, Marioara

We examined the effects of sand deposition on the bioavailability of N in cyanobacterial-dominant soil crusts during and after a severe drought. Crusts were sampled from two depths on stony and stone-free surfaces with and without sandy deposits. All sites supported an extensive cover (up to 51%) of N-fixing cyanobacteria and cyanolichens. During drought, sand-covered crusts had up to three-times more mineral N (NH₄ ⁺ and NO₃ ⁻) and twice the mineralisable N, at both depths, than sand-free samples. Mineralisable N was always greater in the surface soil layer both during and after drought. During the drought, two common N-fixing cyanobacteria (Scytonema cf. hofman-bangii, Stigonema ocellatum) were significantly more abundant on uncovered than sand-covered surfaces. Increased N bioavailability likely results from autolysis and subsequent breakdown of N-enriched cyanobacterial cell material mediated by changes in the soil surface microenvironment. Our work suggests that landscape-level processes of sand deposition have a marked effect on soil nutrient pools by enhancing the accumulation of plant-available N on cyanobacterial crusted surfaces. Inappropriate land management or the loss of cyanobacterial soil crusts during drought would compromise the long-term bioavailability of soil N.";"Williams, Wendy J.

Under the constraints of land shortage, how to allocate the finite land resources to the multiple land users in China considering various political, environmental, ecological and economic conditions have become research topics with great significance. In this study, an interval fuzzy national-scale land-use model (IFNLM) was developed for optimizing land systems of China. IFNLM is based on an integration of existing interval linear programming (ILP), and fuzzy flexible programming (FFP) techniques. IFNLM allows uncertainties expressed as discrete interval values and fuzzy sets to be incorporated within a general optimization framework. It can also facilitate national-scale land-use planning under various environmental, ecological, social conditions within a multi-period and multi-option context. Then, IFNLM was applied to a real case study of land-use planning in China. The satisfaction degree of environmental constraints is between 0.69 and 0.97, the system benefit will between 198.25 × 10¹²USD and 229.67 × 10¹²USD.

"AGRIS:US201400162259";"Carbon dioxide exchange of a Sitka spruce plantation in Scotland over five years";"";"Scotland's 17% forested land cover sequesters 10% of Scotland's emissions of greenhouse gases. The expected rise of forested land cover to 25% by the middle of this century make forests an important component of the national carbon budget. This paper presents the carbon exchange measurement methodology, results, and modeling associated with a five-year experiment at a plantation forest in Scotland, UK, as part of a European initiative to develop and verify vegetation carbon-exchange models. We have developed a site specific correction for advective flux loses. While based on ustar corrections, it differs from current approaches in that it includes site topographic effects, corrects existing data instead of replacing it, and applies over the entire diel cycle instead of only during nocturnal periods. Models of soil respiration are compared and reveal the inadequacy of soil state parameterization. A non-rectangular hyperbola model of assimilation is selected to examine the maximum assimilation rate and quantum use efficiency parameters’ responses to environmental temperature, vapour pressure, and sky condition. Intra-annual variability is found to be highest in early autumn, linked to a combination of seasonal changes in radiation and phenological changes in canopy quantum yield. Inter-annual variability was low, with less than %5 variation from year to year, and factors driving this variability were not clearly apparent. Over the 5 years of reported measurements, this forest sequestered about 6 tonnes of C per hectare per annum. Photosynthetically active radiation use efficiency of the forest is about 4.2%. Constancy of radiation use efficiency was observed at both diel and annual scales. This constancy depended on the ecosystem's thermal inertia and assimilation/radiation response curve characteristics at diel time scales but depended on thermal inertia and phenological changes in quantum yield at annual time scales. The net carbon uptake rates are consistent with two other flux sites in the British Isles and suggest that the relatively maritime climatology of these areas is highly suitable for the species of trees routinely planted here.";"Clement, Robert J.

"AGRIS:US201400037851";"Spatial dependence of predictions from image segmentation: A variogram-based method to determine appropriate scales for producing land-management information";"";"A significant challenge in ecological studies has been defining scales of observation that correspond to the relevant ecological scales for organisms or processes of interest. Remote sensing has become commonplace in ecological studies and management, but the default resolution of imagery often used in studies is an arbitrary scale of observation. Segmentation of images into objects has been proposed as an alternative method for scaling remotely-sensed data into units having ecological meaning. However, to date, the selection of image object sets to represent landscape patterns has been largely subjective. Changes in observation scale affect the variance and spatial dependence of measured variables, and may be useful in determining which levels of image segmentation are most appropriate for a given purpose. We used observations of percent bare ground cover from 346 field sites in a semi-arid shrub-steppe ecosystem of southern Idaho to look at the changes in spatial dependence of regression predictions and residuals for 10 different levels of image segmentation. We found that the segmentation level whose regression predictions had spatial dependence that most closely matched the spatial dependence of the field samples also had the strongest predicted-to-observed correlations. This suggested that for percent bare ground cover in our study area an appropriate scale could be defined. With the incorporation of a geostatistical interpolator to predict the value of regression residuals at unsampled locations, however, we achieved consistently strong correlations across many segmentation levels. This suggests that if spatial dependence in percent bare ground is accounted for, a range of appropriate scales could be defined. Because the best analysis scale may vary for different ecosystem attributes and many inquiries consider more than one attribute, methods that can perform well across a range of scales and perhaps not at a single, ideal scale are important. More work is needed to develop methods that consider a wider range of ways to segment images into different scales and select sets of scales that perform best for answering specific management questions. The robustness of ecological landscape analyses will increase as methods are devised that remove the subjectivity with which observational scales are defined and selected.";"Karl, Jason W.

"AGRIS:US201400185286";"For the public good: weaving a multifunctional landscape in the Corn Belt";"";"Critics of modern agriculture decry the dominance of monocultural landscapes and look to multifunctionality as a desirable alternative that facilitates the production of public goods. In this study, we explored opportunities for multifunctional Midwestern agriculture through participatory research led by farmers, landowners, and other local actors. We suggest that agriculture typically fosters some degree of multifunctionality that arises from the divergent intentions of actors. The result is a scattered arrangement of what we term patchwork multifunctionality, a ubiquitous status quo in which individuals provide public goods without coordination. In contrast, interwoven multifunctionality describes deliberate collaboration to provide public goods, especially those cases where landowners work across fence lines to weave a synergistic landscape. Using examples from two case studies, we demonstrate the spectrum of patchwork and interwoven multifunctionality that currently exists in the Corn Belt, and present underutilized opportunities for public good creation.";"Harden, Noelle M.

"AGRIS:US201301856019";"comparison of alternative modelling approaches to evaluate the European forest carbon fluxes";"";"The European forest carbon balance studied by various methods shows different results. We compared the regional and national net primary production (NPP) estimated by the forest inventory-based model EFISCEN and the climate-based terrestrial ecosystem models (TEMs: BIOME-BGC, ORCHIDEE, and JULES), and single forests NPP derived from the international network of eddy-covariance towers (FLUXNET). In addition, the paper presents the net ecosystem production (NEP) and the net biome production (NBP) calculated with EFISCEN and discusses the influence of forest management onto carbon fluxes. We aimed to better understand the variance between EFISCEN and TEMs NPP estimates, and to improve the assessment of European forest mitigation potential for the year 2005. The NPP comparison between the EFISCEN inventory method and the TEMs process-based method showed similar average values for Europe and its countries. The European NPP average 508±183 (±standard deviation) gC/m²/year of EFISCEN was close to 487±126gC/m²/year of TEMs. The country level average EFISCEN-TEMs difference was just 57±153gC/m²/year. Larger differences were apparent at the regional level for the species groups. Especially for coniferous forests, EFISCEN projected higher values (NPP maximum 1480gC/m²/year) than TEMs (NPP reaching saturation below 700gC/m²/year). Compared to regional TEMs NPP across Europe, the range of regional EFISCEN NPP was consistently larger and with larger variance. Regionally EFISCEN and TEMs NPP averages were close to the individual FLUXNET data. Similar to broadleaves of TEMs, the FLUXNET broadleaves NPP were more productive compared to coniferous forests. We conclude that the two methods produce similar results, except for higher regional EFISCEN NPP of coniferous forests. The NPP difference between modelling methods was presumably result of TEMs assuming mature steady state forests, and lacking the distribution of highly productive and abundant intermediate age classes (integrated into EFISCEN). Both approaches have their advantages; TEMs include climate and environmental change, whereas EFISCEN includes past and current management. Combining the two approaches will allow more accurate assessment of the forest carbon balance, including direct and indirect human effects.";"Ťupek, Boris

"AGRIS:US201400185281";"Human Rights Against Land Grabbing? A Reflection on Norms, Policies, and Power";"";"Large-scale transnational land acquisition of agricultural land in the global south by rich corporations or countries raises challenging normative questions. In this article, the author critically examines and advocates a human rights approach to these questions. Mutually reinforcing, policies, governance and practice promote equitable and secure land tenure that in turn, strengthens other human rights, such as to employment, livelihood and food. Human rights therefore provide standards for evaluating processes and outcomes of transnational land acquisitions and, thus, for determining whether they are ethically unacceptable land grabs. A variety of recent policy initiatives on the issue have evoked human rights, most centrally through the consultation and negotiation of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests concluded in 2012. However, a case of transnational land appropriation illustrates weak host and investor state enforcement of human rights, leaving the parties to in interaction with local groups in charge of protecting human rights. Generally, we have so far seen limited direct application of human rights by states in their governance of transnational land acquisition. Normative responses to transnational land acquisition—codes of conduct, principles of responsible agricultural investment or voluntary guidelines—do not in themselves secure necessary action and change. Applying human rights approaches one must therefore also analyze the material conditions, power relations and political processes that determine whether and how women and men can secure the human rights accountability of the corporations and governments that promote large-scale, transnational land acquisition in the global south.";"Wisborg, Poul";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"women;land tenure";"Land & Gender";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400185281";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-013-9449-8";"";"";"";"1199-1222"

We conducted point-transect surveys for the endangered Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) in the live-fire region of Fort Hood, Texas. We used markârecapture distance sampling and combined a Horvitz-Thompson estimator with a habitat-based, resourceselection gradient to estimate spatially explicit density for both species. We detected Golden-cheeked Warblers at 120 locations (202, 197, and 89 detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively) and Black-capped Vireos at 173 locations (241, 255, and 107 detected by primary, secondary, and both observers, respectively). For Golden-cheeked Warblers, the average (Â± SE) composite detection probability estimate within a 100-m point-sample radius was 0.57 Â± 0.14, and for vireos it was 0.24 Â± 0.02. Estimated mean density (singing males haâ»Â¹) was 0.14 Â± 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.08â0.23) and 0.47 Â± 0.05 (95% CI: 0.38â0.60) for Golden-cheeked Warblers and Black-capped Vireos, respectively. Our analysis suggested evidence of heterogeneity in the detection process for both species, as well as imperfect detection at distance g(0), both of which would bias estimated densities if ignored. Additionally, both species exhibited spatial variability in estimated densities, with those areas that had higher occurrence probabilities typically having higher estimated density. In the absence of spatially explicit density prediction, managers must treat all losses of potential habitat for endangered species uniformly, despite likely differences in conservation value. Our approach could be used to ascertain areas of changing density in relation to changing habitat conditions over time and space.";"Collier, Bret A.

The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of military tracked M1A1 heavy combat tank vehicles on sediment loss from runoff, surface plant cover, and surface microtopography in a desert military training environment. A randomized block design was used which had 10 blocks with 4 plots (0.5 m2) in each block. Each block had randomly selected treatments that included an untreated control, 1 pass by a M1A1 tank under wet seasonal conditions, 3 passes by a M1A1 tank under wet seasonal conditions, 1 pass by a M1A1 tank under dry seasonal conditions, and 3 passes by a M1A1 tank under dry seasonal conditions. Data were analyzed using mean separation and stepwise regression techniques. Most sample periods showed that sediment losses from M1A1 tank treatments, single or triple passes under wet or dry seasonal conditions, did not differ statistically from natural sediment losses under nominal rainfall events. However, comparatively intense rainfall events often generated significantly (P < 0.05) greater sediment losses from the M1A1 tank triple pass treatments. Triple pass M1A1 tank impacts had detrimental effects that could last many years, particularly when disturbances were imposed under dry seasonal conditions. Seasonal drought for the area, occurring 2 out of 3 years during the study period, may have exacerbated the effects of triple pass M1A1 tank impacts. Analysis showed that grass cover, litter cover, and microtopographic variance were highly and negatively correlated (R = -0.62) with cumulative sediment loss. Depending on precipitation availability, a minimum of 3 years for most triple pass M1A1 tank impacts is suggested for suitable vegetation recovery and soil stability. It is recommended that site repetitious M1A1 tank training maneuvers should be conducted with particular attention to site recovery. Furthermore, the influence of climate, drought in particular, should be among the topics addressed by future military training land use models.";"Fuchs, E.H.

"AGRIS:US201600101221";"Determining the effects of felling method and season of year on the regeneration of short rotation coppice";"";"There is increasing interest in plantations with the objective of producing biomass for energy and fuel. These types of plantations are called Short Rotation Woody Crops (SRWC). Popular SRWC species are Eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.), Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and Willow (Salix spp.). These species have in common strong growth rates, the ability to coppice, and rotations of 2–10 years. SRWC have generated interest for many forest products’ companies (seeking for diversification or energy self-sufficiency) and private landowners, and although they might help with the supply for the expected growth on the bioenergy and biofuels market, there are still several concerns about how and when to harvest SRWC to maximize their ability to coppice. SRWC have elevated establishment and maintenance costs if compared to other type of plantations, but due to the coppicing ability, the same plantation may be harvested up to 5 times without the need of establishing a new one. Study plots were installed at six locations in Florida, Mississippi and Arkansas, and were cut with a chainsaw and a shear head during summer and winter, to determine the effects of felling method and season on coppice regeneration. Thus, plots were divided into areas of four different treatments: shear-winter, saw-winter, shear-summer, saw-summer. Harvesting eucalypt and cottonwood trees during winter resulted in better survival rates than harvesting during summer; however, there was no effect of felling method on coppice regeneration. Finally, no statistically significant difference was found on coppice regeneration of black willow when harvested during winter or summer with a chainsaw or a shear head.";"P. L. de Souza, Daniel

Land cover management has been an effective strategy in managing land degradation through the reduction of water, soil and nutrient losses and improvement in soil fertility and quality. Acacia nilotica (Acacia)-based silvipastoral systems with five intercrops, viz., Eulaliopsis binata (bhabbar), Saccharum munja (munj), Vetiveria zizanioides (vetiver), natural grasses and no grass, were evaluated in a long-term study in degraded bouldery lands in Haryana state of India. All grasses resulted in a reduction of soil, water and nutrient losses and improved microbial properties. However, their association adversely affected the growth of Acacia, and the decline varied with grass species. After 11� years of establishment, sole Acacia plantation had the maximum height (7.58� m), diameter at breast height (dbh) (21.32� cm) and crown spread (7.41� m). Munj produced the highest biomass under Acacia, but most adversely affected its growth, resulting in minimum survival (48� %), height (7.07� m), dbh (16.23� cm) and crown spread (6.57� m). Yield of all the grasses increased during the initial 5–6� years, but declined sharply thereafter, with the maximum decline in bhabbar. Detailed investigations established that the sharp decline in survival and growth of bhabbar was due to shade and not because of nutrient competition or allelopathy. Acacia� +� V. zizanioides proved the most effective silvipastoral system for resource conservation and biomass production. It also provided the highest NPV (Rs 1.88 lakhs ha⁻¹), B:C (2.37) and IRR (24.70� %) as compared to Rs 6,998� ha⁻¹, 1.05 and 8.76� % under pure Acacia plantation, respectively.";"Yadav, R. P.

This paper explores the potential for adoption of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) agroforestry in Portugal and estimates the potential carbon sequestration. Spatial modeling and Portuguese datasets were used to estimate target areas where cork oak could grow on farmland. Different implementation scenarios were then modeled for this area assuming a modern silvoarable agroforestry system (113� trees� ha⁻¹ thinned at year 20 for establishing 50� trees� ha⁻¹). The YieldSAFE process-based model was used to predict the biomass and carbon yield of cork oak under low and high soil water holding capacity levels. Approximately 353,000� ha are available in Portugal for new cork oak alley cropping. Assuming implementation rates between 10� % of the area with low soil water capacity (60� mm: 15� cm depth, coarse texture) and 70� % of the area with high soil water holding capacity (1,228� mm: 200� cm depth, very fine texture), then carbon sequestration could be 5� ×� 10⁶ and 123� ×� 10⁶ Mg CO₂ respectively. Due to higher yields on more productive land, scenarios of limited implementation in high productivity locations can sequester similar amounts of carbon as wide implementation on low productivity land, suggesting that a priori land classification assessments can improve the targeting of land and financial incentives for carbon sequestration.";"Palma, J.

While forest farming is encouraged to reduce wild-harvest impacts, little information is available to aid landowners in successfully cultivating black cohosh. This study examined survival and multi-year growth of 200 black cohosh rhizomes collected from an Appalachian deciduous forest and transplanted to a similar forest type. By the second year after transplant, fewer than 40� % of rhizomes produced above-ground growth and mean rhizome biomass declined by more than 50� %. Shoot biomass was the greatest predictor of below-ground biomass; however, leaf area provided a reasonable, non-destructive means of estimating this commercially-important biomass. Our results suggest that pre-transplant rhizome condition is particularly important to transplant success. Low biomass, lack of roots, and fungal infection all were associated with reduced plant survival. Based on this and associated studies, we recommend careful site selection for propagation, including circumneutral or lime-amended soils and light to moderate shading. Well-drained soil appears particularly important to discourage fungal infection. Understanding conditions for successful transplanting of black cohosh rhizomes can improve forest farming and contribute to sustainable management of this and other non-timber forest products.";"Small, Christine J.

These observations imply that land is being farmed much  more intensively without much time to fallow and allow the soil to rejuvenate. Pasture and  woodlot are also being cut down at the expense of cultivation. This has important potential  implications for productivity as well as for the environment. Average calorie production per  person per day in Rwanda is believed to have dropped significantly during the war period, and then  has increased on average in 2002 to levels near those measured in 1984. The rural population  dependent on the land has increased some 27% since 1984.";"Mpyisi, Edson

"AGRIS:US201600186963";"Empirical Study on Compatibility of Sarawak Forest Ordinance and Bidayuh Native Customary Laws in Forest Management";"";"This study was conducted to examine the compatibility between the Sarawak Forest Ordinance and Bidayuh Native Customary Laws in Sarawak and to gather the community membersâ opinions on the compatibility of these laws. This study was carried out using two research methods, viz. a literature review and a survey among the Bidayuh community in Bau, Sarawak. The documents reviewed were the Forest Ordinance Chapter 126 (1958) and the Adat Bidayuh Order, 1994. There are several notable differences between the two laws in terms of, forest ownership, losing of rights to forest or inheritance, and the management of forest. A list of statements with six interval scales was presented and a majority of Bidayuh community members neither disagreed nor agreed with the statement, (1) Forest Ordinance respects the Bumiputera peopleâs rights (37.5Â %; SDÂ =Â 1.259) and (2) Forest Ordinance protects the Bumiputera peopleâs rights (37.5Â %; SDÂ =Â 1.281). The community members are also not sure about the consistency between these two laws (28.1Â %; SDÂ =Â 1.182). These results indicated the need for the State to respect the nativesâ rights toward the forest land and its resources, recognize the Bidayuh Native Customary Laws and for the native people to learn about the constitutional provisions. Further studies are needed because the knowledge of Native Customary Law itself cannot guarantee the nativesâ future in terms of economic, social and environmental aspects and there is also a need to review the current laws to achieve the objective to protect and preserve the nativesâ rights.";"Nelson, Julia

"AGRIS:US201500197487";"mechanistic modeling system for estimating large-scale emissions and transport of pollen and co-allergens";"";"Allergic airway diseases represent a complex health problem which can be exacerbated by the synergistic action of pollen particles and air pollutants such as ozone. Understanding human exposures to aeroallergens requires accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of airborne pollen levels as well as of various air pollutants at different times. However, currently there are no established methods for estimating allergenic pollen emissions and concentrations over large geographic areas such as the United States. A mechanistic modeling system for describing pollen emissions and transport over extensive domains has been developed by adapting components of existing regional scale air quality models and vegetation databases. First, components of the Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (BEIS) were adapted to predict pollen emission patterns. Subsequently, the transport module of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system was modified to incorporate description of pollen transport. The combined model, CMAQ-pollen, allows for simultaneous prediction of multiple air pollutants and pollen levels in a single model simulation, and uses consistent assumptions related to the transport of multiple chemicals and pollen species. Application case studies for evaluating the combined modeling system included the simulation of birch and ragweed pollen levels for the year 2002, during their corresponding peak pollination periods (April for birch and September for ragweed). The model simulations were driven by previously evaluated meteorological model outputs and emissions inventories for the eastern United States for the simulation period. A semi-quantitative evaluation of CMAQ-pollen was performed using tree and ragweed pollen counts in Newark, NJ for the same time periods. The peak birch pollen concentrations were predicted to occur within two days of the peak measurements, while the temporal patterns closely followed the measured profiles of overall tree pollen. For the case of ragweed pollen, the model was able to capture the patterns observed during September 2002, but did not predict an early peak; this can be associated with a wider species pollination window and inadequate spatial information in current land cover databases. An additional sensitivity simulation was performed to comparatively evaluate the dispersion patterns predicted by CMAQ-pollen with those predicted by the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, which is used extensively in aerobiological studies. The CMAQ estimated concentration plumes matched the equivalent pollen scenario modeled with HYSPLIT. The novel pollen modeling approach presented here allows simultaneous estimation of multiple airborne allergens and other air pollutants, and is being developed as a central component of an integrated population exposure modeling system, the Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies (MENTOR) for multiple, co-occurring contaminants that include aeroallergens and irritants.";"Efstathiou, Christos

This study aimed to test the transferability of the Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA), which was originally developed in the European context, to developing countries, in which lack of data often prevents the use of data-driven impact assessment methods. The core aspect of FoPIA is the stakeholder-based assessment of alternative land use scenarios. Scenario impacts on regional sustainability are assessed by using a set of nine regional land use functions (LUFs), which equally cover the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The cases analysed in this study include (1) the alternative spatial planning policies around the Merapi volcano and surrounding areas of Yogyakarta City, Indonesia; (2) the large-scale afforestation of agricultural areas to reduce soil erosion in Guyuan, China; (3) the expansion of soil and water conservation measures in the Oum Zessar watershed, Tunisia; (4) the agricultural intensification and the potential for organic agriculture in Bijapur, India; and (5) the land degradation and land conflicts resulting from land division and privatisation in Narok, Kenya. All five regions are characterised by population growth, partially combined with considerable economic development, environmental degradation problems and social conflicts. Implications of the regional scenario impacts as well as methodological aspects are discussed. Overall, FoPIA proved to be a useful tool for diagnosing regional human–environment interactions and for supporting the communication and social learning process among different stakeholder groups.";"König, Hannes Jochen

"AGRIS:US201600132308";"Quandaries of a decade‐long restoration experiment trying to reduce invasive species: beat them, join them, give up, or start over?";"";"We evaluate the outcomes and consequences of a decade‐long restoration project in a Hawaiian lowland wet forest as they relate to long‐term management actions. Our initial study was designed both to promote native biodiversity and to develop knowledge that would enable land management agencies to restore invaded forests. Our premise of success followed the prevalent perception that short‐term management, such as removal of invasive species, ideally translates into long‐term and sustainable restoration. We were therefore disappointed and perhaps discouraged in our results—little recovery of native biodiversity despite ongoing and labor‐intensive management. Not only did we fail to return the invaded forest to a native‐dominated system but also our efforts lead to recruitment of new non‐native species assemblages. The sobering truth of many restoration projects in Hawaii and elsewhere is that we can never completely walk away and “consider the job finished,” or we have to accept that some ecosystems cannot be returned to an all‐native state. Essentially, costs of restoration may outweigh the accomplishment. This setback gave us an opportunity to reconsider and modify our initial approach. By starting over with a new direction using both native and non‐invasive but non‐native species, we have adopted a new philosophy of “join them.” In our revision, we changed the players in the game by following invasive species removal with outplantings of native and non‐invasive non‐native species that will functionally fill missing roles in the ecosystem. We link social interest in the new experiment to changing attitudes about naturalness.";"Cordell, Susan

Rice cultivation is a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and no tillage of soil is becoming popular due to low economic investments with improved soil conditions. However, how these arrangements will affect GHG emissions need to be quantified. Therefore, monitoring over diverse agricultural practices is essential for optimum utilization of cultivable land and resources, while identifying the chances of emission reductions. We assessed the impacts of four tillage practices in rice–wheat cultivation system on fluxes of GHGs (CH₄, N₂O and CO₂) and yield of rice. The tillage practices were tilling of soil before sowing of every crop (RCT-WCT), tillage before sowing of rice but no tillage before sowing of wheat (RCT-WNT), tillage before sowing of wheat but no tillage before sowing of rice (RNT-WCT), and no tillage before sowing of rice as well as wheat (RNT-WNT). Reduction in tillage frequency led to significant reductions in fluxes of CH₄ and N₂O, but increased CO₂ while permutations of tillage and no tillage influenced grain yield. RNT-WCT produced next to or comparable to the most yielding RCT-WCT. Although it is difficult to select the best performer since no single tillage permutation showed consistent increment in yield with accompanied emission reductions, RNT-WCT, however may be considered as better agricultural practice for the study region. Long term and extensive spatio-temporal monitoring is still required before making any recommendation. It is also essential for understanding the factors that cause declination in yields under no tillage.";"Pandey, Divya

Over the years, various anthropogenic pressures in the lake catchment have significantly altered the land system, impairing, inter-alia, sustained biotic communities and water quality of the lake. The primary objective of this paper was to help a better understanding of the LULC change, its driving forces and the overall impact on the hydrological response patterns. Multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data for 1992 and 2005 was used for determining the spatio-temporal dynamics of the lake catchment. Geographic Information System (GIS) based simulation model namely Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) was used to model the hydrological processes under the LULC conditions. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in LULC and identify factors contributing to these variations and analyze the corresponding impacts of the change on the hydrological processes like runoff, erosion and sedimentation. The simulated results on the hydrological responses reveal that depletion of the vegetation cover in the study area and increase in impervious and bare surface cover due to anthropogenic interventions are the primary reasons for the increased runoff, erosion and sediment discharges in the Dal lake catchment. This study concludes that LULC change in the catchment is a major concern that has disrupted the ecological stability and functioning of the Dal lake ecosystem.";"BADAR, BAZIGHA

Rejeitou-se, pelo teste qui-quadrado a 5% de probabilidade, a hipótese nula de independência entre as classes de concentração da posse da terra e os tipos de especialização locacional dos usos da terra, no âmbito municipal. Verificou-se que nos municípios com alto quociente locacional com cana-de-açúcar também ocorre concentração de posse da terra em graus forte e muito forte. Por outro lado, os municípios com quocientes locacionais maiores que o padrão da bacia nas culturas perenes e anuais apresentaram menor concentração fundiária, quando comparados aos municípios não especializados nestas atividades. Já o grau de especialização na atividade de pastagem não apresentou relação significativa com a estrutura fundiária.

The results have shown a very high land concentration index: half of the municipalities presents medium to strong degrees of land concentration (Gini Index between 0,501 and 0,700) and the other half strong to very strong degrees (Gini Index between 0,701 and 0,900). The null hypothesis of the independence between land concentration classes and location distribution of the land uses was rejected by the chi-square test with 5% of probability. It was found also strong and very strong degrees of land concentration in municipalities with a high location quotient with sugar cane. On the other hand, the municipalities presenting location quotients with other crops larger than the standard found in the Watershed, presented lower concentration land when compared to municipalities more specialized in cattle raising activities. However, the degree of specialization in cattle raising activities was not correlated to the agrarian structure. The paper concludes that the indicators proposed have been efficient to characterize the distribution of the activities in the municipalities. The Location Quotient was useful for analysis at the regional levels (in this case, by municipality) and at the sector levels (by productive activity).";"Ambrosio, Luis Alberto

The literature search was filtered by the tick’s species name and an unambiguous reference to the point of capture. Records from some curated collections were included. We focused on tick species of importance to human and animal health, in particular: Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, H. sulcata, Hyalomma marginatum, Hy. lusitanicum, Rhipicephalus annulatus, R. bursa, and the R. sanguineus group. A few records of other species (I. canisuga, I. hexagonus, Hy. impeltatum, Hy. anatolicum, Hy. excavatum, Hy. scupense) were also included. A total of 10,280 records was included in the data set. Almost 42 % of published references are not adequately referenced (and not included in the data set), host is reported for only 61 % of records and a reference to time of collection is missed for 84 % of published records. Ixodes ricinus accounted for 44.3 % of total records, with H. marginatum and D. marginatus accounting for 7.1 and 8.1 % of records, respectively. The lack of homogeneity of the references and potential pitfalls in the compilation were addressed to create a digital data set of the records of the ticks. We attached to every record a coherent set of quantitative descriptors for the site of reporting, namely gridded interpolated monthly climate and remotely sensed data on vegetation (NDVI). We also attached categorical descriptors of the habitat: a standard classification of land biomes and an ad hoc classification of the target territory from remotely sensed temperature and NDVI data. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed that a principal components reduction of the environmental (temperature and NDVI) variables described the distribution of the species in the target territory. However, categorical descriptors of the habitat were less effective. We stressed the importance of building reliable collections of ticks with specific references as to collection point, host and date of capture. The data set is freely downloadable.";"Estrada-Peña, A.

Given that watershed management is the implementation of management systems that ensure the preservation, conservation and sustainable use of all land resources. It is through this understanding that watersheds can be managed to protect the natural resources valued by local and national communities. This study aims to investigate the effect of water management on soil productivity at Marab Hassan/Jordan. It was found that the salinity in the initial soil samples (before treatment) were higher than the values for the final analyses reported in final soil samples (after treatment). Also, it was found that the average height of barley planted in the treated areas was 63 cm, while the average height of barley planted in the control area was 20 cm. This result is showing that the water management treatments were very successful in terms of retain water and store more moisture in the soil, so the barley grow in high rate compare to those have no treatments.";"Saad Al-Ayyash

"AGRIS:US201500015561";"assessment of long-term overtopping risk and optimal termination time of dam under climate change";"";"Reservoir management faces a wide range of new challenges resulting from the impact of climate change. One set of challenges arises from the non-stationary nature of hydrological conditions. Another crucial issue is watershed sedimentation, which can significantly influence the sustainability and safety of reservoirs. To address these concerns, this study developed a framework for the management of reservoir risk. An analytical conceptual model coupling physical governing relationships and economic tools was proposed, which was then applied to the Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan. We adopted a statistical representation of future hydrologic conditions with the assumption of time-variant moments and focused on evaluating the impact of an increase in the frequency of extreme hydrological events caused by climate change and used a stochastic approach to quantify the risk factors. Our results confirm that this approach can be used to identify reservoir-related risks and generate appropriate options for strategy and policy. We determined that the major source of risk is the hydrological conditions, especially the extreme events. More severe intra-annual climatic change is much more dominant in the risk compared to inter-year trends. The influence of reservoir characteristics on risk is associated mainly with the availability of flood control capacity, but limited due to the limitation of its volume and potential to regulate the flow. Engineering may provide an option for mitigating the risk, but integrated, watershed-level approaches, such as providing systematic detention or land use management, are better suited to reducing the storm peak from a long-term perspective. With a critical increase in the risk of overtopping, a high probability of dam failure and corresponding losses may precipitate the need to retire or remove the facility. However, because the benefits and costs are both huge, the decision may be biased by a conservative attitude. The outcome of small facilities failing may be considered more acceptable than similar events besetting larger systems.";"Lee, Bau-Shian

"AGRIS:US201500192747";"Thresholds of species loss in Amazonian deforestation frontier landscapes";"";"In the Brazilian Amazon, private land accounts for the majority of remaining native vegetation. Understanding how land‐use change affects the composition and distribution of biodiversity in farmlands is critical for improving conservation strategies in the face of rapid agricultural expansion. Working across an area exceeding 3 million ha in the southwestern state of Rondônia, we assessed how the extent and configuration of remnant forest in replicate 10,000‐ha landscapes has affected the occurrence of a suite of Amazonian mammals and birds. In each of 31 landscapes, we used field sampling and semistructured interviews with landowners to determine the presence of 28 large and medium sized mammals and birds, as well as a further 7 understory birds. We then combined results of field surveys and interviews with a probabilistic model of deforestation. We found strong evidence for a threshold response of sampled biodiversity to landscape level forest cover; landscapes with <30–40% forest cover hosted markedly fewer species. Results from field surveys and interviews yielded similar thresholds. These results imply that in partially deforested landscapes many species are susceptible to extirpation following relatively small additional reductions in forest area. In the model of deforestation by 2030 the number of 10,000‐ha landscapes under a conservative threshold of 43% forest cover almost doubled, such that only 22% of landscapes would likely to be able to sustain at least 75% of the 35 focal species we sampled. Brazilian law requires rural property owners in the Amazon to retain 80% forest cover, although this is rarely achieved. Prioritizing efforts to ensure that entire landscapes, rather than individual farms, retain at least 50% forest cover may help safeguard native biodiversity in private forest reserves in the Amazon.";"Ochoa‐Quintero, Jose Manuel

To divide the original information into logical and statistically valid value categories, we used a k-means cluster analysis combined with expert knowledge of how each resource type is managed with respect to fire. After we established the value categories, we performed a regression tree analysis to estimate an average relative marginal value for each category under different combinations of ecosystem condition and fireline intensity. Average values for each category are as expected and the regression tree fits are excellent with R ² values ranging from .895 to .948.

While reforms have been implemented to manage water resources, these have taken little notice of how people use and manage their water and have had limited effect at the ground level. On the other hand, regulations developed within communities are livelihood-oriented and provide incentives for collective action but they can also be hierarchal, enforcing power and gender inequalities. This book shows how bringing together the strengths of community-based laws rooted in user participation and the formalized legal systems of the public sector, water management regimes will be more able to reach their goals. Evaluating the interface between community and formal water laws, chapters consider examples from Africa, Latin America and Asia and provide valuable insights for policy makers, managers, researchers and field implementers.";"van Koppen, Barbara

"AGRIS:US201600060099";"approach for characterizing the distribution of shrubland ecosystem components as continuous fields as part of NLCD";"";"Characterizing and quantifying distributions of shrubland ecosystem components is one of the major challenges for monitoring shrubland vegetation cover change across the United States. A new approach has been developed to quantify shrubland components as fractional products within National Land Cover Database (NLCD). This approach uses remote sensing data and regression tree models to estimate the fractional cover of shrubland ecosystem components. The approach consists of three major steps: field data collection, high resolution estimates of shrubland ecosystem components using WorldView-2 imagery, and coarse resolution estimates of these components across larger areas using Landsat imagery. This research seeks to explore this method to quantify shrubland ecosystem components as continuous fields in regions that contain wide-ranging shrubland ecosystems. Fractional cover of four shrubland ecosystem components, including bare ground, herbaceous, litter, and shrub, as well as shrub heights, were delineated in three ecological regions in Arizona, Florida, and Texas. Results show that estimates for most components have relatively small normalized root mean square errors and significant correlations with validation data in both Arizona and Texas. The distribution patterns of shrub height also show relatively high accuracies in these two areas. The fractional cover estimates of shrubland components, except for litter, are not well represented in the Florida site. The research results suggest that this method provides good potential to effectively characterize shrubland ecosystem conditions over perennial shrubland although it is less effective in transitional shrubland. The fractional cover of shrub components as continuous elements could offer valuable information to quantify biomass and help improve thematic land cover classification in arid and semiarid areas.";"Xian, George

We use data from Uganda to test for differences in the performance of rental, as compared to sales markets and their evolution over time, based on a framework where markets are affected by differences in ability and imperfections in rural labor and capital markets.  We find that land markets are very active, that land rental but not sales markets transfer land to more efficient and relatively poor producers thereby providing an opportunity for the landless to access land, and that rental market activity has increased recently with economic growth.  Despite land prices in some regions being above the net present value of land we find no evidence for sales markets leading to land concentration and conclude that, rather than imposing administrative restrictions, government should aim to improve access to alternative savings instruments.";"Deininger, Klaus W.

This paper relates the observed patterns in regional inequality to major events during this period. Because of China’s institutional barriers to migration, regional inequality is much higher than in India. Also, China’s decentralization and opening up are closely related to the observed regional inequality - particularly the inland-coastal disparity - since the reform period. From the Green Revolution age to the period of economic liberalization in India, the evolution of regional comparative advantage has shifted from the quality of land to the level of human capital as India integrates with the international market.

"AGRIS:US201400165325";"Drought vulnerability drives land-use and land cover changes in the Rift Valley dry lands of Ethiopia";"";"The Ethiopian Rift Valley is a dry land zone where for a long time pastoral communities have made their living from acacia-based woodlands. But many pastoralists have changed from a pastoral way of life to mixed farming over time. The aim of this study was to evaluate land-use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Central Rift Valley dry lands of Ethiopia, and determine the role of drought vulnerability as a driver. A combination of GIS/remote sensing techniques, drought vulnerability analyses, field observation and surveying were employed. Because drought vulnerability is linked more closely to the types of land-uses and social contexts rather than only climatological events, it was examined based on locally perceived criteria of drought. Accordingly, the pastoral way of life was vulnerable to severe drought during 25% of the last 28years while the mixed farming (livestock and maize farming combined) system was vulnerable to severe drought only during 4% of the years. Over the last 5 decades, cultivated lands increased to threefold while the dense acacia coverage declined from 42% in 1965 to 9% in 2010. The observed LULC changes were driven by the interplay of recurrent drought, socioeconomic and institutional dynamics, access to markets and improved technologies such as early-maturing maize cultivars and better land management. Proper policy and technological interventions are required to develop appropriate drought adaptation strategies and avert the increasing degradation of woodlands in the Rift Valley dry lands where a pastoral way of life is still present.";"Biazin, Birhanu

The EFZ covers 173 930 ha in 304 estuaries/outlets nationally. Field surveys and analysis of available aerial images showed that 82 (12 956.70 ha) of these estuaries (26%) had estuarine habitats occurring outside of this boundary. As a result of mapping scale, the National Vegetation Map does not represent habitats that are associated with small estuaries (approximately 50% of South Africa's estuaries). For estuaries in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, most habitats have been lost due to urban development, whereas in subtropical areas (northern Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal), cultivation has removed estuarine habitat. Although delineation of boundaries can be complicated by landcover changes, the estuarine lateral boundary in Cape estuaries could be identified based on sediment characteristics (moisture content, organic content, electrical conductivity), groundwater characteristics (salinity, conductivity and depth) and plant species. The delineation of the EFZ needs to be consistent, inclusive of all estuarine physical and biological processes, and cost-effective to identify so that it can protect estuarine habitats.";"Veldkornet, DA

Land under agroforestry decreased by 25%, while that under annual crops increased by 41%. Grasslands increased by 116% and riverine vegetation decreased by 53%. Daily dry season flow showed a slightly decreasing trend in one of the stations despite all of them receiving water from the Rundugai natural springs. On the other hand, low flow indices indicated no statistically significant changes in the long-term average flow and there was no identifiable change in the rainfall amount. The majority (93%) of the local people perceived a changing rainfall pattern and decline in dry season flow in the Kikuletwa River. Changes in the dry season flow then can be associated with the identified land cover changes. Further research to substantiate the local people perceptions is important as indigenous knowledge may be good evidence for ascertaining changes in the natural environment.";"Munishi, P.K.T.

Changes in woody cover were measured for 1 km² sites in areas under communal, commercial and conservation land-use systems for the period between 1937 and 2000. Land users from each area were interviewed to gain the histories of each area and to determine how the changes in woody cover had impacted them and whether anything was being done to counteract the spread of trees and shrubs on their land. Bush encroachment occurred across all three of the land-use types in the 67-year period between 1937 and 2000. The results showed that land-use practice had enormous impacts on the process of bush encroachment. The communal site showed a decrease in grass (21%) and tree (5%) cover and an increase in shrub cover (13%). At the commercial site, there was a considerable decrease in grass cover (46%) and moderate increase in shrub cover (10%) and a massive increase in tree cover (36%). The area under conservation showed a substantial decrease in grass cover (47%), a slight decrease in shrub cover (19%) and a massive increase in tree cover (66%). The perceived causes of these changes were fairly similar amongst the different land users. The changes were mostly not perceived to be a problem for the communal land users. The main advantages mentioned were increased woody resources for building and firewood and increased browse availability. The commercial and conservation land users perceived the changes to have significant negative connotations including the loss of grazing land and biodiversity and secondary invasion of encroached areas by alien plant species. Despite these perceptions, very little has been done to combat bush encroachment in the commercial and conservation land use systems.";"Wigley, B.J.

The SWBM was applied to the Upper Ing Basin in northern Thailand to investigate the spatial and temporal variations in the location of streams and water yields from different parts of the basin. The base simulation was carried out for the years 1998–2007 using a DEM and actual land-use data at 100-m resolution. The simulated stream network was compared with topographic maps under different flow conditions, which were successfully represented. The 10-year average simulated river flow rate was 1300 L/s, but it more than doubled during periods of heavy rainfall and decreased below 600 L/s in dry seasons. The total length of the streams (based on flow threshold of 25 L/s) on a typical day in the dry season differed by a factor of approx. 1.5. Agricultural water needs and possible extraction were assessed and presented by dividing the basin into 10 different zones based on the stream network. The results show that there is the potential for harvesting significant quantities of water at different spatial gradients with no initial water supply for irrigation. Monthly water yields for each zone were computed; the results varied from less than 50% to over 137% of the per hectare water yield for the entire basin. This variation was due to differences in topography and land cover. The impact of land use and climate change on streamwater availability was also studied. The basin shows very different hydrological responses. The changes in average river flow relative to the base simulation were +27.6%, −32.1%, +94% and +52.9% under deforestation, changing land use from paddy field to orchard, bare soil and increased rainfall scenarios, respectively.Citation Bahadur KC, K.

"AGRIS:US201302927471";"Adoption of Brush Busters: results of Texas county extension survey";"";"Changing landowner demographics and the increasing recognition that some quantity of woody plants is valuable for certain rangeland management objectives has led to increasing interest in selective brush management practices. Brush Busters is a collaborative extension/research program developed in response to this growing interest. A survey of Texas County Extension Agents-Agriculture was conducted in 1999 to determine their perceptions about the interest in and adoption of Brush Busters practices. Using 3 threshold photographs, Extension Agents representing almost 50% of the counties in the 9 Extension Districts surveyed estimated that 44, 34, and 49% of the total area of mesquite, juniper and pricklypear, respectively, could be treated using Brush Busters. They also indicated that over 405,000 ha (78% mesquite) were treated with Brush Busters methods between 1995 and 1998, but that this represented less than 7% of the potentially treatable area. In most Extension Districts, more time was spent disseminating information about Brush Busters methods than any other brush management method since 1995. Extension Agents indicated that Brush Busters has become popular because it is perceived to be an inexpensive, convenient, safe, effective and predictable method for controlling brush, and because user-friendly information is widely available. Our findings suggest that increasing the adoption rates of ecologically sound rangeland management technologies requires: (1) greater emphasis on developing and disseminating user-friendly messages to rangeland managers and Extension Agents; and (2) greater emphasis on short-term efficacy rather than the long term advantages of new technologies.";"Kreuter, U.P.

Ecological impacts were typically low. Recent trends have increased use of protected areas for extreme sports, with greater numbers undertaking more active recreation, such as extreme sports. The effect of this trend is considered, together with potential management options. We propose that the development of appropriately targeted and delivered educational programmes could minimise environmental degradation. However, to maximise ecological conservation in protected lands we consider that a major paradigm shift is required. This will require a more strategic, holistic approach to planning and managing outdoor recreation/sport destinations incorporating collaboration across stakeholders. Based on past experience, to continue with the current model will ultimately accelerate biodiversity loss, degradation of protected areas, and loss of recreational amenity.";"Burgin, Shelley

The analysis focuses on Argentina, but draws on examples from throughout Latin America for a regional perspective and from the provinces of Jujuy, Cordoba and Santiago del Estero for subnational views. Section one describes the territorial restructuring of meaning, physical ‘places’ and politico-legal ‘spaces', as it plays out at multiple scales to facilitate the investment in and sale and export of natural resource commodities. I argue that land grabs contribute to this process but are not solely responsible for it. Section two explores the territorial logic of resistance. In what might be understood as territorial restructuring from below, rural communities are finding their own ways of restructuring places, legal spaces and the meaning of resistance from a peasant struggle for land reform to a peasant–indigenous alliance in defense of territory. This emerging alliance is not only important for understanding the nature of reactions to land grabbing and land conflict today. Recognizing and navigating the differences between peasant and indigenous histories of collective action are also crucial for sustaining such alliances at the regional, national and subnational level.";"Brent, Zoe W.";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"013;005;ARG";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001855";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2015.1013100";"";"";"";"671-694"

As battle over three SEZs continues in the Supreme Court of India, there is hope that commons will be returned to local communities. There is, however, an impasse on the ground that begs resolution if the gains over SEZs are to be secured.

This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides.

This paper analyses the ‘exceptional’ case of non-resistance of Ukrainian peasants and argues that it is not as exceptional as it seems at first glance. By studying various rural responses to the large-scale agricultural development in Ukraine and the resulting socio-economic transformations within rural communities, this research demonstrates that: the politics of dispossessed groups depend on the terms of inclusion in land deals; adaptive response strategies are common and can be advantageous for rural people; and peasants are more concerned with personal gains from land grabs than with benefits for the whole community, which often leads to their acceptance of large-scale land acquisitions.

This research documents changes in cloud forest cover, explores some contributing factors to deforestation, and considers forest preservation and food security implications for Q’eqchi’ communities. We used a transdisciplinary framework that synthesized remote sensing/GIS analysis of land cover change, focus group dialogs, and surveys. Expansion of subsistence agriculture is a key proximate cause of cloud forest removal, followed by extraction of fuelwood and larger-scale logging operations. Predisposing environmental factors such as rugged topography, steep slopes, and poor soils contribute to low agricultural productivity that contributes to increased conversion of forest to agricultural land. The key underlying driving forces for deforestation locally are population growth and subdivision of land. Population growth is increasing the demand for agricultural land and, as a result, the Q’eqchi’ clear the forest to meet the need for increased food production. Furthermore, population growth is driving subdivision of land, decreasing fallow periods, and putting additional strain on poor soils, all of which exacerbate land degradation. Given the increase in population in the region, food production must be improved on existing agricultural land to avoid the need to put more land into production to meet food requirements. Thus, efforts to sustainably increase agricultural productivity are fundamental to efforts to conserve the cloud forest and to safeguard essential ecosystem services.";"Pope, I.

Infection of C. felis is characterized by lethargy, icterus, fever, anorexia, anemia, and death. The natural vertebrate reservoir of C. felis is the bobcat (Lynx rufus). To determine the possible distribution of C. felis in three states where infection is common (Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas), two separate approaches to ecological niche modeling were implemented. First, a model relating several different climatic layers to geographic locations where cases of C. felis infection were confirmed in domestic cats was developed to predict the possible distribution of the parasite. The second model incorporated occurrences of bobcats with environmental layers and land cover suitable for tick vectors to identify areas of overlap where C. felis transmission was likely. Results of both models indicated a high probability of C. felis from central Oklahoma to south-central Missouri. However, other predicted areas of C. felis occurrence varied between the two modeling approaches. Modeling the vertebrate reservoir and the tick vector predicted a broader possible distribution compared to modeling cases of C. felis infection in domestic cats. Our results suggest that C. felis is likely to extend beyond areas predicted by case modeling due to the presence of both the vector and reservoir.";"Mueller, Elisha K.

As we hypothesize that these variables may impact both, farm profit and efficiency in alternative ways, we develop four different stochastic frontier and inefficiency effect models by shifting some of these variables from the inefficiency model into the profit function. The underlining reason is to know the impact of different combination of these structural variables on farm profit and efficiency. Our analysis shows that there exist high levels of inefficiency among the sample farms. Among the variables influencing efficiency, the most pronounced effects are observed with land fragmentation, land ownership and crop diversity. Land fragmentation is positively and significantly associated with inefficiency, whereas land ownership and crop diversity is negatively and significantly associated with inefficiency. In addition land fragmentation can also have a significant negative effect on farm profit. We further find that smaller farms appear to have lower inefficiencies than larger farms due to the more efficient use of inputs by the former category. Importantly, when a farmer owns a failed well, this also contributes to the inefficiency, since well failure increases cost of irrigation. Further the average profit efficiencies are higher for unfragmented farms, large farms, owner operated farms and farms with a diversified cropping pattern as compared with their counterparts. Knowledge on the factors influencing farm profit and efficiency is crucial for policy makers and extension agents for improving efficiency levels of the groundwater irrigated farms especially in water scarce regions of the country.";"Manjunatha, A.V.

At a regional scale, models containing only correlates of land cover suggested a far wider distribution of suitable habitat in north-east Africa than the area actually occupied. However, models including only climate variables predicted the known distribution almost perfectly, and suggested that the species’ area of occupancy is delimited by a pocket of climate that is cooler, dryer and more seasonal than surrounding areas. The predicted probability of occurrence was low outside a narrow range of mean annual temperatures of 17.5–20°C. Within the area predicted to be climatically most suitable, records of Bush-crows were concentrated in 1-km cells of marginally but significantly lower normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicating a preference for areas of lower photosynthetic activity. At a finer spatial scale within a 10-km² intensive study site in the core of the species’ range, nests were located in 30-m cells of higher NDVI but always close to areas of lower NDVI. These areas of lower NDVI comprise open grassland, which standardised observations of individual birds showed to be the main foraging habitat. However, taller vegetation is also necessary for nesting and roosting; the average height of nests from the ground was nearly 5 m. Therefore, the species’ range appears to be defined primarily by a unique climate pocket within which it shows a preference for park-like habitats of grassland interspersed with taller vegetation, largely the result of clearance of vegetation by people and their associated grazers. The diet appeared unspecialised and a wide range of feeding methods was observed. Models estimate the species’ optimal climatic range to cover around 6,000 km², of which perhaps 4,500 km² has suitable land cover. We tentatively estimate the global population to be at least 9,000 breeding pairs, with a potentially larger additional population of non-breeding birds, particularly nest-helpers. Several climate models predict increases in both temperature and precipitation in the southern highlands of Ethiopia. The species’ narrow climatic range suggests that global climate change may therefore pose a serious threat to its long-term survival.";"Donald, Paul F.

"AGRIS:US201500217355";"case study of the Czech agriculture since 1918 in a socio-metabolic perspective – From land reform through nationalisation to privatisation";"";"This article explores the development of the social metabolism of Czech agriculture over the past 80 years and aims to describe the complex agricultural system from a biophysical perspective. As a Central European country, the Czech Republic's political system has experienced a number of turning points and changes in its history. Using the social metabolism concept and the material and energy flow method of analysis this article looks at the system from a biophysical perspective and explores the interactions between the economic system and nature. The present-day Czech Republic and Slovakia (Czechoslovakia before 1993) are successor countries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From 1918 to 1938, the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia) were part of the market-oriented, capitalist and democratic Czechoslovakia, which turned into a socialist centrally planned system in 1948 and then back into a market-oriented economy in 1989. The Czech Republic and Slovakia both joined the European Union in 2004. This article presents selected indicators covering the period between 1920 and the present, indicators such as the fossil energy use, labour in the agro-ecological system (i.e. particularly human and animal labour), domestic extraction (DE), and last but not least the production–energy use ratio, all expressed in units of energy. As a complement, information is also included on land use and the number of agricultural workers and livestock, and on the physical balance of foreign trade for the last ten years of the studied period. These indicators are also linked to political and economic historical events.";"Grešlová Kušková, Petra";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use;land reform";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"SVK;CZE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217355";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.05.009";"";"";"";"592-603"
"AGRIS:US201500217420";"Landowners and conservation markets: Social benefits from two Australian government programs";"";"Market-based approaches to conservation provide two novel policy outcomes. First, they secure public environmental benefits through incentive payments to private landowners to deliver those conservation outcomes that are unlikely to be achieved through regulation. Second, they provide opportunities to influence perceptions, motivations and values, and shift behaviors among landowners towards biodiversity conservation. Here we report on our experiences in engaging private landowners through two large market-based conservation programs funded by the Australian government. The Forest Conservation Fund was run in Tasmania from 2006 to 2009 and protected over 28,000ha of high conservation value forests through contracts with over 125 landowners. The Environmental Stewardship Program was run in temperate south eastern Australia from 2008, targets nationally endangered ecological communities and has so far secured over 45,000ha through contracts with over 260 landowners to improve habitat condition. In total these two programs have, at various stages in their implementation, engaged with over 1400 landowners. Participating landowners benefited from their engagement in three major ways. Firstly, landowner appreciation that their land had both production and commercial conservation values grew, as did their interest in better understanding these values and their measurement. Secondly, was the flow of information to build capacity through improved awareness, knowledge transfers and skills development. Effective landholder engagement was strengthened by targeted communications and information support. Landowners received detailed information on the ecology of their properties, and workshops and on-site field surveys provided practical exposure that filled a conservation information and extension void. Some landowners who had been unsuccessful in bidding for funding said they would change aspects of their land management because of what they learned. Thirdly was a group of benefits associated with property planning and management. The competitive and commercial nature of these two programs prompted many landholders to think more about the mix of revenue and cost drivers for their enterprise, and in particular those associated with new conservation market opportunities. Participation encouraged many landholders to redesign their properties into production and conservation zones that supported improved management for both productive and conservation outcomes. These observations suggest that participation in market-based conservation programs encourage social learning and build social capital in ways that can facilitate additional positive biodiversity outcomes on private land. The effectiveness of biodiversity conservation policies and programs would be strengthened by the inclusion of specific social outcomes.";"Zammit, Charlie";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land management;landowners";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217420";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.01.011";"";"";"";"11-16"
"AGRIS:US201500217350";"Beyond fragmentation and disconnect: Networks for knowledge exchange in the English land management advisory system";"";"The growing multifunctionality in agriculture, combined with privatisation of previously public agricultural extension services, has resulted in a pluralistic land management advisory system. Despite benefits in terms of increased client orientation and greater advisor diversity, it is argued that these changes have resulted in the fragmentation of the land management advisory system and a reduction of interaction within the advisory system and between the advisory system and science. Hence, concerns have been voiced as regards the capacity of the advisory system to be able to incorporate new knowledge, resulting in a growing interest in how advisors obtain and construct the knowledge necessary for offering adequate advisory services to their clients. In this article we explore how advisors within the English land management advisory system (land agents, applied ecologists and veterinarians) develop and optimise their knowledge by engaging in different kinds of networks (centralised, distributed and decentralised), each of which employs a different type of social capital. Key findings suggest that to obtain the knowledge needed to solve complex queries of clients, advisors use distributed networks and draw upon informal ‘communities of practice’ within their own advisory profession characterised by bonding social capital, but also draw upon broader ‘networks of practice’ involving multiple advisors from different advisory professions, which rely on bridging social capital. The employment of decentralised networks which rely on linking social capital, to solve complex queries or develop new services, for example through contacts with scientific institutes, appears to be less developed, despite brokering activities of the professional associations. Whereas fragmentation and disconnect due to competition and epistemological differences do play a role; they do not appear to prevent overall knowledge exchange among advisors within and across different professions. Assumptions of a collapse of interaction within the land management advisory system are not supported by the evidence, as there appears to be much bonding and bridging social capital. However, to optimise interactions between professions, and between advisors and the science system, either informal brokers or formal brokers in the form of professional associations or other organisations could play a bigger role.";"Klerkx, Laurens

"AGRIS:US201500217423";"Land institutions and supply chain configurations as determinants of soybean planted area and yields in Brazil";"";"Soybean production has become a significant force for economic development in Brazil. It has also received considerable attention from environmental and social non-governmental organizations as a driver of deforestation and land consolidation. While many researchers have examined the impacts of soybean production on human and environmental landscapes, there has been little investigation into the economic and institutional context of Brazilian soybean production or the relationship between soy yields and planted area. This study examines the influence of land tenure, land use policy, cooperatives, and credit access on soy production in Brazil. Using county level data we provide statistical evidence that soy planted area and yields are higher in regions where cooperative membership and credit levels are high, and cheap credit sources are more accessible. This result suggests that soybean production and profitability will increase as supply chain infrastructure improves in the Cerrado and Amazon biomes in Brazil. The yields of competing land uses, wheat, coffee, and cattle production and a complementary use, corn production, also help to determine the location of soybean planted area in Brazil. We do not find a significant relationship between land tenure and planted area or land tenure and yields. Soy yields decline as transportation costs increase, but planted area as a proportion of arable land is highest in some of the areas with very high transportation costs. In particular, counties located within Mato Grosso and counties within the Amazon biome have a larger proportion of their arable, legally available land planted in soy than counties outside of the biome. Finally, we provide evidence that soy yields are positively associated with planted area, implying that policies intending to spare land through yield improvements could actually lead to land expansion in the absence of strong land use regulations. While this study focuses on Brazil, the results underscore the importance of understanding how supply chains influence land use associated with cash crops in other countries.";"Garrett, Rachael D.

Against this background the introduction of an animal welfare label is being intensively discussed in Europe. In choosing a market-based instrument to take these concerns into account, normative judgments are made about the formation of preferences, the value system that is implicitly assumed, and the distribution of property rights. From the perspective of classical institutional economics it can be shown that the introduction of a label as an institutional change does not redefine institutions in a way that allows them to consider the interests of animals for their own sake. Rather, the label only redefines the property rights that humans have over animals. The market segregation into privileged and normal animals conflicts with the idea of equality between sentient animals. Within the group of humans only the interests of those who act on markets count. The commodification of their moral concerns assumes that people always decide based on their own interests, which can be traded off. The lexicographical ordering of preferences, which occurs when humans view animals as entities with rights, is not compatible with the normative assumptions of markets. Furthermore, interpreting animal suffering as market failure that can be corrected by labeling impedes a reasoned dialog within the society about the values and beliefs that serve as a basis for preference formation. Thus, an animal welfare label cannot replace a fundamental societal debate about legal standards on animal well-being.";"Pirscher, Frauke";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600090047";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-015-9592-5";"";"";"";"67-80"
"AGRIS:US201500217429";"Securing rural land transactions in Africa. An Ivorian perspective";"";"A good deal of research has highlighted the surge and development of rural land sales and tenancy contracts in West Africa. However, the commoditization of land, especially through sales, does not appear to be obvious, as land transactions appear to be a major source of tenure insecurity and land conflicts. This issue is linked with the broader issue of identification and recognition of both the land rights that are being transferred and people holding them. This article deals with tensions and conflicts in land transactions in Côte d’Ivoire and discusses how these transactions might be secured in a context where most transactions occur outside the legal framework. The 1998 Law aims to organise a rapid transition towards private property rights through a nationwide certification and titling program. Due to the socio-political situation, it was only in 2010 that the first certificates were issued and even independently of current political turmoil, there are grounds for doubting the effective implementation of the law. The objective of this article is to consider the issue of securing land transactions in the pre-certification/titling context, drawing from the author's intensive field research on land transactions in Côte d’Ivoire. A first section describes the main types of rural land transactions in Côte d’Ivoire. The second section outlines the sources of tensions and conflicts arising from these transactions. The third section assesses the practices that have emerged spontaneously in rural areas to secure transactions. The fourth section considers the needs and conditions for a public intervention regarding the security of land transactions.";"Colin, Jean-Philippe";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"property rights;land rights;rural development;rural areas";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217429";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.08.006";"";"";"";"430-440"

Models indicate that warming from carbon emissions associated with land cover conversion have been partially offset if not outweighed by cooling from elevated albedo, but considerable uncertainty remains partly because of uncertainty in model treatments of albedo. This study incorporates a new spatially and temporally explicit, land-cover specific albedo product derived from MODIS with historical land use dataset (Land Use Harmonization product; Hurtt et al., 2006) to provide more precise, observationally-derived estimates of albedo impacts from anthropogenic land-cover change. The mean annual global albedo increase due to land-cover change during 1700-2005 was estimated as 0.0012, mainly driven by snow exposure due to land-cover transitions from natural vegetation to agriculture. This translates to a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative cooling of -0.23 W m-2. Our estimate of radiative forcing from land cover change is slightly higher than other recent estimates based on MODIS albedo products, and at the higher end of the IPCC AR5 range of -0.25 to -0.05 W/m2.";"Ghimire, Bardan

"AGRIS:US201500014934";"approach for the long-term 30-m land surface snow-free albedo retrieval from historic Landsat surface reflectance and MODIS-based a priori anisotropy knowledge";"";"Land surface albedo has been recognized by the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) as an essential climate variable crucial for accurate modeling and monitoring of the Earth’s radiative budget. While global climate studies can leverage albedo datasets from MODIS, VIIRS, and other coarse-resolution sensors, many applications in heterogeneous environments can benefit from higher-resolution albedo products derived from Landsat. We previously developed a “MODIS-concurrent” approach for the 30-meter albedo estimation which relied on combining post-2000 Landsat data with MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) information. Here we present a “pre-MODIS era” approach to extend 30-m surface albedo generation in time back to 1980s through an a priori anisotropy Look-Up Table (LUT) built up from the high quality MCD43A BRDF estimates over representative homogenous regions. Each entry in the LUT reflects a unique combination of land cover type, terrain information, time of year, disturbance age and type, and Landsat optical spectral bands. An initial conceptual LUT created for the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States provides BRDF shapes estimated from MODIS observations for undisturbed and disturbed surface types, including recovery trajectories of burned areas and non-fire disturbances. With the assumption of invariant BRDF shape for consistent land covers, the spectral white-sky and black-sky albedos are derived through albedo-to-reflectance ratios as a bridge between Landsat and MODIS scale. A further narrow-to-broadband conversion based on radiative transfer simulation is adopted to produce the broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. We evaluate the accuracy of produced Landsat albedo using available field measurements at forested AmeriFlux stations in the PNW region and examine the consistency of surface albedo generated by this approach respectively with that from “concurrent” approach and the coincident MODIS operational surface albedo products. Using the tower measurements as reference, the Landsat 30-m snow-free shortwave broadband albedo yields an absolute accuracy of 0.02 with a root mean square error less than 0.016 and a bias no more than 0.007. A further cross-comparison over individual maps shows that the retrieved white sky shortwave albedo from the “pre-MODIS era” LUT approach is highly consistent (R2=0.988, the scene-averaged low RMSE=0.009 and bias=-0.005) with that generated by the earlier “concurrent” approach, and exhibits more detailed landscape texture and wider dynamic range of albedo value than the coincident 500-m MODIS operational products (MCD43A3), especially in the heterogeneous regions. Collectively, the “pre-MODIS” LUT and “concurrent” approaches provide a practical way to retrieve long-term Landsat albedo since 1980s from historic Landsat archives as well as the on-going Landsat-8 mission, and support investigation on albedo evolution of terrestrial biomes at fine resolution.";"Shuai, Yanmin

Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived ‘higher-level’ Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies.

The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is integrated in the framework. Compared to earlier implementations of STARFM, several improvements have been incorporated in the operational data fusion framework. These include viewing angular correction on the MODIS daily bidirectional reflectance, precise and automated co-registration on MODIS and Landsat pair images, and automatic selection of Landsat and MODIS pair date. Three tests that use MODIS and Landsat data pair from the same season of the same year, the same season of the different year, and the different season from an adjacent year have been performed over a Landsat scene using the integrated STARFM operational framework. The results show that the accuracy of the predicted results depends on the data consistencies between the MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) -Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and Landsat surface reflectance on both the pair date and prediction date. Case studies were focused on monitoring vegetation condition in central India and the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region. In general, spatial and temporal variations of the landscape can be identified with a high level of detail from the fused data. Vegetation index trajectories derived from the fused products can be associated with specific land cover types that occur in the study regions.

Land tenure systems in the 'communal areas' of South Africa are described as dynamic and evolving regimes within which a number of important commonalities and continuities over time are observable. Key underlying principles of pre-colonial land relations are identified, which informed the adaptation and modification of tenure regimes in the colonial era and under policies of segregation and apartheid, and continue to do so today. Exploring the policy implications of this analysis, the article suggests that alternative approaches to that embodied in the Communal Land Rights Act are required.

The eddy covariance technique was applied at two different sites with distinct land forms within an urbanizing mountain basin. One site was located in a suburban neighborhood with substantial mature vegetative cover (urban forest), prototypical of many residential neighborhoods in the valley, and the other site was in a pre-urban area. Results indicate that the suburban site was a net sink of CO₂ during the midday period in the summer due to photosynthetic activity and was a source of CO₂ during the evening and nighttime periods. The pre-urban site was a net source of CO₂ with positive fluxes throughout the day. Even though the vegetation at the suburban site sequestered carbon dioxide during the daytime in the summer months, the daily net CO₂ flux remained positive (i.e. a net source). In addition, the net CO₂ emission at the suburban site was found to be three times greater in the fall than during summer. The vegetative cover around the suburban site also had a significant impact on the partitioning of the surface energy fluxes. During the summer months, the contribution of the latent heat flux was substantially higher at the suburban site, while the sensible heat flux was much larger at the pre-urban site. The general behavior of the energy and CO₂ fluxes are consistent with typical climate modification due to urbanization in semi-arid climates (i.e. introduction of an urban forest), but quite different from changes reported in more mesic climates where highly vegetated regions are replaced with urban surfaces.";"Ramamurthy, Prathap

"AGRIS:US201600099920";"Climatic and land cover influences on the spatiotemporal dynamics of Holocene boreal fire regimes";"";"Although recent climatic warming has markedly increased fire activity in many biomes, this trend is spatially heterogeneous. Understanding the patterns and controls of this heterogeneity is important for anticipating future fire regime shifts at regional scales and for developing land management policies. To assess climatic and land cover controls on boreal forest fire regimes, we conducted macroscopic‐charcoal analysis of sediment cores and GIS analysis of landscape variation in south‐central Alaska, USA. Results reveal that fire occurrence was highly variable both spatially and temporally over the past seven millennia. At two of four sites, the lack of distinct charcoal peaks throughout much of this period suggests the absence of large local fires, attributed to abundant water bodies in the surrounding landscape that have likely functioned as firebreaks to limit fire spread. In contrast, distinct charcoal peaks suggest numerous local fires at the other two sites where water bodies are less abundant. In periods of the records where robust charcoal peaks allow identification of local‐fire events over the past 7000 years, mean fire return intervals varied widely with a range of 138–453 years. Furthermore, the temporal trajectories of local‐fire frequency differed greatly among sites and were statistically independent. Inferred biomass burning and mean summer temperature in the region were not significantly correlated prior to 3000 years ago but became positively related subsequently with varying correlation strengths. Climatic variability associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, along with the expansion of flammable Picea mariana forests, probably have heightened the sensitivity of forest burning to summer temperature variations over the past three millennia. These results elucidate the patterns and controls of boreal fire regime dynamics over a broad range of spatiotemporal scales, and they imply that anthropogenic climatic warming and associated land cover changes, in particular lake drying, will interact to affect boreal forest burning over the coming decades.";"Barrett, Carolyn M.

From the land-cover proportions, a hard land-cover map can be predicted at sub-pixel spatial resolution using super-resolution mapping techniques. It has been demonstrated that the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) provides a suitable method for super-resolution mapping. To increase the detail and accuracy of the sub-pixel land-cover map, supplementary information at an intermediate spatial resolution can be used. In this research, panchromatic (PAN) imagery was used as an additional source of information for super-resolution mapping. Information from the PAN image was captured by a new PAN reflectance constraint in the energy function of the HNN. The value of the new PAN reflectance constraint was defined based on forward and inverse models with local end-member spectra and local convolution weighting factors. Two sets of simulated and degraded data were used to test the new technique. The results indicate that PAN imagery can be used as a source of supplementary information to increase the detail and accuracy of sub-pixel land-cover maps produced by super-resolution mapping from land-cover proportion images.";"Nguyen, Quang Minh

For each of these sites, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) satellite data were acquired for the years 1990 and 2000. A dot grid visual interpretation was used to assess land-cover change between the two dates in each of the sites. With only two acquisition dates, we found that these data were insufficient for accurately determining land-cover change and degradation in arid areas where non-woody biomass dominates. We were nevertheless able to detect land-cover modifications in three areas: increases in agriculture on the coastal plain near Mogadishu, increases in agriculture at the western fringes of our study area where there is higher rainfall, and finally a reduction in woodlands and shrublands in areas close to refugee camps on the Somali–Kenya border.";"Brink, Andreas Bernhard

"AGRIS:US201400106823";"predictive modelling technique for human population distribution and abundance estimation using remote-sensing and geospatial data in a rural mountainous area in Kenya";"";"This study presents a predictive modelling technique to map population distribution and abundance for rural areas in Africa. Prediction models were created using a generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction (GRASP) method that uses the generalized additive model (GAM) regression technique. Dwelling unit presence–absence was mapped from airborne images covering 98 km² (30% of the study area) and used as a response variable. Remote-sensing-based (reflectance, texture and land cover) and geospatial (topography, climate and distance) data were used as predictors. For the rest of the study area (228 km²; 70%), GAM models were extrapolated, and prediction maps constructed. Model performance was measured as explanatory power (adj.D², adjusted deviance change), predictive power (area under the receiver operator curve, AUC) and kappa value (κ). GAM models explained 19–31% of the variation in dwelling-unit occurrence and 28–47% of the variation in human population abundance. The predictive power for population distribution GAM models was good (AUC of 0.80–0.86). This study shows that for the prediction of dwelling-unit distribution and for human population abundance, the best modelling performance was achieved using combined geospatial- and remote-sensing-based predictor variables. The best predictors for modelling the variability in human population distribution using combined predictors were angular second moment image-texture measurement, precipitation, mean elevation, surface reflectance for Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, correlation image-texture measurement and distance to roads, respectively. The population-abundance modelling result was compared with two existing global population datasets: Gridded Population of the World version 3 (GPWv3) and LandScan 2005. The result showed that for regional and local-scale population-estimation probability, models created using remotely sensed and geospatial data were superior compared to GPWv3 or LandScan 2005 data products. Population models had high correlation with Kenyan population census data for 1999 in mountainous sub-locations and low correlation for sub-locations that also extended into the lowlands.";"Siljander, M.

We identified federal and state land ownership in relation to the darter's distribution and provided quantitative estimates of abundance of the species. We also quantified sex ratio and mean size of males and females, summarized abiotic and physical characteristics of streams supporting the species, and characterized the fish assemblage most often associated with the Yazoo Darter. Yazoo Darters are generally limited to headwater streams, have a female-skewed sex ratio, and have larger males than females. Individuals in the Yocona River drainage are larger than in the Little Tallahatchie River drainage. Abundance was highly variable among streams within the two major drainages, but was similar within and between drainages. Yazoo Darter habitat in the Little Tallahatchie River drainage has some protection because many streams supporting this species are on land managed by federal or state agencies. Streams with Yazoo Darters are far less common in the Yocona River drainage, have almost no protection, and face growing pressure from urban expansion. For these reasons, management action is urgently needed for Yocona River populations.";"Sterling, Ken A.

"AGRIS:US201301723425";"comparative assessment of land cover dynamics of three protected forest areas in tropical eastern Africa";"";"Processes of deforestation, known to threaten tropical forest biodiversity, have not yet been studied sufficiently in East Africa. To shed light on the patterns and causes of human influences on protected forest ecosystems, comparisons of different study areas regarding land cover dynamics and potential drivers are needed. We analyze the development of land cover since the early 1970s for three protected East African rainforests and their surrounding farmlands and assess the relationship between the observed changes in the context of the protection status of the forests. Processing of Landsat satellite imagery of eight or seven time steps in regular intervals results in 12 land cover classes for the Kakamega-Nandi forests (Kenya) and Budongo Forest (Uganda) whereas ten are distinguished for Mabira Forest (Uganda). The overall classification accuracy assessed for the year 2001 or 2003 is similarly high for all three study areas (81% to 85%). The time series reveal that, despite their protection status, Kakamega-Nandi forests and Mabira Forest experienced major forest decrease, the first a continuous forest loss of 31% between 1972/1973 and 2001, the latter an abrupt loss of 24% in the late 1970s/early 1980s. For both forests, the temporally dense time series show short-term fluctuations in forest classes (e.g., areas of forest regrowth since the 1980s or exotic secondary bushland species from the 1990s onwards). Although selectively logged, Budongo Forest shows a much more stable forest cover extent. A visual overlay with population distribution for all three regions clearly indicates a relationship between forest loss and areas of high population density, suggesting population pressure as a main driver of deforestation. The revealed forest losses due to local and commercial exploitation further demonstrate that weak management impedes effective forest protection in East Africa.";"Lung, Tobias

These include rationalizing the cleanup process and decreasing cleanup costs, promoting economic development in the local communities that host Superfund sites, and helping such communities exercise more control over the cleanups. However, interviews with Superfund stakeholders and a detailed case study call into question these arguments. The current role of land use in cleanup, uncertainties about whether economic development is likely at the bulk of Superfund sites, the long-run viability of institutional controls, the willingness of communities to accept cleanups that leave contamination on-site, and the nature of public involvement all suggest that the benefits of tying land use to remedy selection may not be so straight forward.";"Wernstedt, Kris

"AGRIS:US201600186350";"Simple Approaches to Improve Restoration of Coastal Sage Scrub Habitat in Southern California";"";"Much of the coastal sage scrub habitat in Southern California that existed prior to European settlement has been developed for human uses. Over the past two to three decades, public agencies and land conservation organizations have worked to acquire some of the remaining lands for preservation. Many of these lands are degraded by past intensive livestock grazing, farming, and frequent fires, and the native flora has been replaced by weedy, exotic annual grasses and forbs, mostly of Mediterranean origin. Restoration of native flora is challenging and there are few successful examples to provide guidance on effective methods. Cost is also an important and prohibitive factor. Competition from weeds is one of the most difficult impediments to establishing native vegetation, which often persists in the seedbank. We compared annual applications of the nonselective herbicide glyphosate over multiple years, followed by a final year with the grass-specific fluazifop, as a simple, low cost method of reducing the exotic seedbank sufficiently to allow native vegetation to establish. This approach was combined with seeding native forbs, herbaceous perennials, and shrubs in one half of each treatment plot. Herbicide treatments were made in the spring each year from 2006 to 2010, and were combined with weed trimming in 2010 and 2011 to remove exotic forb inflorescences, and raking to remove litter. In 2010, native plant cover in herbicide-treated plots was about 50%, consisting of 43 species, compared to <5% cover in the control plots. Most of the native plants came from the existing seedbank, and very few from the seed mix. A cost analysis showed that a once-yearly herbicide treatment was as effective as one application plus spot spraying or hand inflorescence trimming, and is more cost-effective than hand weed control and raking for restoration.";"Bell, Carl E.

"AGRIS:US201300832444";"Changing patterns of water distribution under the influence of land reforms and simultaneous WUA establishment";"";"In 2005 the Uzbek government accelerated the dissolution process of collective farms through full-scale land reform. As the central production unit, the collective enterprise was supplanted by a private, family-based enterprise. Simultaneously Water Users Associations (WUAs) were established that operate and maintain the irrigation and drainage infrastructure of the former collective farms. Though these land-cum-water reforms could in principle initiate enormous changes, there is still a strong continuity due to the state-regulated agricultural system. Although officially only cotton and wheat production are still subject to a state order system, the whole agricultural production is still under strict state control. This paper builds on research conducted during the spring and summer of 2005 and 2006 in the oasis of Khorezm, Uzbekistan. Through field walks in combination with semi- and non-structured interviews, two cases of water management at former collective farm (FCF) level were distinguished: one at the onset of reform and one two years after full-scale reforms. The former shows the strong interlinkage at FCF level between the control of agricultural production and water management. However, the second case shows that even in the post-reform context, where the co-ordination of production and the control of cropping areas are formally no longer arranged at this level, these functions are informally reproduced through the new institutions. The WUA forms a crucial link between privatised producers and a state preoccupied with control.";"Veldwisch, Gert Jan";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"UZB";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300832444";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10795-007-9017-3";"";"";"";"265-276"

Overseas studies have generated a curve with optimum levels of allocation which maximise the economic return to the community from the resource. The study on which this paper is based used a single case study to model the individual and regional economic outcomes for four scenarios of water allocation, using daily time step simulation models of the hydrological, irrigation, farm and financial systems over the 1973 – 2000 period.

"AGRIS:US201400138404";"abundance of rare tree species in remnant forests across the Visayas, Philippines";"";"In several tropical regions of the world, formerly widespread forests have been reduced to scattered remnants, and many tree species are becoming increasingly endangered. Knowledge on the population status of rare species is essential to inform conservation efforts and, in particular, the use of native species for reforestation projects stemming from emerging land-use strategies. We studied 20 mostly red-listed native species in remnant forests on five limestone-, four volcanic- and one ultramafic site(s) across the Visayas in the Philippines, with 40 plots being assessed at each site. Seventeen of the species showed a median density of less than two trees per hectare, with ten species showing median densities of zero due to low species frequency, although some had higher local densities. One species (Dracontomelon edule) was not encountered at all, while two other species (Dipterocarpus validus and Dracontomelon dao) were only encountered as singletons. Six species were confined to limestone sites and showed associations with other better-known limestone specialists. The other study species occurred at both site types. Four of the species showed significant relationships between stem density, soil pH and stand basal area. The particular rarity of the majority of the species calls for immediate conservation measures to be adopted to protect species and associated remnant forests. In addition to legal measures such as the designation of remnant forests as protected areas, we recommend the establishment of mixed native forest stands giving due regard to the species associations and site characteristics identified in this study.";"Peque, Dennis

However, given the inherent inadequacies of these PAs to cater for all species in conjunction with the effects of climate change and human pressures on PAs, the future of biodiversity depends heavily on the 88� % of land that is unprotected. The study of biodiversity patterns and the processes that maintain them in human-modified landscapes can provide a valuable evidence base to support science-based policy-making that seeks to make land outside of PAs as amenable as possible for biodiversity persistence. We discuss the literature on biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa’s human-modified landscapes as it relates to four broad ecosystem categorizations (i.e. rangelands, tropical forest, the Cape Floristic Region, and the urban and rural built environment) within which we expect similar patterns of biodiversity persistence in relation to specific human land uses and land management actions. Available research demonstrates the potential contribution of biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes within all four ecosystem types and goes some way towards providing general conclusions that could support policy-making. Nonetheless, conservation success in human-modified landscapes is hampered by constraints requiring further scientific investment, e.g. deficiencies in the available research, uncertainties regarding implementation strategies, and difficulties of coexisting with biodiversity. However, information currently available can and should support efforts at individual, community, provincial, national, and international levels to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes.";"Trimble, Morgan J.

"AGRIS:US2016208318";"Optimal Preservation of Agricultural and Environmental Land within a Municipality Under Irreversibility and Uncertainty";"";"This paper analyzes the optimal policy choice for the conservation of privately owned openspace when future land cover types are uncertain. Policymakers must use land use policies tomake conservation decisions under uncertainty over the social benefits of future vegetation, dueto the uncertain effects of climate change on suitable habitat ranges. If policymakers fail toaccount for future information gains when designing land use policies, expected social welfaremay not be maximized. To examine this situation, I consider three policy instruments: urbangrowth boundaries (UGB), location-independent development fees (LIF), and location-dependentdevelopment fees (LDF). I analyze them in a spatial-dynamic model in which climate change istreated as a land use externality with an uncertain future value. I derive the privately and sociallyoptimal land allocations under open-loop and closed-loop control. By comparing the privatelyand socially optimal land allocations for each control problem, I identify the optimal trajectory ofeach instrument over time. Results depend on whether or not there is a cumulative externalityfrom urban development. When no cumulative externality exists, welfare-maximizing UGB andLIF depend on the control problem. In contrast, LDF are identical in expectation across the twocontrol problems. As a consequence, LDF are the first best policy when landowners do andpolicymakers do not anticipate (or cannot respond to) the future availability of climaticinformation. When a cumulative externality exists, none of the policies are robust to the type ofcontrol problem, including LDF, and only UGB are time consistent. Therefore, UGB are thefirst best policy when policymakers anticipate future climatic information and there is acumulative externality. This work implies that conservation programs should amend currentmethods for ranking conservation choices to account for future ecosystem movement, and returnlands to other uses if climate change causes conservation goals to not be achieved.

Debates tend to focus around what proportion of the annual harvest should be devoted to markets opposed to long-term contracts. To give a guide to policy makers, we surveyed forest firms from New Zealand and Sweden where this decision is based purely on a commercial basis. On average, mills source fifty percent of their fibre from the market. However, using a fractional logit model, we test whether theories from transaction cost economics influence this decision.

"AGRIS:US201400156622";"Comparison and analysis of agricultural and forest land changes in typical agricultural regions of northern mid-latitudes";"";"The northeastern China, the United States, and the western Europe are important agricultural regions both on the global and regional scales. The western Europe has a longer history of agricultural land development than the eastern United States. These two regions have changed from the deforestation and reclamation phase in the past to the current land abandonment and reforestation phase. Compared with the two regions, large-scale land exploitation has only been practiced in the northeastern China during the last century. After a short high-intensity deforestation and reclamation period, agricultural and forest lands are basically in a dynamic steady state. By comparing domestic and international agro-forestry development and considering the ecological environment and socio-economic benefits that can be derived from agro-forestry, this paper suggests that large area of reforestation would be inevitable in future though persistent and large agricultural demand in coming decades even more. And local reforestation at slope farmland with ecological vulnerability should be imperative at present to avoid severer damage. At the same time, from the perspective of Land Change Science, the results demonstrate that the research on land use change in the agro-forestry ecotone is typical and critical, particularly those dealing with the analysis of spatial and temporal characteristics and the simulation of climate, hydrology, and other environmental effects.";"Liu, Tingxiang

It addresses the question of whygroup ranch members would demand individualized property systems, but then turnagainst the outcome. In addressing this puzzle the paper discusses the process of landallocation and distribution during group ranch subdivision. It examines who the mainactors were during subdivision, their degree of latitude in crafting and changing rules,and the interactions between Maasai and state institutions. Findings suggest that, becausethe process by which property rights change is so intertwined with politics, we may needto move beyond economic models of relative price changes and state enforcement inorder to better understand such transitions. Models that accommodate competition byactors and the possibility that state actors may not provide the arbitration or enforcementthat is often taken for granted are more useful for analyzing the complexities of shiftingproperty rights. When the possibility for conflict and competition is factored into theproperty rights equation, the relative gains from privatizing/individualizing may not be aslarge or as obvious as anticipated.";"Mwangi, Esther";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"property rights;commons;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KEN";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016222599";"http://purl.umn.edu/42510";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500209616";"Recent decadal growth of the Atchafalaya River Delta complex: Effects of variable riverine sediment input and vegetation succession";"";"The Mississippi River Delta Plain has experienced substantial wetland loss from subsidence, erosion, and sea level rise, threatening coastal communities and the ecosystems that support them. The Atchafalaya River, the largest distributary of the Mississippi River, has one of the few prograding delta features along the ~200-km deltaic coastline. Understanding changes in the Atchafalaya River Delta complex (ARDC) development has critical implications for future prediction and management strategy for the Mississippi River Delta Plain. This study was organized to answer two major questions: (1) how did development of the ARDC respond to fluctuation in riverine sediment supply over the period 1989–2010, and (2) has vegetation succession helped stabilize subaerial land? The study quantified annual total suspended sediment yields to the two ARDC subdeltas—Atchafalaya River subdelta (ARSD) and Wax Lake outlet subdelta (WLSD)—classified delta land cover using satellite imagery over ~5-year intervals into three classes: barren land, vegetation, and open water and investigated the relationship of delta land change with sediment yield and vegetation succession. Over the entire 21-year study period, we found a net land gain of 59km², with the ARSD accounting for 58% of this gain and WLSD 42%. Sediment yield to the subdeltas decreased from an average annual of 38megatonnes (MT) for ARSD and 18 MT for WLSD during 1989–1995 to an average annual of 24MT for ARSD and 17MT for WLSD during 2004–2010, corresponding to the decrease in riverine suspended sediment concentration. Concurrently, total land growth rate decreased from 2.4km²y⁻¹ to 1.6km²y⁻¹ for ARSD and 3.2km²y⁻¹ to 0.6km²y⁻¹ for WLSD. However, the ARDC had a net land loss of 2.1km² during 1999–2004 because of tropical system effects in conjunction with the lack of large river floods (defined as discharge>13,800m³s⁻¹). On average, more than 60% of newly vegetated land remained vegetated in subsequent years, and when compared with barren areas, vegetated land was less likely (7.3% vs. 32%) to be converted to water, indicating vegetative stabilization effect. However, during the period without a major flood, vegetation buffering against tropical system erosion was limited. This indicates that over the period 1989 to 2010 land growth of the ARDC was dictated by large flood events.";"Rosen, Timothy

Evidence and implications";"";"The diurnal land surface temperature (LST) variation is a primary characteristic of the effects of urbanization. However, no study to date has focused on changes in diurnal LST variation in urban environments. This paper investigates the effects of urbanization on landscape pattern and diurnal LST variation of Taipei City, using MODIS thermal images and SPOT multispectral remote sensing images over the 1994â2010 period. Supervised land-cover classifications were conducted to investigate decadal land-cover changes within the study area. A remote-sensing-based urbanization index was adopted as a quantitative measure of urbanization-induced changes in landscape patterns. Diurnal LST variations were assessed using MODIS Aqua satellite images. We found that the diurnal LST variation increases with the urbanization index, with the adverse effects of urbanization on the diurnal LST variation being more substantial in the earlier stages of urbanization. Increasing diurnal LST variation due to urbanization implies that urbanization is likely to result in a greater increase in urban heat absorption than in thermal inertia. This research provides insightful supporting evidence that measures that can reduce urban heat absorption such as urban parks, community green spaces, green roofs and cool (or permeable) pavements should be given higher priority in mitigating UHI effects.";"Chen, Yen-Ching

"AGRIS:US201301646015";"Managing for rainfall variability: effect of grazing strategy on cattle production in a dry tropical savanna";"";"Rainfall variability is a challenge to sustainable and profitable cattle production in northern Australia. Strategies recommended to manage for rainfall variability, like light or variable stocking, are not widely adopted. This is due partly to the perception that sustainability and profitability are incompatible. A large, long-term grazing trial was initiated in 1997 in north Queensland, Australia, to test the effect of different grazing strategies on cattle production. These strategies are: (i) constant light stocking (LSR) at long-term carrying capacity (LTCC); (ii) constant heavy stocking (HSR) at twice LTCC; (iii) rotational wet-season spelling (R/Spell) at 1.5 LTCC; (iv) variable stocking (VAR), with stocking rates adjusted in May based on available pasture; and (v) a Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) variable strategy, with stocking rates adjusted in November, based on available pasture and SOI seasonal forecasts. Animal performance varied markedly over the 10 years for which data is presented, due to pronounced differences in rainfall and pasture availability. Nonetheless, lighter stocking at or about LTCC consistently gave the best individual liveweight gain (LWG), condition score and skeletal growth; mean LWG per annum was thus highest in the LSR (113 kg), intermediate in the R/Spell (104 kg) and lowest in the HSR (86 kg). Mean LWG was 106 kg in the VAR and 103 kg in the SOI but, in all years, the relative performance of these strategies was dependent upon the stocking rate applied. After 2 years on the trial, steers from lightly stocked strategies were 60-100 kg heavier and received appreciable carcass price premiums at the meatworks compared to those under heavy stocking. In contrast, LWG per unit area was greatest at stocking rates of about twice LTCC; mean LWG/ha was thus greatest in the HSR (21 kg/ha), but this strategy required drought feeding in four of the 10 years and was unsustainable. Although LWG/ha was lower in the LSR (mean 14 kg/ha), or in strategies that reduced stocking rates in dry years like the VAR (mean 18 kg/ha) and SOI (mean 17 kg/ha), these strategies did not require drought feeding and appeared sustainable. The R/Spell strategy (mean 104 kg/ha) was compromised by an ill-timed fire, but also performed satisfactorily. The present results provide important evidence challenging the assumption that sustainable management in a variable environment is unprofitable. Further research is required to fully quantify the long-term effects of these strategies on land condition and profitability and to extrapolate the results to breeder performance at the property level.";"O'Reagain, Peter

In land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities through afforestation and reforestation projects, known as A/R CDM, the deliverables that demonstrate sustainable development remain unclear. While the methods to convincingly demonstrate carbon benefits are fine-tuned, there is growing concern on a lack of socio-economic benefits of the projects. With the criteria for sustainable development left with the national approval process, CDM projects in a medium-income country with transparent criteria may be more supportive to the socio-economic targets of CDM than in a low-income country without further specifications. At national scale, priority areas can be identified on the basis of publicly available data on land cover and the human development index (HDI). In a case study for Indonesia we found that population density between a lower and upper limit, and risks of fire incidence are socio-economic indicators which could further guide choices within the domain of technically eligible lands (without forest cover in 1990). Within the 302 districts across Indonesia covering a land area of around 193 million ha, the eligibility criteria based on the Marrakesh Accord (later called “hard” criteria) identified 47 million ha of land. With additional (later called “soft”) criteria of a population density between 10 and 100 persons km⁻² and a below-average HDI, 17.3 million ha of eligible lands distributed over 53 districts were prioritized. Differences in fire risk lead to a further stratification of clusters of similarity within this priority domain, with CDM possible at high as well as low fire risk, but requiring different types of project. By grouping districts in clusters of overall similarity of land cover, three main clusters with 7.9, 0.7 and 3.7Mha of prioritized eligible lands were identified where pilot activities for CDM may be implemented with higher probability of development benefits and extrapolation potential.";"Murdiyarso, Daniel

An important determinant of ecosystem services provision from European farmland is the amount and spatial arrangement of trees, shrubs and woodlands that are integrated into the respective land-use systems. This paper uses an institutional economics framework for the analysis of payment schemes for ecosystem services (PES schemes) that enhance the establishment, conservation and management of farm trees and woodlands, elaborating on the reasons for the often very reluctant participation of farmers in these schemes. PES schemes in Saxony (Germany) were selected as a typical example. Obstacles identified included high production costs and opportunity costs for land use, contractual uncertainties, land-tenure implications and heterogeneous societal preferences for ecosystem services of farm trees. Further, since scheme adoption has been relatively low compared with the total area covered by the respective farm tree types in Saxony, the PES schemes alone could not explain the substantial increase in number and size of some farm-tree types, in particular hedgerows. Regionalized premiums, result-oriented remuneration and cooperative approaches are options to improve participation in PES schemes for farm trees. The example of PES schemes for farm trees highlights one of the major challenges for the protection and preservation of cultural landscapes: they are man-made and thus need to be preserved, managed and maintained continuously.";"SCHLEYER, CHRISTIAN

Such custodianship is generally lacking among communal rural societies in Africa because of land use policies that overlook the capacity and the practical importance of actively engaging these societies in wildlife management. In Zambia participation by local village communities in this management is recognized as a prerequisite for wildlife development and conservation. This participation is permitted through the administrative management design (called ADMADE) for game management areas. To help improve the capacity of rural communities to become more knowledgeable and effective in managing their wildlife resources, a geographical information system (GIS), based on ARC/INFO software, was applied and tested as an appropriate technology. It was hypothesized that maps composed of easily recognizable information about land use issues affecting the welfare of local residents and their natural resources would facilitate communal societies to make technically improved land use decisions with broadâbased support within the community. Results offered a growing set of achievements in land use planning by local community leaders in support of this hypothesis. Custom designed maps produced by this technology were used by these leaders to explain and build consensus at the community level on ways to resolve resource use conflicts. Results also demonstrated the pragmatic and costâeffective value of training local residents to participate in the collection of GIS data as a way of making maps more locally acceptable and better focused on relevant issues and needs.";"Lewis, Dale M.";"";"Ecological Society of America";"AGRIS";"1995-12-31";"en";"land use planning";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ZMB;002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600186130";"http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2269337";"";"";"";"861-871"

One solution to this issue involves the analysis of historical bison (Bison spp.) jump data. We conducted a literature search of archeological data associated with bison jump sites in North America with the goal of analyzing the data and summarizing historical bison demographics. We identified six locations with adequate information to conduct vertical life-table analyses. Two of the six were Bison antiques, two were Bison occidentalis, and the final two were Bison bison. In five of six analyses, a common annual survival parameter was estimated across all age classes. The most robust data set came from Wardell, Wyoming, where age-class-specific survival parameters best described the data. Average annual survival for the same age classes across all six sites was = 0.7344. These estimates are substantially lower than annual survival estimates of contemporary bison herds. The lower survival estimates produced an estimated finite rate of population change for Pre-Columbian B. bison of = 1.075 compared to contemporary populations that are about 9% higher. Natural Pre-Columbian B. bison populations had a much lower growth potential than contemporary populations due to pressures from apex predators, which are no longer present in current populations. Managers of natural areas interested in maintaining natural bison populations can use our results to help guide culling and other management decisions.";"Clawson, Michael V.

A case study was undertaken following a very destructive wildfire that occurred in Parnitha, Greece, July 2007, for which we acquired satellite images from LANDSAT, ASTER, and IKONOS. Additionally, we created spatially degraded satellite data over a range of coarser resolutions using resampling techniques. The panchromatic (1m) and multispectral component (4m) of IKONOS were merged using the Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening method. This very high-resolution imagery served as the basis to estimate the cover percentage of burned areas, bare land and vegetation at pixel level, by applying the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. Finally, multiple linear regression models were fit to estimate each land-cover fraction as a function of surface reflectance values of the original and the spatially degraded satellite images. The main findings of our research were: (a) the Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) are the most important channels to estimate the percentage of burned area, whereas the NIR and red channels are the most important to estimate the percentage of vegetation in fire-affected areas; (b) when the bi-spectral space consists only of NIR and SWIR, then the NIR ground reflectance value plays a more significant role in estimating the percent of burned areas, and the SWIR appears to be more important in estimating the percent of vegetation; and (c) semi-burned areas comprising 45–55% burned area and 45–55% vegetation are spectrally closer to burned areas in the NIR channel, whereas those areas are spectrally closer to vegetation in the SWIR channel. These findings, at least partially, are attributed to the fact that: (i) completely burned pixels present low variance in the NIR and high variance in the SWIR, whereas the opposite is observed in completely vegetated areas where higher variance is observed in the NIR and lower variance in the SWIR, and (ii) bare land modifies the spectral signal of burned areas more than the spectral signal of vegetated areas in the NIR, while the opposite is observed in SWIR region of the spectrum where the bare land modifies the spectral signal of vegetation more than the burned areas because the bare land and the vegetation are spectrally more similar in the NIR, and the bare land and burned areas are spectrally more similar in the SWIR.";"Pleniou, Magdalini

"AGRIS:US201500073439";"Variable retention silviculture in Tasmania's wet forests: ecological rationale, adaptive management and synthesis of biodiversity benefits";"";"Summary The recognition that biodiversity conservation requires more than a system of reserves has led to the need to consider the outcomes of land management actions, such as timber harvesting, in the matrix land outside reserves. The design of harvesting systems can be guided by the natural disturbance regime, which in Tasmania's lowland wet eucalypt forests is infrequent, intense wildfire. Clearfell, burn and sow silviculture has been used since the 1960s for harvesting these forests but, while this system is practical and effectively regenerates eucalypts in harvested coupes, it is predicted to lead to losses at the coupe level of late-successional species and structures that would survive into stands regenerating following natural wildfire. Variable retention silviculture is thus currently being implemented as an alternative to clearfelling in wet old-growth forest on public land (state forest) in Tasmania. In contrast to clearfelling, variable retention has the explicit ecological goal of maintaining some species, habitats and structural legacies from the pre-harvest forest into the harvested and regenerating stand. This paper synthesises biodiversity findings from the Warra Silvicultural Systems Trial (SST), established in 1997, and demonstrates that aggregated retention is the optimal form of variable retention for ensuring coupe-scale persistence (‘lifeboating’) of mature-forest biodiversity. In addition to providing retained forest, aggregates are also designed to facilitate recolonisation of harvested areas by mature-forest species (‘forest influence’), and to provide connectivity across the forest stand. In the last few years, more than 50 aggregated-retention coupes have been harvested in mature forest across Tasmania. Development and implementation of variable retention in Tasmania is an example of active adaptive management, which we describe in relation to five steps for a formalised adaptive management program, indicating how ecological criteria are incorporated in operational guidelines for implementation of aggregated retention.";"Baker, Susan C.

The surveys were split into two subsets: Canterbury, which is the region with most arable farming in the nation, and the other New Zealand regions. Analysis of the data reveals that Canterbury residents‟ willingness to pay for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from arable farming is greater than their willingness to pay for improvement in water quality, while it is the opposite for residents in other regions. In addition, residents‟ willingness to fund an organic farming project that enhances certain ecosystem services is analyzed. The results provide insights for management of arable lands to deliver selected ecosystem services in New Zealand.";"Takatsuka, Yuki

Variables in the prediction equation included difference between the downtown reference and each of the other sites in upwind tree cover and impervious cover as obtained from 10-m resolution geographic information system (GIS) data. Other predictor variables included an index of atmospheric stability, topographic indices, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit, and antecedent precipitation. The model was used to map predicted hourly Δ [Formula: see text] R₋ₚ across the Baltimore region based on hourly weather data from the airport. Despite the numerous sources of variability in the regression modeling, the method produced reasonable map patterns of Δ [Formula: see text] R₋ₚ that, except for some areas evidently affected by sea breeze from the Chesapeake, closely matched results of mesoscale modeling. Potential applications include predictions of the effect of changing tree cover on air temperature in the area.";"Heisler, Gordon M.

"AGRIS:US201301887757";"Windy Commons";"";"Wind power generation is growing rapidly in the United States, doubling nearly every three years since 1998. Yet, wind is an open access resource, and past experiences with open access resources suggest that tragedies of the commons may occur. While the engineering literature has focused on turbine siting within a wind farm to maximize profits and minimize interaction effects, the economics literature has overlooked interaction effects between windfarms. We provide a qualitative framework for measuring wake externalities and use simulation modeling to determine their magnitude. We find that: a) turbine wake externalities (and thus losses) to downwind sites increase with the square of wind velocity and can be substantial, b) decentralized ownership across wind farms leads to overcapitalization in upwind sites and undercapitalization in downwind sites relative to sole ownership, c) when multiple potential patches are considered, more land will be used upwind for wind power under decentralized ownership, and d) numerical simulations suggest that total rents are reduced under decentralized ownership by up to 12%, while total power produced increases by approximately 10%. Under our central parameters, decentralized ownership may be preferred to a sole owner, depending on the value society places on clean power relative to dirty power.";"Kaffine, Daniel T.

"AGRIS:US201400163421";"Sink or source—The potential of coffee agroforestry systems to sequester atmospheric CO₂ into soil organic carbon";"";"Current carbon accounting methodologies often assume interactions between above-ground and below-ground carbon, without considering effects of land management. We used data from two long-term coffee agroforestry experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to assess the effect on total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of (i) organic versus conventional management, (ii) higher versus moderate agronomic inputs, (iii) tree shade types. During the first nine years of coffee establishment total 0–40cm depth SOC stocks decreased by 12.4% in Costa Rica and 0.13% in Nicaragua. Change in SOC differed consistently amongst soil layers: at 0–10cm SOC stocks increased by 2.14 and 1.26MgCha⁻¹ in Costa Rica and Nicaragua respectively; however much greater reduction occurred at 20–40cm (9.65 and 2.85MgCha⁻¹ respectively). Organic management caused a greater increase in 0–10cm SOC but did not influence its reduction at depth. Effects of shade type were smaller, though heavily pruned legume shade trees produced a greater increase in 0–10cm SOC than unpruned timber trees. No significant differences in SOC stocks were found between shaded and unshaded systems at any depth and SOC was poorly correlated with above-ground biomass stocks highlighting poor validity of “expansion factors” currently used to estimate SOC. SOC stock changes were significantly negatively correlated with initial SOC stock per plot, providing evidence that during establishment of these woody-plant-dominated agricultural systems SOC stocks tend to converge towards a new equilibrium as a function of the change in the quantity and distribution of organic inputs. Therefore it cannot be assumed that tree-based agricultural systems necessarily lead to increases in soil C stocks. While high inputs of organic fertiliser/tree pruning mulch increased surface-layer SOC stocks, this did not affect stocks in deeper soil, where decreases generally exceeded any gains in surface soil. Therefore site- and system-specific sampling is essential to draw meaningful conclusions for climate change mitigation strategies.";"Noponen, Martin R.A.

"AGRIS:US201600089403";"Multiple watershed alterations influence fish community structure in Great Plains prairie streams";"";"Stream fish distributions are commonly linked to environmental disturbances affecting terrestrial landscapes. In Great Plains prairie streams, the independent and interactive effects of watershed impoundments and land cover changes remain poorly understood despite their prevalence and assumed contribution to declining stream fish diversity. We used structural equation models and fish community samples from third‐order streams in the Kansas River and Arkansas River basins of Kansas, USA to test the simultaneous effects of geographic location, terrestrial landscape alteration, watershed impoundments and local habitat on species richness for stream‐associated and impoundment‐associated habitat guilds. Watershed impoundment density increased from west to east in both basins, while per cent altered terrestrial landscape (urbanisation + row‐crop agriculture) averaged ~50% in the west, declined throughout the Flint Hills ecoregion and increased (Kansas River basin ~80%) or decreased (Arkansas River basin ~30%) to the east. Geographic location had the strongest effect on richness for both guilds across basins, supporting known zoogeography patterns. In addition to location, impoundment species richness was positively correlated with local habitat in both basins; whereas stream‐species richness was negatively correlated with landscape alterations (Kansas River basin) or landscape alterations and watershed impoundments (Arkansas River basin). These findings suggest that convergences in the relative proportions of impoundment and stream species (i.e., community structure) in the eastern extent of both basins are related to positive effects of increased habitat opportunities for impoundment species and negative effects caused by landscape alterations (Kansas River basin) or landscape alterations plus watershed impoundments (Arkansas River basin) for stream species.";"Perkin, Joshuah S.

The test was performed on a concave skid trail, where tractor loaded with 8 meter long fir logs stopped at the 32% incline. It stopped somewhat later when skidding with butt-end forward in comparison to skidding with top-end forward. The loadweight with butt-end forward was 31.69 kN, whereas with top-end forward itweighed 33.53 kN. The measured speeds showed minute changes until the last meter, but decreased swiftly after stopping. Regarding some technical parameters, there were almost no changes at the end of stopping, two exceptions being the slip, which increased in the range of stopping, and the forward torque, which decreased in this range. The results showed that the hydrostatic transmission was efficient, considering that in a relatively well-controlled slip (the slip values increase only in the last three meters, which approximately equals the half of tractor's length) there was less grounddamage.";"Marence, J., Ljubljana Univ.

"AGRIS:US201500170918";"Integration of temperature and dust effects in siting large PV power plant in hot arid area";"";"Recently, solar PV technologies witnessed a commercial vigor due to their tremendously decreasing prices. However, these technologies are vulnerable to dust and temperature which can significantly degrade their efficiency. Taking into account, the effect of dust and temperature during the site assessment for large PV power plant will reduce their vulnerability and optimize their operation efficiency. Most of the site assessment for large PV power plants does not take into consideration spatio-temporal variability of dust and temperature effects due to their measurement complexity. This paper presents an original approach of integration of the effects of temperature and dust in siting large PV power plant using Fuzzy logic and GIS-based spatial multi-criteria evaluation. Dynamical downscaling approach of the high resolution COSMO Numerical Weather Prediction model is used to simulate the annual pattern of temperature and the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) is used to retrieve the contamination degree of the air with mineral aerosol. Land suitability analysis for large PV farms implementation is carried out for the case study of Oman. Compared to previous results obtained without temperature and AOD, the new results show that several areas are declassified because of their exposure to high temperature and dust risks. It is noticed that the highly suitable land areas decreased significantly by 81% after considering the temperature and dust constraint layers. Different PV technologies are considered and it is found that the Concentrated Photovoltaics (CPV) technology provides higher potential for implementing large solar plants. In fact, if all highly suitable land is exploited for CPV farms, it can supply more than 750 times the current total power supply in Oman estimated at 16.1 TWh in 2010.";"Charabi, Yassine

"AGRIS:US201600185111";"Applying spatial analysis to the agroecology-led management of an indigenous farm in New Zealand";"";"In Aotearoa New Zealand MÄori land is often owned by communities and managed by trusts. Under communal ownership, trust managers are expected to provide for their communities in culturally responsive ways, using alternative land-related paradigms. In the context of MÄori trust rural land management, geographic information systems (GIS) are seen as a beneficial resource to plan and support important decisions that have community-wide implications. For example, it is much easier to demonstrate visually the putative outcomes of spatial change to large numbers of people with the help of a GIS than it is to verbalise the effects of change. This paper reports on one aspect of such an application to a MÄori trust-owned South Island farm, where a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis of terrain and proximity was conducted using also local botanical knowledge input to indicate optimal areas of growth for traditional medicinal plants. The analysis yielded very useful results, with positive feedback received from the local community. As well as the need to verify the approach empirically, there are plans underway to apply GIS in this way to other similarly-managed farms in Aotearoa New Zealand. However, in order to build a more comprehensive decision support resource for farm management, further plant species need to be modelled, and informed by a wider data set that includes detailed soil data.";"Moore, Antoni

From 1990 to 2006, fish community samples were collected by the North Carolina Division of Water Quality (NCDWQ) at 36 sample sites in the Cape Fear, Lumber, and Yadkin river basins within the Sandhills region of North Carolina. The NCDWQ does not currently have an IBI capable of distinguishing significant differences between reference and non-reference streams. To develop a more robust method of measuring responses to anthropogenic disturbance, we delineated contributing watersheds for each of the 36 sample sites using a geographic information system, hydrologic modeling, and 20-foot-resolution digital elevation models derived from light-detection and ranging data. The 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and in situ habitat data were used to determine various land-use/land-cover and hydrologic variables within each watershed. These variables were then used to select the sites with absolute minimal anthropogenic impacts. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to identify 11 fish-community metrics, 2 chemical metrics, and 9 individual species that were significantly different between reference and non-reference sites. Of the final 15 metrics, only 3 exhibited higher values in reference streams. Our results demonstrate that the abundance and richness of the Sandhills fish fauna are greater in areas more highly impacted by anthropogenic activities. By automating the process by which reference sites are chosen, we were able to produce a multi-metric IBI that reflects the varying levels of anthropogenic impacts on wadeable streams in the Sandhills.";"Hain, Ernie F.

A sampling design stratified by an auxiliary variable correlated with forest cover change has this adaptability. A global stratified random sample can be augmented by additional sample units within a region selected by the same stratified protocol and the resulting sample constitutes a stratified random sample of the region. Stratified sampling allows increasing the sample size in a region by a few to many additional sample units. The additional sample units can be effectively allocated to strata to reduce the standard errors of the regional estimates, even though these strata were not initially constructed for the objective of regional estimation. A complete coverage map of deforestation within the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is used as a population to evaluate precision of regional estimates obtained by augmenting a global stratified random sample. The standard errors of the regional estimates for the BLA and states within the BLA obtained from the augmented stratified design were generally smaller than those attained by simple random sampling and systematic sampling.";"Stehman, Stephen V.

"AGRIS:US201500077735";"hierarchical patch mosaic ecosystem model for urban landscapes: Model development and evaluation";"";"Urbanization effects on ecosystem functions are both important and complex, characterized by scale multiplicity, spatial heterogeneity, and intensive human disturbances. Integrating the hierarchical structure of urban landscape pattern with ecosystem processes through simulation modeling can facilitate our understanding of human–environment interactions in urban environment. Current ecosystem models often focus on plant physiological and biogeochemical processes in homogeneous land covers, incapable of addressing the structural complexity in urban landscapes with multiple anthropogenic drivers across a range of spatial scales. Here we present the Hierarchical Patch Mosaic-Urban Ecosystem Model (HPM-UEM), a multi-scaled model that explicitly treats spatial pattern and hierarchical structure of urban landscape by incorporating both top-down controls and bottom-up mechanisms in urban environment. By addressing six hierarchical levels from individual plant to the urbanized region, HPM-UEM provides a “hierarchical ladder” to scale up local ecosystem functions across the nested urban land hierarchies (i.e., land cover, land use, landscape, and the urbanized region), and facilitate linking ecosystem processes and socioeconomic drivers. By organizing human influences in a spatially nested hierarchical patch mosaic structure, HPM-UEM models the complex spatiotemporal pattern of multiple environmental constraints on urban ecosystem functions. The model was evaluated based on extensive datasets developed by the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, especially the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) LTER. Model testing results showed that HPM-UEM predicted both C fluxes and spatial pattern of C stocks with reasonable accuracy. HPM-UEM enabled us to assess spatial patterns and multiple-scaled dynamics of C cycle of the urban landscape, revealing the distinct productivities and C densities of different urban land types across different spatial scales. Sensitivity analyses indicated that future environmental changes and landscape modifications could have strong and complex effects on urban ecosystem functions. By matching ecological processes, anthropogenic environmental controls, and land and socioeconomic dynamics based on hierarchical levels, HPM-UEM could be coupled to multiple-scaled urban land-use models, climate models, and socioeconomic models to gain a comprehensive understanding of urban biogeochemical cycles.";"Zhang, Chi

Egy ilyen kérdésben mindenre lehet egymással szögesen ellentétes példákat hozni, ha az állapotra koncentrálunk, de ebben az esetben nem az állapot, hanem a folyamat, a tendencia a fontos. ------------------------------------------------ The Editorial Board has invited me to present my opinion on the state of the agro-economy and land ownership. To address the issue, I start from István Kapronczai’s high quality, very detailed paper. I do not think, however, that it is helpful to introduce and contrast in his paper new terms (sustaining capacity, viability, competitiveness) which would warrant a separate analysis themselves, drawing conclusions which cannot be expected to meet general agreement, just like the disputes surrounding the issue of small and large farms. This way it is nothing but a revival of the small farm vs. large farm dispute in a new form. The essence of this is that in developed countries, two to three per cent of the farms stop operating every year, probably due to their poor sustaining capacity and competitiveness – in other words, because they are not viable. The problem here, I think, is that if we focus on these terms, we do not pay attention to the essence of the issue, the essence that has brought about the current situation of the Hungarian agriculture. For a topic like this, one can bring up examples for any opposing point, if we focus on the situation, but in this case the tendency, the process is the important thing rather than the situation.";"Buday-Santha, Attila";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016218494";"http://purl.umn.edu/99139";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016209379";"U.S. BIOMASS SUPPLY FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION:  CLIMATE POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY";"";"This paper investigates three important energy and climate policy issues: (1) the availability of biomass for electricity generation (i.e., supply), (2) climate policy effects on this supply, and (3) the net greenhouse gas reduction when biomass is used for electricity generation. Using a detailed model of U.S. agriculture and forestry markets and land-use, that includes a broad and diverse set of biomass feedstocks, we evaluate competing potential sub-national and feedstock specific supplies of biomass for U.S. electricity generation. Our preliminary results suggest significant supply, with residues dominating at lower delivered energy prices, and dedicated crops significant at higher prices. Sub-national variation is dramatic and will affect generation siting and sustainability. We find displacement of food crops, but net forest land and cropland expansion. We also find that GHG policies could substantially increase the delivered cost of biomass; however, the implications for individual regions and feedstocks is non-uniform, with some supplies falling to zero and others increasing. Finally, we find that bioelectricity is not carbon neutral, but can be emissions reducing relative to coal generation, yield greater direct GHG benefits than biofuels, and even result in domestic indirect emissions reductions with incentives for forest based feedstocks.";"Rose, Steven K.

These are proximity to market, output productivity, and cost efficiency.  In all cases, we identify precise conditions on the production technology such that rental volatility varies in a monotone manner with land quality.  A method of econometric investigation of the relationship between rental volatility and land quality is developed and applied to Iowa cash rents data collected during 1994-2000.

These rights include the rights of sharing in the financial benefits of REDD+, the rights to participate in decision-making around REDD+ schemes, and the rights to have their knowledge about forestry resources respected. Each of these issues depends on the extent to which they have some sort of claim to, or tenure over, tropical rainforests. While the REDD+ Advance Negotiating Text is ‘groundbreaking’ for including references to the rights of indigenous peoples, and local communities, the implementation of these rights requires clarity with respect to the type of tenure which grants property rights in forest carbon.

Spate irrigation systems are more complex due to uncertain flows and can exhibit unexpected changes due to novel shocks. Therefore, actions directed at enhancing robustness to a particular set of disturbances can trigger changes in ecological dynamics that may, in turn, alter the set of disturbances faced by irrigators. This paper looks on the institutional change and resulting water rights and operational rules-in-use in such a context in spate irrigation systems in Punjab province. The sustainability framework (Anderies et al., 2004) has been used for analysis of entities involved in case studies of SESs.

In considering such quantification, it is apparent that investigations must be conducted at different scales and in a comparative manner across regions. At the broader scales it becomes necessary to utilize remote sensing of vegetation for comparative studies against map referenced census data. This paper explores such an approach for the urbanized area in the Tokyo vicinity. Vegetation is represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as determined from data acquired by the thematic mapper (TM) sensor of the Landsat satellite. Sparseness of vegetation is analyzed in relation to density of human residence, first by regression analysis involving stratified distance zones and then by the recent echelon approach for characterization of surfaces. Echelons reveal structural organization of surfaces in an objective and explicit manner. The virtual surface determined by census data collected on a grid is shown to have structural correspondence with the surface representing vegetation greenness as reflected in magnitude of NDVI values computed from red and infrared bands of image data.";"Kurihara, K.

The water supply results from SRM were run through a Southern Idaho reservoir operation and water rights allocation model (MODSIM). The 2030-Dry and 2080-Dry scenarios produce supply deficits relative to the current climate of 5.4%, and 1.9%, respectively, for which the corresponding irrigation water delivery reductions were 1.7% and 2.7%. In contrast, the 2030-Wet, 2030-Mid, 2080-Wet, and 2080-Mid climate change scenarios increased water supply by 13.4%, 0.5%, 19.5%, and 5%, respectively, for which water deliveries increased by 0.41%, 0.04%, 0.34% and 0.14%, respectively.

We aimed to develop shorter koala food and habitat trees for urban areas by heterografting tall eucalypt species onto rootstocks of shorter species and comparing their survival and growth with homografted trees and control ungrafted trees. In total, 12 of 14 interspecific scion/rootstock combinations were grafted successfully in the nursery but graft compatibility and field survival depended on taxonomic relatedness. The six interspecific combinations that had multiple surviving trees at 5 years after planting were all between species within the same taxonomic section or between a species and its own interspecific hybrid. Almost all trees died from grafts between species in different taxonomic sections. In most cases, the height of surviving interspecific grafted trees did not differ from control intraspecific grafted trees or from ungrafted trees of their scion species. Grafting elicited a ‘thrive or not survive’ response that diminished its usefulness for producing shorter trees. However, one combination, E. moluccana/E. behriana, had field survival of 40% and reduced height (4.0m vs 9.9m). These could be valuable habitat trees for koalas and other fauna in urban areas.";"Trueman, Stephen J.

The survey showed that a significant number of commonage users are committed to their farming enterprises, as shown by five proxy indicators: Their readiness to plough their income into their farming enterprises; their sale of livestock; their desire for more land, and their willingness to pay rental to secure such land; their desire to farm on their own; and their desire to own their own land. The paper reflects on the significance of commonage in the context of the South African governments land reform policy, and argues that commonage can transcend survivalist or subsistence production, and can be used as a stepping stone for emergent farmers to access their own land parcels. Finally, the paper argues that, if commonage is to become a key part in a step-up strategy of land reform, then appropriately sized land parcels should be made available for commonage users, to enable them to exit from commonage use and invest in smallholdings or small farms.";"Atkinson, D.

"AGRIS:US201301938740";"Evaluating threats to an endangered species by proxy: air pollution as threat to the blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) in South Africa";"";"Background, aim, and scope The blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) is one of the most threatened bird species in southern Africa. Among terrestrial birds, its plumage is known to be the most water repellent, an adaptation to foraging on the wing in dense fog. Despite this unique adaptation, the nesting success of the blue swallow at the Blue Swallow Natural Heritage Site (BSNHS) is lower during years with high incidence of fog. As the phenomenon is not observed at other nesting sites, we hypothesized that this is due to changes in the air chemistry at the BSNHS. In the immediate proximity of the BSNHS, plantations of exotic trees (e.g., pines and eucalypts), rich in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are dominant features. In addition, air pollution from the Johannesburg area is transported with the surface winds and mix with VOCs released from exotic trees. Together with the high humidity and high elevation, these conditions may result in the formation of sulphonates. Sulphonates are strong detergents, and the presence of these in the fog could lead to decreased water repellence of the plumage. This study was performed in order to determine the occurrence and distribution of sulphonates in the BSNHS and to compare these with sulphonates formed in other locations in South Africa. Because the blue swallow is endangered, pine needles were used as proxy to detect formation of sulphonates. Methods We sampled pine needles with different exposure to air pollutants, in climates with different humidity, and at different elevation and analyzed these for sulphonates using mass spectrometry. Results Pine needles from high elevations and the BSNHS, with high humidity, and exposure to air pollution contained significantly higher concentrations of sulphonates than pine needles from low elevations or from high elevations with a dryer climate or a different combination of air pollutants. Conclusions These findings lead to two conclusions. First, the occurrence and distribution of sulphonates may be explained by chemical reactions between sulphur dioxide and organic compounds in the humid air induced by ultraviolet radiation. Second, elevated concentrations of sulphonates in the fog could affect the water repellence of the blue swallow plumage, possibly decreasing their capacity to forage in the fog. We cannot prove conclusively that this is the reason why the number of blue swallows at the BSNHS has decreased dramatically, but for endangered species, we may have to rely on proxies to draw conclusions about outside threats. All such information should be valuable in devising protection plans for species under threat. Recommendations and perspectives The use of proxies to elucidate threats to endangered species should be evaluated in a broad scale. The mist-belt habitat in general is threatened by many human activities. These findings indicate that air pollution and the proximity of volatile organic compound (VOC) sources close to mist-belt habitat refuges may be an unrecognised conservation threat to the animals inhabiting them.";"Kylin, Henrik

White-tailed deer are sympatric with cattle throughout much of their range and are a valuable commodity in southern rangelands. The spatial distribution of deer and cattle was monitored over 1 year during four trials each lasting 12 days. In each trial six white-tailed deer (three bucks, three does) and nine cows were fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. Collars were scheduled to take a position location every 5min to determine animal location. These data were analyzed to study animal-to-animal interactions. To minimize problems of spatial autocorrelation, data were thinned to hourly locations for assessing animal home ranges and distributions. Although there was extensive overlap in spatial distributions of deer and cattle the species exhibited strong temporal separation. The mechanism was probably a combination of avoidance of cattle by deer and different habitat requirements. Close interactions were rare, however, individual deer did not show avoidance of cattle until they were within 50m of each other. Species distributions overlapped mainly on the most productive ecological sites such as clay loam soils and riparian areas which were favored by both species. Cattle avoided rocky terrain, so deer had almost exclusive use of rocky areas including the productive deep soil drainage areas within them. Does particularly favored these areas and the riparian areas while bucks favored the more open clay loam sites. In this shrub-dominated system both deer and cattle were often located close to ranch roads, and cattle especially used roads as paths of least resistance. Cattle were closely associated with water sources, but deer did not stay long near water or at supplemental feeding sites. Concerns that cattle will displace deer into marginal habitats, or that deer will over utilize vegetation near water and feeders, were not supported.";"Cooper, Susan M.

"AGRIS:US201400024043";"Integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis in GIS to develop land suitability for agriculture: Application to durum wheat cultivation in the region of Mleta in Algeria";"";"Due to constant decrease in farmlands, it is important to identify the best lands useful for sustainable agriculture (productive and profitable agriculture that protects the environment and that is socially equitable). This requirement has resulted in the development of land suitability maps for agriculture by combining several factors of various natures and of differing importance. The integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis approaches (MCDA) in a Geographical Information System (GIS) provides a powerful spatial decision support system which offers the opportunity to efficiently produce these land suitability maps. Indeed, GIS is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial data and establishing a process for decision support. Because of their spatial aggregation functions, MCDA methods can facilitate decision making in situations where several solutions are available, various criteria have to be taken into account and decision-makers are in conflict (Dias et al., 2002). The parameters and the classification system used in this work are inspired from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) approach dedicated to a sustainable agriculture. A spatial decision support system has been developed for establishing the land suitability map for agriculture. It incorporates the multicriteria analysis method ELECTRE Tri (ELimitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) in a GIS (ArcGIS) within the GIS program package environment. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. A land suitability map for durum wheat has been produced. Through the obtained results, it appears that ELECTRE Tri method, integrated into ArcGIS 9.2 of ESRI, is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. The time saving during the development of the land suitability map for the agriculture of the durum wheat was considerable. The coherence of the obtained maps confirms the system effectiveness.";"Mendas, Abdelkader

Vegetation restoration had been widely developed in this hot and arid area. In this work we investigate the quality of rhizosphere soils under four restoration species in the towns of Zuolin (gully bed) and Yuanma (slope area). The vegetation included two trees [ Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis L.] for the slope area, one shrubland [ Dodonaea viscosa (Linn.) Jacq. Enum.] and one native, natural grassland [ Heteropogon contortus (L.) Beauv.] for gully bed. Soil physical (bulk density and soil moisture content), chemical [pH, soil organic matter, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents], and microbial (microbial biomass and microbe quantity) properties and soil enzyme (catalase, protease and urease) activities were determined. Compared to the soils collected from other vegetation types, the soil under Leucaena leucocephala had the highest content of soil organic matter, total N, available N, total P, available P, available K, microbial biomass carbon (C), and the highest microbe quantity and enzyme activities. Five parameters (organic matter, pH, microbial biomass N, total K and protease activity), which had the greatest weight in the principal components analysis, were selected to calculate the soil quality index (SQI). The final SQI values implied that restoring Leucaena leucocephala greatly improved the soil quality, while restoration with Eucalyptus camaldulensis decreased the soil quality of the slope area. Plant recovery with Dodonaea viscosa and Heteropogon contortus on the gully bed affected the population of soil microbial communities but didn't improve the SQI values. It can therefore be seen that types of plants used for recovery in gully-developed regions in dry-hot valleys must be chosen cautiously: Leucaena leucocephala is a good choice for soil revegetation of the slope area, but the revegetation patterns on the gully bed still need further study.";"Peng, Sili

The intersection of the layer of plots' boundaries with the evaluation map is the basis for determining the value of existing and new plots. The areas of values as represented by the updated areas of ESQU (BPEJ) hardly reflect the true value of the land. Standard application of the current land valuation method leads to disagreements, especially in those cases where the owners are located in areas with significant difference between two adjacent values of ESQU (BPEJ). Original land valuation practices for landscape consolidation process are presented in this paper with the aim of a more realistic reflection of the plots benefits as offered by the particular land allocation site. A new procedure for determining the relative value of land by multicriteria evaluation system will be proposed. Two essential criteria that significantly affect the final value of the land will be defined. The methodology and algorithms for land valuation within the land consolidations will be outlined.";"Muchova, Z., Slovenská poľnohospodárska univerzita v Nitre (Slovak Republic).

The registration system is similar in concept to what is used in Nordic countries, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Croatia, Macedonia, the United Kingdom, and the northern provinces of Italy. It is different from other European countries in that it is expressly ""property"" or ""parcel"" based and not simply a recording of transactions. It is an improvement over both types of European systems in that it combines property mapping with the recording of legal rights into a single administrative system.

"AGRIS:US201400147773";"Assessing the application of a geographic presence-only model for land suitability mapping";"";"Recent advances in ecological modeling have focused on novel methods for characterizing the environment that use presence-only data and machine-learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of species occurrence. These novel methods may have great potential for land suitability applications in the developing world where detailed land cover information is often unavailable or incomplete. This paper assesses the adaptation and application of the presence-only geographic species distribution model, MaxEnt, for agricultural crop suitability mapping in a rural Thailand where lowland paddy rice and upland field crops predominant. To assess this modeling approach, three independent crop presence datasets were used including a social-demographic survey of farm households, a remote sensing classification of land use/land cover, and ground control points, used for geodetic and thematic reference that vary in their geographic distribution and sample size. Disparate environmental data were integrated to characterize environmental settings across Nang Rong District, a region of approximately 1300sq. km in size. Results indicate that the MaxEnt model is capable of modeling crop suitability for upland and lowland crops, including rice varieties, although model results varied between datasets due to the high sensitivity of the model to the distribution of observed crop locations in geographic and environmental space. Accuracy assessments indicate that model outcomes were influenced by the sample size and the distribution of sample points in geographic and environmental space. The need for further research into accuracy assessments of presence-only models lacking true absence data is discussed. We conclude that the MaxEnt model can provide good estimates of crop suitability, but many areas need to be carefully scrutinized including geographic distribution of input data and assessment methods to ensure realistic modeling results.";"Heumann, Benjamin W.

"AGRIS:US201400052283";"Regional distribution patterns predict bird occurrence in Mediterranean cropland afforestations";"";"Part of the abandoned cropland in Mediterranean landscapes is being subjected to afforestation dominated by pines. Here we simultaneously evaluate the effect of three categories of factors as predictors of the interspecific variation in bird habitat occupancy of fragmented afforestations, namely regional distribution, habitat preferences, and life-history traits of species. We use the “natural experiment” that highly fragmented pine plantations of central Spain represent due to the prevailing pattern of land ownership of small properties. Many species with marked habitat preferences for woodland habitats were very scarce or were never recorded in this novel habitat within a matrix of deforested agricultural landscape. Interspecific variability in occurrence was mainly explained by regional distribution patterns: occurrence was significantly and positively associated with the proportion of occupied 10� ×� 10� UTM km squares around the study area, habitat breadth, and population trend of species in the period 1998–2011. It was also positively associated with regional occupancy of mature and large pine plantations. Other predictor variables related to habitat preferences (for woodland, agricultural and urban habitats) or life-history traits (migratory strategy, body mass, and clutch size) were unrelated to the occurrence of species. Thus, small man-made pinewood islands funded by the Common Agrarian Policy within a landscape dominated by Mediterranean agricultural habitats only capture widespread and habitat generalist avian species with increasing population trends, not contributing to enhance truly woodland species.";"Carrascal, Luis M.

However, there has been little research on whether using fine-scale habitat data collected in the field could produce more robust models of species' distributions. Here we used radio-telemetry data collected on a declining species, the North American wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta), to test whether fine-scale habitat variables were better predictors of occurrence than land-cover and topography variables measured in a GIS. Patterns of male and female occurrence were similar in the spring; however, females used a much wider array of land-cover types and topographic positions in the summer and early fall, making it difficult for GIS-based models to accurately predict female occurrence at this time of year. Males on the other hand consistently selected flat, low-elevation, riparian areas throughout the year, and this consistency in turn led to the development of a strong GIS-based model. These results demonstrate the importance of taking a more sex-specific and temporally dynamic view of the environmental niche.";"Tingley, Reid

Rain-water harvesting are interesting technologies that decrease this risk. Therefore, one would expect an increasing use of these technologies in drought-prone areas. However, data collected in Ethiopia shows that the share of irrigated land in total landholding declines with farm size. This study investigates why the share declines with farm size using panel data collected in 2005 and in 2010. A random-effect tobit model is estimated for the share of irrigated land as a function of variables affecting returns, market prices, source of finance and expectation formation. The findings show farm-specific factors such as credit per hectare, distance to market, ease of selling output, landholding, regional differences, aridity and distance of plots from natural water sources significantly affect the share. Thus, encouraging investment has to consider farm-size, and also geographical, environmental and regional diversity.";"Wakeyo, Mekonnen B.

"AGRIS:US2016217727";"The Effects of Aquatic Invasive Species on Property Values: Evidence from a Quasi-Random Experiment";"";"The invasion of ecosystems by non-native species is widely considered to be a principal threat to global biological diversity, yet the social costs of invasive species are not well-understood. The purpose of this study is to estimate a hedonic model of lakeshore property values to quantify the effects of a common aquatic invasive species â€“ Eurasian Watermilfoil â€“ on property values across an extensive system of over 170 lakes in the northern forest region of Wisconsin.  In addition to providing empirical evidence as to the potential benefits from reducing the spread of invasive species, this paper also develops a quasi-experimental methodology to identify the effects of changes in endogenous neighborhood amenities within the commonly estimated hedonic framework.  In our application, a lake is more likely to be invaded with Milfoil if it is more popular with recreational boaters.  Therefore, since lakes popular with recreational boaters are also likely to be popular with potential residents, and since many aspects of a lakeâ€™s amenities may be difficult to quantify, the likelihood of Milfoil invasions is endogenous in a hedonic price equation.  Our identification strategy is based on a spatial difference-in-difference specification, and uses fixed effects to control for observed and unobserved neighborhood effects, while exploiting changes in the Milfoil status of several lakes during the time period of our data.  Results indicate that lakes invaded with Milfoil experienced an average 13% decrease in land values after invasion.  The Milfoil results are robust across linear and non-linear specifications.";"Horsch, Eric J.

"AGRIS:US201500008467";"Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of BMPs in controlling agricultural nonpoint source pollution in China based on the SWAT model";"";"Best management practices (BMPs) have been widely used in managing agricultural nonpoint source pollution (ANSP) at the watershed level. Most BMPs are related to land use, tillage management, and fertilizer levels. In total, seven BMP scenarios (Reforest1, Reforest2, No Tillage, Contour tillage, and fertilizer level 1–4) that are related to these three factors were estimated in this study. The objectives were to investigate the effectiveness and cost-benefit of these BMPs on ANSP reduction in a large tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China, which are based on the simulation results of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results indicated that reforestation was the most economically efficient of all BMPs, and its net benefits were up to CNY 4.36×10⁷ years⁻¹ (about USD 7.08×10⁶ years⁻¹). Regarding tillage practices, no tillage practice was more environmentally friendly than other tillage practices, and contour tillage was more economically efficient. Reducing the local fertilizer level to 0.8-fold less than that of 2010 can yield a satisfactory environmental and economic efficiency. Reforestation and fertilizer management were more effective in reducing total phosphorus (TP), whereas tillage management was more effective in reducing total nitrogen (TN). When CNY 10,000 (about USD 162) was applied to reforestation, no tillage, contour tillage, and an 0.8-fold reduction in the fertilizer level, then annual TN load can be reduced by 0.08, 0.16, 0.11, and 0.04 t and annual TP load can be reduced by 0.04, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.03 t, respectively. The cost-benefit (CB) ratios of the BMPs were as follows: reforestation (207 %) > contour tillage (129 %) > no tillage (114 %) > fertilizer management (96 and 89 %). The most economical and effective BMPs can be designated as follows: BMP1 (returning arable land with slopes greater than 25° to forests and those lands with slopes of 15–25° to orchards), BMP2 (implementing no tillage on arable land with slopes less than 15°), and BMP5 (0.8-fold less than that of 2010).";"Liu, Ruimin

In this regard, efficient soil management relies on accurate quantification of soil loss. To this end, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standard of soil erosion, developed for agricultural areas, has been applied in many countries, including South Korea. Due to the lack of standard methods for assessing soil erosion in South Korea, the OECD standard has been applied to non-agricultural regions of Korea despite the possibility that local soil erosion characteristics may differ from those in agricultural areas. Such an approach might give erroneous information on soil loss to policy and decision makers. This study estimated soil loss for eight different land cover-types in Korea using the universal soil loss equation, and compared the results with those from the unmodified OECD soil erosion standard. Estimated soil loss differed considerably among land-cover types. The results have implications on the limitations in applying the OECD soil erosion standard to soil management in Korea. Thus, this study suggests a modified soil erosion standard for efficient soil management.";"Jang, Chunhwa

Since 2000, drought of unusual severity, extent, and duration has affected large areas of western North America, leading to regional-scale dieback of forests in the southwestern US. We report on drought impacts on forests in a region farther north, encompassing the transition between boreal forest and prairie in western Canada. A central question is the significance of drought as an agent of large-scale tree mortality and its potential future impact on carbon cycling in this cold region. We used a combination of plot-based, meteorological, and remote sensing measures to map and quantify aboveground, dead biomass of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across an 11.5 Mha survey area where drought was exceptionally severe during 2001-2002. Within this area, a satellite-based land cover map showed that aspen-dominated broadleaf forests occupied 2.3 Mha. Aerial surveys revealed extensive patches of severe mortality (>55%) resembling the impacts of fire. Dead aboveground biomass was estimated at 45 Mt, representing 20% of the total aboveground biomass, based on a spatial interpolation of plot-based measurements. Spatial variation in percentage dead biomass showed a moderately strong correlation with drought severity. In the prairie-like, southern half of the study area where the drought was most severe, 35% of aspen biomass was dead, compared with an estimated 7% dead biomass in the absence of drought. Drought led to an estimated 29 Mt increase in dead biomass across the survey area, corresponding to 14 Mt of potential future carbon emissions following decomposition. Many recent, comparable episodes of drought-induced forest dieback have been reported from around the world, which points to an emerging need for multiscale monitoring approaches to quantify drought effects on woody biomass and carbon cycling across large areas.";"MICHAELIAN, MICHAEL

The sample analysed includes 277 personal surveys completed by members of agricultural cooperatives in the Region of Murcia (Spain). Results show that in all questions related to objectives and level of satisfaction, members value them with an average of 6.9 out of 10 or higher in all cases. For both objectives and satisfaction, the directors and the cooperative members who depend upon agricultural activity for a large percentage of their income have higher scores, compared with non-board members and members who are less dependent on agricultural activity (with a statistical significance of 1% and 5%, respectively). We also find that members who agree in more with the admission of new members, who think it is easy to recover their investments and who want to stay longer in the cooperative are those who are more willing to invest and to exert control. Furthermore, we find that members that prefer to have a participation in the assembly proportional to their contribution and that prefer that the cooperative diversifies more are those who are more willing to invest. In addition, control is favoured by members pertaining to the cooperative for a large period and for those members who think that investing in the cooperative is a high risk and who prefer long-term investments. Finally, directors are more willing to invest and to exert control.

Farming systems based on integrated pest management (IPM) technologies can reduce the use of pesticides to a great extent without causing harm to the yield. Therefore, Bangladesh, like many developing countries, launched IPM technologies to reduce the adverse effects of pesticides in social, economic and environmental aspects. This study made an attempt to analyze the level of IPM adoption and the intensity of IPM practices by vegetable farmers of Narsingdi district, Bangladesh. A total of 331 vegetable producers were sampled. The results revealed that less than one-third of the farmers (30 %) adopted IPM and they varied in terms of the number or type of practices. The use of logistic regression model in this study was to identify the significant factors of IPM adoption, explore several factors, including farmer field school, land ownership status, perception toward IPM, use of improved varieties and extension contact. Furthermore, the linear regression model showed that vegetable cultivation area, farmers’ age, household size, land ownership status and perception toward IPM are necessary in the adoption intensity of IPM practices. This study also made an attempt to clarify the role of these factors in the adoption behavior of IPM practices in vegetable farming. The findings could be used to formulate better policies toward increasing the adoption of this sustainable approach.";"Kabir, Muhammad Humayun

"AGRIS:US201301691666";"impact of shrub encroachment on savanna bird diversity from local to regional scale";"";"Evidence is accumulating of a general increase in woody cover of many savanna regions of the world. Little is known about the consequences of this widespread and fundamental ecosystem structural shift on biodiversity. South Africa. We assessed the potential response of bird species to shrub encroachment in a South African savanna by censusing bird species in five habitats along a gradient of increasing shrub cover, from grassland/open woodland to shrubland dominated by various shrub species. We also explored historical bird species population trends across southern Africa during the second half of the 20th century to determine if any quantifiable shifts had occurred that support an ongoing impact of shrub encroachment at the regional scale. At the local scale, species richness peaked at intermediate levels of shrub cover. Bird species composition showed high turnover along the gradient, suggesting that widespread shrub encroachment is likely to lead to the loss of certain species with a concomitant decline in bird species richness at the landscape scale. Finally, savanna bird species responded to changes in vegetation structure rather than vegetation species composition: bird assemblages were very similar in shrublands dominated by Acacia mellifera and those dominated by Tarchonanthus camphoratus. Shrub encroachment might have a bigger impact on bird diversity in grassland than in open woodland, regardless of the shrub species. Species recorded in our study area were associated with historical population changes at the scale of southern Africa suggesting that shrub encroachment could be one of the main drivers of bird population dynamics in southern African savannas. If current trends continue, the persistence of several southern African bird species associated with open savanna might be jeopardized regionally.";"Sirami, Clélia

"AGRIS:US201500162836";"Characterising spatiotemporal environmental and natural variation using a dynamic habitat index throughout the province of Ontario";"";"Understanding changes in landscape productivity patterns is critical for management of ecosystems, characterising biodiversity, and monitoring climate change. Vegetation productivity, a key functional component of terrestrial ecosystems, can be readily monitored using remote sensing and can also be combined with other spatial information, such as land cover and topography, to provide a more comprehensive understanding, at the landscape scale, of ecosystem dynamics. Ontario is the second largest and most populated province in Canada covering approximately 1 million km² with a population of 13 million. Befitting such a large and complex area, Ontario is characterised by high environmental and land cover diversity. In order to assess temporal trends in vegetation productivity across the province we utilised a series of 10-day composites of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS) fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) over a 6-year period (2003–2008). Indicators of annual productivity, seasonality and the minimum amount of vegetated cover were all calculated from the fPAR time-series to evaluate vegetation condition. To define the level of observed natural variability and areas which fall within, and beyond, the variability thresholds, we utilised the Theil–Sen's non-parametric statistical trend test. Results indicate that over the 6-year period decreasing trends in productivity dominated the Ontario landscape. Using spatial data layers of potential drivers of vegetation variability, we found that different land cover types exhibited significantly different trend amplitudes and proportions with elevation a significant correlate for most of the observed trends. Distance from nearest road or human settlement, indicative of anthropogenic drivers, was not significantly related to the observed trends. Recent and older burn areas were linked to decreasing and increasing trends in satellite derived productivity respectively. Our findings suggest that characterising trends in landscape productivity patterns over large areas is possible using remote sensing technology and the integration of productivity trends with explanatory spatial data sets can provide insights into drivers of productivity dynamics. These insights can aid in provincial and national monitoring activities as well as be used to focus more detailed analysis to regions of specific interest.";"Michaud, Jean-Simon

We developed a spatial statistical model based on multiple geophysical and socio-economic variables to investigate the pattern of natural forest regrowth in the Swiss mountain area between the 1980s and 1990s. Results show that forest regrowth occurred primarily in areas with low temperature sum, intermediate steepness and soil stoniness as well as close to forest edges and relatively close to roads. Model results suggest that regions with weak labor markets are favored in terms of land abandonment and forest regrowth. We could not find an effect of population change on land abandonment and forest regrowth. Therefore, we conclude that decision makers should consider non-linearities in the pattern of forest regrowth and the fact that labor markets have an effect on land abandonment and forest regrowth when designing measures to prevent agricultural land abandonment and natural forest regrowth in the Swiss mountains.";"Gellrich, Mario

This investigation is intended to estimate the annual soil loss in Wadi Kerak watershed, and to examine the spatial patterns of soil loss and intensity, as an essential procedure for proper planning of conservation measures. To achieve these objectives, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model has been applied in a geographical information system framework. After computing the RUSLE parameters (R, K, LS, C and P) soil erosion risk and intensity maps were generated, then integrated with physical factors (terrain units, elevation, slope, and land uses/cover) to explore the influence of these factors on the spatial patterns of soil erosion loss. The estimated potential annual average soil loss is 64 ton ha⁻¹year⁻¹, and the potential erosion rates from calculated class ranges from 0.0 to 790 ton ha⁻¹year⁻¹. Soil erosion risk assessment indicates that 54.5 % of the catchment is prone to high to extreme soil losses higher than 25 ton ha⁻¹year⁻¹. The lower and middle parts of the catchment suffer from high, severe, to extreme soil erosion. While 45.5 % of the basin still undergoes slight and moderate levels of soil loss of less than 25 ton ha⁻¹year⁻¹, yet 76.91 % of soil erosion occurred on four different terrain units, and 72.29 % of soil erosion occurred in zones less than 600 m in elevation, with 88 % present on areas of 0°–6°, 5°–15°, and 15°–25° slope categories. 32.6, 30.3, and 33.1 % of soil erosion occurred on rainfed mixed farming and irrigated areas, barren, and rangeland, respectively.

The study area is located in the Arabian Shield heterogeneous basement terrain. It is characterized by insignificant primary porosity and permeability and is mainly covered by massive and altered gneissose granites, diorite, and gabbro and metamorphosed basalts. Lithology, rainfall, lineament density, drainage density, slope steepness and landuse/landcover are the main hydrogeological parameters defined to be related to the groundwater storage in the study area. They are prepared using the processed satellite data and integrated using weights of evidence and index overlay GIS models to generate groundwater potential zones map. Within the GIS model, those parameters are assigned values of 30, 20, 15, 15, 10 and 10, respectively, as score values. The resulting groundwater potential zone map for Wadi Yalamlam basin is categorized into three main classes (high, moderate and low groundwater potential zones) based on pixel values. The results of this study indicate that the lower parts of the Wadi Yalamlam basin is the most promising area for groundwater occurrences and contains both high and moderate potential zones. High groundwater potential zones are located to the north of the main dyke area around Abu Helal farm. They are characterized by loose wadi deposits, flat areas, gentle slope (ranges between 0 and 5 degrees), low drainage density (<100 D/30 km²) and shallow water table (water table is 7 m from the ground surface). The present study proved: (1) the usefulness of the processed remote sensing satellite imageries for generating several indirect groundwater parameters; (2) the usefulness of weights of evidence and index overlay GIS models for the integration process and the production of groundwater potential zone map along the study area.";"Madani, Ahmed

In recent years, this sector has had to tackle far-reaching changes taking place in the social, economic and political system. New demands are now being addressed and policies reformulated. As a response to this pressure, new decision-making structures and innovation activities are taking place in the forestry sector. The aim of this paper is to study learning processes on the management level of forest enterprises. We focus on the production of new ecosystem goods and services; a result of such learning and adaptation processes during the last ten years. The main questions we ask are: How did forest enterprises react to the different changes with respect to their products and services? What are the driving forces and causes for learning and adaptation? In order to operationalise this research aim, we conducted a case study analysis among 6 forest owners in Switzerland between 1995 and 2005. We identified the production of new ecosystem goods and services mainly in the category of cultural services. As we expected, the most important impulse for these adaptation activities was the decrease of returns from traditional timber production. However, other explanatory factors such as external contacts and innovation strategies also seemed to play a similar role.";"Ingold, Karin

The Alto Paraguaçu Watershed is a major producer of fruits and vegetables, and currently the largest producer of English potato in the north/northeast of Brazil. The water availability in the region can be considered the limiting factor to the expansion of agricultural frontiers. Therefore, in order to assess the influence of land use/land cover on the quality and quantity of the water resources in the subwatershed, three sampling campaigns were carried out (two in the rainy season and one in the dry season) at ten points throughout the watershed, as well as the hydrological analysis and land use/land cover changes assessment for both seasons. The objective was to relate land use/land cover indicators with hydrological indicators in order to fit a model to predict water changes in the studied subwatershed. The results showed that the changes that occurred in land use/land cover for the development of the current agriculture have significantly impacted the hydrological behavior in the Alto Paraguaçu watershed. It was possible to observe that the quality and quantity of water were directly influenced by the anthropization process. This study highlights the importance of suitable land use/land cover for the conservation of water resources.";"Calijuri, Maria Lúcia

Succession processes were spontaneous, anthropogenic-conditioned or successive, which were linked with land use changes, reduction of traditional management of non-forest vegetation (mowing, grazing) and consequent climax succession. Recultivation of meadows was the most extensive anthropogenic process (88%) linked with disposal of hedges, bank vegetation, floodplain woods, changes of mosaic of arable fields and semi-natural meadows to intensively utilized meadows. Evaluation of ecological significance of land use changes pointed out, that the target area became most homogenous landscape during the last fifty years. Statistics and the synthesis of historical and present land use maps refer to a reduction of the number of land use elements, increase of their size, decrease of mosaics due to interface of plots and succession of non-forest habitats as well as the decreasing trend of porosity.";"Špulerová, J., Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava (Slovak Republic).

Consequently, voluntary conservation programs may induce lower costs than traditional obligatory programs, such as a land taking. We compared the costs accrued from land purchasing with those from temporal land leasing. The costs included both direct costs, such as fees of land acquisition and compensation payments in land leasing, and transaction costs. We used a data set from a Finnish pilot program called Trading in Natural Values (TNV). In this new practice landowners and the authority that represents the Finnish government sign a fixed-term contract. According to these contracts the forest owners produce biodiversity services on their lands and receive a compensation payment. We developed a framework where land purchasing and leasing can be treated equivalently in terms of duration of time, so that their costs can be compared consistently. Land purchasing and leasing yielded quite similar cost levels. This indicates that the competitive bidding process in TNV has not worked properly.";"Juutinen, Artti

But uncertainty exists about the extent of tree benefits and services because urban trees also impose costs (e.g. asthma) and may create hazards (e.g. windthrow). Few researchers have systematically assessed how urban tree benefits and costs vary across different cities, geographic scales and climates. This paper provides a quantitative review of 115 original urban tree studies, examining: (i) research locations, (ii) research methods, and (iii) assessment techniques for tree services and disservices. Researchers published findings in 33 journals from diverse disciplines including: forestry, land use planning, ecology, and economics. Research has been geographically concentrated (64% of studies were conducted in North America). Nearly all studies (91.3%) used quantitative research, and most studies (60%) employed natural science methods. Demonstrated tree benefits include: economic, social, health, visual and aesthetic benefits; identified ecosystem services include: carbon sequestration, air quality improvement, storm water attenuation, and energy conservation. Disservices include: maintenance costs, light attenuation, infrastructure damage and health problems, among others. Additional research is required to better inform public policy, including comparative assessment of tree services and disservices, and assessment of urban residents and land managers’ understanding of tree benefits and costs.";"Roy, Sudipto

We documented an extreme case study for the range of possible post-fire land cover (LC) dynamics. We investigated a 15-ha, steep (10°–65°) burnt slope in Styria (Austria) at elevation of 760°-113 m, which burned in 1946 and has not fully recovered to date. Seven 8-class legend LC maps were produced (1954, 1966, 1973, 1982, 1998, 2004, 2009) and integrated in a vector-based GIS, mainly by on-screen interpretation of aerial photos. Our aim was to clarify how post-wildfire LC dynamics take place on a severely damaged, steep slope and to give a basic projection of the future vegetation recovery process. The pre-fire Pinus sylvestris stands have been mainly replaced by Picea abies and Larix decidua. Regeneration proceeded mainly from the base of the slope upwards. All tree species together still cover no more than 40% of the slope after more than 60 years of recovery, while grassland communities and rock/debris areas have expanded. Multitemporal analysis showed a slow but steady increase in woodland cover. Degraded rock/debris areas, however, expanded as well because soil erosion and related debris flows remained active. Slope angle (with a threshold value of approx. 35-40°) seemed to control whether erosion or regeneration prevailed. According to a simple extrapolation, the slope will not reach its former condition before 2070. This extreme disturbance window of more than 120 years is owed to the steepness of the slope and to the shallow soils on dolomitic bedrock that were severely damaged by the fire. The neglect of any game fencing is a further factor slowing regeneration.";"Malowerschnig, Bodo

"AGRIS:US201600101785";"review of forest and tree plantation biomass equations in Indonesia";"";"KEY MESSAGE : We compiled 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies in Indonesia. Unpublished academic theses contributed the largest share of the biomass equations. The availability of the biomass equations was skewed to certain regions, forest types, and species. Further research is necessary to fill the data gaps in emission factors and to enhance the implementation of climate change mitigation projects and programs. CONTEXT : Locally derived allometric equations contribute to reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of biomass, which may be useful in the implementation of climate change mitigation projects and programs in the forestry sector. Many regional and global efforts are underway to compile allometric equations. AIMS : The present study compiles the available allometric equations in Indonesia and evaluates their adequacy in estimating biomass in the different types of forest across the archipelago. METHODS : A systematic survey of the scientific literature was conducted to compile the biomass equations, including ISI publications, national journals, conference proceedings, scientific reports, and academic theses. The data collected were overlaid on a land use/land cover map to assess the spatial distribution with respect to different regions and land cover types. The validation of the equations for selected forest types was carried out using independent destructive sampling data. RESULTS : A total of 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies were compiled. Unpublished academic theses contributed the majority of the biomass equations. Twenty-one habitat types and 65 species were studied in detail. Diameter was the most widely used single predictor in all allometric equations. The cumulative number of individual trees cut was 5,207. The islands of Java, Kalimantan, and Sumatra were the most studied, while other regions were underexplored or unexplored. More than half of the biomass equations were for just seven species. The majority of the studies were carried out in plantation forests and secondary forests, while primary forests remain largely understudied. Validation using independent data showed that the allometric models for peat swamp forest had lower error departure, while the models for lowland dipterocarp forest had higher error departure. CONCLUSION : Although biomass studies are a major research activity in Indonesia due to its high forest cover, the majority of such activities are limited to certain regions, forest types, and species. More research is required to cover underrepresented regions, forest types, particular growth forms, and very large tree diameter classes.";"Anitha, Kamalakumari

Based on an empirical study on desertification control in 12 counties in north China, the study found the following major results: (1) although there was a cubic relationship between the extent and effect of local knowledge, local knowledge significantly influenced the impact of science on institutional change; (2) local knowledge took effect mainly through affecting formal laws and regulations, major actors, and methods of desertification control in institutional change but had no significant impact on the types of property rights; and (3) local knowledge enhanced the impact of science on the results of desertification control through affecting the impact of science on institutional change. These findings provide a reference for researchers, policy makers, and practitioners, both in China and in other regions of the world, to further explore the influence of local knowledge on the impact of science on institutional change and the roles of local knowledge or knowledge in institutional change and governance.";"Yang, Lihua";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"desertification;property rights";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500204732";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0418-4";"";"";"";"616-633"
"AGRIS:US201600059830";"cloud mask methodology for high resolution remote sensing data combining information from high and medium resolution optical sensors";"";"This study presents a novel cloud masking approach for high resolution remote sensing images in the context of land cover mapping. As an advantage to traditional methods, the approach does not rely on thermal bands and it is applicable to images from most high resolution earth observation remote sensing sensors. The methodology couples pixel-based seed identification and object-based region growing. The seed identification stage relies on pixel value comparison between high resolution images and cloud free composites at lower spatial resolution from almost simultaneously acquired dates. The methodology was tested taking SPOT4-HRVIR, SPOT5-HRG and IRS-LISS III as high resolution images and cloud free MODIS composites as reference images. The selected scenes included a wide range of cloud types and surface features. The resulting cloud masks were evaluated through visual comparison. They were also compared with ad-hoc independently generated cloud masks and with the automatic cloud cover assessment algorithm (ACCA). In general the results showed an agreement in detected clouds higher than 95% for clouds larger than 50ha. The approach produced consistent results identifying and mapping clouds of different type and size over various land surfaces including natural vegetation, agriculture land, built-up areas, water bodies and snow.";"Sedano, Fernando

"AGRIS:US201600059832";"Land use and land cover classification over a large area in Iran based on single date analysis of satellite imagery";"";"Accelerated soil erosion, high sediment yields, floods and debris flow are serious problems in many areas of Iran, and in particular in the Golestan dam watershed, which is the area that was investigated in this study. Accurate land use and land cover (LULC) maps can be effective tools to help soil erosion control efforts. The principal objective of this research was to propose a new protocol for LULC classification for large areas based on readily available ancillary information and analysis of three single date Landsat ETM+ images, and to demonstrate that successful mapping depends on more than just analysis of reflectance values. In this research, it was found that incorporating climatic and topographic conditions helped delineate what was otherwise overlapping information. This study determined that a late summer Landsat ETM+ image yields the best results with an overall accuracy of 95%, while a spring image yields the poorest accuracy (82%). A summer image yields an intermediate accuracy of 92%. In future studies where funding is limited to obtaining one image, late summer images would be most suitable for LULC mapping. The analysis as presented in this paper could also be done with satellite images taken at different times of the season. It may be, particularly for other climatic zones, that there is a better time of season for image acquisition that would present more information.";"Saadat, Hossein

Among three watersheds, Sher watershed has gauging site for the runoff measurements. The CN computed from the observed rainfall-runoff events is termed as CN₍PQ₎, land use and land cover (LULC) is termed as CN₍LU₎ and the CN based on land slope is termed as SACN₂. The estimated annual CN₍PQ₎ varies from 69 to 87 over the 26years data period with median 74 and average 75. The range of CN₍PQ₎ from 70 to 79 are most significant values and these truly represent the AMC II condition for the Sher watershed. The annual CN₍LU₎ was computed for all three watersheds using GIS and the years are 1973, 1989 and 2000. Satellite imagery of MSS, TM and ETM+ sensors are available for these years and obtained from the Global Land Cover Facility Data Center of Maryland University USA. The computed CN₍LU₎ values show rising trend with the time and this trend is attributed to expansion of agriculture area in all watersheds. The predicted values of CN₍LU₎ with time (year) can be used to predict runoff potential under the effect of change in LULC. Comparison of CN₍LU₎ and CN₍PQ₎ values shows close agreement and it also validates the classification of LULC. The estimation of slope adjusted SA-CN₂ shows the significant difference over conventional CN for the hilly forest lands. For the micro watershed planning, SCS-CN method should be modified to incorporate the effect of change in land use and land cover along with effect of land slope.";"Deshmukh, Dhananjay Suresh

"AGRIS:US201500217160";"Is Oregon's land use planning program conserving forest and farm land? A review of the evidence";"";"Planners have long been interested in understanding ways in which land use planning approaches play out on the ground and planning scholars have approached the task of evaluating such effects using a variety of methods. Oregon, in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies owing to its early-adopted and widely recognized statewide approach to farm and forest land protection and recent experiment with relaxation of that approach in 2004 with the passage of ballot Measure 37. In this paper we review research-based evidence regarding the forest and farm land conservation effects of Oregon land use planning. We document the evolution of methods used in evaluating state land use planning program performance, including trend analysis, indicator analysis, empirical models, and analysis of indirect effects on the economic viability of forestry and farming. We also draw on data documenting Measure 37 claims to consider the degree to which Measure 37 might have altered land use and development trends had its impacts not been tempered by a subsequent ballot measure – Measure 49. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge and suggest opportunities for future research. Common to nearly all of the studies we reviewed was an acknowledgement of the difficulty in establishing causal relationships between land use planning and land use change given the many exogenous and endogenous factors involved. Despite these difficulties, we conclude that sufficient evidence does exist to suggest that Oregon's land use planning program is contributing a measurable degree of protection to forest and farm land in the state.";"Gosnell, Hannah

Individual accumulation of land over the last decade has mainly taken place via inheritance (among indigenous farmers) without takeovers of land and dispossession of small-scale farmers outside the extended family. Land accumulation among migrant farmers is rare beyond the initial acquisition. Large-scale farmers transfer surplus from their higher volume of cocoa production into investments in non-farm activities and construction of new residential houses—and not in land acquisition based on market transactions. State regulation of the cocoa sector has spurred increased efficiency among private cocoa purchasing companies and thereby reduced the marginalization of farmers with small landholdings by preserving their access to a vital source of income. The unique character of the Ghanaian purchasing system is a major factor behind the relatively stable proportion in the access and control of land for cocoa between extended families.";"Knudsen, Michael Helt

"AGRIS:US201600131929";"Regulating riparian forests for aquatic productivity in the Pacific Northwest, USA: addressing a paradox";"";"Forested riparian buffers isolate streams from the influence of harvesting operations that can lead to water temperature increases. Only forest cover between the sun and stream limits stream warming, but that cover also reduces in-stream photosynthesis, aquatic insect production, and fish productivity. Water temperature increases that occur as streams flow through canopy openings decrease rapidly downstream, in as little as 150 m. Limiting management options in riparian forests restricts maintenance and optimization of various buffer contributions to beneficial uses, including forest products, fish, and their food supply. Some riparian disturbance, especially along cold streams, appears to benefit fish productivity. Options for enhancing environmental investments in buffers should include flexibility in application of water quality standards to address the general biological needs of fish and temporary nature of clearing induced warming. Local prescriptions for optimizing riparian buffers and practices that address long-term habitat needs deserve attention. Options and incentives are needed to entice landowners to actively manage for desirable riparian forest conditions.";"Newton, Michael

"AGRIS:US201500217166";"When should households be compensated for land-use restrictions? A decision-making framework for Chinese forest policy";"";"Competing uses of land mean that regulations aimed at environmental conservation often conflict with the land-use rights of rural households. Several reports suggest that this has occurred with the introduction of the Natural Forest Protection Programme (NFPP) in China, one of the world's largest logging ban programmes. This paper investigates whether households should be compensated for infringements on property rights, drawing on institutional economics literature on regulation. We distinguish between cases where regulation solves local collective action problems and increases the welfare of those affected, and those where regulation involves a redistribution of rights from one group to another. We apply this to the NFPP by estimating the net welfare impacts, using household level stated preference data with econometric techniques that explicitly account for zero and negative values of the dependent variable. We find that the ban on logging does not affect the net welfare of the affected forest communities. This indicates that the losses resulting from the restrictions on property rights are offset by the benefits from restrictions on other local households. We also find evidence that a partial reduction in logging would be welfare increasing, indicating that the NFPP is to some extent addressing local collective action problems in forest areas. Broader implications for the question of compensating for infringement of property rights as the result of regulatory interventions in contexts of institutional imperfections are also drawn.";"Mullan, Katrina

"AGRIS:US201301722801";"Simulating restoration strategies for a southern boreal forest landscape with complex land ownership patterns";"";"Restoring altered forest landscapes toward their ranges of natural variability (RNV) may enhance ecosystem sustainability and resiliency, but such efforts can be hampered by complex land ownership and management patterns. We evaluated restoration potential for southern-boreal forests in the ∼2.1millionha Border Lakes Region of northern Minnesota (U.S.A.) and Ontario (Canada), where spatially distinct timber harvest and fire suppression histories have differentially altered forest conditions (composition, age-class distribution, and landscape structure) among major management areas, effectively resulting in forest landscape “bifurcation.” We used a forest landscape simulation model to evaluate potential for four hypothetical management and two natural disturbance scenarios to restore forest conditions and reduce bifurcation, including: (1) a current management scenario that simulated timber harvest and fire suppression practices among major landowners; (2) three restoration scenarios that simulated combinations of wildland fire use and cross-boundary timber harvest designed to emulate natural disturbance patterns; (3) a historical natural disturbance scenario that simulated pre-EuroAmerican settlement fire regimes and windthrow; and (4) a contemporary fire regime that simulated fire suppression, but no timber harvest. Forest composition and landscape structure for a 200-year model period were compared among scenarios, among major land management regions within scenarios, and to six RNV benchmarks. The current management scenario met only one RNV benchmark and did not move forest composition, age-class distribution, or landscape structures toward the RNV, and it increased forest landscape bifurcation between primarily timber-managed and wilderness areas. The historical natural disturbance scenario met five RNV benchmarks and the restoration scenarios as many as five, by generally restoring forest composition, age-class distributions, and landscape structures, and reducing bifurcation of forest conditions. The contemporary natural disturbance scenario met only one benchmark and generally created a forest landscape dominated by large patches of late-successional, fire-prone forests. Some forest types (e.g., white and red pine) declined in all scenarios, despite simulated restoration strategies. It may not be possible to achieve all objectives under a single management scenario, and complications, such as fire-risk, may limit strategies. However, our model suggests that timber harvest and fire regimes that emulate natural disturbance patterns can move forest landscapes toward the RNV.";"Shinneman, Douglas J.

The treatment of soil conservation as an input has involved the demonstration of damage functions and a study of factors influencing the adoption of soil conservation. The study of renewability, or the lack of it, has involved the application of the concept of user costs, whilst the consideration of common property resources has concentrated on the need to minimise the divergences between social and private values. The literature is dominated by work on developed countries and also reveals the research on decision frameworks to be compartmentalised in terms of the three concepts.";"Thampapillai, Dodo J.

"AGRIS:FR2016209883";"La valeur économique des paysages des villes périurbanisées";"";"In this research, we propose a method for describing rural landscapes in peri urban areas and evaluating their impact on house and land prices. This method matches quantitative geography and econometric methods used for hedonic analysis. A geographical model is used for producing variables describing the landscape an observer can look at when located in a specific house or a land parcel. This model takes account of these parts of the landscape that are hidden by houses, buildings, hills, forests,. . . The variables produced by the model describe the size of the area that can be seen and its repartition across various types of land use (agriculture, forest, buildings, roads, water,. . . ). They are used as explanatory factors for the price paid for buying the house or land parcel, using hedonic regression. This method has been simultaneously used in six areas: the periurban areas of the cities of Dijon, Besançon, Lyon, Marseille and Brest and the whole Nord-Pas de Calais region. We are then able to compare results obtained using the same methodology for various areas, with various types of landscapes. Moreover, for Dijon, Besançon and the Nord-Pas de Calais regions, we can compare variables produced using different sources of information. For Dijon and Besançon, they differ with respect to the thinness and the quality of the satellite images used for analysing landcapes, the best one being much more expansive. For the Nord-Pas de Calais, we compared two types of geographical information systems. Our results confirm that the quality of the landscape that can be seen when located at a house or in a land parcel significantly influences its price. A landscape, with notably green areas, has a value that is capitalized into house and land prices. However, the measure of this value is highly variable across regions and is highly sensitive to the quality of the data used by the geographical model. Therefore, at this stage of the research work, our results cannot be used for operational purposes.

La recherche présentée ici propose une méthode de description et d’évaluation des caractéristiques d’un paysage qui combine la géographie quantitative et l’économétrie des modèles hédoniques. Un modèle géographique produit des indices caractérisant les paysages à partir d’une reconstitution de la vue depuis le sol, en tenant compte des effets du relief et des masques que les objets hauts opposent à la vue. Il décrit la quantité de paysage vu par un observateur au niveau du sol en la répartissant entre 13 types d’occupations du sol. Les variables produites par le modèle géographique sont utilisées dans des régressions hédoniques qui permettent d’évaluer l’impact des attributs paysagers ainsi mesurés sur les prix des transactions immobilières. Nous avons appliqué cette méthode à six zones géographiques périurbaines, autour des villes de Dijon, Besançon, Lyon, Marseille et Brest et pour l’ensemble de la région Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Nous pouvons ainsi comparer les résultats obtenus en appliquant la même méthode sur le même type de données, dans des contextes différents, notamment par le type de paysage. De plus, pour Dijon, Besançon et le Nord-Pas-de-Calais, nous disposons de plusieurs sources d’information géographique différant par leur qualité, notamment la finesse des images satellitaires utilisées ; ce qui nous permet d’analyser l’impact de la qualité des données sur la qualité de la description des paysages et sur les évaluations économiques qui en résultent. En règle générale, les résultats obtenus montrent que la contribution des attributs paysagers au prix des biens fonciers et immobiliers est faible mais significative. Les paysages, en particulier les objets « verts » (couverts arborés et agricoles), sont valorisés par les ménages à travers leur capitalisation dans les valeurs immobilières, en particulier dans l’espace périurbain. Cependant, les résultats obtenus sont très sensibles à la qualité et à la finesse des sources d’information utilisées pour décrire le paysage. Ils sont également très variables d’une zone géographique à l’autre, sans que l’on dispose actuellement de facteurs explicatifs de cette variabilité.";"Brossard, Thierry

"AGRIS:US201400126340";"Modeling the long-term natural regeneration potential of woodlands in semi-arid regions to guide restoration efforts";"";"Understanding forest regeneration at sites previously used for agriculture underlies the establishment of science-based woodlands management policies. This is especially relevant in semi-arid areas, where the tree cover is critical in ameliorating the effects of aridity and in preventing desertification and land degradation. Natural regeneration in semi-arid areas occurs very slowly, which in part explains why it has hardly been studied. In the present work, we sought to devise a method to predict the natural regeneration potential of woodlands in semi-arid areas, to be used in guiding restoration efforts. Specifically, we evaluated holm oak coverage at a long-term ecological research site and then designed and validated a model to predict the natural regeneration of holm oak based on a few environmental variables. Unlike available studies, we obtained long-term information on tree regeneration (making use of >60� years of aerial photography) and climate (using long-term climate and microclimate data). We found that microclimate, measured using the potential solar radiation as a proxy, was a key driver of natural regeneration: after 60� years of agricultural abandonment, less sun-exposed areas attained a tree cover >90� %, whereas in more sun-exposed areas it remained below 20� %. We then used the model to map the natural regeneration potential, first in the study area and then in an area where holm oak plantations had been unsuccessfully introduced. In the latter case, the model successfully predicted the failure of this reforestation effort. Our results support the use of this model by decision makers to optimize management practices, as it will encourage the concentration of efforts in areas more prone to successful reforestation and allow the identification of areas more likely to benefit from natural regeneration processes.";"Príncipe, Adriana

We analyzed 16 years (1992-2007) of butterfly transect count data from The Netherlands in a reevaluation of the trends of common, widespread species. Fifty-five percent (11 of 20 species) of these species suffered severe declines in distribution and abundance. Overall, cumulative butterfly abundance declined by around 30%. Some of the species in decline used to be omnipresent in gardens and parks, and 2 of the species were previously considered agricultural pests. Based on their declines over the last 16 years, 2 of the 20 species (Lasiommata megera and Gonepteryx rhamni) reached endangered status in The Netherlands under the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) population-decline criterion, and 2 species (Inachis io and Thymelicus lineola) met vulnerable criterion. Butterflies in farmland, urban, and particularly woodland areas showed the largest decline in species abundance. The abundance of species associated with vegetation types found mainly in nature reserves (dunes, heathland, and, to a lesser extent, seminatural grassland) increased or remained stable. The decline of widespread species requires additional conservation strategies in the wider landscape.";"VAN DYCK, HANS

Federal land management agencies are directed to monitor and manage rangelands at landscapes scales, but traditional field methods for measuring vegetation heights are often too costly and time consuming to apply at these broad scales. Emerging remote sensing techniques capable of measuring surface and vegetation height (e.g., LiDAR or synthetic aperture radar) are also often too expensive, require specialized sensors, or are not of high enough resolution to meet monitoring objectives. An alternative remote sensing approach that is potentially more accessible to managers is to measure vegetation heights from digital stereo aerial photographs. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and accuracy of estimating shrub heights from high-resolution (HR, 3-cm ground sampling distance) digital stereo-pair aerial images. Overlapping HR imagery was taken in March 2009 near Lake Mead, Nevada and 5-cm resolution digital surface models (DSMs) were created by photogrammetric methods for twenty-six test plots. We compared the heights of individual shrubs and plot averages derived from the DSMs to field measurements. Individual shrub heights were generally underestimated in the imagery, however, accuracy was higher for dense, compact shrubs compared with shrubs with thin branches. Plot height averages were also underestimated compared with the field measurements. Grasses and forbs in our plots were generally too small to be adequately modeled with the resolution of imagery we used. Estimates of vertical structure will be more accurate in plots having low herbaceous cover and high amounts of dense shrubs. Through the use of statistically derived correction factors or choosing field methods that better correlate with the imagery, vegetation heights from HR DSMs could be a valuable technique for broad-scale rangeland monitoring needs.";"Gillan, Jeffrey K.

Despite its growing use, it is not known whether smart growth can impact physical activity. This review utilizes existing built environment research on factors that have been used in smart growth planning to determine whether they are associated with physical activity or body mass. Searching the MEDLINE, Psycinfo and Web-of-Knowledge databases, 204 articles were identified for descriptive review, and 44 for a more in-depth review of studies that evaluated four or more smart growth planning principles. Five smart growth factors (diverse housing types, mixed land use, housing density, compact development patterns and levels of open space) were associated with increased levels of physical activity, primarily walking. Associations with other forms of physical activity were less common. Results varied by gender and method of environmental assessment. Body mass was largely unaffected. This review suggests that several features of the built environment associated with smart growth planning may promote important forms of physical activity. Future smart growth community planning could focus more directly on health, and future research should explore whether combinations or a critical mass of smart growth features is associated with better population health outcomes.";"Durand, C.P.

The elements of cadastral valuation model for building land are the following: the base value of the building land, the land area under jurisdiction conditioned by the purpose of use, correction coefficient of the area, the correction coefficient accounting for the changes in the market, the correction coefficient of encumbrances and the correction coefficient of pollution. Within framework of the research schematic solution of cadastral assessment process for building land has been developed, which shows the flow of information required for each element of cadastral valuation model for building land. An important role in particular cadastral valuation model is played by the indicators of real property market and the basis of cadastral value, as well as zoning of building land. The main conclusion of the research is that cadastral assessment process for building land is very complicated and it requires high quality information for each element of the model.

These changes have placed significant pressures on farmers and processors including more stringent quality control and product varieties.  The government has launched a rice production-marketing contract program in 2005 to assist rice farmers and the agro-business sector to work together as partners.  The minimum scale for each contract is 50 hectares of adjacent rice paddies with 50 participants including rice farmers, seedling providers, millers and marketing agents.  In order to evaluate the outcome of this program, a survey is conducted in the summer of 2005 after the first (spring) crop is harvested.  Information of price and value of output and major variable and fixed inputs are collected along with characteristics of the farmers and farms.  The survey results show that the average revenue of a contract farm is about 11 percent higher than an average non-contract farm.  The per hectare cost of production in a contract farm is about 13 percent lower and as a result the average profit margin under contract is more than 50 percent above those without contract.  A swtiching regression profit frontier model is adopted to further investigate their efficiency performance.  The result indicates that an average contract farms is 20 percent more efficient than an average non-contract farm in a comparable operating environment.  The result also suggests that although contract farming has potential to improve the profit of smallholders, it is not a sufficient condition for such improvement.";"Chang, Ching-Cheng

We argue that, in the presence of contractual externalities under which the landlords do not cooperatively act, multilateral contracting results in higher-powered contracts for the tenant, due to inefficient competition among the landlords, and that this incentive effect becomes a motivation for the use of cash rental contacts. Using the USDAfs AELOS data set, we show that the number of landlords per tenant indeed increases the likelihood of cash rent and changes the qualitative properties of the contract choice equation.

"AGRIS:US201400144537";"influence of land use patterns on water quality at multiple spatial scales in a river system";"";"The influence of land use patterns on water quality in a river system is scale‐dependent. In this study, a four‐order hierarchical arrangement method was used to select water sampling sites and to delineate sub‐basins in the Daliao River Basin, China. The 20 sub‐basins were classified into four spatial scales that represented four different stream orders. Pearson correlation analysis was used to quantify relationships between land use composition and the river's physical‐chemical variables for all samples collected. This analysis showed that the presence of forest cover was associated with higher water quality at the scale of the whole basin. The scale effects of land use patterns on water quality were then examined using stepwise multiple regression analysis that compared different land use types with water quality variables. The results from this analysis showed that urban areas, as opposed to forest areas, became the most significant contributors of water pollutants when scale effects were considered. The influence of urban land cover on water pollution was significantly higher at larger scales. The lack of a significant regression correlation for the forest land use type at smaller scales revealed that forest located upstream of the Daliao River Basin did not provide a buffer for improved water quality. Further analysis showed that this result could be because of disproportionate spatial distributions for forest and urban land use types. The topographic characteristics of sub‐basins, such as average slope (S) and size (A), were determined to be secondary explanatory variables that affected land use impacts on stream water quality. Areas with steep slopes were associated with increased water oxygenation, whereas areas with flatter slopes were associated with higher concentrations of pollutants. These results are significant because they can provide a better understanding of the appropriate spatial scale required for effective river basin management in the future.

Consequently, rigorous, yet efficient, monitoring protocols are needed to provide defensible quantitative data on the status and trends of rangeland vegetation. Rigor requires precise, repeatable measures, whereas efficiency requires the greatest possible information content for the amount of resources spent acquiring the information. We compared two methods--point frequency and visual estimate--of measuring canopy cover of individual plant species and groups of species (forbs vs. graminoids, native vs. nonnative) and plant species richness. These methods were compared in a variety of grassland vegetation types of the northern Great Plains for their precision, repeatability, and efficiency. Absolute precision of estimates was similar, but values generally differed between the two sampling methods. The point-frequency method yielded significantly higher values than the visual-estimate method for cover by individual species, graminoid cover, and total cover, and yielded significantly lower values for broadleaf (forb + shrub) cover and species richness. Differences in values derived by different sampling teams using the same method were similar between methods and within precision levels for many variables. Species richness and median species cover were the major exceptions; for these, the point-frequency method was far less repeatable. As performed in this study, the visual-estimate method required approximately twice the time as did the point-frequency method, but the former captured 55% more species. Overall, the visual-estimate method of measuring plant cover was more consistent among observers than anticipated, because of strong training, and captured considerably more species. However, its greater sampling time could reduce the number of samples and, therefore, reduce the statistical power of a sampling design if time is a limiting factor.";"Symstad, Amy J.

"AGRIS:FR2016226176";"Comprendre la dynamique régionale des exploitations de polyculture élevage pour accompagner le développement rural dans les Coteaux de Gascogne";"";"The Coteaux de Gascogne region, an upland area in south-western France, is a site where studies related to the future of landscapes and the sustainability of natural resource management are well documented. The local agricultural system is induced by a “house centred” society with the particularity of passing on the inheritance and farm estate identically from one generation to the next. This system generates a mosaic landscape made up of field crops, grasslands and woodlots. Local agriculture has experienced deep changes since the 1950s in relation with modernization and farm enlargement processes. Traditional farming systems were very diversified and turned towards subsistence. Nowadays, farming systems are market-oriented mixed crop-livestock farming, in which cattle is the main species raised. We have started a participatory research with local stakeholders for prospecting the future of livestock farming in the study area. We carried out a spatially explicit and exhaustive survey of the farms in 4 adjoining villages to assess the variety of family-farms, their agricultural land-management and their changes over recent decades. In this paper we present an initial typology assessing the current variety of the family-farms structure and functioning. The types of spatial and functional organization of farm territories appear to depend on farm size and access to land resources. In current socio-economical conditions, difficulty for farm transfer at the time of a farmer’s retirement and competition between crop and animal productions appear as main topical issues that challenge the future of local livestock farming. Their impacts on the sustainability of the local livestock sector and on landscape characteristics are major issues that will be considered in the modelling and scenarios of land-use and landscape change to be worked out in a subsequent step of the participatory research project.

Les Coteaux de Gascogne constituent un des terrains de recherche sur l’avenir des paysages ruraux et la durabilité de la gestion des ressources naturelles. Cette petite région du Sud-Ouest de la France est historiquement fondée sur un système social dit « à maison » caractérisé par une permanence des patrimoines fonciers et des exploitations agricoles. Le système agraire qui lui est lié génère une mosaïque de paysages composée de grandes cultures, de prairies liées à l’élevage bovin et de bois. L’agriculture locale a connu, depuis les années 1950, de profonds changements liés à la modernisation et à l’agrandissement des exploitations. A l’origine très diversifiées et tournées vers l’autoconsommation, les exploitations s’inscrivent aujourd’hui dans l’économie de marché tout en conservant une orientation de polyculture-élevage. Dans une perspective d’élaboration de scénarios d’évolution relatifs à l’élevage, nous avons mis en place un dispositif de recherche en partenariat. Il a été convenu, avec les partenaires, que la première étape de nos travaux porte sur l’amélioration de la connaissance des changements en cours dans les exploitations et la compréhension des stratégies des familles agricoles. A partir d’une enquête exhaustive et spatialisée des exploitations utilisant le territoire de quatre communes, nous avons, en premier lieu, élaboré une typologie pour disposer d’une représentation de la diversité de leurs situations. Les modes d’organisation spatiale et fonctionnelle des territoires d’exploitation montrent des situations contrastées liées à leur dimension et à leur accès aux ressources foncières. La transmission des exploitations et l’avenir de l’élevage bovin sont des questions pressantes qui constituent des éléments à intégrer dans les modèles et scénarios à élaborer.";"Choisis, Jean Philippe

Changed fire patterns across northern Australian savannas have been proposed as a factor contributing to recent declines of small‐ and medium‐sized mammals. Despite this, few studies have examined the mechanisms that underpin how species use habitat in fire‐affected landscapes. We determined the habitats and resources important to the declining golden‐backed tree‐rat (Mesembriomys macrurus) in landscapes partially burnt by recent intense fire. We aimed to (i) compare the relative use of rainforest and savanna habitats; (ii) examine the effect of fire history on use of savanna habitats; and (iii) identify key foraging and denning resources. Habitat selection was examined by comparing the availability of eight habitat types around real (used) and generated (available) location points. Individuals used a range of habitats, but consistently selected long unburnt rainforest in preference to recently burnt savanna (1–12 months post‐fire); however, recently burnt savanna was used in preference to long unburnt savanna. Tree‐rats foraged in Terminalia hadleyana, Planchonia rupestris, Celtis philippensis and Owenia vernicosa, tree species that are found in a variety of habitat types. Individuals used a range of den sites, including cliffs, trees, logs, scree and stags found throughout the study area. Although multiple factors may have led to the decline of Mes. macrurus across its range, these results are consistent with the idea that changes in the savanna structure as a consequence of contemporary fire patterns could also have a role. The continued persistence of Mes. macrurus in the northwest Kimberley may be supported by land management strategies that conserve fruiting and hollow‐bearing trees, and maintain the availability of fire‐sensitive vegetation types.";"Hohnen, Rosemary

In the specific case of China, impressive economic growth during the last decades exemplifies this process. Specifically, we focus on how changing economic dynamics are influencing land-use and land-cover change in Xishuangbanna, China. Xishuangbanna has the richest flora and fauna of China, but increasing demand for natural rubber and the expansion of rubber plantations is threatening this high-diversity region. We quantified land-use/land-cover change across Xishuangbanna using Landsat images from 1976, 1988, and 2003. The most obvious change was the decrease in forest cover and an increase in rubber plantations. In 1976, forests covered approximately 70% of Xishuangbanna, but by 2003 they covered less than 50%. Tropical seasonal rain forest was the forest type most affect by the expansion of rubber plantations, and a total of 139,576 ha was lost. The increase of rubber plantations below 800 m, shifted agricultural activities to higher elevations, which resulted in deforestation of mountain rain forest and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. Although these changes have affected the biodiversity and ecosystem services, we believe that long-term planning and monitoring can achieve a balance between economic and social needs of a growing population and the conservation of a highly diverse flora and fauna. Below 800 m , we recommend that no more rubber plantations be established, existing forest fragments should be protected, and riparian forests should be restored to connect fragments. Future rubber plantations should be established in the abandoned arable or shrublands at higher elevations, and tea or other crops should be planted in the understory to improve economic returns and reduce erosion.";"Li, Hongmei

However, the lack of detailed data on speciesâ local distributions is frequently a major constraint to identify effective indicators of impact and to prescribe effective conservation and management measures. Here we aim to describe and demonstrate the applicability of a novel looping approach to predict spatially dynamic ecological responses to LU/LC changes. The methodology integrates statistical downscaling, multi-model inference, stochastic-dynamic modelling and simulations, and spatial projections under a common and interactive framework. We illustrate the approach with a study of passerine foraging groups and their potential indicator role under LU/LC change scenarios. Based on the coarse occurrence data from published atlases, this approach allowed transposing species richness to fine resolutions in order to assess regional ecological integrity by up scaling the local responses of those indicators again at the landscape level. Overall, our proposed framework was able to provide realistic patterns of passerine foraging responses to LU/LC changes, highlighting the usefulness of existing databases for model-based research in addressing complex emergent problems across scales. Comparative analysis between simulations and independent field data showed a promising model performance, with consistent projections of the local passerine functional composition for a significant number of point-counts tested. Our approach represents a contribution for more universal applications in the scope of conservation and landscape planning, especially when fine resolution data is difficult to obtain due to resources constraints.";"Bastos, Rita

"AGRIS:US201300836826";"Land-cover and land-use change and its contribution to the large-scale organization of Puerto Rico's bird assemblages";"";"Global biodiversity is changing rapidly driven by human alteration of habitat, and nowhere this is more dramatic than in insular habitats. Yet land-cover change is a complex phenomenon that not only involves habitat destruction but also forest recovery over different time scales. Therefore, we might expect species to respond in diverse ways with likely consequences for the reorganization of regional assemblages. These changes, however, may be different in tropical islands because of their low species richness, generalist habits and high proportion of endemics. Here, we focus on the island of Puerto Rico and ask how island-wide changes in land cover and land use has influenced the large-scale organization of bird assemblages. To address this question, we combined in a Geographical Information System (GIS) the first 6 years (1997-2002) of the Puerto Rican Breeding Bird Survey (PR-BBS) with land-cover and land-use data extracted from a published digital map derived from the classification of Landsat images. A Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) ordination based on the composition and abundance of birds, and percentage land-use types showed that land use followed by climate could explain most of the variation observed among routes in terms of species composition and abundance. Moreover, endemic and exotic species were widely distributed throughout the island, but the proportion of endemic species is higher in closed forests while exotic species are more abundant in open habitats. However, historical accounts from the early 1900s indicate that endemic species were distributed across the entire island. Today, most of the land cover transformation in Puerto Rico occurs in the lowlands which may explain the high abundance of endemic species in cloud forests and the high abundance of exotic species in open habitats in the lowlands.";"Acevedo, Miguel A.

"AGRIS:US2016219048";"ALTA OR NLTA: WHAT'S IN THE NAME? LAND TENURE DILEMMA AND THE FIJI SUGAR INDUSTRY";"";"Since 1997, the agricultural leases on Native land, issued under the 1976 Agricultural and Landlord Tenants Act (ALTA), began to expire. The sugar industry is the main commodity export earner for Fiji, directly contributing about 22% of the national GDP and supporting over 25% of the country's active labor force. Fiji exports 80% of its sugar production, earning on average of $250-300 million in foreign exchange annually. Several options have been suggested, including: non-renewal of leases, with the land reverting to Fijian owners; renewal of ALTA but with land rents pegged to the gross value of production instead of the unimproved capital value; sharecropping and contract wage arrangements; and abolishment of lease arrangement under ALTA with leases to be issued under an institutional arrangement guided by the Native Lands Trust Act (NLTA).The land tenure system adopted will have a significant impact not only on the efficiency of the sugar cane sector but also on Fiji's ability to meet its international obligations of sugar exports. This paper explores the land tenure dilemma facing Fiji today. It assesses the economic implications of the various forms of land lease system proposed. This analysis is carried out in terms of efficiency, equity, and risk sharing in the current preferential market access environment and under possible future world market conditions. Suggestions are made on institutional arrangements that could enhance efficiency in resource use and encourage sharing of production risks that arise due to variability in factor prices and climatic conditions as well as sugar prices.";"Lal, Padma

Obtaining this data, especially for forests, can be challenging. These challenges can include the remoteness of the locations, and expense of equipment. A location with a long record of soil water content data and the potential provide this important data is the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) in Saskatchewan Canada. In and around the BERMS study area, there are five long-term soil water content profile stations. These stations potentially provide a critical but incomplete view of the soil water content patterns across a study domain of 10, 000 square kilometers, however, the representativeness of these observations for this purpose has not yet been evaluated. In coordination with the Canadian Experiment-Soil Moisture 2010 (CANEX-SM10), a temporary network of surface soil water content sensors was installed during the summer of 2010 to enhance the data resources of the BERMS network. During the 3-month deployment, 20 stations recorded surface soil water content which was then used as basis for up-scaling and validating the BERMS network and products from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Satellite. This large domain is approximately 1200 square kilometers and provides a higher confidence because of the increased number of sampling sites. Using temporal stability analysis, this network verified that the BERMS network could be scaled to a satellite scale footprint with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.025 m3/m3, and applied to the entire period of record.";"Cosh, Michael D.

The replacement of the existing low-efficiencyirrigation system could be the solution, but the recover of cost creates an affordability problem.Results suggest that a dual network, integrating agricultural and rural urban sectors, represents areal challenge for the Irrigation Board since this option meets the environmental goal and pass theeconomic sustainability test.";"Bazzani, Guido Maria";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"agriculture";"";"";"ITA";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016219044";"http://purl.umn.edu/6496";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016216727";"Land-Use Credits to Corn Ethanol: Accounting for Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles as a Feed Substitute in Swine Rations";"";"Many studies on the impact of biofuels on greenhouse gas emissions do not consider indirect land-use change and land use avoided because of co-products utilization. This paper provides estimates of the land-use credit for corn ethanol when its by-product—distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS)—is used in swine feed rations to substitute for corn and soymeal. The range of estimates used here covers the land-use credit used in the literature. Moreover, this study departs from earlier studies because feed rations from a least-cost optimization are used rather than rations from feeding trials, and DDGS nutrient profile variability is fully accounted for. As a result, displacement rates and the land-use credit can be better characterized using a distribution rather than a single point estimate. The land-use credit for corn ethanol for DDGS used in swine feed rations ranges from -0.367 to -0.596 hectares, whereby substitution for corn in the feed ration accounts for 56.09% and soymeal substitution contributes 48.46%. Variability of the land-use credit is contributed more by the variability of land use from the substitution of soymeal than that of corn. Finally, when feed compounders discount the DDGS nutrient profile to ensure they are at or above any realized nutrient profile 90% of the time, the land-use credit for corn ethanol declines by 8.47% for DDGS in a swine feed ration.";"Fabiosa, Jacinto F.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-04-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016216727";"http://purl.umn.edu/48854";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016213117";"Estimating the Implicit Value of Crop Stubble as a Barrier to Technology Adoption in Morocco";"";"For mixed cereal-livestock farmers, cereal production provides a bundle of goods.Grain is consumed by the household or sold at market, and crop residues are used aslivestock feed. The straw component of crop residue can be bought and sold at market andtherefore has a well-established local market price. Crop stubble, the portion of the crop residue left on the ground, is generally not traded and therefore has no market price. Some agricultural technologies require farmers to forgo using crop stubble as feed, and cultivation of high value crops entails sacrificing residue production altogether. In this paper we apply a structural econometric model to household data from Morocco to estimate the implicit value of crop stubble. We use a sample splitting technique to investigate differences in the value of this resource and find that it is significantly higher for smaller farmers, who therefore face an even larger barrier to technology adoption.";"Magnan, Nicholas

"AGRIS:US201301910651";"Biotic and Abiotic Changes in Ecosystem Structure over a Shrub-Encroachment Gradient in the Southwestern USA";"";"In this study, we investigate changes in ecosystem structure that occur over a gradient of land-degradation in the southwestern USA, where shrubs are encroaching into native grassland. We evaluate a conceptual model which posits that the development of biotic and abiotic structural connectivity is due to ecogeomorphic feedbacks. Three hypotheses are evaluated: 1. Over the shrub-encroachment gradient, the difference in soil properties under each surface-cover type will change non-linearly, becoming increasingly different; 2. There will be a reduction in vegetation cover and an increase in vegetation-patch size that is concurrent with an increase in the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties over the shrub-encroachment gradient; and 3. Over the shrub-encroachment gradient, the range at which soil properties are autocorrelated will progressively exceed the range at which vegetation is autocorrelated. Field-based monitoring of vegetation and soil properties was carried out over a shrub-encroachment gradient at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, USA. Results of this study show that vegetation cover decreases over the shrub-encroachment gradient, but vegetation-patch size increases, with a concurrent increase in the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties. Typically, there are significant differences in soil properties between non-vegetated and vegetated surfaces, but for grass and shrub patches, there are only significant differences for the biotic soil properties. Results suggest that it is the development of larger, well-connected, non-vegetated patches that is most important in driving the overall behavior of shrub-dominated sites. Results of this study support the hypothesis that feedbacks of functional connectivity reinforce the development of structural connectivity, which increases the resilience of the shrub-dominated state, and thus makes it harder for grasses to re-establish and reverse the vegetation change.";"Turnbull, Laura
