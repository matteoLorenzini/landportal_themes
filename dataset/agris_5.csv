"AGRIS:US201400131655";"Study on the diurnal change of microclimate and human comfort in five types of land covers";"";"The role of urban parks in the microclimatic conditions of cities in summer is investigated in this paper through monitoring campaigns carried out at the Beijing Olympic forestry park. Five kinds of land cover, namely urban woods, lawn, bare concrete cover, water areas and wetlands were selected to study on the temperature, humidity and human comfort. The air temperature and relative humidity were measured once every two hours from 8:00 to 20:00 every day and continuously three days in July 2010. The results showed that the microclimate of these five kinds of land cover had signiﬁcant differences during the day. In general, the air temperature of these five types of land cover complied with the order during the middle of the day: bare concrete cover > wetlands > lawn > water areas > woods, with reversed order in the late afternoon when the air temperature of the lawn became the lowest. Compared with the bare concrete cover, the other four types of land cover can decrease temperature 1.0-3.5°C at noon. Finally, the human thermal comfort of the five kinds of land cover was assessed with the discontent index (DI). The DI in five kinds of land cover was the highest at 14:00, and the lowest at 8:00. The woods had the lowest DI while the bare concrete cover had the highest one at 14:00, and the lawn cover had the lowest DI while the wetlands had the highest one at 20:00.";"Yan, H.

"AGRIS:US201301638654";"Efficiency and effectiveness in representative reserve design in Canada: The contribution of existing protected areas";"";"To be effective, reserve networks should represent all target species in protected areas that are large enough to ensure species persistence. Given limited resources to set aside protected areas for biodiversity conservation, and competing land uses, a prime consideration for the design of reserve networks is efficiency (the maximum biodiversity represented in a minimum number of sites). However, to be effective, networks may sacrifice efficiency. We used reserve selection algorithms to determine whether collections of existing individual protected areas in Canada were efficient and/or effective in terms of representing the diversity of disturbance-sensitive mammals in Canada in comparison to (1) an optimal network of reserves, and (2) sites selected at random. Unlike previous studies, we restricted our analysis to individual protected areas that met a criterion for minimum reserve size, to address issues of representation and persistence simultaneously. We also tested for effectiveness and efficiency using historical and present-day data to see whether protected area efficiency and/or effectiveness varied over time. In general, existing protected areas did not effectively capture the full suite of mammalian species diversity, nor are most existing protected areas part of a near-optimal solution set. To be effective, Canada's network of reserves will require at minimum 22 additional areas of >2700km². This study shows that even when only those reserves large enough to be effective are considered, protected areas systems may not be representative, nor were they representative at the time of establishment.";"Wiersma, Yolanda F.

As some forecasts had suggested, corn acreage increasedmostly on farms that previously specialized in soybeans. Other farms, however, offsetthis shift by expanding soybean production. Farm-level data reveal that the simultaneousnet expansion of corn and soybean acreage resulted from a reduction in cotton acreage, a shift from uncultivated hay to cropland, and the expansion of double cropping (consecutively producing two crops of either like or unlike commodities on the same land within the same year).";"Wallander, Steven

"AGRIS:US201500155563";"future of bioenergy and rural development policies in Africa and Asia";"";"This special issue has presented some of the specific findings of the RE-Impact Project which was commissioned and funded by the EuropeAid Cooperation Office from 2007 until its conclusion in 2010. The project aimed to provide impact assessment frameworks and influence relevant policies through direct involvement in bioenergy projects and policy analysis in South Africa, Uganda, India and China. The papers summarised here have covered issues related to Jatropha curcas and forest-based bioenergy in these countries. Taking an overall look at the project findings we can identify a number of general conclusions relevant for the future of bioenergy and rural development in Africa and Asia. First, only local and context-specific sustainability assessment can identify the risk and responsibilities of the different groups and the exact impact on the environment. Second, many initiatives both in biofuels and forest-based bioenergy are marred by a lack of understanding of the life-cycle financial analysis. Third, careful consideration of local physical and social conditions and the economics of the production chain can identify real opportunities for rural development using bioenergy. The current global impasse in bioenergy policies could actually be advantageous to the development of bioenergy in developing countries. Without the pressure from America and Europe to develop bioenergy systems for climate change mitigation, countries in Africa and Asia may have the breathing room to shape bioenergy systems for their own internal energy supply in an orderly fashion. However, in order to avoid environmental and social impacts it will be necessary to articulate together elements of a number of measures including market-based certification, national policy formulation, national legislation, impact assessments, sustainability planning, land use planning, research, monitoring and evaluation taking into account country and project specific sustainability criteria. Unfortunately, many of the countries in Africa and Asia where bioenergy can play an important role still lack institutional structures able to articulate this sustainable development.";"Amezaga, Jaime M.

"AGRIS:LV2014000473";"Engineering and economic calculations for assessing land consolidation";"";"Land consolidation is a new concept in Latvia, although in other countries of the world it has been known since the end of the 18th century. Land consolidation is implemented to improve the spatial structure of land holdings and agricultural infrastructure and to rationally use natural resources. It is particularly significant in agriculture when establishing farms of optimal size and territorial location. Land fragmentation hinders not only land management but also increases the transport cost. In the present research, land consolidation is viewed as an excellent instrument to enhance the spatial structure of agricultural holdings, reduce land fragmentation and increase the area size of agricultural holdings by fostering efficient use of land in accordance with the territorial development plan determining land uses in the future. The case of land consolidation and the calculation of the consolidation efficiency are based on Zemgale region Vircava parish of Jelgava municipality, as a benchmark for the region most suited for agricultural production in Latvia. Determining the economic gains from land consolidation may be based on the developed model for calculating the economic indicators of farms.";"Platonova, D., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia)

Predator densities outside of protected areas are often understudied and management decisions are based on assumptions of predator numbers. This study conducted three spoor surveys on commercial farmland in Botswana to estimate large predator densities. Brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) were found to occur evenly across both cattle and game farms at higher densities than previously assumed. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus) were more commonly located on game ranches, at or below population density assumptions. This study demonstrated the importance but difficulties of conducting predator surveys on farmland, where study animals are often at risk of persecution by landowners, due to the perceived or real threat predators may pose to livestock and stocked game.";"Boast, Lorraine K.

"AGRIS:US201600190617";"Benefits of wildlife-based land uses on private lands in Namibia and limitations affecting their development";"";"Legislative changes during the 1960sâ1970s granted user rights over wildlife to landowners in southern Africa, resulting in a shift from livestock farming to wildlife-based land uses. Few comprehensive assessments of such land uses on private land in southern Africa have been conducted and the associated benefits are not always acknowledged by politicians. Nonetheless, wildlife-based land uses are growing in prevalence on private land. In Namibia wildlife-based land use occurs over c. 287,000 kmÂ². Employment is positively related to income from ecotourism and negatively related to income from livestock. While 87% of meat from livestock is exported â¥Â 95% of venison from wildlife-based land uses remains within the country, contributing to food security. Wildlife populations are increasing with expansion of wildlife-based land uses, and private farms contain 21â33 times more wildlife than in protected areas. Because of the popularity of wildlife-based land uses among younger farmers, increasing tourist arrivals and projected impacts of climate change on livestock production, the economic output of wildlife-based land uses will probably soon exceed that of livestock. However, existing policies favour livestock production and are prejudiced against wildlife-based land uses by prohibiting reintroductions of buffalo Syncerus caffer, a key species for tourism and safari hunting, and through subsidies that artificially inflate the profitability of livestock production. Returns from wildlife-based land uses are also limited by the failure to reintroduce other charismatic species, failure to develop fully-integrated conservancies and to integrate black farmers sufficiently.";"Lindsey, P.

"AGRIS:US201600003819";"Is Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change Necessary in Grazed Rangelands?";"";"In this article we test the notion that adaptation to climate change in grazed rangelands requires little more effort than current approaches to risk management because the inherent climate variability that characterizes rangelands provides a management environment that is preadapted to climate change. We also examine the alternative hypothesis that rangeland ecosystems and the people they support are highly vulnerable to climate change. Past climate is likely to become an increasingly poor predictor of the future, so there is a risk in relying on adaptation approaches developed solely in response to existing variability. We find incremental, autonomous adaptation will be sufficient to deal with most of the challenges provided by the gradual expression of climate change in the next decade or two. However, projections of greater climate change in the future means that the responses required are qualitatively as well as quantitatively different and are beyond the existing suite of adaptation strategies and coping range. The proactive adaptation responses required go well beyond incremental on-farm or local actions. New policies will be needed to deal with transformational changes associated with land tenure issues and challenges of some displacement and migration of people in vulnerable parts of rangelands. Even where appropriate adaptation actions can be framed, issues of when to act and how much to act in a proactive way remain a challenge for research, management, and policy. Whether incremental or transformational involving system changes, a diversity of adaptation options will be required in different rangeland regions to enhance social and ecological resilience.";"Ash, Andrew

"AGRIS:US2016205864";"The possibilities of rural development and the potential role of hunting tourism in rural development";"";"Rural development is of great significance for the future of both the EU and Hungary.We must reduce migration, create new jobs and focus on sustainability and the principles and goals of environmental protection and nature conservation. For this reason, it is necessary to apply for EU project funding.EU priorities regarding rural development serve the creation of a ‘liveable countryside’.Rural development is connected to tourism that can help compensate for decreasingincome from agriculture.Services related to hunting could achieve a significant role in the development of tourism as they can be harmonised with rural development and with rural and ecotourism.Hunting tourism and game management can be connected to several rural development goals, so it would be important to include them in applications for rural development project funding. Game management and hunting tourism could play a significant role in rural development as they are almost totally independent from geographicaland other characteristics.Hunting tourism is only partly related to the present structure of tourism since the organisational tasks are carried out by hunting organisation agencies. Although the professional and organisational framework of hunting tourism is laid down, its marketing activities and quality standards should be improved.Hungarian hunting tourism plays a leading role in Europe. It is of special interest to all of us to protect and improve its position.";"Marselek, Sandor

"AGRIS:US2016205860";"Revenue-Recycling and the Efficiency and Spatial Distributional Impacts of Development Taxes";"";"Recent studies that compare the efficiency and distributional impacts of alternative instruments to curb sprawl typically ignore what to do with the revenues from anti-sprawl policies, such as development taxes. This paper extends first-best analysis of development taxes aimed atpreserving land at the urban fringe to account for interactions with other distortions within the urban system. By incorporating urban decline at the city core, which in turn, generates negativeneighborhood spillover effects and extra pressure for development at the urban fringe, we provide a more complete framework to evaluate the efficiency and distributional impacts of developmenttaxes. We consider three potential alternative schemes to recycle the revenues: lump sum recycling, earmarked revenues to purchase conservation easements that permanently save open space and earmarked revenues to subsidize a revitalization program at the city core. In thissetting, when revenues from the development tax are earmarked to fund a conservation easement there is an additional welfare gain (relative to the lump sum case) because the threat of future conversation of open space is fully eliminated. Similarly, when revenues are earmarked to fund arevitalization program at the city core, there are additional sources of welfare that make this policy preferred relative to the lump-sum recycling scheme. Finally, we also explore the spatial distributional impacts of these three alternative recycling schemes.";"Bento, Antonio M.

"AGRIS:US201500058312";"effects of land tenure and land use on the urban forest structure and composition of Melbourne";"";"The urban forest provides valuable ecosystem services for enhancing human well-being. Its structure and composition determine the quantity and quality of these services. There has been little research on the heterogeneity in structure and composition of urban forests in the Australasian region, especially in the centre of a highly dynamic and rapidly urbanizing city. This paper quantifies the structure and the composition of the urban forest of Melbourne, Australia's city centre. The effects of land tenure and land use on the heterogeneity of canopy cover, tree density and canopy size were explored. Species and family composition by land use, land ownership and street type were also analysed using the Shannon–Wiener and Jaccard similarity indices. Most of the canopy cover in the city centre is located on public land and is unevenly distributed across the municipality. The mean canopy cover (12.3%) is similar to that found for whole city studies around the world, which often include peri-urban forests. Similarly to other cities, structure varied across different land uses, and tree size, density and cover varied with land tenure and street type. The diversity index shows that the urban forest is rich in species (H′=2.9) and is dominated by native species. Improving the distribution, and increasing tree cover and variety of species will result in a more resilient urban centre, able to provide multiple ecosystem services to their residents and its large population of visitors and workers. The study of the urban centre provides further understanding of compact city morphologies, and allows inter-city comparison independent of the size.";"Dobbs, Cynnamon

"AGRIS:US201500058314";"Developing a complementary framework for urban ecology";"";"Cities are characterized by dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical forces. Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design – “E-LAUD” – affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, ‘habitat islands’ and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services.";"Kattel, Giri R.

This study combines remote sensing techniques and a coupled GIS-CENTURY model to estimate regional biomass C stocks and SOC dynamics for Guiera senegalensis shrub communities in Senegal's Peanut Basin. A statistical model relating field-measured shrub aboveground biomass C at training plots to satellite image-derived shrub abundances was developed and used to estimate regional biomass C across a major part of the Basin. Regional SOC dynamics were modeled by coupling the CENTURY model and GIS databases. Significant correlation (r =0.73; p =0.05) was observed between aboveground biomass C and satellite image-derived shrub abundance at the training plots. Aboveground biomass C stocks ranged from 0.01 to 0.45Mgha⁻¹ with an approximate total of 247,000MgC for the 3060km² study area. CENTURY model predictions indicate that C sequestration in these systems is contingent on long-term effectiveness of non-thermal management of shrub residue and that the actual rates depend strongly on soil type and scenarios of future land management. Compared with the traditional “pruning-burned” management practice, returning prunings for 50 years would increase soil C sequestration by 200-350% without fertilization, and increase soil C sequestration by 270-483% under a low (35kgha⁻¹ Nyr⁻¹; 20kgha⁻¹ Pyr⁻¹) fertilization regime, depending on soil type and climate conditions. These results indicate that altered land management could contribute to transforming these degraded semiarid agroecosystems from a source to a sink for atmospheric CO₂.";"Lufafa, A.

The main natural disturbance in these forests is wildfire, which modifies the carbon budget and atmosphere, directly and indirectly. Wildfire emissions in Russia contribute substantially to the global carbon cycle and have potentially important feedbacks to changing climate. Published estimates of carbon emissions from fires in Russian boreal forests vary greatly depending on the methods and data sets used. We examined various fire and vegetation products used to estimate wildfire emissions for Siberia. Large (up to fivefold) differences in annual and monthly area burned estimates for Siberia were found among four satellite-based fire data sets. Official Russian data were typically less than 10% of satellite estimates. Differences in the estimated proportion of annual burned area within each ecosystem were as much as 40% among five land-cover products. As a result, fuel consumption estimates would be expected to vary widely (3%â98%) depending on the specific vegetation mapping product used and as a function of weather conditions. Verification and validation of burned area and land-cover data sets along with the development of fuel maps and combustion models are essential for accurate Siberian wildfire emission estimates, which are central to balancing the carbon budget and assessing feedbacks to climate change.";"Kukavskaya, Elena A.

"AGRIS:US201300913155";"Plant responses to agricultural intensification";"";"1. A large proportion of the world's land surface is extensively managed for livestock production. In areas where livestock systems are becoming more intensive, a major challenge is to predict those plant species likely to decline, persist or increase as a result of agricultural intensification. 2. Most analyses develop inferences for frequent or abundant species, or rely on intensive studies of single species. A promising approach is to identify plant traits related to disturbance to enable inference to be made about changes in plant community composition. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyse the response to agricultural intensification of 494 plant species of pastures and woodlands in southern Australia, and to identify how simple species' traits (life form, growth form and species origin) influence those responses. 3. The probability of occurrence of most species declined along the two intensification gradients, grazing intensity and soil phosphorous concentration, although the occurrence of a greater proportion of species was negatively correlated with soil phosphorous. Responses could be broadly predicted from both plant origin and plant traits, in particular growth form. 4. Native perennial geophytes, ferns and shrubs were most negatively affected by both gradients, while exotic annual grasses and forbs were more tolerant. Along the phosphorous gradient, 24 of the 30 most negatively affected plant species were native geophytes. Mean within-group responses masked considerable within- and between-species variation, particularly for the exotic species group which included species that responded both negatively and positively to intensification. 5. Synthesis and applications. The hierarchical model described here provides a powerful method for estimating individual plant responses and identifying how species' traits influence those responses. Plant species native to southern Australia are sensitive to grazing and phosphorous apparently due to a shared evolutionary history of low grazing intensity and low phosphorous soils. Invading exotic plants have faced strongly contrasting ecological filters, leading to a greater diversity of responses. Where grazing systems have been most intense, a small suite of exotics dominate. Maintaining native and functional plant diversity will necessitate limits being placed on intensive livestock management systems.";"Dorrough, Josh

Data from Egerton University’s Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development was used for the analysis.. A two step Heckman model was employed to estimate the extent of engagement in daily and semi-permanent contracts conditional on choice of contract. Results from the study show that casual and semi-permanent contracts are substitutes.  Family labour negatively influences engagement in daily and semi-permanent contracts hence it is a substitute to the two forms of the contracts. Increase in wages paid to casual contracts is negative and significant to the extent of daily contract engagement but positive and significant to semi-permanent contracts supporting the substitutability of daily contracts for semi-permanent contracts. Methods and costs of farm preparation are significant in influencing the choice and demand for any type of contracts. The proxy variable for hoarding costs is significant and positive indicating that there are hoarding costs incurred in the maintaining a steady pool of labour within the farm. From the results the relatively asset poor farmers engage in the wage high daily contracts to avoid incurring hoarding costs as indicated by the dummy denoting poverty level. However, to avoid uncertainty during peak periods semi-permanent contracts are highly employed by the asset poor farmers. From the results, farmers willing to minimize hoarding costs may find themselves substituting family labour for daily contracts or in absence of family labour, semi-permanent contracts for daily contracts.";"Gathungu, E.

A evolução dos desmatamentos realizada pelos produtores rurais é condicionada por características das famílais produtoras e pelo ambiente socioeconômico. O objetivo desse estudo foi identificar os condicionantes de desmatamentos nos principais pólos de produção agropecuária familiar no estado do Acre. Foi utilizado o modelo econométrico logit multinomial para essa avaliação. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que maior disponibilidade de mão-de-obra familiar, acesso a crédito, maior patrimônio, maior ocorrência de contratação de trabalho e titulação definitiva dos lotes de terra são fatores causais de maior desmatamento e que maior tamanho do lote e maior nível de consciência ambiental por parte dos produtores são fatores que atuam para a menor proporção de terra desmatada nas pequenas propriedades. Os resultados mostram que melhoria na renda e riqueza das famílias não tem resultado em maior preservação das matas nativas nas regiões estudadas, o que indica que políticas de melhoria de renda e qualidade de vida devem ser acompanhadas de medidas que favoreçam a conservação dos recursos naturais, especialmente a redução dos desmatamentos.----------------------------------------------The development of agricultural and cattle production has addressed larger deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, and it lead to greenhouse gas emissions and to biodiversity loss.

Based on a study of two land deals in Kenya's Tana Delta, this paper considers the processes by which blueprint designs are amended or delayed through the involvement of local actors. It demonstrates that even top-down acquisition of land by powerful state-linked actors with the support of policy discourse can be stalled by the rural poor, particularly if the latter have strong customary claims and links to wider opposition. At the same time, large-scale land acquisition is not automatically opposed by local people, who may see land deals as an opportunity to safeguard access to resources and to support their development expectations. The paper also suggests that although consultation and the existence of recognised property rights appear to result in fairer project designs, land deals are likely to reflect the decision-making power of an elite that is not fully informed. The conclusion affirms the need for more nuanced, place-based analyses of large-scale land deals, taking into account tenure arrangements, resource access mechanisms, land management discourses and the role of cross-scale agency and alliances in building support for, or opposition to, such deals.";"Smalley, Rebecca

The reconstruction of low-value forest stands (LVFSR) should become an effective measure for forest management on such areas. The experimental industrial station was the object of the study. It was founded by the Vologda laboratory of the Northern Forestry Research Institute. The LVFSR was carried out by means of planting and care of it. The total area of the low-value forest stands development of the open and shrubs overgrown territories was 42 hectares. The low-value forest stands reconstruction by means of planting due to ridging and fir trees planting in both sheets allows increasing the area occupied by conifers from 25% to 41%. Plough furrows improve moisture regime of the soil. Ground water does not come to the day surface even in the flood period. Before begin of vegetation growth (in May) the layer of root zone soil is free from suspended water and average vegetative level of ground water within the whole channel space between dehumidifiers is 69-78 cm. Vegetation period of forest forming species on the assumption of the soil temperature regime and the depth of the soil horizon (10 cm and 30 cm) was 135-172 days.

Безлесные площади после сплошных рубок и пожаров подвержены периодическому переувлажнению, что ведет к заболачиванию. Эффективным мероприятием в отношении ведения лесного хозяйства на таких площадях должна стать реконструкция малоценных насаждений (РМН). Объектом исследования явился опытно-производственный стационар, заложенный Вологодской лабораторией Северного НИИ лесного хозяйства. РМН велась посредством создания лесных культур и последующих уходов в них. Общая площадь освоения малоценных насаждений открытых и заросших кустарниковой растительностью территорий составила 42 га. РМН посредством создания лесных культур за счет нарезки борозд и посадки ели в оба пласта позволяет увеличить площадь, занятую хвойными породами, от 25% до 41%. Нарезка плужных борозд улучшает водный режим почв. Почвенно-грунтовые воды не выходят на дневную поверхность даже в паводковый период. К началу роста растительности (май) корнеобитаемый слой почвы свободен от гравитационной воды, а средневегетационный уровень почвенно-грунтовых вод во всем межканальном пространстве среди осушителей составляет 69-78 см.

Self-imposed governance with spatial property rights, internal rules and co-management resulted in successful local shellfisheries. At the national level, the long-term Chilean governability system, which included sea-zoning for artisanal and industrial fleets and exclusive allocation of rights to artisanal shellfish communities, successfully tamed wicked management problems. However, the combination of weak governance, globalization of markets, fishing pressure and climate change exacerbated depletion patterns in most LAC shellfisheries. Increasing market prices exceed the low costs of harvesting low abundance coastal shellfish, and together with illegal trade, have driven some species to levels close to extinction (anthropogenic Allee effect). Mass shellfish mortalities driven by climate variability are threatening stocks and may swamp management and governance schemes. Coastal shellfisheries urgently require the implementation of resilient management and effective long-term governance schemes under pressing conditions of change and uncertainty.";"Defeo, Omar

Quantifying the relationship between eutrophication and land use can help effectively manage land use to improve water quality. Previous studies principally utilized land use quantity as an indicator to link water quality parameters, but these studies lacked insight into the impact of land use intensity. Taking the upper catchment of Miyun Reservoir as a case study, we developed a method of aggregating land use quantity and intensity to build a new land use indicator and tested its explanatory power on water quality. Six nutrient concentrations from 52 sub-watersheds covering the whole catchment were used to characterize the spatial distribution of eutrophication. Based on spatial techniques, empirical conversion coefficients, remote sensing data, and socio-economic statistical data, land use intensity was measured and mapped visually. The new land use indicator was calculated and linked to nutrient concentrations by Pearson correlation coefficients. Results demonstrated that our new indicator incorporating intensity information can quantify the different nutrient-exporting abilities of different land use areas. Compared to traditional indicators that only incorporate land use quantity, most Pearson correlation coefficients between the new indicator and water nutrient concentrations increased. This new information enhanced the explanatory power of land use on water nutrient concentrations, and so will be able to help us understand the impact of land use on water quality and guide decision making for better land use management.";"Xu, Erqi

Mountain Ash forests have been extensively modified through a century of intensive logging, recurrent wildfires and post-fire salvage logging. These disturbances have led to a reduction in old growth forest to 1/30th-1/60th of the extent of historical levels, a rapid collapse followed by a prolonged (â¯30-year) shortage of populations of hollow-bearing trees throughout the Mountain Ash forests (which are critical habitat elements for many species of cavity-dependent vertebrates), and an increased risk of re-burning of landscapes dominated by young, regrowth forest. The consequences of the severe decline and consequent âtemporary extinctionâ of large old trees will be the potential global extinction of Leadbeater's Possum whose distribution is significantly associated with the number of large old trees. We outline the conservation and forest restoration principles and practices that are needed to address these problems. We discuss how general principles for forest restoration must be multi-faceted and multi-scaled by encompassing strategies ranging from retaining existing key residual elements of original natural forest cover (e.g. remaining populations of target species, key structures, habitats, and patches) through to restoring patterns of forest cover and key ecosystem processes. We also outline how forest restoration principles intersect strongly with similarly multi-faceted and multiscaled general principles for forest biodiversity conservation - in particular, those corresponding to conserving populations of particular species and their habitats, maintaining stand structural complexity, maintaining patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and perpetuating key ecosystem processes. Finally, we outline the potential for positive cumulative benefits of multiple restoration and conservation strategies by outlining how actions at one scale can create benefits at other (smaller or larger) scales.";"Lindenmayer, David B.

Between 2011 and 2013, we combined farmer participatory research approaches, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to (1) understand the contribution of CNRPs to household food and income in Dendenyore and Ushe smallholder communities in Hwedza District, eastern Zimbabwe and (2) assess changes of the CNRPs in both space and time, and their implications on climate change adaptation. Across study sites, wetlands and woodlands were ranked as the most important CNRPs. Extraction and use patterns of products from the different pools differed among households of different resource endowment. Resource-constrained households (RG3) sold an average of 183 kg household⁻¹ year⁻¹ of wild loquats fruits (Uapaca kirkiana), realising about US$48, while resource-endowed farmers (RG1) had no need to sale any. The RG3 households also realised approximately US$70 household⁻¹ year⁻¹ from sale of crafts made from water reeds (Phragmites mauritianus). Empirical data closely supported communities’ perceptions that CNRPs had declined significantly in recent years compared with two to three decades ago. More than 60 % of the respondents perceived that the availability of natural resources drawn from wetlands and woodlands, often used for food, energy and crafts, has decreased markedly since the 1980s. Classification of land cover in a GIS environment indicated that CNRPs declined between 1972 and 2011, supporting farmers’ perceptions. Overall, woodlands declined by 37 % in both communities, while the total area under wetlands decreased by 29 % in Ushe, a drier area and 49 % in Dendenyore, a relatively humid area. The over-reliance in CNRPs by rural communities could be attributed to continued decline in crop yields linked to increased within-season rainfall variability, and the absence of alternative food and income sources. This suggests limited options for rural communities to adapt to the changing food production systems in the wake of climate change and variability and other challenges such as declining soil fertility. There is therefore a need to design adaptive farm management options that enhance both crop and livestock production in a changing climate as well as identifying other livelihood alternatives outside agriculture to reduce pressure on CNRPs. In addition, promotion of alternative sources of energy such as solar power and biogas among rural communities could reduce the cutting of trees for firewood from woodlands.";"Chagumaira, Christopher

"AGRIS:US201500207509";"Agricultural drought trends and mitigation in Tillaberí, Niger";"";"Whether aggravated agricultural drought in the Sahel is related to a changing climate (meteorological drought, i.e., deficit of rainfall or unfavourable rainfall distribution) or to land use and land degradation (soil-water drought, i.e., decreased water infilitration and water holding capacity) is a much-debated issue. Global climate models and trend analysis show little agreement on how rainfall and meteorological drought are changing in the region, and research has increasingly attributed agricultural drought to an imbalanced rainwater distribution over the root zone caused by human-induced land degradation. This paper investigates the extent of both meteorological and soil-water drought on “laterite” soils in the Tillaberí region of Niger and their effect on millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) growth by combining monthly (1905–1996) and daily (1989–2010) rainfall analysis with analysis of the root zone water distribution under different management practices. The treatments include: zaï + manure (Z), demi-lunes + manure (DL), scarification + manure (SCAR), control + manure (CF) and control (C). Our findings suggest that increasing agricultural drought does not originate from a decreasing annual amount of rainfall. However, other daily rainfall parameters more important for crop biomass productivity than total rainfall amount, such as the number of dry spells, do appear to have recently worsened. Dry-spell analysis showed increased drought risks during the vegetative growth phase (0–40 DAS) and the vulnerable grain formation phase (90–110 DAS, Days After Sowing). The extremely low grain yields and values of soil-water storage below the critical value for water stress of the control treatments, moreover, confirm poor root zone water distribution. DL and Z however, show potential, to mitigate both dry spells and soil-water drought, as they induce an important increase of soil-water storage, resulting in higher grain yields. In order to optimize these water and soil conservation (WSC) techniques and to increase their potential for drought mitigation, the underlying features enabling increased soil-water storage, including water balance analysis, soil physical properties, nutrient management and system design, should be tackled in future studies.";"Wildemeersch, Jasmien C.J.

"AGRIS:US201500200221";"Valuing local knowledge as a source of expert data: Farmer engagement and the design of decision support systems";"";"Engagement with farmers and landowners is often undertaken by the research community to obtain information relating to typical land, livestock and enterprise management and generally centres on responses to questionnaire surveys. Farmers and land managers are constituted as expert observers of ground-level processes and provide diverse information on farming practices, enterprise economics and underpinning attitudes towards risk. Research projects designed to inform policy and practice may rely on such data to understand better on-the-ground decisions that can impact on environmental quality and the rural economy. Such approaches to eliciting local-level expert knowledge can generate large quantities of data from which to formulate rules relating to farm enterprise types. In turn, this can help to inform the structure of Decision Support Systems (DSS) and risk-based tools to determine farming practices likely to impact on environmental quality. However, in this paper we advocate the need for integrated farmer participation throughout the whole research process – from project inception through to community qualitative validation and legitimation - and thus not just for the elicitation of questionnaire responses. With farm questionnaire surveys being adopted widely by the research community, it is an opportune time to highlight a recent case study of the Taw catchment, Devon, UK. This serves as an example of co-construction of a DSS via a co-ordinated and integrated approach to expert elicitation with a farmer questionnaire survey as a central methodology. The aim of the paper is to detail the core aspects of an iterative cycle of participatory environmental management and DSS development for water quality protection and consider the multiple benefits of co-ordinated programmes of engagement with the farming community in this process.";"Oliver, David M.

Four soils (0â30 cm depth) were studied in a semi-arid region with different uses and management regimes: two soils with olive cultivation, both under a non-tillage regime and one with a cover crop (OCC) and the other without (ONT); a fluvial terrace soil (FT) with cerealâsunflowerâfallow rotation; and an unaltered soil under natural vegetation (oak trees; OT). The OT soil had a higher SOC concentration than the agricultural soils (OCC, ONT and FT), followed by the FT soil without significant differences. The olive grove soils had a lower SOC concentration but the two types of management differed significantly, with higher concentrations due to the cover crop. Hydrofluoric acid (HF)-soluble, hydrochloric acid (HCl)-resistant, and non-oxidizable (sodium peroxodisulphate; NaâSâOâ) SOC fractions were determined at different depths (0â5, 5â10, 10â20 and 20â30 cm). The relative HCl-resistant and non-oxidizable SOC fractions increased with depth, whereas the relative HF-soluble SOC fraction varied slightly among the four soils considered. Differences in the SOC-stabilization mechanism were found according to the chemical SOC fractionation. In the FT and OT soils, where HF-soluble SOC and soil respiration rates were higher, the intense biological activity rapidly degraded the plant debris, being partially fixed and stabilized by the fine mineral-soil fraction as the principal stabilization mechanism of SOC. The olive grove soils had lower biological activity but higher SOC resistance to oxidation with NaâSâOâ, thus suggesting that chemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter was a relevant stabilization mechanism in these soils.";"SIERRA, M.

"AGRIS:US201500213458";"Quantitative assessment of groundwater pollution intensity on typical contaminated sites in China using grey relational analysis and numerical simulation";"";"Groundwater vulnerability assessment is an important method for groundwater pollution risk assessment. However, vulnerability assessment results rarely consider groundwater pollution concentration. Few quantitative studies consider groundwater pollutant concentration in different hydrogeological conditions. HYDRUS-1D software can simulate different concentrations of pollutants reaching the shallow aquifer under some vadose zone conditions. However, HYDRUS-1D simulation parameter settings are complicated; thus, it is difficult to simulate groundwater pollution intensity (GPI) on the site with limited information. In this study, the issue of site data constraints for model predictions is solved. Ammonia–nitrogen is selected as an indicator, and a method for quantitative groundwater pollution assessment based on grey relational analysis (GRA) is proposed. According to two factors (inherent, extrinsic) of groundwater vulnerability assessment, and on the basis of the information from 18 contaminated sites, primary GPI control factors, including emission concentration, hydraulic conductivity, soil density and diffusion coefficient, are filtered using GRA. These four factors are utilized as variables to establish a multiple linear regression (MLR) equation, which is used to predict the GPI of polluted sites. Compared with a HYDRUS-1D simulation, the proposed GPI prediction method can effectively predict GPI with simpler input conditions. The established MLR equation satisfies a significance test and small error analysis. Comparative results between simulation values and regression values on the established case show that the regression values are closer to the measured value. Hence, the MLR equation is practical and can be applied for sensible groundwater source management and land use planning.";"Li, Juan

Identification of integrated conservation approaches that can reduce or prevent degradational impacts is the aim of the EU-funded DESIRE research program, part of which is concerned with quantifying the likely benefit of acceptable alternative conservation strategies to wildfire. The overall aim of this paper is to apply a modification of the Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment (PESERA) model in order to compare predicted soil erosion rates of one possible conservation strategy, the regular application of prescribed fire, with that of wildfire. The model is applied to two fire-prone study areas in central Portugal (Góis and Mação) and predicts runoff and erosion at much larger spatial (regional) and temporal (decadal) scales than is usually possible with field monitoring. Simulation using the model was carried out for 50years based on a historical climate time-series. Even assuming very frequent management burns (every 2years) and infrequent wildfires (100years), the model suggests that this conservation measure can generally reduce soil erosion relative to infrequent wildfires, although the predicted soil losses for both types of fire are large compared even with those obtained from small-scale field monitoring. The benefits, limitations, scope for improvement and application to future climatic scenarios of the model in a fire context are discussed.";"Esteves, T.C.J.

Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. These forests are under severe threat from the prospect of bauxite mining and other anthropogenic disturbances. In the absence of adequate, up-to-date ecological information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.";"Newman, Minke E.

"AGRIS:US201500217513";"Effects of conservation policies on forest cover change in giant panda habitat regions, China";"";"After long periods of deforestation, forest transition has occurred globally, but the causes of forest transition in different countries are highly variable. Conservation policies may play important roles in facilitating forest transition around the world, including China. To restore forests and protect the remaining natural forests, the Chinese government initiated two nationwide conservation policies in the late 1990s – the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-To-Green Program (GTGP). While some studies have discussed the environmental and socioeconomic effects of each of these policies independently and others have attributed forest recovery to both policies without rigorous and quantitative analysis, it is necessary to quantify the outcomes of these two conservation policies simultaneously because the two policies have been implemented at the same time. To fill this knowledge gap, this study quantitatively evaluated the effects of the two conservation policies on forest cover change between 2001 and 2008 in 108 townships located in two important giant panda habitat regions – the Qinling Mountains region in Shaanxi Province and the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuary in Sichuan Province. Annual forest cover change rate was evaluated using a land-cover product (MCD12Q1) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This product proved to be highly accurate in the study region (overall accuracy was ca. 87%, using 425 ground truth points collected in the field), thus suitable for the forest change analysis performed. Results showed that within the timeframe evaluated, 94% of townships (i.e., 101 out of 108) in both regions exhibited either increases or no changes in forest cover. After accounting for a variety of socioeconomic and biophysical attributes, a linear regression model suggests that the GTGP had a positive and significant effect on the annual forest cover change rate after seven years of implementation. Our results also suggest that elevation has a significant positive effect on forest cover change, while the percentage of agricultural population, initial forest cover in 2001, and the interaction term of elevation and slope had negative significant effects. Findings from this study will be useful for evaluating the implementation of current conservation policies, designing future conservation policies, developing future giant panda habitat conservation projects, and achieving forest sustainability in China and elsewhere.";"Li, Yu

"AGRIS:US201500217516";"Factors influencing the use of alternative land cultivation technologies in Swaziland: Implications for smallholder farming on customary Swazi Nation Land";"";"Poor land preparation and late planting are among the factors responsible for the decline in food production on customary Swazi Nation Land (SNL). While efforts are being made to develop an improved national land cultivation programme, this process can be helped by identifying factors that influence farmers to use alternative technologies for land cultivation. Using cross-section data collected in 2009 from a random sample of 210 farmers in Komati, three land cultivation technologies were identified; (i) use of tractors; (ii) use of draught animals; and (iii) use of hand hoes. For a country like Swaziland where human health problems, particularly HIV/AIDS, make manual labour a scarce resource, the use of tractors is regarded as a modern technology that can achieve time and labour savings. The empirical evidence from this study indicates that the use of tractors is significantly influenced by household wealth and size of arable land used by households. However, given that land holdings on customary land are generally small, sparsely distributed and often fragmented, tractor hire service providers face relatively high overhead and transaction costs. Furthermore, investment in mechanised farming by individual SNL households is constrained by the lack of secure tenure. Given these challenges, this study makes recommendations for creating an enabling environment that could promote the adoption of improved land cultivation methods by smallholders on customary SNL.";"Mabuza, M.L.

We used maximum entropy to estimate the optimal proportions of 18 habitat types, plus elevation and habitat richness associated with the presence of leks of Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix within an 800‐km² study area in Perthshire, Scotland. We repeated the analysis at several radii (0.2–3� km) to assess how the importance of different habitats changed with proximity to lek and scale. We then examined habitat features or combinations of features that were associated with large leks or positive lek growth. Models at all radii had satisfactory predictive power. Using response curves from maxent, we constructed ideal habitat mixes for leks at each radius. At the 2‐km radius, suitability was highest with around 20% each of three moorland types and open/mixed forestry, whereas close to leks (0.2� km), higher proportions of grouse moor and lower proportions of closed‐canopy woodland were optimal. The relationship between habitat and lek size or direction of lek growth was complex, indicating that a landscape containing large or productive leks can be the result of more than one combination of habitats. This demonstrates a degree of flexibility in designing landscapes for Black Grouse conservation, so landowners can prioritize combinations of habitats that are the most practical and/or economical, while still serving the requirements of the target species.";"Geary, Matthew

"AGRIS:US201400191518";"Conceptual frameworks for estimating the water quality benefits of improved agricultural management practices in large catchments";"";"Chemical and sediment losses from agricultural lands are threatening coastal marine and aquatic ecosystems in many parts of the world. This is an acute problem in Australia, where the condition of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) ecosystems is threatened by increased pollutant loads from agricultural lands, and Governments have enacted policies to reduce pollutant exports. These policies raise the question of how to identify changes in land management that will effectively reduce exports. The scale of the GBR catchments (> 400,000km²) precludes detailed modelling investigations, especially within the time scale of policy implementation. Therefore, we developed conceptual frameworks linking agricultural land management to river pollutant exports for two contrasting agricultural pollutants posing threats to the health of GBR ecosystems; dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and fine sediment (silt and clay), based on a synthesis of past studies. We argue that nitrogen (N) Surpluses (N inputs relative to crop N off-take), are the primary driver of DIN losses from agricultural land to rivers. Similarly, previous studies in GBR grazing lands and elsewhere have quantitatively defined how sediment losses from hill slopes, gullies and stream banks are related to grazing land condition, ground cover and riparian management, which are products of recent climate and grazing practices. From these frameworks we derive relationships between firstly, estimated N Surplus and DIN exports, and secondly ground cover and river fine sediment exports. Using these relationships we examine how DIN and fine sediment exports to the GBR may respond to a range of management scenarios for reducing N inputs, and increasing ground cover and improving riparian management. We predict that widespread adoption of the most extreme scenarios would approximately meet water quality improvement targets set/implied by governments for these two pollutants. However, it is unlikely that these extreme scenarios will be adopted to the extent needed and in the time frames set by current policy. In particular, the agri-environmental management practices defined in this study for N are generally unproven in GBR cropping systems, the required levels of pasture cover and riparian management are generally beyond current experience, and it can take decades to improve land condition, and so reduce erosion rates after cover increases. We also show that the approach taken is applicable to other pollutants, such as total N, that combine characteristics of the pollutants considered here. For the case of total N, the reductions in pollutant loads are not as great smaller relative to targets than for DIN or fine sediments.";"Thorburn, P.J.

Cropping land has been identified as a major source of pollutants in the Fitzroy Basin, the largest catchment discharging into the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. However, knowledge of pollutant generation rates in runoff from the dryland cropping (grains) industry's best management practices (BMPs) on Vertisol soils is limited, partly due to the scarce distribution of these soils worldwide. During a 9 year study sediment movement in runoff from grains dryland cropping was measured at the outlet of 2 contour bays where the distance between contour banks, referred to as the slope length, was standard (single) (180m) and triple (450m) the recommended space. Additionally, nutrient and herbicide movement in runoff was quantified for a sorghum (Sorghum bicolour) crop grown with fertiliser and herbicide applied at planting for a single wet season. During this period a double spaced slope length (380m) was also monitored. All contour bays were farmed under a zero tilled–controlled traffic farming system. Average annual runoff and sediment yield at the standard slope length was 75mm and 1.2tha⁻¹ respectively. This was greater than losses from grazing land use (0.1tha⁻¹yr⁻¹) observed during the study, but less than losses from conventional tillage practices (4tha⁻¹yr⁻¹) previously reported from a long term study in the region. Total nitrogen concentrations (median 8.3mgL⁻¹) in runoff from the sorghum crop were higher than those reported for other agricultural land uses at similar scales, and high proportions of NOₓ–N in relation to total nitrogen were observed (69%). Estimated NOₓ–N lost in runoff from the double spaced slope length after fertiliser application was 7-8kgha⁻¹. Off farm movement of metolachlor (2-chloro-N-(6-ethyl-o-tolyl)-N-[(1RS)-2-methoxy-1-methylethyl]acetamide) (Strada®) was observed with a maximum event mean concentration of 360μgL⁻¹ detected 19 days after application, equivalent to 4.3% of the applied amount. Current dryland cropping BMPs have reduced sediment losses compared to conventional practices. However, observations from a single wet season indicate that high concentrations of nutrients and herbicides can be transported off farm in runoff where they have the potential to be transported to the GBR. Further monitoring and analysis of delivery ratios of pollutants from paddock to catchment is required in the Fitzroy Basin, as is the continued development and adoption of BMPs that reduce nutrient and herbicide movement off farm.";"Murphy, T.

Ground cover has been identified as an important factor in reducing sediment loads, but improving ground cover has been difficult for reef stakeholders in major catchments of the GBR. To provide better information an optimising linear programming model based on paddock scale information in conjunction with land type mapping was developed for the Fitzroy, the largest of the GBR catchments. This identifies at a catchment scale which land types allow the most sediment reduction to be achieved at least cost. The results suggest that from the five land types modelled, the lower productivity land types present the cheapest option for sediment reductions. The study allows more informed decision making for natural resource management organisations to target investments. The analysis highlights the importance of efficient allocation of natural resource management funds in achieving sediment reductions through targeted land type investments.";"Star, M.

To address this issue, government policy has been designed to increase adoption of improved land management practices that are known to minimise the runoff of sediments and nutrients into waterways. Government policy can be implemented through a spectrum of approaches ranging from voluntary to regulatory, and often occurs through a mix of approaches. In this paper we argue that it makes economic and ecological sense to focus investments on those parts of the landscape with greatest potential to reduce pollutants at least cost. To examine this, a financial economic analysis is combined with agricultural production analysis and catchment scale hydrological analysis using a Bayesian belief network model. We explore and compare the cost-effectiveness of two homogenous design based approaches, aimed at reducing diffuse source nutrient pollutants exports, between two biophysically and socio-economically heterogeneous catchments in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment Area, Australia. Sugarcane production is regarded as a major source of pollutants with the dominant pollutant being nitrogen. Our results show significant differences between catchments, both in relation to costs and benefits as well as water quality improvement potential, suggesting a spatially targeted approach may lead to more cost efficient pollutant reductions.";"van Grieken, Martijn

The direction of this relationship certainly has relevance for policy. Previous studies have used econometric techniques to estimate this relationship. This paper uses a land use share multiple regression model in which the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the ratio of acres developed from 1990-2000 to acres not developed over the same time period. It builds on previous studies by using a weighted average minimum lot size variable rather than a simple dummy variable and by explicitly considering the change in developed land area in the dependent variable. The study area is Oakland County, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit that is experiencing significant suburban development. Results show that there is a quadratic relationship between average minimum lot size and land development. At first, development declines with minimum lot size, but at a diminishing rate.

We examine this mechanism’s performance characteristics when opportunity costs are heterogeneous across potential participants, and when costs are only approximately known by the purchaser. We find that overly stringent maximums can increase overall expenditures, and that when quality of offers is important, substantial increases in offer maximums can yield a better quality-adjusted result.";"Hellerstein, Daniel

A spatial autoregressive error model can be used to model the spatial structure of errors arising from omitted spatial effects. This paper demonstrates an alternative approach to modeling land values based on individual and joint misspecification tests using data from Roanoke County in Virginia.  Spatial autocorrelation is found in land value models of Roanoke County.  Defining neighborhoods based on geographic and socioeconomics characteristics produces better estimates of neighborhood effects on land values than simple distance measures. Implementing a comprehensive set of individual and joint misspecification tests results in better correction for misspecification errors compared to existing practices.";"Kaltsas, Ioannis K.

In this paper, we proposed a state-and-transition approach in order to organize pastoral vegetation in a simple management-oriented framework integrating ecological data. The study sites were chosen in an inner alpine territory where the abandonment of pastoral practices was more evident than in other alpine regions. Cluster and fuzzy analysis applied to botanical data allowed the classification of six pastoral types and the assessment of the main overlaps between them. Non-parametric tests on Landolt nutrients indices, slope and distance from farm allowed the identification of a gradient linked with nutrients and pastoral practices intensity from rich pastures to shrub encroached pastures. Moreover, the implementation of the available information in a state-and-transition model (STM) allowed us to hypothesize the presence of an ecological threshold between grass-dominated and shrub-dominated grasslands and the identification of the at-risk pastoral types in the shrub-encroachment dynamics.";"Targetti S

Adsorbed NPS pollution is one of the major forms of NPS pollution in mountainous regions, the essential of the adsorbed NPS pollution is soil loss. Thus, simple, highly sensitive and continuous methods are required to simulate and quantify sediments yield at watershed scales. It is imperative to construct an integrated model to estimate the sediment yield and adsorbed NPS pollution load. According to the characteristics of climate, hydrology, topography, geology, geomorphology and land use types in Three Gorges reservoir area, a GIS-based dynamic-integrated-distributed model of annual adsorbed NPS load was presented in view of impacts of the rainfall intensity, sediment delivery ratio (SDR) and land management, where the temporally dynamic-continuous model of annual sediment yield was established by modifying the revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and the spatially integrated-distributed model of annual adsorbed NPS load was then developed via the correlation between sediment yield and adsorbed NPS load. Furthermore, a case study of the Jialing River basin in China was applied to validate the integrated model, the dynamic-distributed coupling among GIS technology, sediment yield model, and adsorbed NPS load model was achieved successfully. The simulation results demonstrate the following: (1) runoff and sediment are influenced greatly by rainfall intensity, SDR and vegetation cover; rainfall and land management show high sensitivities to the integrated model; the average annual adsorbed TN and TP pollution loads from 2006 to 2010 decreased by 76 and 74� % compared with the previous treatment (1990), respectively. (2) Spatio-temporal variations of adsorbed NPS nitrogen and phosphorus load are mainly related to different land use types and the background level of nutriments in topsoil; different land use types have different contribution rates; the largest contribution rates of adsorbed total nitrogen (TN, 58.9� %) and total phosphorus (TP, 53� %) loads are both from the dryland cropland. (3) The identification of critical source areas can help to implement the prevention and control measures aiming at the reduction of water environmental pollution. These results will provide useful and valuable information for decision makers and planners to take sustainable land use management and soil conservation measures for the control of sediment pollution in the Three Gorges reservoir area. The application of this model in the catchment shows that the integrated model may be used as a major tool to assess sediment yield risks and adsorbed NPS pollution load at mountainous watersheds.";"Wu, Lei

This article provides insight into this international development debate by analyzing the impact of water markets on small farmers in the Limarí River Basin of Chile. The analysis is based on data collected from an extensive in-person survey of 316 farmers in the basin. Results show that water markets in the basin have been successful in moving water and water rights from low- to high-valued uses and that resource-constrained farmers use temporary water sales as a safety net. The long-term beneficial effects of water market trades for the most resource-constrained farmers, however, remain unclear.

Citizen-agency interactions, citizen trust, and citizen acceptance of management strategies are central to successful planning and decision-making in these settings. In this study, citizen opinions from the attentive public are evaluated in two locations near recent fires in Oregon: the 2003 Bear and Booth Complex Fires and the 2002 Biscuit Fire. Results suggest an agency's commitment to long-term interactions with citizens influences citizen trust in the agencies and acceptance of post-fire management strategies. There is broad acceptance for several post-fire management strategies (i.e. erosion control, replanting, reseeding). However, acceptance is highly dependent on trustworthy relations. Further, results suggest it is not enough to simply offer opportunities for public engagement; citizens need to feel that these activities were meaningful opportunities to participate. Although results differed between locations, overall the majority of respondents did not agree with how the local Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management handled forest planning after recent fires. Findings from this research indicate that positive citizen-agency relations need to be long-term and developed well before a fire occurs if post-fire actions are to be supported by communities.";"Olsen, Christine S.

Crop rotation effects are inherently dynamic. They are generally ignored inmulticrop models with land as an allocable input found in the literature since most of these models aredeveloped within a static framework.The aim of this paper is twofold (i) to propose a new approach and tools for investigating dynamic cropacreage choices accounting for crop rotation benefits and constraints and (ii) to illustrate the impacts ofcrop rotation effects and constraints on farmers’ acreage choices through simulation examples. Themodels proposed in this paper are sufficiently simple for being empirically tractable either insimulation studies or in econometric and mathematical programming analyses.Our simulation results tend to show responses of the optimal dynamic acreages to simple price shockswhich are much more complex than those implied by static models. They also demonstrate thatfarmers’ perceptions of the future economic context are crucial determinants of their acreage choices.In fact current acreage choices may appear suboptimal in a static sense but are fully consistent whendynamic effects of crop rotations are specified.";"Carpentier, Alain

"AGRIS:US201500210822";"Beyond REDD+ readiness: land-use governance to reduce deforestation in Peru";"";"Peru contains the fourth largest area of tropical forest in the world, yet faces a worsening net deforestation rate. In 2008, to address this threat, the national government announced its ambition to reduce deforestation to zero by 2021. Via literature review and key informant interviews, this study assess two years of REDD+ readiness preparations according to six readiness functions. A mixed pattern of outcomes emerge. Although significant advances were made by various local-level initiatives, national-level efforts continue to struggle. Three crucial challenges persist: (1) greater involvement and coordination of ministries and government agencies associated with REDD+ planning, (2) better understanding of deforestation agents and drivers, and (3) integration of REDD+ policies into national and regional plans, which includes clarification of safeguard procedures and design of incentive mechanisms. Integrated land use planning is presented as a platform to foster dialogue that helps to reconcile divergent stakeholder perspectives, coordinate changes to land use, and resolve overlapping land rights. Policy relevance This article presents the outcomes of a multi-dimensional assessment of the REDD+ readiness process in Peru. The six key functions in the analytical framework provide the opportunity to evaluate the process in an integrated and systematic manner and highlights the persistence of complex, transversal governance challenges across diverse economic sectors and government agencies. Research findings also reveal a need for policy change and continued investment to ensure success of the national process in Peru. Strong leadership is needed to generate consensus in cross-sectoral negotiations and to establish coordinated land governance and monitoring mechanisms.";"Robiglio, Valentina

However, the mixed results associated with its adoption by households call for an in-depth understanding of the management regimes. This study was conducted in Chepareria ward in West Pokot County to characterize enclosure management regimes and determine factors which influence their choice among agropastoralists in Chepareria.Enclosures in Chepareria were mainly used for livestock-based agropastoralism (78.3 %) while crop-based agropastoralism accounts for 21.7 %. The dominance of livestock-based enclosure management regimes in Chepareria indicates that livestock production is still the mainstay of agropastoralists in Chepareria while diversification of land use is common where rain-fed agriculture allows as evidenced by the adoption of crop-based enclosure regimes in the wetter regions of Chepareria. The choice of management regimes was mainly influenced by agroecological zonation and land tenure (P ≤ 0.01), and number of livestock owned and household income (P ≤ 0.05).Enclosures were mainly established to alleviate pasture scarcity and create stable environments for the local Pokot pastoral community by restoring degraded rangelands. However, the continuous adoption and adaptation of enclosures has enabled agricultural diversification by increasing flexibility on land, fodder and livestock management including the adoption of alternative income-generating activities among enclosure owners in Chepareria. Enclosure owners may continue to diversify or intensify enclosure management regimes as influenced by agroecological zonation, land tenure, number of livestock owned and household income.";"Wairore, John Ndung’u

We assessed 53 pastoral and 197 agro-pastoral households in Nakasongola and Nakaseke districts of Uganda, examining the use of 27 consumption coping strategies over a recall time of two 30-day periods, one at the start of a dry season in 2012 and one at the start of a rainy season in 2013.Four categorical food insecurity status measures were established - food secure (CSI 0 to 5) and mildly (CSI 6 to 20), moderately (CSI 21 to 42) and extremely (CSI >42) food insecure. For the dry season, the mean CSI was 29.4 ± 2.59 and 33.6 % of households were food secure, while for the rains, mean CSI was 33.1 ± 2.30 and 14.0 % of households were food secure. The combination of livelihood system, land holdings, number of livestock owned and belonging to a social network explained 9.4 % to 10 % of the variance in household food insecurity for agro-pastoralists, but variance for pastoralists was not explained by these factors. While the only highly significant factor associated with increasing household food insecurity in the dry season was low landholdings, in the rainy season, it was pastoral livelihood, low livestock holdings for agro-pastoralists and non-involvement in social networks.While our model identified a number of factors important in describing household food insecurity, it explained only about 10 % of the variance.";"Mayanja, Maureen N.

Strategically located near a major urban centre, residents of this region have long relied on wages and social welfare grants. Land was valued primarily for residential security and as a symbolic representation of community membership, rather than for productive purposes. This emphasis on community membership, however, created the potential for conflict when a local chief challenged a civil society group over their authority to claim land. With the government's continued hesitancy to challenge the authority of chiefs, land reform provided an opportunity for local chiefs to reinforce their position and potentially to expand the amount of land under their jurisdiction. This agenda conflicted both with the government's interest in developing commercial agriculture and local residents' desire for rural land as security in the context of high levels of unemployment.";"MATHIS, SARAH M.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land reform;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301123697";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2007.00141.x";"";"";"";"99-120"

To analyse the nutrient characteristics and estimate the nutrient load in streams, we conducted extensive field survey and water quality experiments from 2007 to 2008 in Koise River, a major river of the Lake Kasumigaura watershed, Japan. Water quality indicators of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated. The nutrient loads of TN, TP and TOC, as well as dissolved total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, particle organic nitrogen, dissolved total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and particle organic carbon were also estimated for the Koise River. Seasonal variation of the nutrient concentration from 2007 to 2008 was analysed considering the river discharge variation and agricultural activities. The results showed that the irrigation water from Lake Kasumigaura has the potential ability to decrease the TN concentration and increase the TOC concentration in the Koise River. Significant correlation coefficients between nutrient load and river discharge were found. The monthly pollution loads from different sources were then evaluated based on land cover classification generated from high-resolution Quick Bird remote sensing imagery. This study presents a useful interpretation of water quality data sets with a view to obtaining better information about water quality for more effective management of water resources in river basins.Editor Z.W.

"AGRIS:US201300902378";"Long-term trends in streamflow from semiarid rangelands: uncovering drivers of change";"";"In the last 100 years or so, desertification, degradation, and woody plant encroachment have altered huge tracts of semiarid rangelands. It is expected that the changes thus brought about significantly affect water balance in these regions; and in fact, at the headwater-catchment and smaller scales, such effects are reasonably well documented. For larger scales, however, there is surprisingly little documentation of hydrological change. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which streamflow from large rangeland watersheds in central Texas has changed concurrent with the dramatic shifts in vegetation cover (transition from pristine prairie to degraded grassland to woodland/savanna) that have taken place during the last century. Our study focused on the three watersheds that supply the major tributaries of the Concho River - those of the North Concho (3279 km²), the Middle Concho (5398 km²), and the South Concho (1070 km²). Using data from the period of record (1926-2005), we found that annual streamflow for the North Concho decreased by about 70% between 1960 and 2005. Not only did we find no downtrend in precipitation that might explain this reduced flow, we found no corresponding change in annual streamflow for the other two watersheds (which have more karst parent material). When we analyzed trends in baseflow (contributions from groundwater) and stormflow (runoff events linked to specific precipitation events), however, we found that in spite of large increases in woody plants, baseflow for all the watersheds has remained essentially consistent or has increased slightly since 1960. At the same time, stormflows were of smaller magnitude. Animal numbers have declined precipitously in the latter half of the last century. We suggest that these lower stormflows result from generally higher soil infiltrability due to generally improving range condition. There is no indication that the decline in streamflow is related to diminished groundwater flows caused by extraction of subsurface water by woody plants.";"WILCOX, BRADFORD P.

This study reports a modeling approach for the estimation of weekly levels of ambient black smoke (BS) at residential postcodes across Northeast England (2055km²) over a 12 year period (1985–1996). A two-stage modeling strategy was developed using monitoring data on BS together with a range of covariates including data on traffic, population density, industrial activity, land cover (remote sensing), and meteorology. The first stage separates the temporal trend in BS for the region as a whole from within-region spatial variation and the second stage is a linear model which predicts BS levels at all locations in the region using spatially referenced covariate data as predictors and the regional predicted temporal trend as an offset. Traffic and land cover predictors were included in the final model, which predicted 70% of the spatio-temporal variation in BS across the study region over the study period. This modeling approach appears to provide a robust way of estimating exposure to BS at an inter-urban scale.";"Dadvand, Payam

A distributed hydrological model with locally-derived, slope-dependent sediment yield (erodibility) equations developed from rainfall simulation (RS) studies at the 1-m² scale across the Tahoe basin, USA, is employed to determine the runoff-dependent scaling factors (SFs) necessary to predict daily stream sediment loading from the forested uplands. Data from three “paired”, adjacent, west-shore Lake Tahoe tributary catchments are considered for the period 1994–2004 at time scales ranging from daily to annual. At all time scales, the SF was dependent on runoff (R), particularly at smaller values, but was readily simplified as an approximately inverse square-root function. Optimized SF–runoff regressions for each watershed were equivalent when modified by ratios of watershed area. As a result, a single daily SF–runoff equation was determined (through minimization of sediment load prediction errors) that could be successfully applied to all three watersheds with an accuracy consistent with the predictive error associated with any one of the watersheds alone. Sensitivity analyses indicated that sediment loading predictions were more sensitive to the SF–runoff equation coefficient rather than the exponent. Annual sediment load prediction errors of ˜30% might be expected for low or high runoff years.Editor D. KoutsoyiannisCitation Grismer, M.E., 2012.

Based on in situ measurements and high-resolution multispectral SPOT-5 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) data, a fittest nonlinear function between input and output was obtained from this method, and SVR model parameters were selected automatically using a genetic algorithm (GA). The relationship between water quality variables – permanganate index (CODMₙ), ammonia-nitrogen (NH₃–N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) – and spectral components of SPOT-5 data for the Weihe River in China was constructed by the proposed method. Spatial distribution maps for the three water quality variables were also developed. The results show that SVR can implement any nonlinear mapping, and produce better predictions than the traditional statistical multiple regression method, especially when samples are limited. With further testing, SVR can also be extended to hyperspectral remote sensing applications in the management of land and water resources.";"Wang, Xili

Both domestic and wild bee populations in central Wisconsin pickling cucumber fields were assessed using a combination of pan trapping and floral observations before and during bloom. Together with land cover analyses extending 2,000 m from field centers, the relationship of land cover components and bee abundance and diversity were examined. Over a 2-yr sample interval distributed among 18 experimental sites, 3,185 wild bees were collected representing >60 species. A positive association was found between both noncrop and herbaceous areas with bee abundance and diversity only during bloom. Response of bee abundance and diversity to land cover was strongest at larger buffers presumably because of the heterogeneous nature of the landscape and connectivity between crop and noncrop areas. These results are consistent with previous research that has found a weak response of wild bees to surrounding vegetation in moderately fragmented areas. A diverse community of wild bees is present within the fields of a commercial cucumber system, and there is evidence of floral visitation by unmanaged bees. This evidence emphasizes the importance of wild pollinators in fragmented landscapes and the need for additional research to investigate the effectiveness of individual species in pollen deposition.";"Lowenstein, D.

Using the Al Jabal al Akhdar mountains in northern Oman as an example, our objectives were to analyse the availability and spatial distribution of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and the extent and causes of vegetation changes during the last decades with a remote sensing approach. A combination of destructive and non-destructive biomass measurements by life-form specific allometric equations was used to identify the ANPP of the ground vegetation (<50cm) and the leaf and twig biomass of phanerophytes. The ANPP differed significantly among the life forms and the different plant communities, and the biomass of the sparsely vegetated ground was more than 50 times lower (mean=0.22tDMha⁻¹) than the biomass of phanerophytes (mean=12.3tDMha⁻¹). Among the different vegetation indices calculated NDVI proved to be the best predictor for rangeland biomass. Temporal trend analysis of Landsat satellite images from 1986 to 2009 was conducted using a pixel-based least square regression with the annual maximum Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVIₘₐₓ) as a dependent variable. Additionally, linear relationships of NDVIₘₐₓ and annual rainfall along the time series were calculated. The extent of human-induced changes was analysed using the residual trends method. A strongly significant negative biomass trend detected for 83% of the study area reflected a decrease in annual rainfall but even without clear evidence of deforestation of trees and shrubs, human-induced vegetation degradation due to settlement activities were also important.";"Brinkmann, Katja

Little attention has been paid to the prevention of these diseases. We attempted to identify the significant wetland characteristics associated with the spread of chikungunya, dengue fever and malaria in Kerala, a tropical region of South West India using multivariate analyses (hierarchical cluster analysis, factor analysis and multiple regression). High/medium turbid coastal lagoons and inland water-logged wetlands with aquatic vegetation have significant effect on the incidence of chikungunya while dengue influenced by high turbid coastal beaches and malaria by medium turbid coastal beaches. The high turbidity in water is due to the urban waste discharge namely sewage, sullage and garbage from the densely populated cities and towns. The large extent of wetland is low land area favours the occurrence of vector borne diseases. Hence the provision of pollution control measures at source including soil erosion control measures is vital. The identification of vulnerable zones favouring the vector borne diseases will help the authorities to control pollution especially from urban areas and prevent these vector borne diseases. Future research should cover land use cover changes, climatic factors, seasonal variations in weather and pollution factors favouring the occurrence of vector borne diseases.";"Sheela, A. M.

It is fully recognised that the olive sector contributes significantly to the regional agro-economy, as well as to the conservation of certain typical landscapes. The purposes of this study were (i) to draw a general picture of the olive-tree plantations spatial distribution in the Trás-os-Montes Region and (ii) to identify the main soil characteristics and land qualities of areas where olive-trees are the dominant land use. Information provided by regional soil, land use and land suitability maps (1:100 000) was selected, interpreted and treated in order to achieve those objectives. Due to the small scale of maps, results have only a reconnaissance level of detail. However, they allow conclusions on the main soil/land constraints of olive-tree cultivation in the region. Development of olive-tree plantations and improvement of actual management techniques have to cope with the identified constraints. For that, research contributions are of primary importance, mainly on the fields of mechanisation, soil and water conservation and soil fertility.";"Figueiredo, T. de

Using data from a new survey on Chinese and Indian firms in the ICT sector, we find IPR protection to be key in the engagement of Southern firms in global innovation networks. A complementary exercise uses global bilateral patent data to investigate the location-specificity of IPR enforcement for this phenomenon. We find that a stringent IPR regime in the North (South) discourages (encourage) foreign patenting activities of firms in the South, suggesting that a global convergence of IPRs can stimulate Southern innovation.

"AGRIS:US2012211597";"ASSET ILLIQUIDITY, EXCLUSORY LAWS, AND LAND REFORM: THE CASE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIIP OF HUNGARIAN AGRICULTURAL LAND";"";"The ownership of agricultural land by foreign nationals is currently an extremely sensitive political issue in many of the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries as they move towards European Union accession.  During the past decade economic reforms in CEE have resulted in substantial welfare declines within agricultural sectors across the region.  Generally, all agents within the agri-food chain have faced similar problems of decreasing terms of trade, increased competition, lack of financial resources and thin markets for both the sale of their output as well as for the sale of their underlying assets if so inclined (Swinnen and Macours, 2000).  As a result, farmers have found themselves in severe financial distress and forced to operate at subsistence levels that are well below the optimal productive capacity levels that would be expected under normal equilibrium market conditions without these constraints (Swinnen and Gow, 1999).

Consequently, most farmers have been unable to purchase agricultural land at its long-term economic equilibrium value.  Instead they have either leased land short-term or have offered their own land holdings at substantially undervalued prices.  Recognizing that all farmers are similarly distressed, lack suitable repayment capacity, and land provides minimal security due to being under-valued, banks have been unwilling to provide farmers with mortgage loans.  Consequently, very little land is being sold as absentee landowners have also recognized the market is undervaluing their assets, instead preferring to hold on them until land prices correct themselves.  However, a reasonably fluid land leasing market has developed in a number of countries.  In Hungary, for example, the land leasing market along EU border countries is being driven by foreigners who have found potential loopholes in the laws and been able to develop innovative organizational and contractual structures to control these land assets, which have been coined pocket contracts. 

Shleifer and Vishney, 1992, developed a general equilibrium model analyzing the impact of asset illiquidity under idiosyncratic shocks.  The model shows that if individuals are not financially distressed and the economy is in equilibrium then the value of an asset (i.e. land) should equal the present value of future earnings that accrue to that asset when operated in its best use.  However, if the economy is hit by an idiosyncratic shock and all agents are financial distressed, assets will be substantially undervalued, unless outsiders are allowed to participate in the market.  As a result, the subject of allowing outsiders (i.e. foreigners) to participate in agricultural land markets has become increasingly relevant as many CEE countries exclude foreigners from purchasing agricultural land. Additionally, EU treaty amendments directly address the prohibition of Member States to 'limit land acquisition by nationals of other Member States' (Hodgson, 1999).  The policy and welfare implications and sensitivities are substantial, however they have only received passing attention in academic and policy literature.

The objective of this paper is to extend the Shleifer and Vishney (1992) model to help explain and understand the economic impact and implications that the exclusion of foreign ownership is having on 1) the economic value of agricultural land and 2) economic welfare of current and potential landowners and users in the CEE countries.   The case of Hungarian land reform will provide empirical evidence to highlight the consequences of the exclusion of foreigners in land markets. Policy implications will be provided for a series of different land reform scenarios.";"Coakley, Jaime

"AGRIS:US2012203952";"(NON)COMPLIANCE WITH AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION PROGRAMS: THEORY AND EVIDENCE";"";"This paper introduces enforcement costs and farmer noncompliance into the economic analysis of the USDA conservation program on highly erodible lands. A model of heterogeneous producers is developed to determine the economic causes of farmer noncompliance with the provisions of the conservation program. In addition, the paper determines the enforcement policy design that can induce conservation compliance and examines the effectiveness of the current enforcement policy in deterring producer noncompliance. The implications of the theoretical model are tested empirically with data provided by USDA. The analysis shows that farmer compliance with the provisions of the conservation program is not necessarily the natural outcome of self-interest and complete deterrence of noncompliance is not feasible with the current enforcement policy of the government. Both theoretical and empirical results indicate that the use of farm program payments as a leverage against noncompliance is not sufficient for inducing full producer compliance. Unless the government alters its policy on fines for fraudulent behavior, enforcement of conservation compliance will remain imperfect and some degree of noncompliance with the provisions of the program on highly erodible lands will continue to persist.";"Giannakas, Konstantinos

The average SOC stock in 0–100‐cm depth soil was 142 t C ha⁻¹, with 63, 41 and 38 t C ha⁻¹ in the 0–25, 25–50 and 50–100 cm depths, respectively. Changes at 0–25 cm were small. During 1986–97, SOC in the 25–50‐cm layer increased in sandy soils while SOC decreased in loam soils. In the subsequent period (1997–2009), most soils showed significant losses of SOC. From 1986 to 2009, SOC at 0–100 cm decreased in loam soils and tended to increase in sandy soils. This trend is ascribed to dairy farms with grass leys being abundant on sandy soils while cereal cropping dominates on loamy soils. A statistical model including soil type, land use and management was applied separately to 0–25, 25–50 and 50–100 cm depths to pinpoint drivers for SOC change. In the 0–25 cm layer, grass leys added 0.95 t C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ and autumn‐sown crops with straw incorporation added 0.40 t C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. Cattle manure added 0.21 t C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. Most interestingly, grass leys contributed 0.58 t C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ at 25–50 cm, confirming that inventories based only on top‐soils are incomplete. We found no significant effects in 50–100 cm. Our study indicates a small annual loss of 0.2 t C ha⁻¹ from the 0–100 cm soil layer between 1986 and 2009.";"Taghizadeh‐Toosi, A.

This study aims to identify the factors affecting agrarian reform beneficiaries' (ARBs) perceptions of success or failure of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in Malita, Davao del Sur. Key informant interviews were conducted with 40 beneficiaries of selected agrarian reform cooperatives. Binary probit analysis was used to identify the factors affecting the success of the CARP. Results of the study show that the main consideration influencing ARBs' perception of success was land acquisition. Other reasons included improvements in economic conditions and good cooperative management. Variables such as years of education and age negatively affected the ARB's perceptions. On the other hand, total income and years in the cooperative both had a positive relationship on perceptions of success.";"Shuck, V.A.

"AGRIS:US201400134855";"new data aggregation technique to improve landscape metric downscaling";"";"Scale is a fundamental concept in landscape ecology and considerable attention has been given to the scale-dependent relationships of landscape metrics. Many metrics have been found to exhibit very consistent scaling relationships as map resolution (i.e., pixel or grain size) is increased. However, these scaling relationships tend to break down when attempting to ‘downscale’ them, and the scaling function is often unable to accurately predict metric values for finer resolutions than the original data. The reasons for this breakdown are not well understood. This research examines the downscaling behavior of metrics using various data aggregation techniques in an attempt to better understand the characteristics of metric scaling behavior. First, downscaling performance is examined using the traditional method of aggregation known as ‘majority rules’. Second, a new data aggregation technique is introduced that utilizes fractional land cover abundances obtained from sub-pixel remote sensing classifications in order to capture a greater amount of the spatial heterogeneity present in the landscape. The goal of this new aggregation technique is to produce a more accurate scaling relationship that can be downscaled to predict metric values at fine resolutions. Results indicate that sub-pixel classifications have the potential to transform data aggregation to allow more accurate downscaling for certain landscapes, but accuracy is linked to the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape.";"Frazier, Amy E.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400134855";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-014-0066-3";"";"";"";"1261-1276"

"AGRIS:US201301576214";"Agricultural productivity and environmental insecurity in the Usangu plain, Tanzania: policy implications for sustainability of agriculture";"";"Sustainable agricultural development is a necessity for sustainable economic growth and social development in Africa. Sustainable agriculture largely depends on how effective natural and environmental resources are managed and utilized; it also depends on the security of continuous access to such resources. This research was aimed to look into trends in agricultural productivity, examine the persistence of the environmental insecurity, analyze the relationship between the two, and explore their links to the national development policies. The results are discussed in the context of relevance to national development policies and their implications on the sustainability of agriculture and rural livelihoods security. Literature survey, records collection from the stakeholders, village level participatory assessments (PAs), observations and questionnaire survey were tools used for data collection. The study shows significant (P < 0.01) declines in cereal crop yields, cattle milk yield and cattle calving rate, and increasing cattle mortality rate. Elements of environmental insecurity were found to account for decline in agricultural productivity; significant (P < 0.01) proportion (68%), of 266 households interviewed, reported land resources deterioration, declining soil fertility, and increasing drought frequencies as the causes of their low productivity. Declined fertilizer consumption and increasing variability in rainfall amount significantly (P < 0.01) accounted for 59% and 39%, respectively, of the variations observed in total annual production of rice and maize, which are major cereals in the study area. This study recommends measures to improve soil productivity such as improved fertilizer application and use of organic manures along with mineral fertilizers for maintaining soil productivity; education of farmers on sustainable use and management of land resources; and pro-poor rural policies in agricultural development and environmental governance.";"Malley, Z.

"AGRIS:US201301616741";"Priority areas for the conservation of Atlantic forest large mammals";"";"Large mammal faunas in tropical forest landscapes are widely affected by habitat fragmentation and hunting, yet the environmental determinants of their patterns of abundance remain poorly understood at large spatial scales. We analysed population abundance and biomass of 31 species of medium to large-bodied mammal species at 38 Atlantic forest sites (including three islands, 26 forest fragments and six continuous forest sites) as related to forest type, level of hunting pressure and forest fragment size using ANCOVAs. We also derived a novel measure of mammal conservation importance for each site based on a “Mammalian Conservation Priority index” (MPi ) which incorporates information on species richness, population abundance, body size distribution, conservation status, and forest patch area. Mammal abundance was affected by hunting pressure, whereas mammalian biomass of which was largely driven by ungulates, was significantly influenced by both forest type and hunting pressure. The MPi index, when separated into its two main components (i.e. site forest area and species-based conservation index C i), ordered sites along a gradient of management priorities that balances species-focused and habitat-focused conservation actions. Areas with the highest conservation priority were located in semi-deciduous forest fragments, followed by lowland forests. Many of these fragments, which are often embedded within large private landholdings including biofuel and citrus or coffee crops, cattle ranches and pulpwood plantations, could be used not only to comply with environmental legislation, but also enhance the prospects for biodiversity conservation, and reduce edge effects and hunting.";"Galetti, Mauro

Specifically, the study addresses the women's level of accessibility and control of arable land in agricultural production in the North West Region of Cameroon. The objectives of the study were: (a) to determine the extent to which rural women in the study area gain access to and control small-scale arable land; and (b) to assess the degree of association between access to small-scale arable land by rural women and their level of control of the arable land. The study relied on a one-shot case study design. The method of data collection consisted surveying a randomly selected sample of 1,120 rural women involved in small-scale agricultural production in the study area. The data obtained from the survey were analyzed using the following statistical procedures: (1) frequency distribution, (2) correlation analysis, and (3) one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results revealed that rural women farmers do have access to arable land through their families, but do not control arable land, and there is no association between access to and control of arable land. The study recommends that developing countries involved in arable small-scale agricultural production, should consider adopting agricultural policies that include rural women in decision-making, implementation, and evaluation of agricultural production inputs and outcomes.";"Fon, DE.";"";"Agri‐Overseas";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"";"scale";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"CMR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012067621";"http://www.tropicultura.org/text/v29n2/65.pdf";"";"";"";"293-301"

Montado supports a high biological diversity associated to low intensity management and a landscape diversity provided by a continuous gradient of land cover. Among other features this permits the classification of montados as a High Nature Value (HNV) system. We assessed the role of birds as HNV indicators for montado, and tested several bird groups—farmland, edge, forest generalists and forest specialists species; and some universal indicators such as species conservation status, Shannon’s diversity index and species richness. Our study areas covered the North–South distribution of cork oak in Portugal, and we surveyed the breeding bird communities across 117 sampling sites. In addition to variables related to management and sanitary status, we considered variables that characterize the landscape heterogeneity inside the montado—trees and shrub density and richness of woody vegetation. Our results suggest that specific bird guilds can be used as HNV indicators of particular typologies of montado, and highlight the need to develop an indicator that could be transversally applied to all types of montado.";"Catarino, L.

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model in producing a remote sensing-based and detailed map of montado canopy density over a large territory in southern Portugal. This map will make a fundamental contribution to accurately identifying and assessing High Nature Value farmland in montado areas. The results reveal that the FCD model is an effective approach to estimating the density classes of montado canopy (overall accuracy = 78.0 %, kappa value = 0.71). The study also shows that the FCD approach generated good user’s and producer’s accuracies for the three montado canopy-density classes. Globally, the results obtained show that biophysical indices such as the advanced vegetation index, the bare soil index, the shadow index and the thermal index are suitable for estimating and mapping montado canopy-density classes. These results constitute the first remote sensing-based product for mapping montado canopy density that has been developed using the FCD model. This research clearly demonstrates that this approach can be used in the context of Mediterranean agro-forestry systems.";"Godinho, Sérgio

"AGRIS:US201600127292";"Towards the identification and assessment of HNV Dehesas: a meso-scale approach";"";"Iberian dehesa and montado are paradigmatic high nature value (HNV) agroforestry systems in Europe. Nevertheless their conservation status is uncertain as a consequence of their typological variety, different intensity of management practices on the ground, and other ongoing processes challenging their long-term sustainability. The existing broad gradients of dehesa and montado types impose difficulties in estimating not only their distribution and extent, but also their condition, since probably not all these agroforestry systems should readily be considered as HNV. Tackling with these difficulties, we explore a methodology based on GIS-analyses of land cover cartographies to estimate the extent and condition of dehesa farmland in an area covering ten municipalities in northern Andalusia region (Spain) based on: (1) integration of available thematic maps to obtain an improved land-use cartography; (2) application of GIS map generalization techniques to delimit potential HNV farmland types; (3) definition and calculation of several indices of ‘structural diversity’ and ‘impact’ within patches of dehesa farmland; (4) automatized weighted integration of indices to obtain a cartography assessing dehesa’s HNV in an ordinal scale from very low to very high. Estimated natural value was significantly worse for cultivated dehesas, with dehesas of pastures showing higher structural diversity and lower impact indices. Weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methodology are discussed.";"Acebes, Pablo

"AGRIS:US201600127293";"Assessment of environment, land management, and spatial variables on recent changes in montado land cover in southern Portugal";"";"Montado decline has been reported since the end of the nineteenth century in southern Portugal and increased markedly during the 1980s. Consensual reports in the literature suggest that this decline is due to a number of factors, such as environmental constraints, forest diseases, inappropriate management, and socioeconomic issues. An assessment on the pattern of montado distribution was conducted to reveal how the extent of land management, environmental variables, and spatial factors contributed to montado area loss in southern Portugal from 1990 to 2006. A total of 14 independent variables, presumably related to montado loss, were grouped into three sets: environmental variables, land management variables, and spatial variables. From 1990 to 2006, approximately 90,054 ha disappeared in the montado area, with an estimated annual regression rate of 0.14 % year⁻¹. Variation partitioning showed that the land management model accounted for the highest percentage of explained variance (51.8 %), followed by spatial factors (44.6 %) and environmental factors (35.5 %). These results indicate that most variance in the large-scale distribution of recent montado loss is due to land management, either alone or in combination with environmental and spatial factors. The full GAM model showed that different livestock grazing is one of the most important variables affecting montado loss. This suggests that optimum carrying capacity should decrease to 0.18–0.60 LU ha⁻¹ for livestock grazing in montado under current ecological conditions in southern Portugal. This study also showed that land abandonment, wildfire, and agricultural practices (to promote pastures, crops or fallow lands) were three significant variables influencing montado loss.";"Godinho, Sérgio

Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are a component of a new and more direct conservation paradigm and an emerging concept to finance conservation programs by fostering dialogue between upstream and downstream land users. Those kinds of approach are particularly useful if applied in basins where irrigation schemes are emerging and the service life of reservoir and irrigation canals, in downstream areas are threatened by the sediments moved from upstream region. Here we report the results of our study on the determinants of Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Willingness to Compensate (WTC) for improved land and water management practices in the Blue Nile Basin (Gumera and Koga watersheds). A total of 325 sample households were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique, and a structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data from the sample households. We applied Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to elicit WTP using monetary and material payment vehicles. Our results showed that more households are willing to pay in labor than in cash. The mean WTP for improved land and water management was estimated at US$1.06 and US$1.3 months-1  household-1 for upstream and downstream farmers, respectively. Besides, 83.56% of the sample farm households showed WTC the upstream farmers in cash. However, the aggregate WTP falls far short of the estimated investment cost needed for ecosystem restoration. Among others, the number of livestock, size of arable land, access to education and credit by the sample farm households were identified to positively influence sample farmers WTP for restoration of ecosystem services and downstream farmers WTC for improved ecosystem regulation services. Therefore, institutions and policy measures that enhance environmental education, reduce poverty and foster stakeholders cooperation must be promoted.

"AGRIS:US201500205281";"On the significance of crop‐type information for the simulation of catchment hydrology";"";"Spatially distributed hydrological models require information on the land cover pattern, as it directly influences the generation of run‐off. However, it is not clear which detail of land cover information is suitable for simulating the catchment hydrology. A better understanding of the relationship between the land cover detail and the hydrological processes is therefore required as it would enhance a successful application of the hydrological model. This study investigates the relevance of accurate information about the crop types in the catchment for the simulation of run‐off, baseflow and evapotranspiration. Results reveal that adding knowledge about the crop type in the model simulation is redundant when area‐averaged water flux predictions are intended. On the contrary, when a spatial distribution of water flux predictions is desired, it is meaningful to increase the land cover detail because an increased heterogeneity in the land cover map induces an increased heterogeneity in the hydrological response and locally reduces the uncertainty in the model prediction up to 50%. To assess the land cover uncertainty and to locate the regions for which the reduction in prediction uncertainty is the highest, the thematic uncertainty map (constructed through fuzzy logic) is shown to be a useful tool.

"AGRIS:US201500161943";"Consequences of habitat change and resource selection specialization for population limitation in cavity‐nesting birds";"";"Resource selection specialization may increase vulnerability of populations to environmental change. One environmental change that may negatively impact some populations is the broad decline of quaking aspen Populus tremuloides, a preferred nest tree of cavity‐nesting organisms who are commonly limited by nest‐site availability. However, the long‐term consequences of this habitat change for cavity‐nesting bird populations are poorly studied. I counted densities of woody plants and eight cavity‐nesting bird species over 29 years in 15 high‐elevation riparian drainages in Arizona, USA. I also studied nest‐tree use and specialization over time based on 4946 nests across species. Aspen suffered a severe decline in availability over time, while understorey woody plants and canopy deciduous trees also declined. The decline of plants resulted from increased elk Cervus canadensis browsing linked to declining snowfall. Woodpeckers exhibited very high specialization (>95% of nests) on aspen for nesting, and densities of all six species declined with aspen over time. Mountain chickadees Poecile gambeli and house wrens Troglodytes aedon exhibited increasingly less specialization on aspen. Chickadees strongly increased in density over time, despite a relatively high specialization on aspen. House wren densities declined moderately over time, but nest‐box addition experiments demonstrated that nest‐site availability was not limiting their population. House wren densities increased with understorey vegetation recovery in elk exclosures via increased generality of nest‐site use, demonstrating that the decline in understorey vegetation on the broader landscape was the cause of their population decline. Synthesis and applications. Management should target species that specialize in resource selection on a declining resource. Species with greater resource selection generalization can reduce population impacts of environmental change. Resource generalization can allow a species like the wren to take advantage of habitat refuges, such as those provided by the elk exclosures. Yet, resource generalization cannot offset the negative impacts of broad‐scale declines in habitat quality on the landscape, as demonstrated by the general decline of wrens. Ultimately, aspen is an important habitat for biodiversity, and land management programmes that protect and aid recovery of aspen habitats may be critical.";"Martin, Thomas E.

The point soil organic carbon (SOC) densities are spatialized employing approaches like regression, spatial interpolation, polygon based summation, etc. The present work investigates a data mining based spatial imputation for spatial assessment of soil organic carbon density. The study area covers Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states of India. Field sampling was done using stratified random sampling method with land cover/use, soil type, agro-ecological regions for defining strata. The spatial data at 1 km resolution on climate, NDVI, land cover, soil type, topography was used as input for modeling the top 30 cm Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) density. To model the SOC density, a Random Forest (RF) based model with optimal parameters and input variables has been adopted. Experiment results indicate that 500 number of trees with 5 variables at each split could explain the maximum variability of soil organic carbon density of the study area. Out of various input variables used to model SOC density, land use / cover was found to be the most significant factor that influences SOC density with a distinct importance score of 34.7 followed by NDVI with a score of 12.9. The predicted mean SOC densities range between 2.22 and 13.2 Kg m⁻²and the estimated pool size of SOC in top 30 cm depth is 923 Tg for Andhra Pradesh and 1,029 Tg for Karnataka. The predicted SOC densities using this model were in good agreement with the measured observations (R = 0.86).";"Sreenivas, K.

"AGRIS:US2012202143";"PRESERVING SMALL WHILE STRENGTHENING LARGE FARMERS IN THE USA AND OECD";"";"Facing the general trend towards larger but fewer farms since 1935, the US government implemented a protective safety net for small farmers during 1933-96 which did not halt it but incurred market distortions and other drawbacks. It then switched to market oriented measures in 1996 which have made small farmers more exposed to market risks. A suitable solution to both preserving small and strengthening large farms has not been found. This paper provides a proposal not included in the 145 recommendations in the report `A Time to Act' by the National Commission on Small Farms of the USDA in January 1998: to promote part ownership of land by encouraging small farmers to develop off-farm activities and lease the land beyond self-need to part owners (including competent small farmers) to boost large farmers. In this way, while part owners could achieve economies of scale, small farmers would be boss of self-used land and landlord of rented-out land, integrated with large farmers, gain more income from rent, increase time for and earnings from off-farm activities, so that small farmers, rural communities, democracy roots and landscape could be conserved.  It shows an example of how some black farmers who were small in terms of owned land but became large after renting in land achieved success in farming. Although part ownership has been increasing, it has never been promoted as a policy direction and even be neglected.

The National Wetlands Inventory is the most commonly used data source for this information. However, its accuracy is limited in some contexts, such as agricultural and forested wetlands. An large number of studies have mapped wetlands worldwide from the perspective of land use and land cover change. However, information on the actual wetland planting areas annually is limited, which greatly impacts ongoing research. In this case study of the West Songnen Plain, we developed a simple algorithm for the quick mapping of wetlands by utilizing their unique physical features, such as annual display of phenological land-cover change of exposed soils, shallow flooding water, and plants from multi-temporal Landsat images. Temporal variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) derived from Landsat images in 2010 for wetlands at different growth stages were analyzed. Results show that during the ante-tillering phase, the NDVI value (above zero) is lower than the LSWI value of paddies because of flooding of shallow water; during the reproductive and ripening phases, the NDVI value is higher than the LSWI value (above zero); and during the post-harvest wetland planting phase, the NDVI value is still higher than the LSWI value, but the LSWI value is negative. Wetland areas can be detected using one or two images in the optimum time window. The algorithm based on the difference of NDVI and LSWI values derived from Landsat images was used to extract the actual wetland planting area. Validated alongside statistical data, the algorithm showed high accuracy. Therefore, this algorithm highlights the unique features of wetlands and can help in mapping the actual wetland area annually on a regional scale. Results further indicate that the new method has a classification accuracy of 92 %. In comparison, two traditional methods based on Landsat-7/ETM registered accuracy rates of only 83 % and 87 % respectively.";"Dong, Zhangyu

As a result, these highland zones are highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate variability. As patterns of variability and precipitation intensity alter under anthropogenic climate change, there is concern that this vulnerability will increase, threatening economic development and food security in the region. In order to overcome these challenges and to enhance sustainable development in the context of climate change, it is necessary to establish climate resilient development strategies that are informed by best-available Earth System Science (ESS) information. This requirement is complicated by the fact that climate projections for the Abay Highlands contain significant and perhaps irreducible uncertainties. A critical challenge for ESS, then, is to generate and to communicate meaningful information for climate resilient development in the context of a highly uncertain climate forecast. Here we report on a framework for applying ESS to climate resilient development in the Abay Highlands, with a focus on the challenge of reducing land degradation.";"Benjamin F. Zaitchik

"AGRIS:US201600069090";"Automated Approach for Land Cover Classification Based on a Fuzzy Supervised Learning Framework";"";"This paper proposes an automatic framework for land cover classification. In majority of published work by various researchers so far, most of the methods need manually mark the label of land cover types. In the proposed framework, all the information, like land cover types and their features, is defined as prior knowledge achieved from land use maps, topographic data, texture data, vegetation’s growth cycle and field data. The land cover classification is treated as an automatically supervised learning procedure, which can be divided into automatic sample selection and fuzzy supervised classification. Once a series of features were extracted from multi-source datasets, spectral matching method is used to determine the degrees of membership of auto-selected pixels, which indicates the probability of the pixel to be distinguished as a specific land cover type. In order to make full use of this probability, a fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) classification method is used to handle samples with membership degrees. This method is applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data of two areas located in Northern China. The automatic classification results are compared with visual interpretation. Experimental results show that the proposed method classifies the remote sensing data with a competitive and stable accuracy, and demonstrate that an objective land cover classification result is achievable by combining several advanced machine learning methods.";"Xia, Liegang

It is apparent that structural changes have occurred. A simple single equation econometric model with less economic structure appears to forecast better than a simultaneous equation model. Finally, Box-Jenkins forecasts are roughly as good as those based upon a simultaneous equation econometric model, but somewhat inferior to the single equation model. The results suggest that further research may be needed to explain recent movements of farmland prices.";"Pope, Rulon D.

"AGRIS:US201500196573";"Assessment of urban sprawl on agricultural soil of northern Nile Delta of Egypt using RS and GIS";"";"Urban sprawl is threatening the limited highly fertile land in the Nile delta of Egypt. Landsat TM satellite images of 1984, 1992 and ETM+ of 2006 have been used to study the impact of urban sprawl on agricultural land of the Northern Nile delta, Egypt. Visual interpretation using on screen digitizing and change detection techniques were applied for monitoring the urban sprawl. Combining the land capability map and the urban thematic layer using GIS made it possible to point out the risk of urban expansion on the expense of the highly capable soil class. The results show that a total expansion of urban area amounted to 689.20 km²(6.3% of total area) during the study period 1984–2006. The urban expansion during the 1984–2006 was on the expense of the most fertile soils where, the high capable soils (Class I) lost 247.14 km²(2.26 % of total area) and the moderate capable soils lost 32.73 km²(0.3% of total area), while the low capable soils lost only 57.39 km²(0.53% of total area). The urban encroachment over the non capable soils was very limited during the study period 1984-1992, where 7.33 km²only was lost. The pattern of urban sprawl has been changed during the 1992 to 2006 whereas much larger area (50.64 km²) of the non capable soils was converted to urban. It can be concluded that the urban sprawl is one of the dominant degradation process on the land of Nile Delta.";"Shalaby, Adel

"AGRIS:US2012200434";"Economic and Ecological Transformation Processes in East German Water Management Regimes: The Role of Property Rights and Governance Structures";"";"Like in many low moor regions in East Germany, long-standing intensive arable farming - enabled by complex melioration - has caused soil deterioration and high water runoff in the 'Schraden'. More than ten years of economic and political transformation has worsened the situation and even added new problems. The visible consequences are drought periods in the summer, waterlogged plots in the spring and worn-down water management facilities that operate in an uncoordinated or even unauthorised way.

It is here argued that the reallocation of property rights on melioration systems, together with ineffective co-ordination mechanisms, have impeded appropriate land use. Transformation-related problems like the discontinuity of land property rights, the unclear legal situation regarding melioration plants built in socialist times, and highly-fragmented land ownership have not been effectively dealt with by the newly-established Water Association and Water Administration, respectively. Profoundly heterogeneous water-user interests and the complexity of ecosystem relations have contributed to the persistence of the problems.

"AGRIS:US201300873284";"Is land abandonment having an impact on biodiversity? A meta-analytical approach to bird distribution changes in the north-western Mediterranean";"";"Teasing out how species respond to human-induced environmental changes has become a priority for addressing the challenges posed by the need to conserve biodiversity. Although land abandonment is widespread, the threat it can represent to biodiversity remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we used data from eight long-term studies in a region with widespread land abandonment that has been identified as a biodiversity hotspot, the north-west Mediterranean Basin. We conducted a multi-site analysis of how changes in species occurrence were affected by species' attributes (habitat preference, habitat breadth, migration strategy and latitudinal distribution). The analysis revealed a nested pattern in the effect of species attributes. Woodland and shrubland species showed the strongest increase, whereas no change in overall occurrence patterns was detected in farmland species. Residents increased significantly, especially those with a northern distribution, whereas migrants decreased significantly, especially farmland species with a narrow habitat breadth. Changes in species occurrence were also related to initial landscape composition, with larger increases in initially woodland or mixed landscapes. Woodland species increased in all landscape types, shrubland species increased only in mixed landscapes, and farmland species decreased more, although not significantly, in farmland landscapes. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that large-scale habitat changes associated mainly with land abandonment are impacting bird community patterns in the Mediterranean region. Negative effects seem to be recorded mostly for migrants in farmland landscapes, suggesting that declines in these species are likely to be caused by a variety of mechanisms interacting with habitat change in the breeding region.";"Sirami, Clélia

"AGRIS:US201500113846";"Atmospheric CO₂ consumption by chemical weathering in North America";"";"CO₂ consumption by chemical weathering is an integral part of the boundless carbon cycle, whose spatial patterns and controlling factors on continental scale are still not fully understood. A dataset of 338 river catchments throughout North America was used to empirically identify predictors of bicarbonate fluxes by chemical weathering and interpret the underlying controlling factors. Detailed analysis of major ion ratios enables distinction of the contributions of silicate and carbonate weathering and thus quantifying CO₂ consumption. Extrapolation of the identified empirical model equations to North America allows the analysis of the spatial patterns of the CO₂ consumption by chemical weathering. Runoff, lithology and land cover were identified as the major predictors of the riverine bicarbonate fluxes and the associated CO₂ consumption. Other influence factors, e.g. temperature, could not be established in the models. Of the distinguished land cover classes, artificial surfaces, dominated by urban areas, increase bicarbonate fluxes most, followed by shrubs, grasslands, managed lands, and forests. The extrapolation results in an average specific bicarbonate flux of 0.3Mmolkm⁻²a⁻¹ by chemical weathering in North America, of which 64% originates from atmospheric CO₂, and 36% from carbonate mineral dissolution. Chemical weathering in North America thus consumes 50Mt atmospheric CO₂-C per year. About half of that originates from 10% of the area of North America. The estimated strength of individual predictors differs from previous studies. This highlights the need for a globally representative set of regionally calibrated models of CO₂ consumption by chemical weathering, which apply very detailed spatial data to resolve the heterogeneity of earth surface processes.";"Moosdorf, Nils

"AGRIS:US201500010436";"Reducing reservoir impacts and improving outcomes for dam‐forced resettlement: experiences in central Vietnam";"";"The present study focuses on the growing problem of the impacts of human displacement resulting from hydropower dam construction, within the context of the integrated lake basin management of dam reservoirs. Dam‐forced displacement and resettlement can pose severe challenges to the environmental, economic and social sustainability of a reservoir basin. A case study in Quang Nam Province, central Vietnam, suggests that many resettled communities experience impoverishment due to the lack of adequate replacement land, declines in supplemental food sources and reduced access to natural resources. In response to such situations, resettled residents may (i) destroy lake catchment forests for the purpose of converting them to farmland or engage in illegal logging; (ii) increase agrichemical inputs on reduced land, thereby polluting run‐off and groundwater; and (iii) place increased pressure on fish stocks and wildlife. Examples are provided from central Vietnam to illustrate the need for applying management approaches that allows the affected people to become beneficiaries of dam projects and for including civil society organisations in resettlement planning. The hydropower authority can fund benefit‐sharing mechanisms, including village‐level electrification and payment for environmental services schemes, in which resettled populations are paid for forest maintenance and protection to prevent erosion and deforestation, and reservoir access can be provided for fishing, aquaculture and agriculture. Civil society organizations can advocate for residents’ interests and for reallocation of protected forest land for community forestry. These approaches can be supported by an inclusive reservoir management board working to achieve environmental sustainability, economic growth and social equity.";"Singer, Jane

In this study, annual yield of NPS nitrogen (NPS‐N) pollution in Jiaodong Peninsula, China from 1979 to 2008 was estimated. The results showed that: from 1979 to 2008, NPS‐N yields exhibited significant inter‐annual variations and an increasing trend on decadal scale. High NPS‐N yield was mainly found in east and south parts, as well as the urbanized coastal regions in Jiaodong Peninsula. Among the 32 river basins, the three largest basins yielded more than 41.16% of the NPS‐N. However, some small coastal watersheds along the South Yellow Sea and Jiaozhou Bay had higher per unit area yield. Most of the small watersheds characterized by seasonal runoff had coastal waters pertain to mild and moderate pollution levels. The ratio of watershed area to shoreline length and the up‐stream land use had significant impacts on NPS‐N flux through the shoreline. Among the four adjacent coastal areas of Jiaodong Peninsula, Jiaozhou Bay was the most noteworthy one not only because of high levels of land‐based NPS‐N pollution but also because of its nearly enclosed structure. The combination between integrated coastal zone management and integrated river basin management, land use planning and landscape designing in Jiaodong Peninsula is recommended.

Intensive watershed scale study is therefore necessary to develop management strategies for abating the agricultural NPS pollution. The major goal of the present study was to identify the critical areas of an agricultural watershed and recommend the best management practices using a physical process based watershed scale model, soil water assessment tool (SWAT). A 973-ha agricultural watershed located in Midnapore district of West Bengal state in eastern India was monitored to quantify the hydrologic parameters such as runoff, sediment yield and the quality of surface water. The model was calibrated and validated using observed hydrologic and water quality data of the watershed monitored during the rainy seasons of 2002 and 2003, respectively. Besides these data, micro-meteorological data, topographical map, soil map, land resources data and remote sensing data (satellite imagery) of the watershed were used as input to the model. The study revealed that SWAT model simulates daily runoff, sediment yield and nutrient concentration in runoff satisfactorily throughout the entire rainy season, as evident from standard statistical tests. The calibrated model was then successfully used for identifying the critical sub-watersheds and for development of best management practices. Several simulations were performed to determine the best out of the 48 different combinations of treatments for the management of the critical sub-watersheds. The study revealed that no other crop could replace the rice (Oryza sativa) crop during the rainy season and the existing conventional tillage practice needs to be replaced by conservation tillage in order to minimize the sediment yield and nutrient losses. Fertilizer application rate of 80:60 kg ha-1 of N:P is also recommended to minimize the surface water pollution in the watershed due to NO(3)-N and P.";"Behera, S.

"AGRIS:US201400162066";"Comprehensive evaluation of the climate-change implications of shifting land use between forest and grassland: New Zealand as a case study";"";"The transition of land between forest and grassland has important implications for greenhouse gas emissions and removals. In this paper, we use New Zealand as a case study to comprehensively assess, compare and quantify the net climate change impact of shifting land use between temperate forest and grassland. Forests store large amounts of carbon in their biomass, whereas grasslands contain relatively little biomass carbon. These biomass changes tend to dominate the carbon balance under land-use change. Soil carbon stocks usually do not change much after deforestation unless subsequent erosion occurs, but some soil carbon is often lost when grasslands are reforested with exotic plantations. Forest soils usually release little nitrous oxide or methane and can even oxidise small amounts of methane. Grasslands, on the other hand, can release a large amount of nitrous oxide, which may be further increased with fertilisation, and is higher for cattle- than sheep-grazed systems. Grazing animals increase emissions because the concentrated forms of nitrogen in their excreta allow it to escape from the system. Ruminant animals can also emit large amounts of methane. Land cover change in addition has direct radiative effects through the amount of solar radiation that is either absorbed by vegetated surfaces or reflected back into space. As forests typically absorb more radiation than grasslands, this slightly negates the greenhouse consequences of changes in carbon storage, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions under land-use change.";"Kirschbaum, Miko U.F.

DC trees on soil microbial community and enzymatic activities in intensive silvopastoral systems of Colombia";"";"Livestock production in Latin America has replaced tropical dry forests with conventional monocultures pastures (CP) that have degraded soils. As an alternative to CP, intensive silvopastoral systems (ISS) have been developed with multi-canopied vegetation that mimics native forest (F). The litter inputs and year-round presence of the tree rhizosphere in ISS, contribute to the formation of “fertile islands,” which is expected to impact biological activity and crop productivity. This study, investigated the impact of the conversion of CP to ISS, as well as the effect of canopy of Prosopis juliflora trees in a chronosequence of ISS (3–15years) on soil microbial communities and the physicochemical properties of soil. FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) profiles indicated that soil microbial community structure and composition shifted depending on land management systems. CP promoted the dominance of G⁻ bacteria, while ISS chronosequence and F favored actinomycetes and fungal biomass (total and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). In addition, soil microbial community (FAME profiles) of ISS chronosequence and F were more similar than with CP. An increase in the Cy/pre FAME ratio in CP suggested that the microbial community was under higher stress. The advantage of including trees in pasture systems was reinforced by the observation that FAME biomarkers, enzymatic activities and nutrient status were significantly higher beneath the canopy of P. juliflora. The results indicate that ISS are viable alternatives for improving soil quality and metabolic function, which is reflected in the significant increase in microbial biomass, FAME biomarkers and enzyme activities compared with CP.";"Vallejo, Victoria E.

"AGRIS:US201400162061";"Impacts of winter hay feeding on pasture soils and plants";"";"In temperate regions, feeding livestock year round on pasture is usually limited by weather conditions and livestock must be fed hay, or other stored feeds, at least part of the year when pasture forage runs out. On many farms, hay must be fed during winter and hay feeding is typically confined to pastures that are sacrificed for this purpose. The concentrated use of pasture during winter hay feeding could negatively impact subsequent forage production from soil compaction and possibly create water quality degradation from manure runoff. In 2008, we initiated a field experiment to address how winter hay feeding on pasture might have affected forage and soil variables in VA, USA. Variables were compared between 12 paired pastures each with and without hay feeding sites. Forage accumulation, forage mass, nutritive value and plant species composition along with soil penetration resistance, soil respiration and soil nutrient concentrations were monitored for 2 years. The presence of winter hay feeding sites in pastures had neutral to positive effects on forage productivity and forage nutritive value. Hay feeding pastures were not weedier than control pastures as we predicted, and they did contain more white clover through the grazing season (P<0.05), which may have benefited forage production and nutritive value. As expected, soils from winter hay feeding pastures were more compacted compared with pastures without winter use. Soil compaction did not negatively affect forage production or soil respiration, however. By the end of this study, soil P, K and organic matter concentrations were 59%, 55% and 10% higher, respectively, in hay feeding pastures compared with control pastures. Our findings suggest that well-managed hay feeding in winter could benefit pasture forage production. Moreover, strategic placement of hay feeding sites around farm could be used as a management tool to improve land productivity though nutrient inputs and introduction of legumes into pasture.";"Flores, Joao Paulo

"AGRIS:US201400162062";"Assessing the impacts of economic and climate changes on land-use in mountain regions: A spatial dynamic modeling approach";"";"Future land-use changes are predicted to be influenced by both climate-driven environmental changes and concomitant changes in local economic conditions. Assessing the impact of climate change on ecosystems, and the goods and services that they provide, therefore requires an understanding of the dynamic link between land-cover, ecosystem services and economic-driven land-use decisions. The economic land allocation model (ALUAM) simulates the competition between forest and a range of agricultural land-uses to estimate land-use conversions in a spatially explicit manner at high resolution. Using a modular framework, ALUAM was linked with the forest-landscape model LandClim, and a crop yield model, that simulate the response of forests and crops to changes in climate. An iterative data exchange between the models allows a detailed assessment of the dynamic changes in the provision of agricultural and forest based services. We apply our model to the temperature sensitive inner-alpine region of Visp, Switzerland. Our results demonstrate that land-use is influenced directly by environmental shifts and economic decisions, but are also highly dependent on the interactions between these two components. These shifts in land-use will correspondingly affect the provision of ecosystem goods such as food and timber production.";"Briner, Simon

Feedback about the implementation of this new policy suggests that agriculture continues to drive deforestation. This article explores farmers' household livelihood strategies and land use changes in response to changing forest access rules arising from community-based land management. Based on studying in-depth surveys and participatory mapping in the eastern rain forest highlands, we outline patterns in farmers' responses, exploring the relationship between sociodemographic factors, livelihood strategies, and patterns of land use. Our findings suggest that heterogeneity in farmers' adaptation capacities is closely related to different land use patterns. Furthermore, both conservation and agricultural sustainability have suffered from unintended impacts: an increase of forest clearing, intensification in cultivated area, and an impoverishment of the poorest households. These detailed reviews of household adaptation processes suggest that the zoning-based management scheme would benefit from incorporating a more detailed farm level land use approach. Land use patterns have the potential to inform the design of improved conservation-development initiatives by revealing strategic indicators that could allow practitioners to target households for conservation measures according to their adaption capacities";"Toillier, Aurélie

"AGRIS:US201400052114";"alternative approach for delineating eco-sensitive zones around a wildlife sanctuary applying geospatial techniques";"";"The dynamics, degradation, and conservation of forest ecosystems are matters of prime concerns worldwide at the present. Proper planning and management of a forest area are essentially needed to protect it from the grasp of burgeoning pressure of urban-industrial sprawl. Establishment of eco-sensitive zones (ESZs), which act as buffer areas around the core forests, is one of the key approaches towards achieving this goal. This paper deals with the applicability of geospatial techniques to identify the ESZ around an Indian wildlife sanctuary following the different rules and acts prescribed by the Government of India. Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the northeastern state of Tripura in India, has been selected here as a case study. Collected pieces of information on the distribution of biodiversity and human population in the area were also used to make the approach more holistic. As inferred from this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems were found to be easily implementable and time as well as cost-effective tools for this purpose with a distinct advantage of spatial as well as temporal accuracy in identifying the existing land use and land cover patterns in pilot assessments. However, the results indicated that only appropriate hybridization of field-based information on the biodiversity and ecological aspects of the forest as well as patterns of human interferences with the remote sensing and GIS-based data could make this approach more relevant in actual implementations.";"Deb, Shovik

"AGRIS:US201500162945";"Simulating urban growth processes incorporating a potential model with spatial metrics";"";"Urbanization is one phenomena that drives land use pattern change. Persistent rapid urbanization is associated with depletion of natural resources and worsening conditions in the urban environment. Monitoring urban development is, therefore, an absolute necessity in order to assure sustainable cities in the future. The main objective of this paper is to develop and apply an urban growth potential model incorporating spatial metrics. The model has been tested in Jinan City, China. Firstly, two satellite images (1989 and 2004 SPOT) were used to extract the land-cover. A general land use spatial pattern analysis, based on landscape metrics and a transformation matrix analysis, was conducted. Secondly, a moving window method was used to identify and capture the urbanization process through the PLAND landscape metric. The remote satellite data have been further processed: first to produce an initial state of the land-cover surface, and second to perform a time-series analysis and to assess the potential accuracy of the model application. In the second step, the calibrated model was used to predict the location of the urban growth over 16 years (2004–2020). The results indicated there will be a significant land use change until 2020. However, the spatial distribution of the potential growth areas is not homogenous. The study has confirmed the usefulness of a growth potential model incorporating the moving window method to predict urban growth trends and examining the impacts of urban development on natural resources. The results can provide decision support documents for urban planners and stakeholders with spatially explicit information for future planning and monitoring plans.";"Kong, Fanhua

"AGRIS:US201500015352";"importance of land cover change across urban–rural typologies for climate modeling";"";"Land cover changes affect local surface energy balances by changing the amount of solar energy reflected, the magnitude and duration over which absorbed energy is released as heat, and the amount of energy that is diverted to non-heating fluxes through evaporation. However, such local influences often are only crudely included in climate modeling exercises, if at all. A better understanding of local land conversion dynamics can serve to inform inputs for climate models and increase the role for land use planning in climate management policy. Here we present a new approach for projecting and incorporating metropolitan land cover change into mesoscale climate and other environmental assessment models. Our results demonstrate the relative contributions of different land development patterns to land cover change and conversion and suggest that regional growth management strategies serving to increase settlement densities over time can have a significant influence on the rate of deforestation per unit of population growth. Employing the approach presented herein, the impacts of land conversion on climate change and on parallel environmental systems and services, such as ground water recharge, habitat provision, and food production, may all be investigated more closely and managed through land use planning.";"Vargo, Jason

It has been widely accepted that both climatic conditions and land use have great impact on sandy desertification in northern China. However, the relative role and synergistic effect of each driving force of sandy desertification are still not clear. In this paper, an indicator named as SI was defined to represent the integrated probability of sandy desertification caused by land use. A quantitative method was developed for characterizing the relative roles of annual precipitation and land use to sandy desertification in both spatial and temporal dimensions at county level. Results showed that, at county level, land use was the main cause of sandy desertification for Naiman Banner since 1987–2009. In the case of spatial dimension, the different combination of land use types decided the distribution of sandy desertification probability and finally decided the spatial pattern of bared sand land. In the case of temporal dimension, the synergistic effect of land use and precipitation highly influenced the spatial distribution of sandy desertification.";"Xiaodong, Ge

Temperate Europe (Belgium). Distributional data were extracted from butterfly and grasshopper atlases at a resolution of 5 km for the period 1991-2006 in Belgium. For each group separately, the well-surveyed squares (n = 366 for butterflies and n = 322 for grasshoppers) were identified using an environmental stratification design and were randomly divided into calibration (70%) and evaluation (30%) datasets. Generalized additive models were applied to the calibration dataset to estimate occurrence probabilities for 63 butterfly and 33 grasshopper species, as a function of: (1) climate, (2) climate and land-cover, (3) climate and soil, and (4) climate, land-cover and soil variables. Models were evaluated as: (1) the amount of explained deviance in the calibration dataset, (2) Akaike's information criterion, and (3) the number of omission and commission errors in the evaluation dataset. Information on broad land-cover classes or predominant soil types led to similar improvements in the performance relative to the climate-only models for both taxonomic groups. In addition, the joint inclusion of land-cover and soil variables in the models provided predictions that fitted more closely to the species distributions than the predictions obtained from bioclimatic models incorporating only land-cover or only soil variables. The combined models exhibited higher discrimination ability between the presence and absence of species in the evaluation dataset. These results draw attention to the importance of soil data for species distribution models at regional scales of analysis. The combined inclusion of land-cover and soil data in the models makes it possible to identify areas with suitable climatic conditions but unsuitable combinations of vegetation and soil types. While contingent on the species, the results indicate the need to consider soil information in regional-scale species-climate impact models, particularly when predicting future range shifts of species under climate change.";"Titeux, Nicolas

Such droughts and overexploitation of water caused a significant change of land use and water management practices over the last 50� years. Understanding the change of land use and land cover is, therefore, crucial to understand disturbance of the water cycle around the Lake. The present study analyzed satellite images of Lake Chad from Landsat-MSS, Landsat-TM, and NigeriaSat-1 to investigate the change of land cover during three time periods: the 1970s, 1991, and 2006. Unsupervised and supervised classifications were performed for the land cover analysis. The overall accuracies of the classification of Landsat-TM and NigeriaSat-1 are 93.33 and 95.24� %, respectively. It is evident that a 35� % decrease of waterbodies occurred from the 1970s to 1991, but a slight increase of 0.9� % occurred between 1991 and 2006. The Shrubland has overtaken most of the waterlog areas, as much as seven times of what it was in the 1970s. The interpretation of NigeriaSat-1 images indicates that NigeriaSat-1 has similar capabilities to Landsat-TM and Landsat-MSS for the detection of various land cover types because land cover and land use features are discernible on the processed images, especially depletion of waterbodies and vegetation. These are similarities justify the quality of the NigeriaSat-1 images for land cover and land use analysis.";"Babamaaji, Rakiya A.

Determining if, how and why this conflict has changed over time will be an important step towards managing landscapes where people and elephants Elephas maximus coexist. This study combines social surveys and remote sensing data to analyse patterns in humanâelephant conflict and land-use change over time. The reported experience of conflict increased dramatically in the early 1980s, with 85% of those surveyed indicating that conflict began after 1980. The expansion of conflict showed a significant southward trend and was associated with forest cover dropping below 30â40%. Based on our results we propose that a critical habitat threshold for humanâelephant conflict may exist at 30â40% forest cover. Below this level, conflict expanded across the landscape. The existence of such a deforestation threshold may have important implications for landscape management in elephant range states that seek to avoid or mitigate further conflict. Maintenance of remaining forest areas, reforestation, and the creation of habitat corridors are strategies that could help prevent further expansion of conflict.";"Chartier, Laura

This article analyzes the genesis and the history of this research effort and the causes of its successes and failures. I will show that despite the genuine commitment of the ASB Programme to achieve comprehensive analysis linking the social and the biophysical realms, its conclusions and recommendations were biased in favor of biophysical models whose adoption by farmers remained low. The ASB scientists engaged in a self-critique which led to the opening of new areas of inquiry, such as the macroeconomic context of deforestation. But an excessive faith in the positivist paradigm of Western science maintained the illusion that perfect biophysical solutions could be designed, if larger scales (watershed or region) were addressed. Economic instruments (payment for environmental services) are now being elaborated to favor the adoption of these models, and the ASB Programme may be on the verge of replicating at watershed scale the misleading approach it adopted earlier at plot scale. I conclude that in order to properly answer to the environmental challenges of our time, some myths that pervade within the practice of science have to be debunked, and the issue of unequal power between stakeholders have to be addressed. This could be achieved by paying more attention to disciplines that employ the narrative mode to depict realities and by taking more distance from managerial approaches and from the technological optimism that characterizes them.";"Pollini, Jacques";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"deforestation;farming systems;land management;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301652879";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.05.002";"";"";"";"48-60"

The Mediterranean region has been affected by antropic disturbance for thousands of years, and is, nowadays, one of the most significantly altered hotspots in the world. However, in the last years a significant increase in forest cover has been measured. These new patterns are independent from planned conservation strategies and appear to have a substantial impact on landscapes and biodiversity. We used three land-use/land-cover maps (from 1960 to 2000) covering the Italian peninsula to analyze the pattern of land-use/land-cover change. We measured an increase in forests, especially in mountains, an increase in artificial areas, especially in coastal zones, and a decrease in pastures. Intensively cultivated areas showed a limited decrease while extensively cultivated ones showed a marked decrease. In the same period mammal and bird species followed a similar pattern, with forest birds, ungulates and carnivores increasing, and typically Mediterranean species decreasing. We suggest that our results may provide important information, which could be useful for conservation planning in the entire Mediterranean hotspot. We suggest that an increasing conservation effort should be made to protect the Mediterranean-type forests and scrublands, as well as traditional agricultural practices. Moreover, future conservation efforts should consider the broad socio-political and ecological processes that are most likely to occur across the whole hotspot, especially along coastal areas, and the network of protected areas should be functionally integrated in a conservation strategy that includes the human-dominated landscape.";"Falcucci, Alessandra

We distinguished 11 land cover change classes and 7 associated “time since abandonment” classes at a detailed scale. Several environmental and non-environmental factors were found to be important variables for the land abandonment process. Differences in soil class explain a large part of the land abandonment pattern and the associated transition paths and transition rates. Most abandoned lands are located on regosols and lithosols, which are marginal soils with respect to water holding capacity. Within soil classes, we could recognise different transition paths and transition rates. However, within the 55 years covered by this dataset detailed transitions from pioneer vegetation to vegetation higher in the succession, as described by other authors, were only found for a limited number of vegetation/soil combinations. We relate these slow transitions for some areas to ongoing grazing and for some other areas to irreversible degradation.";"Sluiter, Raymond

Kudzu covers more than 2.8 million ha which prevents uses such as timber production and establishment of carbon plantations. Using data collected on sites in Mississippi, this study examines the after-tax monetary trade-offs of controlling kudzu using different herbicide regimes. The results suggest that the most cost-effective way to control kudzu patches is to apply Escort XP using an aerial applicator. This application is appropriate for both young and old kudzu patches and whether the landowner intends to afforest the site with pine or oak.";"Grebner, Donald L.

These problems emerge from different domains at different spatial scales: agricultural development, natural resource management, and landscape scale conservation. Land and livelihoods are severely constrained in central Africa. Agriculture is rarely remunerative: prices are low, technology limited, land rights contested, and labor scarce. People turn to “illegal” activities such as hunting, mining, pit-sawing, whisky brewing, and joining militias to make a living. Animal husbandry does not present a widely viable option. Land use planning at “landscape” scale is mooted to protect forests and save animals but it is not likely to address livelihood or governance concerns. Without clear legal frameworks and transparent processes, conflict and landgrabbing will result. Investors and planners should rather concentrate on crafting rural development strategies that reflect both the constraints and the comparative advantage of the central African humid forest zone. Above all, the authors argue, the days of carving out large areas of the forest for private concessions and government use, leaving small contested spaces for the locals, must come to an end.";"Russell, Diane

We show that the computation of the ILUC is shrouded with uncertainty; they vary frequently, and are strongly affected by policy choices. It seems that its overall impact on GHGs is relatively minor. Once the ILUCs are introduced other indirect effects of biofuel may need to be considered which will increase the cost of biofuel regulations.

"AGRIS:US2016201480";"ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON AGRICULTURE IN GERMANY - A RICARDIAN ANALYSIS";"";"To assess the impact of climate change on agriculture in German districts, a Ricardian analysis accounting for spatial autocorrelation is used. The analysis relies on land rental prices from agricultural statistics and climate data from the network of German weather observation stations. The results of the cross-sectional analysis show a significant correlation between land rents and increasing mean temperatures, as well as (except for East Germany) a significant increase of land rents along with declining spring precipitation. Next, climate data from the regional climate model REMO are used to calculate local land rent changes under different IPCC scenarios for a time horizon between 2011 and 2040. The overall result is an increase in land rents which relates to 5-6 % of net German agricultural income. In West Germany the increase in land rents rises from the north to south, because of the higher temperature increases in the South of Germany. East Germany shows a greater increase in land rents than West Germany, due to the presently more unfavourable climatic water balance which profits from the increase in spring precipitation. However, agricultural income in Germany might decrease in the long run, when the changes in the climatic conditions will be more severe than those simulated in this study. We plan to extend and improve the research in this field. Different approaches to consider soil qualities at district level shall be compared. In order to understand farmers’ adaptation to different climatic conditions multinomial logit models will be used to investigate how German land use structures depend on the climate. Furthermore, a typology of related transaction costs shall be devised. This will allow the identification of those regions where the adaptation needs and the corresponding costs are likely to be relatively high.";"Aurbacher, Joachim

Four agri-environmental policy instruments are considered: a uniform area payment, a quality-dependent area payment, a mandatory buffer strip policy and a voluntary buffer strip payment. We also analyse how general tax and monetary policies may affect agricultural land prices. The theoretical framework is illustrated by an empirical model applied to Finnish agriculture. The empirical model shows that macroeconomic factors, such as general tax and monetary policies, may exert a greater impact on land prices than some minor fine-tuning in agrienvironmental policies.";"Guyomard, Herve

"AGRIS:DJ2012080447";"Can REDD+ Save the Forest? The Role of Payments and Tenure";"";"A recent policy response to halting global forest deforestation and degradation, and any resulting greenhouse gas emissions is REDD+, which also includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Although still in its infancy, the success of REDD+ will depend significantly on whether it can be economically viable and if any resulting payments are sufficient to cover the opportunity cost plus any transaction cost. Where tenure security over forest is weak, REDD+ can pose a risk for forest communities, who could be dispossessed, excluded and marginalized. This review of existing studies explores how payment for avoided deforestation, and forest tenure impact the success of REDD+ projects in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and equity. Effectiveness refers to the difference between deforestation with and without REDD+, efficiency refers to avoiding deforestation at minimal cost, and equity refers to the implication of REDD+ on benefit sharing. We conclude that the potential success or failure of REDD+ as a means to reduce deforestation and carbon emission on forest commons depends critically on designing projects that work within existing informal tenure institutions to ensure that carbon storage benefits align with livelihood benefits.";"Edward B.

"AGRIS:US201500184759";"technique for quantifying groundwater pumping and land subsidence using a nonlinear stochastic poroelastic model";"";"Subsidence in Yunlin County, Taiwan, is serious and continuous. The Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) route crosses the subsidence area and might be affected by differential settlements. It is important to evaluate the pumping quantity for water resource management and to predict the subsidence for land resource management to mitigate the subsidence problem in Taiwan. This study combines first-order second-moment (FOSM) stochastic poroelastic theory with nonlinear parameters to develop a FOSM nonlinear stochastic poroelastic model and applies it to quantify groundwater pumping and future subsidence with uncertainty. The additional loading and discharge are evaluated by fitting the subsidence historical data to the numerical model. The results show that the proposed model well describes the subsidence behavior and quantifies groundwater pumping. However, the numerical results are larger than the monitoring data at various depths, which might be due to the different compaction situations in individual formations of the aquifer system. The predicted subsidence at the Yuanchang monitoring well is the largest (0.32 ± 0.52 m in 2020) with consideration of the climate change effects, achieved by adding an additional discharge of 31.7 %. The large uncertainty is caused by the large variation of hydraulic conductivity caused by the heterogeneity of the aquifer system, which could be improved by doing more experiments or using a conditioned model. The information provided in this study is useful for the safety of THSR and for land and groundwater resource management in Yunlin County, Taiwan.";"Wang, Shih-Jung

Beef cattle farmers have long been adopting forestry mostly as woodlots or SPSs. In spite of the potential complementary relationship between forestry and cattle husbandry, research in temperate regions is scarce. The objectives of this study were to identify constraints for the inclusion of forestry in cattle farms and to assess expansion potential for this land use. A survey was conducted on a sample of 104 landowners with cattle farms larger than 100 ha. The adoption of forestry in cattle farms was strongly associated with educational level and farm size. The most frequently mentioned advantage in forest plantations owners (FF) and farmers willing to adopt forestry (PWF) was the shelter that trees give to cattle, followed by the increase in calving rate. In those cases where more than one disadvantage was mentioned, environmental issues were the main factors constraining plantation forestry adoption. Over 18 % of FF farmers and 37 % of farmers not willing to adopt forestry (NWF) perceived land use conversion from forestry back to grassland pastures and the high costs involved as a major disadvantage.";"Bussoni, Adriana

Groundwater level data recorded at 26 observation wells for a 14-year period in the Kumamoto Plain, central Kyushu, southwest Japan, were used for the analysis. The general trends of LULC were detected by a satellite image classification technique and surface spline method, which highlighted the decreases in groundwater-recharge materials. As the next step, those trends of groundwater levels that were closely correlated with rainfall were removed from the level data set, and the resultant residual component levels were applied to co-kriging analysis with LULC categories. Co-kriging provided a detailed map of groundwater level variability. Furthermore, we propose a method, prediction of residual of groundwater level (PWL), to infer future residual groundwater levels from the supposed LULC pattern by co-kriging-based modeling. PWL was demonstrated to be effective because it clearly represented the decrease and increase in negative residual level areas, depending on the extent of rice fields in the past and in predicted future distribution scenarios.";"Moukana, Jean Aurelien

"AGRIS:US201600180502";"Establishing turf grass increases soil greenhouse gas emissions in peri-urban environments";"";"Urbanization is becoming increasingly important in terms of climate change and ecosystem functionality worldwide. We are only beginning to understand how the processes of urbanization influence ecosystem dynamics and how peri-urban environments contribute to climate change. Brisbane in South East Queensland (SEQ) currently has the most extensive urban sprawl of all Australian cities. This leads to substantial land use changes in urban and peri-urban environments and the subsequent gaseous emissions from soils are to date neglected for IPCC climate change estimations. This research examines how land use change effects methane (CHâ) and nitrous oxide (NâO) fluxes from peri-urban soils and consequently influences the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of rural ecosystems in agricultural use undergoing urbanization. Therefore, manual and fully automated static chamber measurements determined soil gas fluxes over a full year and an intensive sampling campaign of 80Â days after land use change. Turf grass, as the major peri-urban land cover, increased the GWP by 415Â kg COâ-e haâ»Â¹ over the first 80Â days after conversion from a well-established pasture. This results principally from increased daily average NâO emissions of 0.5Â g NâO haâ»Â¹ dâ»Â¹ from the pasture to 18.3Â g NâO haâ»Â¹ dâ»Â¹ from the turf grass due to fertilizer application during conversion. Compared to the native dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest, turf grass establishment increases the GWP by another 30Â kg COâ-e haâ»Â¹. The results presented in this study clearly indicate the substantial impact of urbanization on soil-atmosphere gas exchange in form of non-COâ greenhouse gas emissions particularly after turf grass establishment.";"van Delden, Lona

Decision-makers need information on trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services but tools for assessing the latter are often expensive, technically demanding and ignore the local context. In this study we used a simple, replicable participatory assessment approach to gather information on ecosystem services at important sites for biodiversity conservation in Nepal, to feed into local and national decision-making. Through engaging knowledgeable stakeholders we assessed the services delivered by Nepal's 27 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, the pressures affecting services through impacts on land cover and land use, and the consequences of these for people. We found that these sites provide ecosystem services to beneficiaries at a range of scales but under current pressures the balance of services will change, with local communities incurring the greatest costs. The approach provided valuable information on the trade-offs between ecosystem services and between different people, developed the capacity of civil society to engage in decision-making at the local and national level, and provided digestible information for Nepal's government. We recommend this approach in other countries where there is a lack of information on the likely impacts of land-use change on ecosystem services and people.";"Thapa, Ishana

Values, in turn, depend on the mix of lot sizes and building attributes (improvement characteristics), which are affected by zoning.  Since lot size restrictions limit the size characteristics of homes (bedrooms, garages, building square footage, etc), it should constrain the number of school age kids emanating from a given homestead and that a school district services.  Each home, depending on lot size, should exhibit differential impacts on school district revenues.  Similarly, if lot size and the magnitude of other housing characteristics impact on the number of kids emanating from a home, then each home would generate differential costs on the school district. This paper argues that the number of school age kids from a given home is endogenous to lot size.  It therefore posits that an optimal lot size exists within a community that would maximize school district revenues, minimize school district costs or optimize the combination of both.  A theoretical framework is developed to guide the specification of net revenue functions for school districts.  By applying data from a school district in Michigan, net revenue functions are estimated as functions of lot size and other exogenous factors.  The result suggests that net revenue is only feasibly optimal at lot sizes below approximately 0.18 acres.  One implication is that school districts, which typically do not engage themselves in the process of local land use decision making, might consider the promotion of density and compact development as being in their best interest.";"Adelaja, Adesoji O.

"AGRIS:US201600198637";"Complex effects of fragmentation on remnant woodland plant communities of a rapidly urbanizing biodiversity hotspot";"";"In many cities worldwide, urbanization is leading to the rapid and extensive fragmentation of native vegetation into small and scattered urban remnants. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the longâterm conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history. Moreover, the smaller and older remnants may already display changes due to fragmentation, providing clues for urban planning and ecosystem management that help to protect urban remnant plant diversity.";"Ramalho, Cristina E.

"AGRIS:US201301549525";"Factors influencing large wildland fire suppression expenditures";"";"There is an urgent and immediate need to address the excessive cost of large fires. Here, we studied large wildland fire suppression expenditures by the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Among 16 potential non-managerial factors, which represented fire size and shape, private properties, public land attributes, forest and fuel conditions, and geographic settings, we found only fire size and private land had a strong effect on suppression expenditures. When both were accounted for, all the other variables had no significant effect. A parsimonious model to predict suppression expenditures was suggested, in which fire size and private land explained 58% of variation in expenditures. Other things being equal, suppression expenditures monotonically increased with fire size. For the average fire size, expenditures first increased with the percentage of private land within burned area, but as the percentage exceeded 20%, expenditures slowly declined until they stabilised when private land reached 50% of burned area. The results suggested that efforts to contain federal suppression expenditures need to focus on the highly complex, politically sensitive topic of wildfires on private land.";"Liang, Jingjing

Monitoring the dynamics and causes of desertification is essential to provide important instruction for desertification control strategies and rational planning of land use in arid and semi-arid areas. In order to assess temporal–spatial variability of desertification from 1986 through 1993 to 2003 in an agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern Shaanxi, China, satellite images were interpreted and analyzed along with meteorological and socio-economic data. During the intervening 17-year period, desertification has decreased in severity and increased in extent. Temporally, severe desertification has decreased in area by 26.8% from 1986 to 2003. Desertification landscape patch quantities and fragmentation indexes have increased gradually. Spatially, desertification has increased in extent north of the Great Wall and decreased in extent in the Wuding river valley and north-western Shenmu County. The geographic centers of deserts in the study area have moved to the south-west and north-east. Climate change and human activities were somewhat responsible for the decrease in desertification severity but significantly affected the increase in desertification extent. The “Three North Shelterbelt Program” and “Grain-for-Green Project” carried out by the governments were the dominant contributors to the desertification severity reversal. Desertification control is a difficult and gradually process and the government should continue to play and enhance the leading role in this process.";"Qi, Yanbing

"AGRIS:US2016220600";"Land Reform and Farm-Household Income Inequality: The Case of Georgia";"";"The income inequality implications of land reform are examined for the case of Georgia using regression-based inequality decomposition techniques. An egalitarian land redistribution is likely to equalize per-capita income among farm households, implying that continuing the land reform process in Georgia is likely to benefit poorer households, relatively speaking. However, land fragmentation was found to be disequalizing, and therefore land market developments that enable plot consolidation are not less important for inequality than the land redistribution itself. Both landholdings and farm assets have favorable inequality implications not only through farm income but also through non-farm income, implying that these productive assets increase the economic opportunities of rural households in the non-farm sector as well, perhaps by easing borrowing constraints.";"Kimhi, Ayal";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-10-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"GEO";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016220600";"http://purl.umn.edu/54159";"";"";"";""

A number of similar tools have been developed for ranchers in southern Africa, but there has been little help for land managers under common property regimes. Manuals were therefore primarily designed for use by communal pastoralists in three study areas in the Kalahari, Botswana. Separate manuals were developed for each study area in response to the differences in indicators and management options deemed relevant for each by local communities. The design of the DSS has been optimised using an “innovation-decision” approach combined with local and external expert review to enhance the likelihood of widespread uptake and application by land managers. Manuals are designed for regular use by pastoralists to identify detrimental environmental change early, and guide sustainable management responses. The recommended assessment procedure is flexible, and designed to make recording and interpretation of results simple for users.

"AGRIS:US2016220604";"SPATIAL TARGETING STRATEGIES FOR LAND CONSERVATION";"";"Purchasing development rights is a major mechanism for the protection of environmental quality and landscape amenities. This paper provides a targeting strategy for protecting multiple environmental benefits that takes into account land costs and probability of land use conversion. We compare two strategies.  Subject to a budget constraint on parcel purchases, the standard strategy is to target parcels with the highest ratio of environmental benefits to land costs.  The standard strategy selects parcels even if there is little probability that the parcel would otherwise be converted.  Our new strategy targets parcels to minimize the benefit loss from land conversion, which weights parcel based on initial benefit endowment and expected probability of land use conversion. The empirical analysis focuses on targeting conservation easements in the exurban region of Sonoma County, CA, in which extensively-managed, developable parcels (i.e. pasture and forest areas) with environmental benefits are being converted to residential use and vineyards. Spatially-explicit modeling approaches are employed to estimate land values and likelihood of land use conversion, according to heterogeneous parcel site characteristics, for all developable parcels. Our results indicate that benefit-cost targeting is biased toward low cost parcels, since it ignores the variation in likelihood of future land use conversion. This inefficiency for benefit-cost targeting arises from the positive relationship that typically exists between likelihood of land use change and value of development rights. Hence, some parcels with poor land quality or remote accessibility to urban centers would have de facto conservation, and therefore do not warrant targeting of conservation funds, despite the low cost of protection. Our new targeting strategy balances the countervailing factors of land values and likelihood of land use conversion.";"Newburn, David A.

"AGRIS:US201400104945";"Evolution of major environmental geological problems in karst areas of Southwestern China";"";"Karst terrains are generally regarded as a fragile and vulnerable environment. China’s karst is mainly developed in pre-Triassic, old-phase, hard, compact carbonate rock. The lack of soil cover in bare karst land can enhance desertification. Its underground drainage system can aggravate both drought and flooding problems; the interconnected surface and subsurface conditions allow for easy contamination by pollutants. Moreover, karst terrains quite often suffer from a series of engineering problems, such as water infiltrating into mines or transportation tunnels, leakage from reservoirs, and failure of building foundations. As resources and energy exploitation intensified in recent years, karst areas in Southwest China faced some severe geo environmental problems. In order to find out how the problems action and evolution in recent years, field and laboratory investigations were conducted in Guangxi autonomous region, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei provinces, and Chongqing municipality. About 100 experts from the Provincial Geological Survey and graduate students took part in this project. Several symposiums were held during those 3� years. Besides the in situ survey, data were collected from hydrogeological survey results since 2000 when the new round of land resources investigation began. After analyzing these data, rock desertification, drought and flooding, and contamination and engineering geological environmental problems were considered the most prevalent problems in karst areas in Southwestern China. The status of each problem is elaborated upon in this paper and should be considered for future sustainable development.";"Guo, Fang

Using a paired-site approach, we estimated the effect of land-cover change on the C stock from 1972 to 2008 in a natural reserve (Grotta di Santa Ninfa) in western Sicily. We selected 15 paired sites representative of five LUCs. We studied the effect of land use on soil organic C (SOC) content in bulk soil and in different particle-size fractions (2000–1000μm, 1000–500μm, 500–250μm, 250–63μm, 63–25μm, and <25μm). Laboratory incubation of the soil samples was conducted to measure CO₂ evolution in bulk soil collected at two different depths from each paired site. We found that the conversion of natural vegetation to orchards (vineyards and olive groves) resulted in SOC decreases ranging from 27% to 50%. The conversion from vineyards to arable land led to a 9% decrease in SOC, whereas the opposite caused a 105% gain. When arable land was replaced by Eucalyptus afforestation, a 40% increase in SOC was observed. SOC decline occurred mainly in coarser soil fractions, whereas the finest fractions were not influenced by land use. We calculated an overall SOC reduction of 63% in the study area, corresponding to a 58Mgha⁻¹ SOC loss in less than 30years. Our results indicate that land-use conversion, vegetation type, and management practices that control the biogeochemical and physical properties of soil could help reduce CO₂ emissions and sequester SOC.";"Novara, Agata

Simpukng is managed secondary forests in which selected species of fruits, rattan, bamboo, timber and other plants are planted. While most are owned by families and passed down from one generation to the next, some are managed on a communal basis. Complex customary Dayak rules exist that control the use and inheritance of these forests that help to avoid over-exploitation of resources. There is clear gender division of labour among Dayak in the management of simpukng that provide a range of products - for household consumption and sale and for customary rituals - fruits, vegetables, medicines, fire wood, honey, rattan, bamboos, and timber. Local knowledge about the more highly valued species are discussed. These indigenous forest garden systems are currently under threat from large-scale mining and logging activities; conflicts between local and external agencies are unfortunately frequent. This paper examines the development and management of simpukng in four Dayak villages in East Kalimantan and their implications on sustainable management of natural resources, with particular emphasis on the role of local knowledge of some of the more highly valued species and the current challenges faced by these communities in maintaining their traditional agroforest management practices.";"Mulyoutami, Elok

Grazing can accelerate and alter the timing of nutrient transfers, and increase the amount of nutrients cycled from plant to soil. Our reason for conducting this study is to test whether cattle congregation sites (CCS) typical on most Florida ranches, such as mineral feeders (MF), water troughs (WT), and shaded areas (SA) have higher soil organic carbon (SOC) than in other locations of pasture under foraged-based system. Baseline soil samples around the congregations zones (MF, WT, and SA) and grazing zones in established (>10 year), grazed cow-calf pastures were collected in the spring and fall of 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Soil samples were collected from two soil depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm) at different locations around the CCS following a radial (every 90 degrees: N, S, E, and W) sampling pattern at 0.9, 1.7, 3.3, 6.7, 13.3, 26.7, and 53.3 m away from the approximate center of MF, WT, and SA. The levels of SOC varied significantly with CCS (P ≤ 0.001), distance away from the center of the CCS (P ≤ 0.05), sampling depth (P ≤ 0.001), sampling year (P ≤ 0.001) and the interaction of CCS and soil depth (P ≤ 0.001). Sampling orientations did not significantly affect the levels of SOC. The SA sites had the highest level of SOC of 3.58 g kg⁻¹, followed by WT sites (3.47 g kg⁻¹) and MF sites (2.98 g kg⁻¹). Results of our study did not support our hypothesis that cattle congregation sites typical on most ranches, such as MF, WT and SA, may have higher concentrations of SOC. The levels of SOC (averaged across CCS) within the congregation zone (3.42 g kg⁻¹) were not significantly (P ≤ 0.05) different from the concentrations of SOC at the grazing zone (3.16 g kg⁻¹).";"Sigua, Gilbert C.

Switzerland, covering 41,244 km² in central Europe. Vascular plant species data were collected along transects of 2500-m length within 1-km² quadrats on a systematic national grid (n = 354), using a standardized assessment method. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to correlate species richness of vascular plants per transect (SRt) with three sets of variables: topography, environment and land cover. Regression models were constructed by the following process: reduction of collinearity among variables, model selection based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and the percentage of deviance explained (D²). A synthetic model was then built using the best variables from all three sets of variables. Finally, the best models were used in a predictive mode to generate maps of species richness (SRt) at the landscape scale using the moving window approach based on 1-km² moving windows with a resolution of 1 ha. The best explanatory model consisted of seven variables including 14 linear and quadratic parameters, and explained 74% of the deviance (D² = 0.742). Used in a predictive mode, the model generated maps with distinctive horizontal belts of highest species richness at intermediate altitudes along valley slopes. Belts of higher richness were also present along rivers and around large forest patches and larger villages, as well as on mountains. The approach involved using consistent samples of species linked to information on the environment at a fine scale enabled landscapes to be compared in terms of predicted species richness. The results can therefore be applied to support the development of national nature conservation strategies. At the landscape scale, belts of high species richness correspond to steep environmental gradients and associated increases in local habitat diversity. In the mountains, the belts of increased species richness are at intermediate altitudes. These general belt-like patterns at mid-elevation are found in all model parameterizations. Other patterns, such as belts along rivers, are visible in specific parameterizations only. Thus we recommend using several sets of parameters in such modelling studies in order to capture the underlying spatial complexity of biodiversity.";"Wohlgemuth, Thomas

Frontal simulations are evaluated against high resolution atmospheric soundings, station observations, and gridded rainfall analyses and shown to reproduce the qualitative features of cold fronts. Land-cover change results in a decrease in total frontal precipitation through a decrease in boundary-layer turbulent kinetic energy and vertically integrated moisture convergence, and an increase in wind speed within the lower boundary layer.

"AGRIS:US201500217184";"application of the social tenure domain model (STDM) to family land in Trinidad and Tobago";"";"Family land is a form of communal tenure found in some of the countries of the English-speaking Caribbean inclusive of Trinidad and Tobago. It has been problematic to administer, is sometimes the source of land conflict and litigation, it has been seen as the cause of many land-related problems such as land degradation and fragmentation, and has therefore been targeted for eradication by land title registration programmes. Informal occupation of many years standing on state and private land is also widespread in Trinidad and Tobago. Recording the existence of these extant extralegal but legitimate rights would go a long way to improving the land administration and the security of tenure on these lands. The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) is a logical and structured standard format for describing the land–human relationship, using an ontology that would allow for sharing of understanding, data and, eventually, software among jurisdictions. This standard is being developed, but has not as yet been finalised, by a technical committee of the ISO (The International Organization for Standardization). The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) is a refinement of the LADM, also being developed by ISO, related to describing more nuanced tenure and land administration components and arrangements that do not fit into the more general descriptions within the LADM, such as customary tenure and informal settlements. This paper charts a preliminary investigation into the applicability of the STDM descriptions to the particular land tenure situations of Trinidad and Tobago and to other countries in the Caribbean in which family land and other informal tenure forms are found. Describing these rights using the standard would then allow for the communication and understanding of the tenure situation and should support the eventual recordation of these rights.";"Griffith-Charles, Charisse";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land tenure";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217184";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2010.10.004";"";"";"";"514-522"
"AGRIS:US201500192733";"Pollution, habitat loss, fishing, and climate change as critical threats to penguins";"";"Cumulative human impacts across the world's oceans are considerable. We therefore examined a single model taxonomic group, the penguins (Spheniscidae), to explore how marine species and communities might be at risk of decline or extinction in the southern hemisphere. We sought to determine the most important threats to penguins and to suggest means to mitigate these threats. Our review has relevance to other taxonomic groups in the southern hemisphere and in northern latitudes, where human impacts are greater. Our review was based on an expert assessment and literature review of all 18 penguin species; 49 scientists contributed to the process. For each penguin species, we considered their range and distribution, population trends, and main anthropogenic threats over the past approximately 250 years. These threats were harvesting adults for oil, skin, and feathers and as bait for crab and rock lobster fisheries; harvesting of eggs; terrestrial habitat degradation; marine pollution; fisheries bycatch and resource competition; environmental variability and climate change; and toxic algal poisoning and disease. Habitat loss, pollution, and fishing, all factors humans can readily mitigate, remain the primary threats for penguin species. Their future resilience to further climate change impacts will almost certainly depend on addressing current threats to existing habitat degradation on land and at sea. We suggest protection of breeding habitat, linked to the designation of appropriately scaled marine reserves, including in the High Seas, will be critical for the future conservation of penguins. However, large‐scale conservation zones are not always practical or politically feasible and other ecosystem‐based management methods that include spatial zoning, bycatch mitigation, and robust harvest control must be developed to maintain marine biodiversity and ensure that ecosystem functioning is maintained across a variety of scales.";"Trathan, Phil N.

Additionally, biodiversity on farms is vulnerable to degradation of the surrounding landscape and changing patterns of land use. We monitored Coleoptera and Hemiptera on grass-fed cattle farms in North Carolina to determine effects of cattle and land use patterns on biodiversity. We found differences among farms in sward height, densities of several insect families and insect diversity that were related to management but not to cattle density. Sward height was more strongly related to the insect community than surrounding land cover patterns. However, both sward height and land cover patterns were related to insect diversity patterns, suggesting that maintenance of biodiversity is not solely affected by agricultural practices on farms.";"Paradise, Christopher

This dysfunction, worsened by the climatic conditions (drought), requires the implementation of ecological engineering strategies allowing the rehabilitation of degraded areas through the restoration of essential ecological services. The first symptoms of weathering processes of soil quality in tropical and Mediterranean environments result in an alteration of the plant cover structure with, in particular, the pauperization of plant species diversity and abundance. This degradation is accompanied by a weakening of soils and an increase of the impact of erosion on the surface layer resulting in reduced fertility of soils in terms of their physicochemical characteristics as well as their biological ones (e.g., soil microbes). Among the microbial components particularly sensitive to erosion, symbiotic microorganisms (rhizobia, Frankia, mycorrhizal fungi) are known to be key components in the main terrestrial biogeochemical cycles (C, N and P). Many studies have shown the importance of the management of these symbiotic microorganisms in rehabilitation and revegetation strategies of degraded environments, but also in improving the productivity of agrosystems. In particular, the selection of symbionts and their inoculation into the soil were strongly encouraged in recent decades. These inoculants were selected not only for their impact on the plant, but also for their ability to persist in the soil at the expense of the residual native microflora. The performance of this technique was thus evaluated on the plant cover, but its impact on soil microbial characteristics was totally ignored. The role of microbial diversity on productivity and stability (resistance, resilience, etc.) of eco- and agrosystems has been identified relatively recently and has led to a questioning of the conceptual bases of controlled inoculation in sustainable land management. It has been suggested that the environmental characteristics of the area to rehabilitate should be taken into account, and more particularly its degradation level in relation to the threshold of ecological resilience. This consideration should lead to the optimization of the cultural practices to either (i) restore the original properties of an ecosystem in case of slightly degraded environments or (ii) transform an ecosystem in case of highly degraded soils (e.g., mine soils). In this chapter, we discuss, through various examples of experiments conducted in tropical and Mediterranean areas, the performance of different strategies to manage the microbial potential in soils (inoculation of exotic vs. native species, inoculation or controlled management potential microbial stratum via aboveground vegetation, etc.) based on the level of environmental degradation.";"Duponnois, Robin

Our study aimed to provide preliminary information on regeneration in cashew orchards by studying the effect of previous land cover, the surrounding landscape, and orchards’ age on the density of species and number of plants. We followed linear transects in orchards planted in areas previously covered by savannah and forest. We found typical forest species growing in the understory, even in orchards previously occupied by savannah or as old as 42 years. The density of species is higher in orchards planted in previously forested plots and in more forested environments. Species density in the understory decreases as orchards get older, but it seems that it increases again after a certain age threshold. This study shows that cashew orchards in Cantanhez retain their potential for succession to forest, and highlights the continuum that may exist between orchards and forests. More research is needed to assess a possible “forestization” of the savannahs through cashew plantations.";"Sousa, Joana

This article explores the potential for using such typologies for a variety of NRM and rural and regional development applications. Review of typology use further suggests that there is potential to refine the way that typologies are developed and applied to better aid NRM, farming systems analyses, and rural and regional development. Before typologies will be adopted more widely, a number of theoretical and methodologic issues must be addressed. These include the following questions: (1) Which criteria and methods should or can be used to classify landholders? (2) How should studies across spatial and temporal scales be integrated? (3) How should multiple and single industry studies be integrated to gain the most value from research? We argue that quantitative research techniques are well suited to provide an underlying structure for landholder typologies, and qualitative research techniques are useful for developing understanding of the nature of variation within and between landholder types. We argued further that because of the potential utility and breadth for the application of landholder typologies, a nested set of landholder typologies could be developed that are coordinated at the national, regional, and local geographic levels, with repeated measures used to track the evolution with time of landholder practices, management values, and socioeconomic characteristics.";"Emtage, Nick

"AGRIS:US201400162936";"Afforestation, agricultural abandonment and intensification: Competing trajectories in semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystems";"";"An understanding of land use change and its drivers in semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystems is important for informing ways to facilitate adaptation to future environmental and socioeconomic pressures. In this paper, we mapped and quantified land use changes in the semi-arid Mediterranean agro-ecosystem of Torrealvilla catchment between 1956 and 2008. Subsequently, we detected signs of landscape fragmentation and examined the relationship between land use change trajectories and a set of biophysical factors using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Finally, we qualitatively evaluated the role of socioeconomic drivers on the land use change trajectories. The study provides accounts of multidirectional land use trajectories in semi-arid Mediterranean landscapes. Our analysis shows that more than 72% of the study area has undergone significant changes over the past five decades with pronounced effects on landscape composition and structure. Both biophysical and socioeconomic factors are strongly related to the observed spatial and temporal changes in land use. Three major trajectories were observed. Firstly, rain-fed agriculture is becoming less dominant; future abandonment of rain-fed agriculture should be anticipated. Secondly, expansion of forested areas is evident in higher altitudes. The trend is still likely to continue given the possibility of further abandonment of rain-fed farming and existing subsidies for reforestation of arable land. Thirdly, intensification has been observed which has occurred mainly in lower parts of the landscape on flat to gentle slopes and near main roads. Further intensification is likely to be subject to market drivers, irrigation water availability, and future rural development and agricultural policy. Overall, the study shows that even within a given locality, contrasting land use trajectories can emerge as a result of local responses to multiple drivers of change and these need to be carefully taken into account in future policy development.";"Nainggolan, Doan

"AGRIS:US201400190058";"Impact of rainwater harvesting on water resources of the modder river basin, central region of South Africa";"";"Along the path of water flowing in a river basin are many water-related human interventions that modify the natural systems. Rainwater harvesting is one such intervention that involves collecting and use of surface runoff for different purpose in the upstream catchment. Increased water consumption at upstream level is an issue of concern for downstream water availability to sustain ecosystem services. The upper Modder River basin, located in a semi arid region in the central South Africa, is experiencing intermittent droughts causing water shortages for agriculture, livestock and domestic uses. To address this problem a technique was developed for small scale farmers with the objective of collecting and concentrating of rainwater for crop production. However, the hydrological impact of a wider adoption of this technique by farmers has not been well quantified. In this regard, the SWAT hydrological model was used to simulate potential hydrological impact of such practices. The scenarios studied were: (1) baseline scenario, based on the actual land use of 2000, which is dominated by pasture (combination of natural and some improved grass lands) (PAST); (2) partial conversion of actual land use 2000 (PAST) to conventional agriculture (Agri-CON); and (3) partial conversion of actual land use 2000 (PAST) to in-field rainwater harvesting which was aimed at improving the precipitation use efficiency (Agri-IRWH). SWAT was calibrated using both observed daily as well as monthly streamflow data of a sub-catchment (419km²) in the study area. SWAT performed well in simulating the streamflow giving Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.57 for the monthly streamflow calibration. The simulated water balance results showed that the highest peak mean monthly direct flow was obtained under the Agri-CON land use (18mm), followed by PAST (12mm) and Agri-IRWH land use (9mm). These were 19%, 13% and 11% of the mean annual rainfall, respectively. The Agri-IRWH scenario reduced the annual direct flow by 32% compared to Agri-CON which is significant at p<0.02 level. On the other hand it was found that the Agri-IRWH contributed to more groundwater recharge (40mm/year) compared to PAST (32mm/year) and Agri-CON (19mm/year) scenarios. Although there was observable impact of the rainwater harvesting technique on the water yield when considered on a monthly time frame, the overall result suggests that the annual water yield of one of the upper Modder River Basin quaternary catchment will not be adversely affected by the Agri-IRWH land use scenario despite its surface runoff capture design.";"Welderufael, W.A.

The adaptation of agriculture to specific features of natural landscapes is needed for its introduction. Concrete designs must be performed taking into account specific features in agricultural organizations with various forms of ownership, dimensions and directions. Thus, it is necessary to use the materials of land improvement, within farming and state cadastre assessment of lands, soil, geobotanical, agrochemical and other kinds of inspections and research. The main reasons of reduction of the quality of soils in Krasnodar region are wind and water erosions. Nowadays 1174.3 thousand ha of ploughed land are subjected to water erosion. Since 1975 till 2010 the area of average eroded ploughed land in the region increased by 3.5 times. The boundaries of agro landscapes require clarification; developing scientifically based standards of anthropogenic load is needed for each type of agro landscape. Now the crop rotations and agro technologies are not adapted to specific features of landscapes; there is no common method for assessing the efficiency of adaptive systems in agriculture. It is suggested to determine the price of agro landscapes stability within the limits of existing natural landscapes as a sum of annual costs for annual reproduction of soil fertility. Costs of fertility restoration shouldn't be included in a land rent or subjected to tax. It is necessary to differentiate the state cadastre assessment of lands and land payments on natural landscapes taking into account the specific features of modern land relations. Realization of antierosion actions is possible only with financial support of the state.

На примере Краснодарского края обосновывается необходимость разработки и реализации научно обоснованной системы сохранения и повышения почвенного плодородия. Для ее внедрения нужна адаптация земледелия к особенностям природных ландшафтов. Конкретные разработки необходимо осуществлять с учетом специфики сельхозорганизаций разных форм собственности, размеров и направлений. При этом следует использовать материалы землеустройства, внутрихозяйственной и государственной кадастровой оценки земель, почвенного, геоботанического, агрохимического и других видов обследований и изысканий. Основными причинами снижения качества почв в Краснодарском крае являются ветровая и водная эрозия. Ныне водной эрозии подвержены 1174,3 тыс. га пашни. С 1975 по 2010 г. площадь среднеэродированой пашни в крае увеличилась в 3,5 раза. Требуют уточнения границы агроландшафтов, необходима разработка научно обоснованных нормативов антропогенной нагрузки на каждый тип агроландшафта. Ныне севообороты и агротехнологии возделывания с.-х. культур не адаптированы к особенностям ландшафтов, нет единой методики оценки эффективности адаптивных систем земледелия. Предложено определять цену устойчивости агроландшафтов в границах существующих природных ландшафтов как сумму ежегодных затрат на противоэрозионную организацию территории и части производственных затрат на ежегодное воспроизводство почвенного плодородия. Затраты на восстановление плодородия не должны включаться в земельную ренту и облагаться налогом. Необходимо дифференцировать государственную кадастровую оценку земель и земельных платежей по природным ландшафтам с учетом особенностей современных земельных отношений.

Land-use impacts were examined by comparing plant species composition within three vegetation types between sites incorporated into commonage for different lengths of time and sites outside the commonage. Results showed that thicket cover increased by 87% between 1942 and 1985 but declined by 11% between 1985 and 2004. The increase in thicket cover was highest on land where goat browsing and wood harvesting was excluded. There was a decline in thicket cover when uncontrolled goat browsing and wood harvesting were introduced. An analysis of plant species composition suggests an increase in the impact of livestock in areas closest to the urban area and with time since inclusion into commonage. Such areas exhibited greater cover of Increaser II grasses and dwarf shrubs in the herbaceous layer and lower cover of succulents within subtropical thicket. We interpret the decline in thicket cover and shift to a less palatable and less productive vegetation as resulting from the open-access land use system that has prevailed on the commonage since 1994.";"Puttick, James R

Biodiversity experiments with artificial species assemblages have shown that community-scale species richness may affect ecosystem productivity and spatial stability. However, the use of synthetic communities with controlled levels of species density for biodiversity experiments has been criticised and their relevance for natural communities has been questioned. Here, we use a land-use change experiment to investigate the biodiversity effects on production within managed, upland grasslands. We examine species diversity and productivity at both the small plant-neighbourhood scale (14×14 cm) and the field scale (15 m×25 m) for two land-use trajectories under field conditions: intensification through fertilisation, and extensification through the cessation of mowing. Both intensification and extensification were associated with a decrease in species number, but the magnitude of this decrease was greater at the small scale. Extensification was associated with a decrease in small-scale productivity whereas intensification had no significant effect on small-scale productivity. Effects of land-use treatments on biomass production were mediated by variation in small-scale species number; species number showed a significant positive relationship with small-scale productivity within each land-use treatment. Furthermore, species number was associated with a decrease in the variance of small-scale green biomass. In contrast, no species diversity effects were found on productivity at the field scale. Instead, field-scale species diversity decreased with increase in the total above-ground biomass (green biomass+litter). This study demonstrates that biodiversity effects can be observed under field conditions at the small scale and may play an important role for ecosystem functioning and stability even in low-diversity plant communities.";"Gross, Nicolas

Re-introduction of currently absent species may be a useful tool to restore a typical, and more diverse, Sphagnum vegetation and may ultimately improve the functioning of peatland ecosystems, regarding atmospheric carbon sequestration. Yet, the factors controlling the success of re-introduction are unclear. In Ireland and Estonia, we transplanted small and large aggregates of three Sphagnum species into existing vegetation. We recorded changes in cover over a 3-year period, at two water levels (−5 and −20 cm). Performance of transplanted aggregates of Sphagnum was highly species specific. Hummock species profited at low water tables, whereas hollow species profited at high water tables. But our results indicate that performance and establishment of species was also promoted by increased aggregate size. This mechanism (positive self-association) has earlier been seen in other ecosystems, but our results are the first to show this mechanism in peatlands. Our results do not agree with present management, which is aimed at retaining water on the surface of peat remnants in order to restore a functional and diverse Sphagnum community. More than the water table, aggregate size of the reintroduced species is crucial for species performance, and ultimately for successful peatland restoration.";"Robroek, Bjorn J.M.

Les mesures agri-environnementales (MAE) visant la gestion pastorale (Herbe_09) et le maintien de prairies à forte richesse spécifique (Herbe_07) sont analysées : genèse de ces mesures en Europe et en France, conditions de leur mise en oeuvre dans plusieurs territoires et pertinence agri-écologique. Ce type de MAE est susceptible de redonner aux éleveurs une responsabilité valorisante ; leur mise en oeuvre peut entraîner une dynamique territoriale positive dans le débat parfois contradictoire entre agriculture et conservation de la biodiversité ; enfin, elles permettent de concilier production et biodiversité, mais sont peu propices à d’autres fonctions écologiques (pollinisation, séquestration du carbone...). Au final, leur bilan social, écologique et agricole, positif, incite à les généraliser mais en faisant progresser réglementation, concertation entre acteurs agricoles et environnementaux, et connaissances techniques et scientifiques.";"De Sainte Marie, Christine

Heterogeneous motivations for farm practice selection";"";"We investigate the trade-off agricultural producers face between profits and stewardly activities when selecting farm practices. Instead of the profit-maximization framework, we model producer behavior in an expanded utility framework, built on production technology, and including two utility components: self and social interests. The framework introduces inherent heterogeneity and social/environmental motivations into farmer behavior. Based on this model, we hypothesize that there are farmers that are willing to forego some profit to engage in stewardly farm practices. With an empirical study, we provide evidence that some farmers are willing to make this sacrifice. Results are consistent with the multi-utility hypothesis";"Chouinard, H.H.

"AGRIS:US201400148013";"Controls of dissolved organic matter quality: evidence from a large‐scale boreal lake survey";"";"Inland waters transport large amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial environments to the oceans, but DOM also reacts en route, with substantial water column losses by mineralization and sedimentation. For DOM transformations along the aquatic continuum, lakes play an important role as they retain waters in the landscape allowing for more time to alter DOM. We know DOM losses are significant at the global scale, yet little is known about how the reactivity of DOM varies across landscapes and climates. DOM reactivity is inherently linked to its chemical composition. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to explore DOM quality from 560 lakes distributed across Sweden and encompassed a wide climatic gradient typical of the boreal ecozone. Six fluorescence components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The intensity and relative abundance of these components were analyzed in relation to lake chemistry, catchment, and climate characteristics. Land cover, particularly the percentage of water in the catchment, was a primary factor explaining variability in PARAFAC components. Likewise, lake water retention time influenced DOM quality. These results suggest that processes occurring in upstream water bodies, in addition to the lake itself, have a dominant influence on DOM quality. PARAFAC components with longer emission wavelengths, or red‐shifted components, were most reactive. In contrast, protein‐like components were most persistent within lakes. Generalized characteristics of PARAFAC components based on emission wavelength could ease future interpretation of fluorescence spectra. An important secondary influence on DOM quality was mean annual temperature, which ranged between −6.2 and +7.5� °C. These results suggest that DOM reactivity depends more heavily on the duration of time taken to pass through the landscape, rather than temperature. Projected increases in runoff in the boreal region may force lake DOM toward a higher overall amount and proportion of humic‐like substances.";"Kothawala, Dolly N.

Within this context, this paper first explores general public preferences and willingness to pay for farmland walking trails in the Irish countryside. Second this paper examines farmers’ willingness to participate in a hypothetical walking scheme whereby the general public will be allowed access to specific trails. Results suggest that individuals are not a homogeneous group with regard to their preferences for farmland walking trails. From a supply perspective, this paper identified significant regional variations in farmers’ attitudes relating to public access.

In many member states, implementation of the WFD has shifted the main responsibility for local water issues from the municipal level to the regional or supra-regional levels. In this study, we investigated how the implementation of the WFD has influenced local-level water management including the interpretation of the new environmental quality standards. Specifically, we considered Sweden, which has traditionally had relatively strong governance at the municipal level. Because a sufficient amount of time has now passed for evaluation of WFD-related effects on operational water handling, we interviewed individuals directly involved in water planning and land use planning at the municipal level in one sub catchment in the Northern Baltic Sea River Basin District of Sweden, as well as representatives for superior levels and associations. Despite divergent views regarding the priority of water issues in physical planning among the local-level planners interviewed, they had all participated in successful inter-municipal pre-WFD collaboration projects. Although such collaborations could help increase the understanding and acceptance of WFD-related goals and costs, as well as facilitate conflict solving, as shown in the Oxunda Catchment, they have not gained much attention in the WFD implementation process. Additionally, physical planners have generally been reluctant to accept new environmental quality standards resulting from WFD implementation, in part because they lack precise definitions, but also because they could challenge the municipal routine of weighing various objectives against each other. Furthermore, despite WFD-related increases in ambition levels, lack of resource improvements at the municipal level were identified as potential problems by local environmental planners.";"Andersson, Ingela

This paper uses a case study of the Khazans, the coastal wetlands of Goa, in order to study determinants of successful environmental regimes. Khazans are the low-lying coastal lands that have been reclaimed from marshy mangroves by the construction of embankments and sluice gates. Traditionally, khazans were managed by the organized groups of self-regulating tribal peasant communities called the gaunkari, who were renamed as the communidades, during the Portuguese regime in Goa. In 1961, with the merger of Goa and the Indian Union, as a measure of the agrarian reform, legislations were enacted and the responsibility for management of the khazans came to be statutorily imposed upon the tenants’ associations. This gradually weakened the control of the gaunkars, particularly as the state control over the functioning of the communidades increased. This paper describes the evolution of the land resource management system over a period of about two thousand years and also comments on the reasons for the success of traditional community based land resource management systems.";"Sonak, Sangeeta

"AGRIS:US2016202681";"Intellectual Property and Biodiversity: When and Where are Property Rights Important?";"";"An important issue in the life sciences industries concerns the nature of the incentive mechanism that should govern the production of innovation within this R&D sector. We look at the specific problem of coordinating the supply of inputs across very different agents - North and South - that must each supply inputs in order to generate innovations from the industry. The current arrangement in this industry provides for a single property right at “end of the pipeline”, i.e. where marketing of the innovation occurs. This property rights scenario raises two problems, one of efficiency and one of equity. The key question asked here pertains to the number and placement of property rights that should be instituted to address this property rights failure. Should one establish new property rights in traditional knowledge alone; property rights in genetic information alone; or in both? We demonstrate that in a world in which traditional knowledge and genetic information are complements in the production of R&D, a resolution of the property rights failure in genetic information also may resolve the allocation failure in traditional knowledge even in the absence of a distinct property right. The reason is that traditional knowledge of the nature of private information is comparable to a trade secret. Traditional knowledge holders may use this informational advantage to improve their benefit by capturing some informational rent. A new property right is important to enable bargaining and coordination to occur across the industry, but a single property right is probably sufficient to enable coordination between the two agents.";"Sarr, Mare

"AGRIS:US201301897495";"Mind the gap: how do climate and agricultural management explain the 'yield gap' of croplands around the world";"";"As the demands for food, feed and fuel increase in coming decades, society will be pressed to increase agricultural production - whether by increasing yields on already cultivated lands or by cultivating currently natural areas - or to change current crop consumption patterns. In this analysis, we consider where yields might be increased on existing croplands, and how crop yields are constrained by biophysical (e.g. climate) versus management factors. This study was conducted at the global scale. Using spatial datasets, we compare yield patterns for the 18 most dominant crops within regions of similar climate. We use this comparison to evaluate the potential yield obtainable for each crop in different climates around the world. We then compare the actual yields currently being achieved for each crop with their 'climatic potential yield' to estimate the 'yield gap'. We present spatial datasets of both the climatic potential yields and yield gap patterns for 18 crops around the year 2000. These datasets depict the regions of the world that meet their climatic potential, and highlight places where yields might potentially be raised. Most often, low yield gaps are concentrated in developed countries or in regions with relatively high-input agriculture. While biophysical factors like climate are key drivers of global crop yield patterns, controlling for them demonstrates that there are still considerable ranges in yields attributable to other factors, like land management practices. With conventional practices, bringing crop yields up to their climatic potential would probably require more chemical, nutrient and water inputs. These intensive land management practices can adversely affect ecosystem goods and services, and in turn human welfare. Until society develops more sustainable high-yielding cropping practices, the trade-offs between increased crop productivity and social and ecological factors need to be made explicit when future food scenarios are formulated.";"Licker, Rachel

The method is considered a qualitative approach, which takes into account thematic maps (geology, pedology, geomorphology, and land use/land cover) and the precipitation spatial distribution. A group of experts in Earth Sciences and Geotechnical Engineering has applied an infiltration potential scale factor that ranges from 5 (highest influence) to 1 (lowest influence). The final infiltration map was produced using several ArcGIS® tools. The results showed that the most suitable (very high) infiltration areas represent only around 7% of the watershed area, which are associated with smooth and gentle hills, fluvial Tertiary sediments and yellow oxisols. However, growing impacts caused by land farming and urban developments require urgent planning for this region. Areas with high to moderate capacity of infiltration represent around 56% of the watershed and are found in the domain of igneous-metamorphic rocks associated with steep hill-slopes and relatively well-preserved forest fragments. This region requires a land-use strategy, such as reforestation programs, in order to increase the infiltration capacity of the watershed.";"Soares, Paulo Valladares

A recent study addressed the relationship between the time since last fire (TSF) and resident amphibians and reptiles in rosemary bald, one Florida Scrub habitat type. This is a parallel study in another Florida Scrub habitat type, scrubby flatwoods, at Archbold Biological Station (ABS), Lake Placid, Florida, USA. We installed 36 400-mÂ² enclosures (four burn units within each of three TSF categories X 3 replicates per burn unit) at ABS. Bucket trap sampling, within and outside the enclosures, occurred during the spring and late summer in 2007 and 2008. Ten environmental variables that reflect differences in the biotic and abiotic conditions of the microhabitats associated with different TSF were surveyed. Eleven species of reptiles and six species of amphibians were captured. Three lizard species together accounted for > 95% of the reptile captures, and two toad species together accounted for > 96% of the amphibian captures. Abundance of the Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon reynoldsi Stejneger) was highest in long-unburned areas, probably because of the accumulated litter; but abundances of the other two lizard species did not show a relationship with TSF. Differences in relative abundances of species between sampling years may be a function of the difference in rainfall. Despite substantial variation in sampling methods between this study and the previous one, the herpetofaunal composition of the two habitat types were found to be similar; differences in diversity between them was attributable mostly to differences in relative abundances. Species inhabiting the Florida Scrub ecosystem respond differently to TSF: the federally-listed Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens Bosc), for example, requires more frequent burning than appears to be the case for the Florida Sand Skink. A land management plan of stochastic return intervals and spatial variation of high-intensity fires to maintain a mosaic landscape would be ideal; but management options for maintaining the diversity of all species inhabiting the Florida scrub ecosystem are limited, because of the generally small size of remaining habitat patches.";"McCoy, Earl D.

The impacts of these regulations on sprawl are modest, however, increasing urbanized area by less than one percent in response to a one percent increase in any of these three forms of regulation.

The units of forest land are often large because it is economically infeasible for firms to maintain roads and operations widely dispersed across a forest. The assignment of these areas clearly frustrates the economic objective of sending the “right log to the right mill”. The objective of this research is to design a decision support model to evaluate the usefulness of incrementally introducing timber sales as an alternative method of allocation. An integer goal programming model was formulated to assign discrete units of land either to multiple competing mills or to timber sales -- through which logs are then redistributed to these mills. The model is applied to a case study in British Columbia. Results from this case study indicate that the benefits of allocating forest land to timber sales decrease after approximately 40% of the annual allowable cut is redistributed through timber sales.

Yield and gross profit functions were estimated with the stochastic frontiermodel. Results revealed a significant effect improved inputs use on yield but not grossprofit. Moreover, farmers who planted recycled seed (of improved variety) withoutfertilizer obtained lower yield but the highest gross profit. Furthermore, if theopportunity cost of own land and labour inputs in maize production were imputed,overall, farmers made economic losses. Based on the prevailing farmers’ productiontechnology and market conditions, maize cultivation in the range of 2‐3 ha was found to give optimum profit while cultivation under 1 ha or above 4 ha led to economic losses. A major contribution of this paper is that maize cultivation in Uganda in 2005/06 and even at present was/may be of no economic consequence other than food, at household level.";"Godfrey, Okoboi";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-03-31";"en";"";"";"";"UGA";"Reports & Research";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016203225";"http://purl.umn.edu/101714";"";"";"";""

Numerous peatlands in particular regions of Europe have been degraded by drainage, burning, extraction, overgrazing and pollution in recent decades, often leading to erosion, loss of peat mass and a loss of a variety of flora. In the UK, some 90% of peatlands can be regarded as degraded. Implemented restoration schemes have been aimed at blocking drainage ditches, re-vegetating bare peat or changing the present vegetation assemblage to a more âdesirableâ alternative. Here we use palaeoecological techniques to reconstruct the development of a blanket peatland through its entirety with a particular focus on recent land management practices and their impact on vegetation in order to determine and support restoration targets. Analysis at West Arkengarthdale, Yorkshire, UK, shows that the present vegetation is not characteristic and has only been present for c. 200 years. Peat has been developing at the site for approximately 6700 years with Sphagnum particularly abundant between 0â40cm depth (present dayâ450cal. BP) and 150â190cm depth (c. 3200â3900cal. BP) and seldom recorded elsewhere in the core. A very recent change in Sphagnum composition is seen towards the surface of the profile, with Sphagnum papillosum making up 100% of the identified Sphagnum in the last 50 years. Monocots, Poaceae, Rumex and Polytrichum commune increase with the beginning of the industrial revolution and an increase in charcoal fragments is indicative of increased pollution and managed burning to support grouse management. It is suggested that any intention to alter land management at the site to encourage a greater variety of Sphagnum species and a decrease in Calluna is in line with peatland development at the site over the past 450 years. This collaborative approach between research palaeoecologists and conservation agency staff has wider application elsewhere.";"McCarroll, J.

In this paper, a programming approach is used in tandem with spatial economic theory to understand the spatial welfare impacts of an ethanol plant established in an area with a beef feeding industry.  The study concludes that corn transportation costs are less significant in plant pricing strategy than originally identified by other studies.  Local ethanol plant competition is found to explain the lower-than-feed value pricing of ethanol byproducts at the plant.  In the study, average welfare effects are calculated for the ethanol plant, corn producers and beef producers under different market situations and changes.";"Van Wart, Justin

"AGRIS:US201400106549";"Using MERIS fused images for land-cover mapping and vegetation status assessment in heterogeneous landscapes";"";"In this paper we evaluate the potential of ENVISAT–Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) fused images for land-cover mapping and vegetation status assessment in heterogeneous landscapes. A series of MERIS fused images (15 spectral bands; 25 m pixel size) is created using the linear mixing model and a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image acquired over the Netherlands. First, the fused images are classified to produce a map of the eight main land-cover types of the Netherlands. Subsequently, the maps are validated using the Dutch land-cover/land-use database as a reference. Then, the fused image with the highest overall classification accuracy is selected as the best fused image. Finally, the best fused image is used to compute three vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and two indices specifically designed to monitor vegetation status using MERIS data: the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and the MERIS global vegetation index (MGVI).Results indicate that the selected data fusion approach is able to downscale MERIS data to a Landsat-like spatial resolution. The spectral information in the fused images originates fully from MERIS and is not influenced by the TM data. Classification results for the TM and for the best fused image are similar and, when comparing spectrally similar images (i.e. TM with no short-wave infrared bands), the results of the fused image outperform those of TM. With respect to the vegetation indices, a good correlation was found between the NDVI computed from TM and from the best fused image (in spite of the spectral differences between these two sensors). In addition, results show the potential of using MERIS vegetation indices computed from fused images to monitor individual fields. This is not possible using the original MERIS full resolution image. Therefore, we conclude that MERIS–TM fused images are very useful to map heterogeneous landscapes.";"Zurita-Milla, R.

"AGRIS:LV2009000312";"The fate of employees in different status classes after decollectivization from early 1990s until 2005 in one Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian kolkhoz. First results";"";"Having done research on agricultural decollectivization and its consequences since 1992, Ilkka Alanen and his colleagues has accumulated a wealth of knowledge on the coping strategies people adopted in order to survive in the Baltic countries and elsewhere (See Alanen 1998, Alanen et al 2001 and Alanen 2004a). The problems turned out to be much more difficult than the reforms planers anticipated, and that some of the initial failures still overshadow people’s lives. However, at the level of individuals, this information has remained far too general or scattered, because the focus of the work has, after all, been on enterprise and community structures. How different kinds of people coped with? What for example had exactly happened e.g. to the status classes of the former socialist large-scale farm? That is the question, to which we focus this paper. We claim, that both the success of the decollectivization in soviet farms, the development of the national economy and the local demand of labour explain the coping strategies and the success of the whole staff of former soviet farm (in this case of former kolkhoz). In addition to that also the position in specific class (as followers of certain status group in soviet farm) has impacted to their coping strategies. Those results refers to the possibility, that not only the education but also the networks of certain status groups originating from pre-decollectivization phase have had some effect in formation of specific coping strategies models. The analysis of early survey data (from 1994 and 1995) already indicated that the Estonian rural population derived most of its income from wage labour, while household plot farming predominated in Lithuania, with Latvia ranking between the other two countries but closer to Lithuania. Thus, decollectivization has directly resulted in the differentiation of the developmental models in the Baltic countryside. (Alanen 1998). Expanding the scope of the interviews from a case study of the decollectivization of a single Soviet farm in Estonia (cf. Alanen et al 'Decollectivization, Destruction and Disillusionment: A Community Study in Southern Estonia', 2001) to other farms and other countries showed that the destruction of large-scale production signified the widespread destruction of material (buildings, machinery, cattle) and immaterial resources (educational capital, skills), because only a small portion of these assets could realistically be transferred to family farms. Consequently, also work collectives disintegrated, and due to their central role this led to widespread alienation. The new local government agencies were powerless in the face of material destruction, communal anomie and lack of trust.";"Alanen, I., University of Jyväskylä (Finland).

"AGRIS:US201301860090";"Bird foraging height predicts bird species response to woody vegetation change";"";"Accurate a priori predictions of the sensitivity of species to vegetation management depend on an understanding of mechanisms underlying species response. To date information on where birds forage in the vegetation strata has been used to predict bird species response to vegetation change caused by livestock grazing. Profiting from this link between vegetation structural diversity and bird diversity, we test whether this variable, bird foraging height, can be used to predict the impact of a different type of habitat alteration; vegetation encroachment. Increases in vegetation density, called ‘encroachment' or ‘thickening', throughout savanna landscapes are considered a serious management issue for pastoral activities and a potential threat to biodiversity. We developed woody-vegetation-change models to predict the effect of vegetation encroachment on bird species through an understanding of where birds forage in intact vegetation communities. We compare model predictions with bird abundance data collected from 60 field sites representing a single woodland vegetation type, but with a gradient of woody vegetation density caused by clearing, thinning and natural climatic perturbation. Our model successfully predicted for the majority (80%) of birds considered, whether a species was likely to increase, decrease or remain unaffected by increases in woody vegetation density. We find that the majority of species respond positively to vegetation encroachment. Our approach avoids problems of post hoc data interpretation and tests a specific mechanism underlying bird species response to habitat alteration, bird foraging height. Simple predictive models such as these will assist land managers make informed decisions about management actions and consequences, particularly in cases where decisions need to be made urgently and preclude the collection and analysis of primary ecological data sets.";"Kutt, A.

"AGRIS:US201301679292";"Realistic Assessment of the Indicator Potential of Butterflies and Other Charismatic Taxonomic Groups";"";"Charismatic groups of animals and plants often are proposed as sentinels of environmental status and trends. Nevertheless, many claims that a certain taxonomic group can provide more-general information on environmental quality are not evaluated critically. To address several of the many definitions of indicator species, we used butterflies to explore in some detail the attributes that affect implementation of indicators generically. There probably are few individual species, or sets of species, that can serve as scientifically valid, cost-effective measures of the status or trend of an environmental phenomenon that is difficult to measure directly. Nevertheless, there are species with distributions, abundances, or demographic characteristics that are responsive to known environmental changes. In this context, single or multiple species can serve as indicators when targets are defined explicitly, ecological relationships between the target and the putative indicators are well understood, and data are sufficient to differentiate between deterministic and stochastic responses. Although these situations exist, they are less common than might be apparent from an extensive and often confounded literature on indicators. Instead, the public appeal of charismatic groups may be driving much of their acclaim as indicators. The same taxon may not be appropriate for marketing a general conservation mission and for drawing strong inference about specific environmental changes. To provide insights into the progress of conservation efforts, it is essential to identify scientific and practical criteria for selection and application of indicators and then to examine whether a given taxonomic group meets those criteria.";"FLEISHMAN, ERICA

I surveyed 82 local leaders of 42 communities to understand whether these communities have succeeded in designing and implementing rules to manage their collective land and its resources. I found that the new property regime has not replaced individuals' informal land holdings, which are still managed as de facto individual private property and are traded in the informal land market. However, the process of collective titling has changed local environmental governance by creating local rules and legal tools to guard against encroachment by intruders. Beyond the establishment of formal property rights, the process of community and authority building based on the expectation of collective titling has begun to formalize the management of the territory. Communities with and without collective titles have promoted new rules and procedures to manage their resources. However, monitoring and enforcement of the rules are weaker than expected.";"Velez, Maria Alejandra";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"property rights;land ownership";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301955883";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-011-9375-1";"";"";"";"117-129"

The objective of this study was to quantify land cover changes and transitions as well as the dynamics of oak woodland patterns and densities over 50 years in two municipalities at the center and edges of Quercus macrolepis distribution in Northern Lesvos (Greece). We used aerial photographs from 1960 and WorldView-2 satellite images from 2010 to process land cover maps and metrics, and to calculate oak canopy cover with a point-grid sampling approach. Spatiotemporal dynamics of land cover change were generally high—especially between oak woodlands and grass- and shrub-lands, resulting in a more heterogeneous and fragmented landscape in 2010. Surprisingly, oak woodland area remained stable with marginal losses in one study site and gains in the other one. Oak canopy cover increased by 8 and 9 %. Spatial hotspots of change were mountainous and peripheral phrygana areas with expanding oak stands, as well as river valleys and near urban areas with expanding olive groves and grass- and shrublands in former complex cultivation and oak stands. We conclude that the parallel processes of abandonment of crop cultivation and intensification of livestock grazing have been less detrimental to oak woodlands than supposed. To ensure long-term persistence of oak woodlands in the face of ongoing rural depopulation and land-use intensification, environmental and agricultural policies should better address their specificities as anthropogenic habitats.";"Schaich, Harald

A static model of quota trade in the short run shows the inefficiency of discrete non-auctioned trade with fixed transaction costs. This model also shows that an obligation to quota sellers to stop their production stimulates structural change. A dynamic model of trade indicates that the measures taken to prevent speculative behaviour causes inefficiencies and stimulates overuse of quota if the penalties are too low. Finally, the dynamic model indicates that a flat rate reduction on traded quota combined with too low penalties for overuse stimulate the total production.";"Buysse, Jeroen

However, the extent and magnitude of the change are uncertain. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between changing conifer cover and topography. The central Great Basin in the state of Nevada, USA. We used a series of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1986, 1995 and 2005 to map change in pinyon-juniper woodlands (Pinus monophylla, Juniperus spp.) in the montane central Great Basin of Nevada. We derived fractional greenness for each year using spectral mixture analysis and identified all areas with an above average increase in greenness from 1986 to 1995 and 1995 to 2005. Areas with high fractional greenness in 2005 were most likely to occur at elevations between 2200 and 2600 m a.s.l. Increases in fractional greenness between 1986 and 2005 were most likely to occur at elevations below 2000 m a.s.l. and on south-facing slopes. However, relationships between elevation and increasing greenness for individual mountain ranges varied considerably from the average trend. Fractional greenness values measured by Landsat suggest that the majority of pinyon-juniper woodlands have not reached their maximum potential tree cover. Expansion of pinyon-juniper at low elevations and on south-facing slopes probably reflects increasing precipitation in the 20th century, higher water use efficiency caused by increasing atmospheric CO₂ in the late 20th century and livestock grazing at the interface between shrubland and woodland. Identification of the spatial relationships between changing fractional greenness of pinyon-juniper woodland and topography can inform regional land management and improve projections of long-term ecosystem change.";"Bradley, Bethany A.

In this framework, an accurate evaluation of fire ignition risk and its environmental drivers constitutes a basic step toward the optimization of fire management measures. In this paper, we propose a multivariate method for identifying and spatially portraying fire ignition risk across a complex and heterogeneous landscape such as the National Park of Cilento, Vallo di Diano, and Alburni (southern Italy). The proposed approach consists first in calculating the fire selectivity of several landscape features that are usually related to fire ignition, such as land cover or topography. Next, the fire selectivity values of single landscape features are combined with multivariate segmentation tools. The resulting fire risk map may constitute a valuable tool for optimizing fire prevention strategies and for efficiently allocating fire fighting resources.";"Guglietta, Daniela

This is illustrated in five selected projects I have been involved in. The sad story is, however, that only less than 10% of the world's aquaculture production is based on genetically improved stocks.

"AGRIS:US201500211171";"Multinomial regression for analyzing macroinvertebrate assemblage composition data";"";"Macroinvertebrate species composition data are often expressed as proportional abundances when assessing water-quality conditions or responses to disturbance. Proportional abundances represent the probability of belonging to one of many mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups (taxa). Proportional abundances have some unique properties that must be considered when analyzing these data: 1) the probabilities of group membership must sum to 1 and 2) a change in any 1 group affects all other groups. We used multinomial regressions to analyze changes in proportional abundances along gradients of urbanization in 9 metropolitan areas across the USA. Multinomial regression can be used to address multiple nonlinear responses simultaneously, whereas simple linear regressions must be used to analyze linear or polynomial responses of each group independently. We established that: 1) abundance ratios of tolerant and moderately tolerant groups responded consistently (3–5% increase in the ratios for every 1% increase in developed land cover in the watershed) across the urban gradient, 2) functional groups did not change significantly, and 3) ratios based on assemblage metrics were better indicators of environmental disturbance than ratios based on individual taxa. Multinomial regression, with its flexible model form, can capture patterns of species succession along a resource or stressor gradient. Our results also demonstrate that users of multinomial regression may encounter numerical problems with rare taxa, especially when these taxa have a complete separation along the gradient. Consequently, multinomial regressions are more suitable for analyzing aggregations of taxa or taxon traits.";"Qian, Song S

"AGRIS:US201300863303";"Assessing the impact of changes in landuse and management practices on the diffuse pollution and retention of nitrate in a riparian floodplain";"";"In many European lowland rivers and riparian floodplains diffuse nutrient pollution is causing a major risk for the surface waters and groundwater to not achieve a good status as demanded by the European Water Framework Directive. In order to delimit the impact of diffuse nutrient pollution substantial and often controversial changes in landuse and management are under discussion. In this study we investigate the impact of two complex scenarios considering changes in landuse and land management practices on the nitrate loads of a typical lowland stream and the riparian groundwater in the North German Plains. Therefore the impacts of both scenarios on the nitrate dynamics, the attenuation efficiency and the nitrate exchange between groundwater and surface water were investigated for a 998.1 km² riparian floodplain of the Lower and Central Havel River and compared with the current conditions. Both scenarios target a substantial improvement of the ecological conditions and the water quality in the research area but promote different typical riparian landscape functions and consider a different grade of economical and legal feasibility of the proposed measures. Scenario 1 focuses on the optimisation of conservation measures for all natural resources of the riparian floodplain, scenario 2 considers measures in order to restore a good status of the water bodies mainly. The IWAN model was setup for the simulation of water balance and nitrate dynamics of the floodplain for a perennial simulation period of the current landuse and management conditions and of the scenario assumptions. The proposed landuse and management changes result in reduced rates of nitrate leaching from the root zone into the riparian groundwater (85% for scenario 1, 43% for scenario 2). The net contributions of nitrate from the floodplain can be reduced substantially for both scenarios. In case of scenario 2 a decrease by 70% can be obtained. For scenario 1 the nitrate exfiltration rates to the river drop even below the infiltration rates from the river, the riparian floodplain in that scenario represents a net sink for river derived nitrate. As the nitrate contributions from the investigated riparian floodplain represent only a small proportion of the total nitrate loads within the river (1% p.a.) the overall impact of the scenario measures on the nitrate loads at the river outlet remains small. However, during the ecologically most sensitive summer periods under current conditions nitrate contributions from the riparian groundwater of the Lower and Central Havel River (which covers only 5% of the area of the Havel catchment) represent more than 20% of the river loads. By the implementation of the investigated landuse changes within the research area the groundwater derived nitrate contributions could be halved to only 10% during summer baseflow conditions.";"Krause, Stefan

"AGRIS:US201400125056";"Land leveling and changes in soil properties in paddy fields of Guilan province, Iran";"";"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of land leveling on some of soil properties. Land leveling as an effective strategy for paddy land management is one of the most important programs run by the Ministry of Jihad-Agriculture in Guilan province, northern part of Iran. Precise land leveling improves irrigation application, fertilization efficiency, and uniform soil moisture for germination. Also, it increases yields and cultivable lands and reduces delivery losses. Running land-leveling projects, however, leads to such disadvantages as severe soil alteration and consequently disruptions to the soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Based on statistical analysis, on the one hand land, leveling led to significant increases (P� <� 0.01) in bulk density, clay percentage, and EC, and on the other hand, it resulted in significant decreases (P� <� 0.01) in the soil organic matter, silt percentage, NPK, pH, soil respiration, bacterial community, and microbial biomass carbon. Microscopic images of buried slides indicated that there was a reduction in the soil microorganism communities and diversities as well. With regard to the management of paddy fields, despite beneficial impacts of land leveling, the results indicate that due to malperformance of the project, which is a consequence of the use of inappropriate machinery and/or nonremoval of surface soil and its re-diffusion, most of soil-desirable properties are reduced and are not revitalized even after 4� years.";"Sharifi, Arezoo

Direction cosines of change vector for determining change direction in n-dimensional spectral space is used for image classification with a minimum distance categorizing technique. The results of change detection are compared (i) Improved CVA with conventional two bands CVA and (ii) Improved CVA before and after topographic corrections. The improved CVA with topographic correction consideration using slope match show maximum accuracy of 90% (Kappa coefficient 0.83) as compared to conventional CVA which show maximum accuracy of 82% (Kappa coefficient 0.6624).

Sound urban environment plays important aesthetic, ecological, cultural, social and engineering roles beneficial to the people. To support better management of vegetated sites, it is necessary to understand the spatial configuration at the landscape scale and changes that have occurred. We studied the change in landscape characteristics of the Nairobi city’s metropolitan region, using Landsat satellite data for the last three decades. Image data were processed on GIS platform and classified into categories of land use/land cover types. Using the classified images as input for analysis, landscape change was evaluated to characterize the landscape change trends. Significant changes were observed in the spatial configuration of the landscape between 1976 and the year 2000 status. Land uses related to human activities such as built areas increased to the detriment of wetland and vegetated areas. It is expected that if the current trend of development continues, the landscape will experience more pressure and get more fragmented. Such human-mediated alterations may significantly affect the way ecosystem processes within the landscape will respond and how they will impact on peoples’ lives. To safeguard the natural greenery, the city planning authorities need to enforce regulatory measures to direct spread of the city in a more strategic way.";"Njoroge, J.B.M.

"AGRIS:US201500088860";"multi-level analysis of the relationship between environmental factors and questing Ixodes ricinus dynamics in Belgium";"";"BACKGROUND: Ticks are the most important pathogen vectors in Europe. They are known to be influenced by environmental factors, but these links are usually studied at specific temporal or spatial scales. Focusing on Ixodes ricinus in Belgium, we attempt to bridge the gap between current “single-sided” studies that focus on temporal or spatial variation only. Here, spatial and temporal patterns of ticks are modelled together. METHODS: A multi-level analysis of the Ixodes ricinus patterns in Belgium was performed. Joint effects of weather, habitat quality and hunting on field sampled tick abundance were examined at two levels, namely, sampling level, which is associated with temporal dynamics, and site level, which is related to spatial dynamics. Independent variables were collected from standard weather station records, game management data and remote sensing-based land cover data. RESULTS: At sampling level, only a marginally significant effect of daily relative humidity and temperature on the abundance of questing nymphs was identified. Average wind speed of seven days prior to the sampling day was found important to both questing nymphs and adults. At site level, a group of landscape-level forest fragmentation indices were highlighted for both questing nymph and adult abundance, including the nearest-neighbour distance, the shape and the aggregation level of forest patches. No cross-level effects or spatial autocorrelation were found. CONCLUSIONS: Nymphal and adult ticks responded differently to environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales. Our results can advise spatio-temporal extents of environment data collection for continuing empirical investigations and potential parameters for biological tick models.";"Li, Sen

We conducted a mail survey to elicit producer choice to provide marketable carbon offsets by participating in different carbon credit programs characterized by varying practices. Based on a quantitative analysis, we found that: 1) the market price for carbon offsets could increase producer participation in carbon sequestration; 2) producers perceived differentially different but correlated private costs for adopting carbon sequestering practices, depending on production attributes; and 3) relatively high carbon prices would be needed to stimulate producer provision of carbon offsets by land-based carbon sequestration activities. A simulation of producer choice with agricultural census data estimated potential carbon offsets supply in the Northern Great Plains region.

A case study is presented for a region within the South‐west Australia Biodiversity Hotspot (Nature 403, 853). This Biodiversity Hotspot is a focus for conservation investment as it combines a relatively high level of biodiversity with severe threat to the biodiversity from agriculture. The conservation planning model developed determines the optimal set of bush fragments for conservation. This model can also be used to assess the trade‐off between the budget and a vegetation species metric. Results from the case study show that, without an effective conservation scheme that at least fences fragments, significant plant biodiversity losses will occur in the North East Wheatbelt Regional Organisation of Councils region of the WA wheatbelt over a 10‐year period. A perfect price discriminating auction scheme could reduce the costs of conservation by around 17 per cent relative to a fixed‐payment scheme; however, a fixed payment on outcome (measured as change in the species metric) scheme represents a viable second‐best alternative, to a conservation auction, where conservation spending is spatially targeted.";"White, Ben

"AGRIS:US201600063664";"Quality assessment of Landsat surface reflectance products using MODIS data";"";"Surface reflectance adjusted for atmospheric effects is a primary input for land cover change detection and for developing many higher level surface geophysical parameters. With the development of automated atmospheric correction algorithms, it is now feasible to produce large quantities of surface reflectance products using Landsat images. Validation of these products requires in situ measurements, which either do not exist or are difficult to obtain for most Landsat images. The surface reflectance products derived using data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), however, have been validated more comprehensively. Because the MODIS on the Terra platform and the Landsat 7 are only half an hour apart following the same orbit, and each of the 6 Landsat spectral bands overlaps with a MODIS band, good agreements between MODIS and Landsat surface reflectance values can be considered indicators of the reliability of the Landsat products, while disagreements may suggest potential quality problems that need to be further investigated. Here we develop a system called Landsat–MODIS Consistency Checking System (LMCCS). This system automatically matches Landsat data with MODIS observations acquired on the same date over the same locations and uses them to calculate a set of agreement metrics. To maximize its portability, Java and open-source libraries were used in developing this system, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles were followed to make it more flexible for future expansion. As a highly automated system designed to run as a stand-alone package or as a component of other Landsat data processing systems, this system can be used to assess the quality of essentially every Landsat surface reflectance image where spatially and temporally matching MODIS data are available. The effectiveness of this system was demonstrated using it to assess preliminary surface reflectance products derived using the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat images for the 2000 epoch. As surface reflectance likely will be a standard product for future Landsat missions, the approach developed in this study can be adapted as an operational quality assessment system for those missions.";"Feng, Min

In the assessment, remotely sensed data, in the form of satellite images, and geographic information systems were used. Types of land use/land cover were designated as the percentage of the total area studied. Results calculated from the satellite data for land cover classification were compared successfully with the database Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE). This served as a reference to appraise the reliability of the study presented here. The CORINE Program was established by the European Commission to create a harmonized Geographical Information System on the state of the environment in the European Community. Unplanned urbanization is causing land use changes mainly in developing countries such as Turkey. This situation in Turkey is frequently observed in the city of Istanbul. There are only a few studies of land use-land cover changes which provide an integrated assessment of the biophysical and societal causes and consequences of environmental degradation in Istanbul. The research area comprised greater Silivri Town which is situated by the coast of Marmara Sea, and it is located approximately 60 km west of Istanbul. The city of Istanbul is one of the largest metropolises in Europe with ca. 15 million inhabitants. Additionally, greater Silivri is located near the terminal point of the state highway connecting Istanbul with Europe. Measuring of changes occurring in land use would help control future planning of settlements; hence, it is of importance for the Gretaer Silivri and Silivri Town.

The highest concentration of exchangeable Ca ²⁺ and Mg ²⁺ was found in NT, decreased in MT and the lowest concentration was found in CT (mean values were 26.0, 24.4 and 23.3 cmol c kg ⁻¹ for exchangeable Ca ²⁺ and 4.2, 3.7 and 3.3 cmol c kg ⁻¹ for exchangeable Mg ²⁺ in NT, MT and CT, respectively). In addition, the highest concentration of exchangeable Na ⁺ was found in NT, decreased in CT and the lowest concentration was found in MT. However, the highest concentration of exchangeable K ⁺ was found in MT.

Through the analysis of satellite images, this article quantifies the LUCC that occurred between 1985 and 2008 in the Colombian Andes. Four submodels of changes were analyzed: deforestation, crop intensification, conversion to pastures, and abandonment. We associated these changes with demographic, socioeconomic, and abiotic variables and to some attractors of landscape change, and finally we have considered three scenarios of change: reference, increase in pasture, and crop intensification. The dynamics of LUCC were dominated by systematic transitions between crops, pastures, and secondary vegetation. Of all the submodels, pasture conversion has an important contribution in terms of accuracy rate (84%), and the most relevant variables for explaining land cover changes in the region were elevation, soil type, and distance to roads, cities, and pastures. Our simulations suggest that the pasture conversion scenario would have the biggest impact in natural ecosystems and could cause the loss of 28–30% of the cover area by 2050. The results indicate some that these hotspots of change are currently still under a good conservation state with large extension of forests.";"Rodríguez Eraso, Nelly

A framework is therefore provided to assist in determining an optimal approach for representing ecological processes in an ABM/LUCC according to the research question and desired application of the model. Relevant challenges limiting the integration of complex, dynamic representations of ecosystem processes into ABMs/LUCC are then assessed, with solutions provided from recent examples.

Yet, we know very little about the dynamics of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) in these understudied regions. Our objective is to map vegetation change in Brazil’s three largest dryland ecoregions – the Cerrado, Caatinga, and Mato Grosso seasonal forests – using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data from 2001 to 2009 at the scale of the municipality. We then assess the relationship between changes in land use and land cover and changes in crop and animal production and environmental factors using random forest regression. Although deforestation is still the dominant transition in Mato Grosso, portions of the Cerrado and Caatinga are experiencing a return of woody vegetation. Other agricultural production systems such as sugarcane also play a key role in vegetation change dynamics, besides soybean and cattle ranching. Municipalities with low standard deviations of temperature, high annual precipitation totals, and low elevation are most likely to have undergone deforestation from 2001 to 2009. In the Cerrado, sugarcane is positively associated with woody regrowth, but these changes may be resulting in displacement deforestation in Mato Grosso. Increases in rainfall and the decline of agriculture were responsible for the return of woody vegetation in the Caatinga.";"Redo, Daniel

Therefore, it is crucial that climate change policy consider the value of all services that are provided by watershed ecosystems. For this purpose, geospatial data and economic analysis are combined to determine a monetary value for wetland ecosystem goods and services (EGSs) in the watersheds of the Yamaska and Bécancour Rivers (Quebec, Canada). From published studies of wetland economic evaluations, we selected 51 relevant studies from 21 countries and performed a benefit transfer using meta-analysis. Our research emphasises the importance of considering multiple wetland characteristics when conducting a benefit transfer because of their complementary effects. We propose an approach that integrates spatial variables that have not been previously used, including type of wetland (complex or isolated) and land use (% of agricultural, urban, forest and water land cover), at a much finer geographical scale of 50 km². Simultaneous use of detailed spatial and economic characteristics in each wetland area allowed us to assign heterogeneous EGS values and map these values in sub-watersheds (50 km²) of the two rivers. Our results demonstrate that location and scale can affect wetland value. When wetland valuation was conducted based on mean values for geospatial characteristics, the EGS [2014 purchasing power parity (PPP) price] that is provided by wetlands was $5277 PPP/ha/year for the Yamaska River Watershed (YRW) and $3979 PPP/ha/year for the Bécancour River Watershed (BRW). When wetland valuation was performed at a more detailed sub-watershed scale to reflect variability within a watershed, EGS (2014 PPP price) that is provided by wetlands was valued higher at $9080/ha/year for YRW and $4702/ha/year (2014 PPP price) for BRW.";"He, Jie

The Arellano-Bond dynamic panel estimator is used within a GMM framework to examine land ownership behavior of forward-looking farmers.

As a first step in understanding current distributions, and therefore spread potential, we assessed diurnal habitat selection by Burmese Pythons in the southern Everglades using radiotelemetry. Sixteen individual pythons were radio-tracked between September 2006 and December 2009. Habitat variables included land cover, habitat edges, surface water depth, and change in water depth. Python locations were compared to available habitat, both within each snake's home range and across the entire study area, by calculating selection ratio intervals and developing resource selection functions. Habitat selection by Burmese Pythons in south Florida was nonrandom with clear selection of broad-leafed and coniferous forest and avoidance of open water and other habitats with deep water. We concluded that Burmese Pythons selected habitats with a substantial canopy overstory that was without deep flooding, with no strong selection for freshwater emergent macrophyte marsh habitats that dominate (â¼ 43%) the study area. We will use these new quantitative insights into python habitat selection to model the potential for this invasive species to expand to new areas within Florida.";"";"";"Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600183536";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1670%2F14-098";"";"";"";"50-56"

The Land Stewardship project in the state of Victoria, Australia, is an initiative devoted to exploring the ways in which private landholders could be encouraged towards more sustainable land management. Following the view that the success of policy initiatives is contingent on effective stakeholder engagement, a component of the Land Stewardship project involved a dialogue with landholders about policy tools (e.g., regulation, economic instruments) that might be deployed to encourage improved land management practices. This paper provides an account of the views and attitudes of landholders, as revealed in a series of three workshops, which consisted of discussions about the factors influencing agriculture, participants' interpretations of sustainability, and policy methods. The focus of the paper is on what landholders believe to be the strengths and limitations of standard policy tools, and the essential requirements for these tools to deliver the best land management outcomes. One of the main findings of the project was a 'preference hierarchy' in respect of policy methods, according to which the strongest support was expressed for voluntary and education-based tools, followed by market-based instruments, with command-and-control regulation identified as a measure of 'last resort'. In the paper we reflect also on how the views and outlook of landholders should be positioned relative to other inputs in the design of policy interventions.";"Cocklin, C.

Nowhere are these changes more evident than in the Great Basin of the western United States, a region of 400,000 km² that largely is managed by federal agencies. Major drivers of ecosystems and human demographics of the Great Basin include human population growth, grazing by domestic livestock, extraction of minerals, development and production of energy, changes in fire and other disturbance regimes, and invasion of non-native annual plants. Exploration of alternative futures may increase the ability of management and policy to maximize the system's resistance and resilience to changes in climate, disturbance regimes, and anthropogenic perturbations. This special section examines the issues facing the Great Basin and then provides examples of approaches to predicting changes in land cover and avifaunal distributions under different management scenarios. Future sustainability of the Great Basin's natural and human systems requires strong, collaborative partnerships among research and management organizations that are capable of obtaining public support and financial resources and developing effective policies and institutional mechanisms.";"Fleishman, Erica

The causes of change are highly interactive and include urban, suburban, and exurban growth, past and present land uses, climate change, altered fire regimes, and rapid expansion of invasive species. Cumulative effects include vegetation type conversions, loss of watershed functioning, loss of native species, and diminished economic potential. The diversity and magnitude of issues require consensus on priority issues, and new and innovative research and management approaches that address larger spatial scales and longer time scales than in the past. Primary research coupled with large-scale assessments and effective monitoring strategies is needed to understand and track the ongoing changes. Prediction and modeling of alternative futures are needed for incorporation into the planning process and use as a basis for adaptive management, and management tools are needed to aid decision-making and implementation. Historically, research and management in arid and semiarid regions such as the Great Basin have been severely under-funded and altering current trajectories will require financial resources, political support, and effective policies and institutional mechanisms. Sustaining the ecosystems, resources, and human populations of these regions will require strong collaborative partnerships among research and management organizations to reduce overlap, leverage funds, and increase efficiency.

"AGRIS:US201400107230";"Evaluation of dynamic linkages between evapotranspiration and land-use/land-cover changes with Landsat TM and ETM+ data";"";"Complexity embedded in coastal management leads to numerous questions as to how inherent spatial and temporal linkages among evapotranspiration (ET), depth to groundwater and land-use/land-cover change (LUCC) could affect the dynamics among these seemingly unrelated events. This article aims to address such unique dynamics in the nexus of physical geography and ecohydrology. To understand such dynamic linkages, a case study was carried out in a fast growing coastal region – the southern Laizhou Bay in Shandong Province, China – by identifying the coastal LUCC at the decadal scale in association with the variations of ET with the aid of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data. In such a coastal landscape evolutionary assessment, findings show that the major patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) in the study area are farmland, saline-alkali land, developed land, salt land and beach land. Over a 20-year time frame, declining groundwater trends were observed, while ET increased gradually with changing LULC. By using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) with Landsat TM/ETM+ images and additional environmental data, the concomitant response of ET variations due to LUCC becomes lucid among three significantly correlated pairs including fractional vegetation cover (FVC), land surface temperature (LST) and soil heat flux. The dynamic linkages between ET and LULC were finally confirmed with such a pair-wise analysis.";"Gao, Zhiqiang

"AGRIS:US201301098281";"Heterogeneity in land resources and diversity in farming practices in Tigray, Ethiopia";"";"The management of soils is an important issue for policy makers in Ethiopia. However, most of the interventions designed to conserve the soil resources have fallen short of the expectations, performing impressively in the short run, but proving unsustainable on a long-term basis. There are no simple explanations for the failure of these interventions to reverse soil degradation, but it has been evident for some time that there is an uneasy connection between 'objective' assessments of the state of the land and the way this information is used in the policy-making processes. It is now widely accepted that understanding the processes of the soil degradation is not simply a matter of analysing changes in the stock of physical and nutrient capital. While studies of nutrient balances are an important component of research in soil erosion and land degradation, their results need to be considered in the context of social, cultural and political factors. This paper presents the results of a study in Tigray, Ethiopia, exploring local people's perceptions on and understanding of their land resources, and the way their views influence natural resource management. Our findings indicate that land use is not only a function of the physical properties of fields, but is also shaped by historical processes and local cultural values, and that management strategies adopted by farmers are influenced by a broad range of factors. These include history of tenure and patterns of inheritance, investment in a plot, and the sense of place, identity and attachment to a locality that develops over time as generations pass through the same family dwelling. Land users in Tigray do not judge arable land purely in terms of its agricultural value. The cultural and social values attributed to specific tracts of land also play an important role in shaping the physical condition of fields and the manner in which farmers interact with their surroundings may explain why certain plots are still 'good', despite having been continuously cultivated by successive generations. It also accounts for local resistance to some types of land redistribution and acceptance of others. Policy makers, therefore, need to pay more attention to the relations between people and land, and to the value that farmers attach to their land resources. Our findings have significant implications for policies on agricultural extension and land redistribution, and for on-farm research, as the type of plot used to test technologies will have a significant impact on the outcome of trials.";"Beyene, A.

Under the conditions of actual agroecological changes, yielded by climatic warming and dryness and new technological and economical conditions of zone agricultural exploitations, the research points out the extension risk of cereal pests attack with an increasing potential and the importance of the elaboration of integrated control strategy (ICS). The attack diminishing recommended methods of the ICS are agro-technical methods; pests,diseases, weeds integrated control; insecticides treatments; conservation and use of entomophagous limiters. The natural predators play an important role in decreasing the pest abundance in Transylvania. The well-known systematic groups of enthomophagous predators: Aranea; Dermaptera;Thysanoptera (Aeolothripidae); Heteroptera (Nabidae); Coleoptera (Carabidae, Cicindelidae, Staphylinidae, Sylphidae, Coccinellidae, Cantharidae, Malachiidae); Diptera (Syrphidae, Empididae); Hymenoptera (Formicidae); Neuroptera (Chrysopidae) were represented in the structure of arthropod fauna. The abundance and the activity quality of entomophagous populations were higher in the system of crops with protective forest belts, existing since 1952, in the Cean-Bolduţ farm of A.R.D.S. in Turda. Therefore, on the farm with protective forestry belts and with field marginal herbs shelters, favorable for the development of entomophagous arthropod fauna, a real natural entomocenotic equilibrium and a natural biological control of important pests were registered. By comparison it is necessary to apply the insecticide treatments on the cereal agroecosystem in open field areas, because the development of pest population exceeds the adjusting capacity of entomophagous arthropod fauna.";"Dana Malschi

The most sophisticated among the vulnerability assessment techniques is the GIS-based DRASTIC model. However, despite its popularity, it is marred with excessive subjectivity glitches; little research has been conducted to address the shortcomings associated with this method. This study investigates various issues regarding the application of the GIS-based DRASTIC model through a critical review of relevant literatures. It is revealed that all the DRASTIC parameters are equally significant irrespective of their assigned weights. On the contentious quantile classifications, however, a categorical classification defined by ‘very low’, ‘low’, ‘medium’, ‘high’, and ‘very high’ was suggested for standardization. Based on the studied literatures, it was established that 46 % of 977 million km²of land assessed globally fell within moderate to high vulnerability category—a land cover bigger than the cultivated lands obtainable in all the countries around the world except the United States, India, China, Russia, Brazil, Canada and Australia.";"Hamza, S.

In Vietnam, land fragmentation is common, especially in the north. For the whole country, there are about 75 million parcels of land, an average of seven to eight plots per farm household. Such fragmentation can be seen to have negative and positive benefits for farm households and the community generally. Comparative statics analysis and analysis of survey data have led to the conclusion that small-sized farms are likely to be more fragmented, and that fragmentation had a negative impact on crop productivity and increased family labour use and other money expenses. Policies which allow the appropriate opportunity cost of labour to be reflected at the farm level may provide appropriate incentives to trigger farm size change and land consolidation. Policies which tip the benefits in favour of fewer and larger plots, such as strong and effective research and development, an active extension system and strong administrative management, may also lead to land consolidation.";"Van Hung, Pham

Among the causes of land degradation in the humid tropics are phosphorus depletion (P), the decrease of soil organic matter (SOM) and the loss of basic cations. The aim of this study was determine the effects of different land uses on the dynamics of soil organic matter and phosphorus, to determine whether and how changes in the P and SOM can be used to assess the degree of land degradation in the humid tropics and whether the use of ecological systems can lessen or mitigate this degradation. Five systems were chosen according to potential use in the region: pasture of 30 years; no-tillage with 5 years of rice–maize rotations; no-tillage in alley cropping systems of 10 years; a newly cleared area; and 20 years of undisturbed secondary forest. Each field was sampled in a “W” pattern, to collect the soil samples from the chosen systems, prior to the chemical analyses. The SOM was separated by physical soil fractionation. The soil P fractionation was performed. All of the soil samples showed a very low pH range. The potential acidity was high under the alley cropping system, with more intensive and continuous use. All of the more labile fractions of organic matter decreased with the continuous use of soil in the alley cropping system. Therefore under alley cropping, most of the P (approximately 95%) was found in an inorganic form, and approximately 60% was found in the less labile fractions. The pasture and secondary forest showed higher contents of the labile fractions of organic matter and organic P. Higher correlations of organic P were found with the silt and clay fractions of organic matter. The results indicate that the fractions of P and organic matter are important indicators to assess changes in the degree of land degradation in the humid tropics. These results indicate also that the intensive and continuous use of annual crops in the soils of the humid tropics must be considered as posing a high risk to the sustainability of the agrosystems, mainly because of the increase of the active and potential acidity, the decrease of the labile organic matter and the depletion of the pools of organic P, leading to land degradation.";"Aguiar, Alana das Chagas Ferreira

Adding woody debris during reclamation can facilitate recovery of flora, soil nutrient cycling and water and nutrient holding capacity. Combined with forest floor material, woody debris can provide native plant propagules that would be otherwise commercially unavailable. Sites with and without woody debris on forest floor material containing identifiable litter (L), fragmented and fermented litter (F), and humus (H) (LFH), and peat mineral soil mix (peat) cover soils were studied. Within 2 years, woody debris decreased bare ground and created microsites which were positively associated with greater vegetation cover and woody plant density. Woody debris treatments had lower soil available nitrate and soil under woody debris had a lower temperature range and higher soil volumetric water content than control treatments without woody debris. Woody debris did not affect first year microbial biomass carbon or mycorrhizae, but both were greater on LFH than peat cover soil. LFH was associated with lower bare ground and greater vegetation cover, species richness, and soil phosphorus and potassium than peat cover soil, which had greater soil sulfate.";"Brown, Robyn L.

Reasons why these land managers decide to use or not use volunteer labor are not well known; yet, this decision can significantly shape ensuing social, psychological, and ecological benefits. To better understand how land managers' opinions influence their intentions toward using volunteers, we surveyed ecological restoration project decision makers (n = 176) from three U.S. land management agencies (the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and U.S. Forest Service) in Colorado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming using stratified random cluster sampling. Employing the Theory of Planned Behavior, we measured factors that likely influence intention to use volunteers, including land managers' attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). We used multiple regression analysis to understand the relationships among constructs, which indicated PBC was the strongest predictor of intention. Based upon intention to use volunteers, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed differences among land managers in terms of (1) their opinions about building community support and accomplishing more work, (2) the influence of supervisors, coworkers, and environmental groups, and (3) their perceived barriers due to a lack of trained volunteers and a lack of tasks safe for volunteers. Our results suggest environmental stewardship organizations and others that want to increase the use of ecological restoration volunteers should find ways to alleviate employees' perceived barriers, encourage supervisors to advocate for using volunteers, and when possible provide tangible information demonstrating how using volunteers can generate community support for a restoration project.";"Bruce, Matt C.

We examine the long‐run investment and consumption choices under two scenarios: (i) when the water availability constraint is binding and (ii) when it is not binding. We then compare the two scenarios to derive conditional convergence hypotheses regarding the impact of water availability on long‐run agricultural growth. Panel data from Wyoming are used to test these conditional convergence hypotheses. We find that Wyoming counties exhibit strong conditional convergence in agricultural growth. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that water availability is not a determinant but can be a constraint on long‐run agricultural growth. Higher water use leads to higher growth in agricultural yield per capita but when water rights constrain water use in a county, as we found in southeastern Wyoming, there are significant losses in agricultural growth.";"Chaudhry, Anita M.

The Indian agricultural dependent states offer representative examples of undervalued irrigation services mainly sourced by canal networks. However, the current inefficient operation of canal irrigation systems diverts water demand to private initiatives by significantly increasing economic value of agricultural water. The additional recent acknowledgement of economic value encompassed in supportive ecological services enhances the request for reevaluation of agricultural water. The paper attempts to assess the value of irrigation and related ecological services in representative backward clusters of Bihar state in Eastern India.

High attention is mainly given to irrigation policy while land is often apprehended through soil productivity aspects. However, the nexus between land scale and water consumption in respect to the economic implications of agricultural development is poorly elaborated. To this aim, this paper examines the economic effects of water use and landholding scale to farming in agricultural communities of IGB area. The research is based on an extensive survey conducted in representative areas of Pakistan, India and Nepal situated along the IGB basin. The results signify that the economic viability of marginal and small landholders and water users is threatened when the study focuses on the land scaling effects to farming.

"AGRIS:US2016203374";"HEDONIC PRICE FUNCTIONS: GUIDANCE ON EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION";"";"The hedonic pricing model is widely accepted as a method for estimating the marginal willingness to pay for spatially delineated amenities. Empirical applications typically rely on one of three functional forms—linear, semi-log, and double-log—and rarely involve rigorous specification testing. This phenomenon is largely due to an influential simulation study by Cropper, Deck and McConnell (CDM) (1988) that found, among other things, that simpler linear specifications outperformed more flexible functional forms in the face of omitted variables. In the 20 years that have elapsed since their study, there have been major computational advances and significant changes in the way hedonic price functions can be estimated. The purpose of our paper is to update and extend the CDM (1988) simulations to investigate current issues in hedonic modeling. Three preliminary results obtained from our theoretically consistent Monte Carlo simulation have been highlighted in this paper: (i) we find that adding spatial fixed effects (census tract dummies) to linear models does improve their performance. This is true both when all attributes are observed, and when some attributes are unobserved, (ii) adding the spatial fixed effects to the more flexible specifications such as the quadratic and quadratic box-cox does not improve their performance when all housing attributes are observed. However, when some housing attributes are unobserved, the spatial fixed effects significantly improves the performance of flexible specifications as well, and (iii) increasing the sample size from CDM’s 200 observations to a sample size of 2000 (which is more representative of modern applications) changes the relative performance of different specifications.";"Kuminoff, Nicolai V.

Main results are the following: 1. German law requires that the interests of the farming community and nature conservation are taken into account in the overall consideration of planning decisions. Any specialist plans already available – bearing in mind the different procedures existing between the various federal states – must also be integrated into the planning process. 2. If farming interests or the interests of nature conservation and countryside protection cannot be asserted in the overall planning process as laid down by the law, the decisions are in many cases political and, as such, cannot be dealt with by legal means. In legal terms, the interests are already recognised as having equalstatus. 3. The rivalry frequently encountered between the farming community and nature conservation over the use of land mostly occurs when the land is intended to be used for other purposes (i.e. for housing development, infrastructure etc.). The necessity for conservation-related compensation creates a relationship of tension which in many cases is not directly attributable to nature conservation and farming. An example is the low amount of conservation-related compensation when viewed in comparison with a housing development project. 4. The law only partially regulates the coordination of nature-preservation and agrarian specialist planning. However, both sides – the farming community (consideration of high-yielding land) and conservation (upgrading the chances of realising landscape planning) have an equal interest in seeing coordinated measures implemented at an early stage. In practice, an adequate procedure has already been developed. In legal terms, however, it is difficult to register and cope with the possibilities and problems associated with the informal methods of coordination. 5. Ultimately, the success of the coordination and collaboration depends largely on the commitment shown by the parties involved. However, the coordination of regional planning instruments at an early stage does not solve the problems of acceptance between the farming community and nature conservation as long as the realisation of legal conservationist measures are financially unattractive for farmers or could even jeopardise their existence.";"Exler, Kathrin";"";"";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"de";"zoning";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016210481";"http://purl.umn.edu/98262";"";"";"";""

The delay in improvements has been found to result in land degradation, decreased land productivity and environmental problems. An important question is thus how landowners would respond to regulations and mandates concerning land improvements. Based on a Finnish landowner survey, we analysed landowner choices under certain land improvement regulations, using the currently dominant choice of leasing land for agricultural use as the benchmark. The results indicated that land leasing will continue to increase in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly land improvements is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandates and search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups were identified based on their land use choices. Current leasers and amenity owners, in particular, were sensitive to land improvement mandates, and would avoid compulsory investment expenses by selling or afforesting their land.";"Pouta, E.

"AGRIS:US201600091911";"Fire legacies impact conifer regeneration across environmental gradients in the U.S. northern Rockies";"";"CONTEXT: An increase in the incidence of large wildfires worldwide has prompted concerns about the resilience of forest ecosystems, particularly in the western U.S., where recent changes are linked with climate warming and 20th-century land management practices. OBJECTIVES: To study forest resilience to recent wildfires, we examined relationships among fire legacies, landscape features, ecological conditions, and patterns of post-fire conifer regeneration. METHODS: We quantified regeneration across 182 sites in 21 recent large fires in dry mixed-conifer forests of the U.S. northern Rockies. We used logistic and negative binomial regression to predict the probability of establishment and abundance of conifers 5–13 years post-fire. RESULTS: Seedling densities varied widely across all sites (0–127,500 seedlings ha⁻¹) and were best explained by variability in distance to live seed sources (β = −0.014, p = 0.002) and pre-fire tree basal area (β = 0.072, p = 0.008). Beyond 95 m from the nearest live seed source, the probability of seedling establishment was low. Across all the fires we studied, 75 % of the burned area with high tree mortality was within this 95-m threshold, suggesting the presence of live seed trees to facilitate natural regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with the mix of species present within the burn mosaic, dry mixed-conifer forests will be resilient to large fires across our study region, provided that seedlings survive, fire do not become more frequent, high-severity patches do not get significantly larger, and post-fire climate conditions remain suitable for seedling establishment and survival.";"Kemp, Kerry B.

Using a household survey from Indonesia, we estimate the impact of having a land title on formal credit access.  Adopting an instrumental variable approach, we find that having a formal title significantly increases a household's probability of ever having had a formal loan and the observed loan amount.  Why land titles increase access to credit is still not clear.  Incorporating data from a unique survey of bankers in Indonesia, we will argue that possessing a formal title increases a household's incidences of formal credit not because the value of the title as collateral but because of what possessing a title signals about the household to the banker. We apply a simple model of contract choice to show how title can act as an indirect signal.";"Dower, Paul

"AGRIS:US201400004164";"Improved methods for measuring forest landscape structure: LiDAR complements field-based habitat assessment";"";"Conservation and monitoring of forest biodiversity requires reliable information about forest structure and composition at multiple spatial scales. However, detailed data about forest habitat characteristics across large areas are often incomplete due to difficulties associated with field sampling methods. To overcome this limitation we employed a nationally available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing dataset to develop variables describing forest landscape structure across a large environmental gradient in Switzerland. Using a model species indicative of structurally rich mountain forests (hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia), we tested the potential of such variables to predict species occurrence and evaluated the additional benefit of LiDAR data when used in combination with traditional, sample plot-based field variables. We calibrated boosted regression trees� (BRT) models for both variable sets separately and in combination, and compared the models’ accuracies. While both field-based and LiDAR models performed well, combining the two data sources improved the accuracy of the species’ habitat model. The variables retained from the two datasets held different types of information: field variables mostly quantified food resources and cover in the field and shrub layer, LiDAR variables characterized heterogeneity of vegetation structure which correlated with field variables describing the understory and ground vegetation. When combined with data on forest vegetation composition from field surveys, LiDAR provides valuable complementary information for encompassing species niches more comprehensively. Thus, LiDAR bridges the gap between precise, locally restricted field-data and coarse digital land cover information by reliably identifying habitat structure and quality across large areas.";"Zellweger, Florian

This article focuses on the controversial issue of the impact of information on the participation decision. We develop a straightforward model to analyze how information affects this decision, and empirically estimate the impact of information, as well as other factors, on participation in a conservation program in Saxony, Germany. We find in our theoretical analysis that information measures may affect program participation either in a positive or negative way, whereas our estimation results indicate that the influence of the diverse information measures that have been relevant in our empirical analysis is weak. We argue, however, that information measures may nonetheless be warranted, as they allow for better informed participation decisions, thus contributing to a more optimal selection of program participants.";"Frondel, Manuel

"AGRIS:US201500007781";"Can intra-aggregate pore structures affect the aggregate's effectiveness in protecting carbon?";"";"Aggregates are known to provide physical protection to soil organic matter shielding it from rapid decomposition. Spatial arrangement and size distribution of intra-aggregate pores play an important role in this process. This study examined relationships between intra-aggregate pores measured using X-ray computed micro-tomography images and concentrations of total C in 4–6 mm macro-aggregates from two contrasting land use and management practices, namely, conventionally tilled and managed row crop agricultural system (CT) and native succession vegetation converted from tilled agricultural land in 1989 (NS). Previous analyses of these aggregates indicated that small (<15 μm) and large (>100 μm) pores prevail in NS aggregates while medium (30–90 μm) pores are more abundant in CT aggregates (Kravchenko et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). We hypothesized that these differences in pore size distributions affect the ability of macro-aggregates to protect C. The results of this study supported this hypothesis. Consistent with greater heterogeneity of pore distributions within NS aggregates we observed higher total C and greater intra-aggregate C variability in NS as compared with CT aggregates. Total C concentrations and intra-aggregate C standard deviations were negatively correlated with fractions of medium sized pores, indicating that presence of such pores was associated with lower but more homogeneously distributed total C. While total C was positively correlated with presence of small and large pores. The results suggest that because of their pore structure NS macro-aggregates provide more effective physical protection to C than CT aggregates.";"Ananyeva, K.

Existing active green spaces were obtained as green space values per capita and indexed at the neighborhood level. The effectiveness of active green space opportunities for each neighborhood were estimated by the distances between centers of neighborhoods and the threshold distance between any active green space and the furthest residential housing. Thus, the effectiveness change values were gained for each neighborhood. The changing values of effectiveness were used as a determinant of effective active green space opportunities. The received findings showed that the active green spaces indicate the unbalanced allocation. The effectiveness of opportunities decay because of the residents who live in neighborhoods that have deficient active green space assets and can use active green space opportunity of other neighborhoods.

Bu çalışma, Adana Kuzeybatı Üst Kentsel Gelişme Alanındaki aktif yeşil alan olanaklarının (parklar, çocuk bahçeleri, spor ve oyun alanları) verimliliğini belirlemek amacıyla yapılmıştır.

Reference conditions used as benchmarks are often specified via potential-based land classifications (e.g., ecological sites) that describe the plant communities potentially observed in an area based on soil and climate. State-and-transition models (STMs) coupled to ecological sites specify indicators of ecological resilience and thresholds. Although general concepts surrounding STMs and ecological sites have received increasing attention, strategies to apply and quantify these concepts have not. In this paper, we outline concepts and a practical approach to potential-based land classification and STM development. Quantification emphasizes inventory techniques readily available to natural resource professionals that reveal processes interacting across spatial scales. We recommend a sequence of eight steps for the co-development of ecological sites and STMs, including 1) creation of initial concepts based on literature and workshops; 2) extensive, low-intensity traverses to refine initial concepts and to plan inventory; 3) development of a spatial hierarchy for sampling based on climate, geomorphology, and soils; 4) stratified medium-intensity inventory of plant communities and soils across a broad extent and with large sample sizes; 5) storage of plant and soil data in a single database; 6) model-building and analysis of inventory data to test initial concepts; 7) support and/or refinement of concepts; and 8) high-intensity characterization and monitoring of states. We offer a simple example of how data assembled via our sequence are used to refine ecological site classes and STMs. The linkage of inventory to expert knowledge and site-based mechanistic experiments and monitoring provides a powerful means for specifying management hypotheses and, ultimately, promoting resilience in grassland, shrubland, savanna, and forest ecosystems.";"Bestelmeyer, Brandon T.

Our aim was to identify those personal and social dimensions of landholders that might contribute to improved conservation policy and program design and, thereby, participation in private land conservation. We tested whether personal circumstances of landholders (e.g., lifestyle and wellbeing, information and knowledge, financial security) and social characteristics (e.g., attitudes, norms, and trust) would be important predictors of landholders' capacity and willingness to participate in biodiversity conservation programs. Forty-five participants and twenty-nine non-participants of biodiversity conservation programs in north Queensland, Australia, were surveyed to: 1) examine differences between their personal circumstances and social characteristics that may influence participation; and 2) explore whether personal circumstances and social characteristics were influenced by participation. The results revealed that, compared to participants, non-participants in conservation programs had significantly different personal circumstances and social characteristics for four of eight measured variables. Compared to participants, non-participants demonstrated a reduced capacity and willingness to participate in conservation programs. Participation did not appear to have a strong influence on participants' personal circumstances or social characteristics, and when social norms supported conservation, programs did not demonstrate additionality. Conservation policies that maintain or improve landholders' personal circumstances and that promote pro-environmental norms may result in increased participation and thereby conservation outcomes.";"Moon, Katie

Landowners play a significant role as providers of this ecosystem service and are currently offered subsidies to cover their costs for constructing and maintaining wetlands. We undertook a grounded theory study, in which landowners were interviewed, aiming at identifying landowners' incentives for constructing wetlands on their land. The study showed that adequate subsidies, additional services that the wetland could provide to the landowner, local environmental benefits, sufficient knowledge, and peers' good experiences could encourage landowners to construct wetlands. Perceived hindrances were burdensome management, deficient knowledge, time-consuming application procedures and unclear effectiveness of nutrient reduction. The main reason for not creating a wetland, however, was that the land was classified as productive by the landowner, i.e., suitable for food production. Current schemes are directed toward landowners as individuals and based on subsidies to cover costs. We propose that landowners instead are approached as ecosystem service entrepreneurs and contracted after a tendering process based on nutrient reduction effects. This would lead to new definitions of production and may stimulate improved design and placement of wetlands.";"Hansson, Anna

"AGRIS:RF2013031625";"Extended Abstract for Cross Cutting FieldsThe Nature of Land Resource Ownership and Perceptions on its Management among Farming Families of South East Nigeria";"";"Land has a cultural value in Nigeria in that its ownership cements
the relationship of the owner with the community. But more
importantly, land resource is critical to the livelihood of rural
farmers because they depend on it for income and food supply.
It is therefore important that it is sustainably managed and
efficiently used. This study investigated the ownership pattern
of land among the farming families in the study area and the
attitude towards its management. It adopted the farming and
rural systems approach which considers the family-farmhousehold
as a system. A multistage random sampling technique
was used to select 120 farming families. A hierarchical clustering
process was used to group the sample into the Land Resource
Rich (LRR) and Land Resource Poor (LRP). Data collected
were further analysed and interpreted in a comparative manner
using descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney-u test. The Likert
scale was used to assess their perceptions on land management.
The results show that the LRP had an average land area that
was one-third of the land-resource rich. The LRR were more
active in land market in terms of sales, rent and purchase
but
they considered that the land available for agricultural purposes
was not enough. The LRP devoted more land to crops and
were more dependent on forest products for fuels and herbs.
The ownership rights were often without title deed among the
LRP which affected their interest in land and soil management
techniques. Erosion and soil infertility were major problems
identified by both systems as being the major cause of yield
reduction in output. But the perception on land resource
management was particularly negative among the LRR.

La terre a une valeur culturelle au Nigeria en ce que sa propriété
cimente la relation du propriétaire avec la communauté. Mais
plus important encore, la ressource en terre est critique à la subsistance des agriculteurs ruraux car ils dépendent d’elle pour
leur revenu et l’approvisionnement alimentaire. Il est donc
important qu’elle soit gérée de manière durable et utilisée
rentablement. Cette étude se propose d’étudier la structure de
propriété foncière au sein des familles d’agriculteurs de la zone
d’étude et l’attitude à l’égard de sa gestion. Elle adopte
l’agriculture et l’approche des systèmes ruraux qui considère
la famille-l’exploitation agricole-le ménage comme un système.
La technique d’échantillonnage aléatoire à plusieurs niveaux a
été utilisée pour sélectionner 120 familles d’agriculteurs. Un
processus de classification hiérarchique a été utilisé pour
regrouper l’échantillon entre le Riche en Ressources Foncières
(LRR) et le Pauvre en Ressources Foncières (LRP). Les
données recueillies ont ensuite été analysées et interprétées de
manière comparative à l’aide de statistiques descriptives et du
test-u de Mann-Whitney. L’échelle de Likert a été utilisée pour
évaluer leurs perceptions sur la gestion des terres. Les résultats
montrent que les LRP ont une superficie moyenne de terre qui
représente le tiers de celle des LRR. Les LRR sont plus actifs
sur le marché des terres en termes de ventes, location et achat,
mais ils considèrent que la terre disponible à des fins agricoles
n’est pas suffisante. Les LRP consacrent plus de terre aux
cultures et sont plus dépendants des produits forestiers pour les
combustibles et les herbes. Les droits de propriété sont souvent
sans titre de propriété au sein des LRP, qui affecte leur intérêt
envers les techniques de gestion des terres et des sols. L’érosion
et l’infertilité des sols sont des problèmes majeurs identifiés par
les deux systèmes comme étant la principale cause de la baisse
de rendement de la production. Mais la perception de la gestion
des ressources foncières est particulièrement négative au sein
des LRR.";"Olajide Adeola, O.

"AGRIS:US2012205652";"THE LACK OF A PROFIT MOTIVE FOR RANCHING: IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY ANALYSIS";"";"The economic impact of changing land-use policies has traditionally been estimated using the standard economic model of profit maximization. Ranchers are assumed to maximize profit and to adjust production strategies so as to continue maximizing profit with altered policies. Yet, nearly 30 years of research and observation have shown that family, tradition, and the desirable way of life are the most important factors in the ranch purchase decision - not profit. Ranch buyers want an investment they can touch, feel, and enjoy, and they historically have been willing to accept relatively low returns from the livestock production. Profit maximization appears to be an inadequate model for explaining rancher behavior, describing grazing land use, and estimating the impacts of altered public land policies. In this paper, we investigate the relative importance of livestock production income and desirable lifestyle attributes in determining the market value of western ranches, and we explore what this means for economic models and policy analysis.";"Torell, L.

This paper utilizes data from a recent study in Owyhee County, Idaho, to explore the combination of social attributes that contribute to community attitudes of cohesion, integration, and attachment in a set of rural communities. Specifically, we examine the importance of social networks and where a particular public land activity, ranching, fits into those networks. We then evaluate the role such networks play in determining respondent attitudes about the cohesiveness of their community, how they are integrated with people in their community, and how attached they are to where they live. The results indicate that increasing density of acquaintenship and intimate social connections to ranching and other local businesses increase the strength of cohesion and integration attitudes.  Density of acquaintenship and intimate social connections to local businesses increase community attachment, but a social connection to ranching does not.";"Harp, Aaron J.

Using results from water quality monitoring at 24 sampling sites, we determined the first-order controls on these fluxes. Land cover with four classes (forest, agriculture, grassland and urban), dominant lithology (schist, marls, sandstone, limestone, alluvial sediments), physiographic indices (elevation, flow path length, ratio of flow path length to flow path gradient, topographic wetness index, and other), and a suite of hydrological indices (baseflow, flashiness index and runoff coefficient), were calculated and used as potential controls. Given the high co-dependence of the predictors, Partial Least Square Regression was used to shed light on the linkages between export fluxes and the metrics composed of the 19 selected catchment characteristics. The first-order controls were determined by calculating the Variable Influence on Projection (VIP). These values revealed that the overall dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes are controlled primarily by lithology, land cover, topographic wetness index and flow path length. The first-order controls of dissolved silica fluxes are runoff coefficient, average topographic slope and land cover. Fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved silica did not show any strong relation to catchment scale. Apart from the widely accepted effect of land cover, our results indicate that catchment topography has an essential impact on the fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The ratio of flow path length and flow path gradient, previously suggested as a proxy of mean water transit time, exerted a relatively strong control on dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes (VIP>1) with a negative relation to dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes, suggesting that dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes decrease with an increasing flow path gradient.";"Onderka, Milan

This study analyzes water conservation practices in irrigated agriculture in a sub-basin in North America's Rio Grande. A method is developed to estimate water savings in irrigated agriculture that result from public subsidies to farmers who convert from surface to drip irrigation. The method accounts for economic incentives affecting farmers' choices on irrigation technology, crop mix, water application, and water depletion. Findings show that farmers will invest in technologies that reduce water applications when faced with lower financial costs for converting to drip irrigation. Subsidies for drip irrigation increase farm income, raise the value of food production, and reduce the amount of water applied to crops. However, an unexpected result is that water conservation subsidies that promote conversion to drip irrigation can increase the demand for water depleted by crops. Our findings show that where water rights exist, water rights administrators will need to guard against increased depletion of the water source in the face of growing subsidies for drip irrigation. Our approach for analyzing water conservation programmes can be applied where water is scarce, irrigation is significant, food security is important, and water conservation policies are under debate.";"Dagnino, Macarena

This paper investigates the legacies of European settlement of Noosa Shire, South-east Queensland, with particular emphasis on the economic and political drivers and the resultant loss and fragmentation of Koala Phascolarctos cinereus habitat. Patterns of habitat loss between 1860 and 1970 were quantified at a coarse level from historical and land tenure records, while changes over the past 30 years were mapped at a finer spatial resolution from aerial photography and satellite imagery. Periods of high economic growth and to lesser extents depression are linked to increased vegetation clearing. Fifty per cent of P. cinereus habitat has been lost since 1860, with habitat class 2A (30-<50 per cent of preferred habitat trees) and 2C (10-<30 per cent of preferred habitat trees) suffering the highest proportion of loss. The period of greatest habitat loss was between 1890 and 1910, linked to the development of the dairy industry in the western half of Noosa Shire. A second significant phase of loss occurred since 1970, linked to the planting of exotic pine plantations, urbanisation and rural subdivision, with 35 per cent of remaining habitat being cleared, mainly in the southern part of the Shire. The cumulative loss of habitat has been accompanied by increasing levels of habitat fragmentation indicated by reduced patch size and increased patch linearity. Further analysis of the temporal aspects of habitat change is required in order to test the hypothesis that there is a relaxation period between the timing of habitat loss and current pattern of habitat occupancy of P. cinereus populations.";"Seabrook, L.M.

However, these relationships could be modified by selective grazing or differential digestibility of the C3 and C4 components, potentially creating a bias between grassland and grazer tissue δ13C. Importantly, these factors have never been studied in detail. We investigated the relation between δ13C of C3/C4 grassland vegetation and that of faeces and hair of sheep in a 3-year (2005–2007) experiment in the Inner Mongolian semi-arid steppe. The experiment employed six stocking rates (0.375–2.25 sheep ha−1 year−1; four replications), which allowed for a large variation in species composition, digestibility, and diet selection. Faecal-nitrogen content, a proxy for digestibility, decreased from 1.9% to 1.5% during the grazing period due to aging of the herbage. At the same time, the C3/C4 ratio decreased due to the later growth initiation of C4 species. 13Δ between diet and faeces (13Δ(DF); 0.6 ppt) and between diet and hair (13Δ(DH); −3.9 ppt) were not influenced by stocking rate, period in the season or C3/C4 ratio. Moreover, faeces–hair discrimination (13Δ(FH); −4.3 ppt), which reflects differences between digestibility of the C3 and C4 components, did not vary along the different gradients. The δ13C of grassland vegetation can be estimated from the δ13C of sheep faeces and hair, provided that 13Δ was accounted for. This is useful for landscape- or regional-scale investigations or reconstruction of C3/C4 vegetation distribution from faeces and hair, which provide different temporal and spatial integration of grassland isotope signals.";"Wittmer, M.H.O.M.

Based on location–allocation model, 13 plants could be built in the Province of Alberta with transportation costs in the range of $21–33per tonne. The locally determined unit costs of pellet plants vary within $108–121 with optimal plant capacities of 150,000–250,000tonnes per year.";"Sultana, Arifa

"AGRIS:US201500219977";"Wolves adapt territory size, not pack size to local habitat quality";"";"Although local variation in territorial predator density is often correlated with habitat quality, the causal mechanism underlying this frequently observed association is poorly understood and could stem from facultative adjustment in either group size or territory size. To test between these alternative hypotheses, we used a novel statistical framework to construct a winter population‐level utilization distribution for wolves (Canis lupus) in northern Ontario, which we then linked to a suite of environmental variables to determine factors influencing wolf space use. Next, we compared habitat quality metrics emerging from this analysis as well as an independent measure of prey abundance, with pack size and territory size to investigate which hypothesis was most supported by the data. We show that wolf space use patterns were concentrated near deciduous, mixed deciduous/coniferous and disturbed forest stands favoured by moose (Alces alces), the predominant prey species in the diet of wolves in northern Ontario, and in proximity to linear corridors, including shorelines and road networks remaining from commercial forestry activities. We then demonstrate that landscape metrics of wolf habitat quality – projected wolf use, probability of moose occupancy and proportion of preferred land cover classes – were inversely related to territory size but unrelated to pack size. These results suggest that wolves in boreal ecosystems alter territory size, but not pack size, in response to local variation in habitat quality. This could be an adaptive strategy to balance trade‐offs between territorial defence costs and energetic gains due to resource acquisition. That pack size was not responsive to habitat quality suggests that variation in group size is influenced by other factors such as intraspecific competition between wolf packs.";"Kittle, Andrew M.

"AGRIS:US201400088127";"Does the surrounding landscape heterogeneity affect the butterflies of insular grassland reserves? A contrast between composition and configuration";"";"Landscape homogenisation represents one of the gravest threats to the biodiversity of intensively farmed landscapes. In such landscapes, many species persist within remnants of (semi)natural habitats, such as in the steppe grasslands of Southern Moravia, SE Czech Republic. We investigated how the butterfly fauna of insular grassland reserves is affected by the heterogeneity of the surrounding farmland. We followed two lines of evidence, one based on species richness, the other on species community composition, considering two aspects of landscape heterogeneity, composition (amount of land cover types) and configuration (geometry of land cover patches). After statistically correcting for individual reserves characteristics, and within-reserves biotope composition, we found that reserves amidst heterogeneous landscapes contained more species. With increasing buffers around the reserves, the strength of the effects decreased for landscape composition, and increased for landscape configuration. Similar patterns applied for the butterfly assemblage composition, but in a rather subtle manner, not reflecting a specialist versus generalist dichotomy. However, more red-listed species inclined towards reserves amidst heterogeneous matrices. The species most tightly associated with heterogeneous landscapes were those whose populations likely span across multiple patches of relatively rare biotopes, whereas those indifferent to configuration were either those persisting at isolated sites, or those utilising common biotope types outside the reserves. The importance of landscape configuration suggests that relatively cheap restoration measures aimed at compartmentalisation the currently huge farmland units may substantially contribute to preserving biodiversity in intensively farmed regions.";"Slancarova, Jana

"AGRIS:US201301897843";"Soil-vegetation patterns in secondary slash and burn successions in Central Menabe, Madagascar";"";"Slash and burn agriculture is a traditional and predominant land use practice in Madagascar and its relevance in the context of forest preservation is significant. At the end of a cycle of culture, the fields become mostly weed covered and the soil fertility starts to drop. As a consequence, these fields are abandoned (they are called “monka”) and the farmers, in the best case, re-use old surfaces where the vegetation has recovered to some extent. Nevertheless, some of the farmers continue to extend part of their cultures into the natural forest. In order to decrease deforestation, the paper focuses on the potential for agricultural re-use of monkas. To do so, we present the soil-vegetation pattern along a slash and burn successional gradient from newly cultivated surfaces to surfaces abandoned for 40 years. Vegetation relevés were carried out on 61 plots sampled on yellow and red soils, and soil variables such as loss of ignition, pH, total carbon content and total nitrogen content were measured. Results show that: (1) by the 10th year of abandonment woody species are increasing, and after 21-30 years herbaceous plants become less dominant, (2) the species richness increases with age of abandonment, but flattens out by 40 years, (3) by 20 years of fallow, the loss of ignition, total carbon and total nitrogen show similar values or even higher values than in cultivated surfaces, (4) the yellow soils are related to higher pH more than the red soils and are preferred for cultivation, but the higher pH of yellow soils is not associated with higher species richness. Given these results, we conclude that fields older than 20 years have recovered sufficient fertility to be re-used as agricultural land. This re-use would decrease impacts on natural forests. But beyond the nutrient perspective, critical problems remain, including the growing demand for arable land and the need for cultivation to control invasive weeds.";"Raharimalala, Olga

A pixel-based supervised image classification was used to map land-use/cover classes. People's perceptions and ecological time-lines were used to explain the driving forces linked to the changes. A rapid reduction in woodland cover (97%) and grassland cover (88%) took place between 1972 and 2007. Bushland cover increased more than threefold, while the size of cultivated land increased more than eightfold. Bare land increased moderately, whereas bushy grassland and scrubland remained stable. According to accounts from local people, major events that largely explain the changes include: (1) severe droughts in 1973/74 and 1984/85; (2) increase in dry years during the last decade; and (3) immigration and increased sedentarization of pastoralists. If the present land-use/cover change were to continue, coupled with a drier climate, people's livelihoods will be highly affected and the pastoral production system will be under increasing threat.";"Tsegaye, Diress

The goal of this study was to determine whether phosphorus input from sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L., cultivation in northern Belize could pose a significant environmental impact on malaria transmission by changing vegetation structure and composition of wetlands and associated larval habitats. Our primary focus was on the increased dominance of cattail, Typha domingensis Pers., a favored habitat for Anopheles vestitipennis Dyar & Knab. A land cover classification based on satellite imagery was used to select 20 marshes impacted by agricultural runoff and 20 marshes surrounded by forest (nonimpacted). A 100-m transect was established into each of the 40 marshes. Water, vegetation, and larval sampling were conducted at the 0-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-m locations along the transect. Analyses of larval density data indicated that Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann was negatively correlated with percentage of cover of Typha (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001) but positively correlated with sparse Eleocharis cellulosa Torr. (rush) cover (R2 = 0.19, P < 0.05) and presence of cyanobacterial mats (CBM) (R2 = 0.33, P < 0.0001). An. vestitipennis was found to be positively correlated with percentage of cover of Typha (R2 = 0.19, P < 0.001). Canonical correspondence analysis identified CBM and light as the variables associated with the presence of An. albimanus larvae, Typha cover with An. vestitipennis larvae, and Eleocharis and absence of light with Anopheles crucians (Wiedemann). A positive correlation also existed between marshes adjacent to agricultural activities and presence of An. vestitipennis (R2 = 0.37, P < 0.05). These results indicate that marshes in proximity to agricultural fields are conducive for Typha growth, thereby providing habitat for the more efficient malaria vector An. vestitipennis.";"Grieco, J.P.

The âIndice Phytoplancton Lacustreâ (IPLAC) is a multimetric index, taking into account biomass, abundance and species composition of communities. The first metric is based on the total phytoplankton biomass (MBA), the second on the abundance and taxonomic composition (MCS) of 165 indicator taxa. The IPLAC was developed on 2 independent databases, one for the calibration and the second for the validation of the metrics. The calibration dataset was composed of 255 âlake-yearsâ from 214 distinct lakes sampled between 2005 and 2012. The validation dataset included 173 lake-years in order to confirm the response of the index to the trophic gradient and anthropogenic pressure.The results show that the IPLAC correctly highlights chemical pressure (eutrophication). Especially high Pearson correlations are shown with total phosphorus (r=â0.71, p-value<0.001), chlorophyll-a (r=â0.83, p-value<0.001) and water transparency (r=0.73, p-value<0.001) which are the main proxies for the trophic level. Corine land cover was used as an indication of the anthropogenic pressure and good correlations are also found with the watershed land use, negatively correlated with agricultural area (r=â0.60, p-value <0.001), population density (r=â0.36, p-value <0.001) and positively with forest area (r=0.57, p-value <0.001).The index is WFD-compliant and is dedicated to natural lakes and artificial water bodies in metropolitan France, and will be routinely used by the French Ministry of the Environment to assess lake ecological status through the phytoplankton community. However, the results must be carefully interpreted in two cases: reservoirs with large water level fluctuations, and samples that include less than 5 indicator species.";"Laplace-Treyture, Christophe

We find that land rental markets in Kenya enhance productivity and are equitable. The results are consistent across different estimation methods and model specifications. Dynamic panel models were used to assess the impact of rental participation on households’ crop income and total income.  After controlling for the endogeneity of rental market participation and the persistent effects of lagged income, we find that the decision to rent land increased tenant households’ net crop (net total) income by 25.1 (6.6) percent. These percentage gains are inversely related to household landholding size. Hence, land rental markets in Kenya appear to play an important role in raising incomes and reducing poverty for land-constrained smallholder farmers.";"Jin, Songqing

"AGRIS:US201400182393";"Assessing the spatio-temporal rates and patterns of land-use and land-cover changes in the Cerrados of southeastern Mato Grosso, Brazil";"";"The Cerrados of central Brazil have undergone profound landscape transformation in recent decades due to agricultural expansion, and this remains poorly assessed. The present research investigates the spatial-temporal rates and patterns of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes in one of the main areas of agricultural production in Mato Grosso State (Brazil), the region of Primavera do Leste. To quantify the different aspects of LULC changes (e.g. rates, types, and spatial patterns) in this region, we applied a post-classification change detection method, complemented with landscape metrics, for three dates (1985, 1995, and 2005). LULC maps were obtained from an object-based classification approach, using the nearest neighbour (NN) classifier and a multi-source data set for image object classification (e.g. seasonal Thematic Mapper (TM) bands, digital elevation model (DEM), and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived index), strategically chosen to increase class separability. The results provided an improved mapping of the Cerrados natural vegetation conversion into crops and pasture once auxiliary data were incorporated into the classification data set. Moreover, image segmentation was crucial for LULC map quality, in particular because of crop size and shape. The changes detected point towards increasing loss and fragmentation of natural vegetation and high rates of crop expansion. Between 1985 and 2005, approximately 42% (6491 km²) of Cerrados in the study area were converted to agricultural land uses. In addition, it was verified that cultivated areas are encroaching into fragile environments such as wetlands, which indicates the intense pressure of agricultural expansion on the environment.";"Grecchi, Rosana Cristina

"AGRIS:US201500058668";"Patterns of forest vegetation responses to edge effect as revealed by a continuous approach";"";"CONTEXT : Understanding the variability of vegetation distribution and its determinants is a central issue for addressing the effects of edges on ecological processes. Recent studies have revealed inconsistencies in the patterns of responses to edge effects that raise important questions about their determinants. We investigated the edge effect response patterns by adapting a recently proposed continuous approach to the case of small forest fragments in southwestern France. METHODS : We surveyed forest understory vegetation (composition, species richness, and percent cover) and abiotic variables (soil temperature, moisture, pH, and canopy openness) along 28 transects across hard forest edges. We tested five statistical models to describe the response pattern of each variable (1) over all transects and (2) per transect. We then compared the response patterns as a function of the attributes of the edge (orientation, topography, and adjacent land cover) and forest patch size. RESULTS : Over all transects, a general decreasing trend was observed for all variables as the distance from the edge increased. In the individual transects, we evidenced a large variability in the response patterns that was not related to edge attributes or to patch size. CONCLUSION : It is difficult to assess the depth of edge influence in highly fragmented forests and to identify the determinants of edge effects. We recommend that care should be taken with studies using pool of transects, and that further studies should be carried out including situations with neutral patterns, in order to gain a broader understanding of edge effects on vegetation.";"Alignier, Audrey

The objective of this study was to identify potential sites of illicit C. sativa plantations located in the semi-arid, southern part of Pernambuco State, Brazil. The study was conducted using an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre high-resolution geometric (SPOT-5 HRG) images (overpass: 31 May, 2007). OBIA considers the target's contextual and geometrical attributes to overcome the difficulties inherent in detecting illicit crops associated with the grower's strategies to conceal their fields and optimizes the spectral information extracted to generate land-cover maps. The capabilities of the SPOT-5 near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands to discriminate herbaceous vegetation with high water content, and employment of the support vector machine classifier, contributed to accomplishing this task. Image classification included multiresolution segmentation with an algorithm available in the eCognition Developer software package. In addition to a SPOT-5 HRG multispectral image with 10 m spatial resolution and a panchromatic image with 2.5 m spatial resolution, first-order indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index and ancillary data including land-cover classes, anthropogenic areas, slope, and distance to water sources were also employed in the OBIA. The classification of segments (objects) related to illegal cultivation employed fuzzy logic and fixed-threshold membership functions to describe the following spectral, geometrical, and contextual properties of targets: vegetation density, topography, neighbourhood, and presence of water supplies for irrigation. The results of OBIA were verified from a weight of evidence analysis. Among 15 previously known C. sativa sites identified during police operations conducted on 5–17 June 2007, eight sites were classified as maximum-alert areas (total area of 22.54 km² within a total area of object-oriented image classification of ∼1800 km²). The approach proposed in this study is feasible for reducing the area to be searched for illicit cannabis cultivation in semi-arid regions.";"Lisita, Alessandra

Fraction imagery representing proportions of green vegetation, soil, and shade was estimated using all six reflective bands of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM1 to TM5 and TM7) through the linear spectral mixing model (LSMM). The fraction information registered at pixel level was then related to different types of land classes following three principal procedures: (1) selecting an image or image group as input for segmentation; (2) application of sequences of masking techniques to address the segmentation of preselected areas in order to obtain better image partitioning; and (3) application of an unsupervised classifier by region, named Isoseg, to group the segmented regions. Isoseg is a clustering algorithm that calculates the centre of each class using the covariance matrix and the average vector of the regions. An assessment of the classification was performed visually and by error matrix, relating reference data points to classification results. The results showed that fraction images were effective in highlighting the different types of LULC. Several tests were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the masking technique in the process for extracting information. The results showed that the use of masks significantly improves the segmentation results. However, in the Isoseg classification process, the masking technique was not able to avoid omission and commission errors between classes of similar structures. On comparing the results obtained in this work with a Maximum Likelihood classification, it was found that adopting the procedures described resulted in increases of 10% in average and global accuracy, and 18% in average reliability. Furthermore, a reduction was observed in the variability of errors created in the classification.";"Kawakubo, F. S.

Drawing upon research carried out near the Rio Tinto/QMM ilmenite mine in 2009 (January–March), it focuses on how local Malagasy land users are incorporated into new forms of inclusion (into the neoliberal capitalist economy) and exclusion (from land-based, subsistence activities) resulting from private sector engagements in conservation and sustainability. Sustainability tropes and corporate partnerships with international conservation NGOs were found to play a part in land access, in part through the neoliberal project of commodifying, economically valuing and objectifying nature. Through a process of mimesis (of conservation NGOs) and alterity (‘othering’ land users), Rio Tinto's process of creating scarcity of biodiversity paradoxically lends support to the company's claim to be ‘saving’ biodiversity from local Malagasy people; this is described as a process of inversion, wherein actual mining impacts are abstracted and remediated as part of a broader sustainable development strategy.";"Seagle, Caroline";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"mining;land access;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014033";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.671769";"";"";"";"447-477"
"AGRIS:US201600014031";"Wild property and its boundaries – on wildlife policy and rural consequences in South Africa";"";"Against the backdrop of post-Apartheid neoliberal reform, South African landowners have gained the option to acquire full ownership over wild animals on their land. Corresponding with this, approximately one sixth of South Africa's total land has been ‘game-fenced’ and converted for wildlife-based production (i.e. hunting, ecotourism, live trade and venison production). This article analyzes the institutional process in which authority concerning access to wildlife is being restructured, and argues that the unfolding property regime leads to an intensified form of green grabbing. To demonstrate this, the article singles out three particular wildlife policy institutions which make clear (a) how private property rights to wildlife are negotiated and implemented, (b) how wildlife ownership is firmly interlocked with land ownership, (c) how natural entities are being converted to robust political and economical assets, and (d) what social consequences this has for rural South Africa.";"Snijders, Dhoya";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"property rights;landowners;land ownership";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014031";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.667406";"";"";"";"503-520"
"AGRIS:US201600014030";"Conservation, green/blue grabbing and accumulation by dispossession in Tanzania";"";"This article shows how wildlife and marine conservation in Tanzania lead to forms of ‘green’ or ‘blue grabbing’. Dispossession of local people's land and resources has been gradual and piecemeal in some cases, while it involved violence in other cases. It does not primarily take the usual form of privatization of land. The spaces involved are still formally state or village land. It is rather the benefits from the land and natural resources that contribute to capital accumulation by more powerful actors (rent-seeking state officials, transnational conservation organizations, tourism companies, and the State Treasury). In both cases, restrictions on local resource use are justified by degradation narratives, while financial benefits from tourism are drained from local communities within a system lacking in transparent information sharing. Contrary to other forms of primitive accumulation, this dispossession is not primarily for wage labour or linked to creation of a labour reserve. It is the wide-open spaces without its users that are valued by conservation organizations and the tourism industry. The introduction of ‘community-based conservation’ worked as a key mechanism for accumulation by dispossession allowing conservation a foothold in village lands. This foothold produced the conditions under which subsequent dispossessions could take place.";"Benjaminsen, Tor A.

To safeguard the land use security of continental river watersheds in arid regions, the oasis of the Manas River Watershed was investigated using 15 evaluation indexes from three subsystems, including land use suitability, land use vulnerability and water security to provide a comprehensive evaluation based on the methods of analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy synthetic evaluation model, social economy and land use/cover data from remote sensing images for 1976, 1987, 1998 and 2010. The above-mentioned indexes were classified into four levels, which were regarded as security (v ₁), relative security (v ₂), security threshold (v ₃) and insecurity (v ₄). The results showed that land use securities of oasis in the Manas River Watershed were at the insecure level of v ₄, and that the synthetic graded values were 0.6150, 0.5772, 0.5617 and 0.5640, respectively. For the three subsystems, indexes of land use suitability were all at the security level of v ₁, and the indexes of land use vulnerability were at the levels of v ₁, v ₂, v ₄ and v ₄ in the 4� years investigated, respectively. Furthermore, indexes of water security in the 4� years were all classified as insecure levels. Ultimately, it is important to determine the leading factors that restrict land use security and then put forward corresponding solutions. The objects of this study were to achieve sustainable land use in the Manas River Watershed, as well as provide scientific references for evaluation of land use security in the continental river watershed of arid regions.";"Ling, Hongbo

Our knowledge concerning the predominant controls on the cycling of leaf litter far outweighs that for rhizodeposition even though the constituents of rhizodeposits includes a cocktail of low molecular weight organic compounds which represent a rapidly cycling source of carbon, readily available to soil microbes. We determined the mineralization dynamics of a major rhizodeposit, glucose, and its relationship to land-use, microbial community and edaphic characteristics across a landscape in the southeastern United States. The landscape consists of cultivated, pasture, pine plantation, and hardwood forest sites (n = 3). Mineralization dynamics were resolved in both winter and summer using an in situ 13C-glucose pulse-chase approach. Mineralization rates of the labeled glucose decline exponentially across the 72 h measurement periods. This pattern and absolute mineralization rates are consistent across seasons. An information-theoretic approach reveals that land-use is a moderately strong predictor of cumulative glucose mineralization. Measures assessing the size, activity, and/or composition of the microbial community were poor predictors of glucose mineralization. The strongest predictor of glucose mineralization was soil-extractable phosphorus. It was positively related to glucose mineralization across seasons and explained 60% and 48% of variation in cumulative glucose mineralization in the summer and winter, respectively. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between soil phosphorus and glucose mineralization. Our results suggest that specific soil characteristics often related to land-use and/or land-management decisions may be strong predictors of glucose mineralization rates across a landscape. We emphasize the need for future research into the role of soil phosphorus availability and land-use history in determining soil organic carbon dynamics.";"Strickland, Michael S.

Merr.] intercrop has emerged as an option that increases land productivity in the southern Pampas of Argentina, compared with sole crops, because of complementary use of resources between species. A common management practice for this intercrop consists of delay soybean sowing, although delayed planting reduces the capacity of soybean to capture resources. Simultaneous sowing could improve total intercrop productivity because of an increase in soybean grain yield with no or little detrimental effects on sunflower grain yield. The objectives of this study were to analyze the response of the sunflower-soybean intercrop and of their component species under different sowing management (i.e., relay or simultaneous sowing) and water availability conditions. Three experiments were conducted at Balcarce, Argentina. Four cropping systems were evaluated: (i) sunflower-soybean intercrop with simultaneous sowing management (I00), (ii) sunflower-soybean intercrop with 30 d of delay between sunflower and soybean sowing (I30), (iii) sunflower sole crop (SUN), and (iv) soybean sole crop (SOY). Sunflower-soybean intercrop grain yield tend to be higher than that for sole crops of the component species. This yield advantage for intercrop increased with water availability and was associated with an increase in intercropped soybean productivity. Intercrop sowing management had no effect on total intercrop grain yield. However, simultaneous sowing increased soybean contribution to intercrop yield. Finally, our results indicate that agronomic practices that promote intercropped soybean performance increase intercrop productivity relative to the sole crops of their component species.";"Andrade, José F.

"AGRIS:US201400048804";"Density fractionation and ¹³C reveal changes in soil carbon following woody encroachment in a desert ecosystem";"";"Woody encroachment has dramatically changed land cover patterns in arid and semiarid systems (drylands) worldwide over the past 150 years. This change is known to influence bulk soil carbon (C) pools, but the implications for dynamics and stability of these pools are not well understood. Working in a Chihuahuan Desert C₄ grassland encroached by C₃ creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), we used two density fractionation techniques (2 and 7 pool density fractionations) and isotopic analysis to quantify changes in C pools and dynamics among vegetation microsites typical of an encroachment scenario (remnant intact grassland, shrub subcanopies, and in shrub intercanopy spaces within a shrub-encroached area). The C concentration of bulk soils varied with microsite, with almost twice the C in shrub subcanopies as in intercanopy spaces or remnant grasslands. Estimated SOC accumulation rates from Larrea encroachment (4.79 g C m⁻² year⁻¹ under canopies and 1.75 g C m⁻² year⁻¹ when intercanopy losses were taken into account) were lower than reported for higher productivity Prosopis systems, but still represent a potentially large regional C sink. The composition of soil C varied among microsites, with the shrub subcanopy C composed of proportionally more light fraction C (<1.85 g cm⁻³) and C that was soluble in sodium polytungstate. Grassland soils contained very little carbonate C compared to shrub subcanopies or shrub intercanopy spaces. Stable isotope analyses indicate that inputs from C₃ shrubs were incorporated into all density fractions, even in heavy fractions in which shrub inputs did not change overall C concentration. The seven density fractionation yielded unexpected δ¹³C patterns, where the two heaviest fractions were strongly depleted in ¹³C, indicating strong fractionation following organic matter inputs. These results suggest that the utility of isotope mixing models for determining input sources may be limited in systems with similar fractionation patterns. We propose a five pool model for dryland soil C that includes a relatively dynamic light fraction, aggregate and heavy fractions that are stable in size but that reflect dynamic inputs and outputs, a potentially large and seasonally dynamic pool of soluble C, and a large pool of carbonate C. Combined, these results suggest that dryland soil C pools may be more dynamic than previously recognized.";"Throop, Heather L.

"AGRIS:US201600057361";"Interpolation-based super-resolution land cover mapping";"";"Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a technique to produce a land cover map with finer spatial resolution by using fractional proportion images as input. A two-step SRM approach has been widely used. First, a fine-resolution indicator map is estimated for each class from the coarse-resolution fractional image. All indicator maps are then combined to create the final fine-resolution land cover map. In this letter, three popular interpolation methods, Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), Spline and Kriging, as well as four indicator map combination strategies, including the maximal value strategy and the sequential assignment strategy with and without normalization, were assessed. Based on the application to two simulated images, the performance of all SRM algorithms was assessed. The results show that the two-step SRM approach can obtain smoother land cover maps than hard classification. An increase in zoom factor results in the appearance of numerous small patches and linear artefacts in the SRM results. The accuracies of Spline and Kriging are similar and are both higher than that of IDW. The maximal value strategy can generate a smoother land cover map than the sequential assignment strategy in most cases, and a normalizing indicator value has a mixed effect on the result.";"Ling, Feng

Habitat suitability index (H.S.I.) was developed using multiple logistic regression (MLR) integrated with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). Satellite imageries of study area, acquired from Indian remote sensing satellite-P6, linear imaging self-scanning satellite-III of 2005, was digitally processed, whereas topographic maps were used for generating the collateral data in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as forest density, Landuse land cover, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created from satellite and topographic data. These layers along with global positioning system location of gaur presence/absence and MLR technique were integrated in a GIS environment for modelling the H.S.I. of gaur. The results indicate that approximately 91.80 km² (31.14%) of the forest of tiger reserve is highly suitable for gaur, whereas, 115.18 km² (39.07%) is suitable, 72.12 km² (24.47%) moderately suitable and 15.67 km² (5.32%) is least suitable. The accuracy level of this model is 70.7%. However, model is potent enough to advocate that forests of this area are most appropriate for declaring it as a reserve, for gaur conservation.";"Imam, Ekwal

We examined the effects of the expansion of the water-point network on the arid and semi-arid zone bird community, using data from the Atlas of Australia bird surveys of 1977-1981 and 1996-2001. We examined whether traits of species could be used to uncover the critical ecological processes altered by this land use change. We detected large scale declines in individual species. Species reliant on water for nesting and feeding declined more than other groups in the presence of high water-point density, likely through direct effects of livestock degrading habitat of both natural and artificial water points. The arid zone has no natural hoofed animals and livestock have significant impacts. Species that forage and nest on the ground also showed large declines, likely because of trampling and removal of vegetation by livestock and potentially through the indirect effect of water limited predators, dingos and foxes, expanding their ranges in response to the expanding network of water points in the landscape. This result was also apparent at large spatial scales so that these local-scale responses to water points translate into continental-scale population declines. Using traits of species to understand declines of bird species helped us to uncover which critical changes associated with the expansion of the water-point network most affected the bird community and therefore which species are most at risk.";"Davies, Kendi F.

The research results indicate that residents have a low perception of wildland fire risk but support the use of fire hazard reduction strategies, including prescribed fire, mechanical removal of trees and brush, and construction of firebreaks. Previous experience with wildland fire was a major factor influencing respondents' perception of fire risk. Furthermore, participants' knowledge about specific fuel treatments positively influenced their support for those treatments.

Focused analyses on four representative species (central stoneroller, creek chub, largemouth bass, and white sucker) showed the probability of presence of each species increased non-linearly with watershed area. For these species, SDMs built to predict absent, low, and high densities were similar to presence/absence predictions but provided probable locations of high densities (e.g., probability of high-density creek chub decreased rapidly with watershed area).

Changes in soil temperature and moisture moderately affected parameters of the spatial structure, the variance (heterogeneity) and correlation length (continuity), and the effects were higher at 10-cm depth compared to 20-cm depth. Increase in soil temperature by 1°C increased the correlation length by about 0.6m only at the upper depth. Heterogeneity of soil moisture was affected by interaction of variability of soil temperature and moisture so that the peak variance changed by as much as 5%² and 0%² under changing soil temperature and by 6%² and 3%² under changing soil moisture over almost a year at 10-cm and 20-cm depths, respectively.

To determine how landscape configuration affects the distribution of species traits, relationships of traits and species affinity with landscape variables were tested. Results: Among landscape variables, forest continuity, landscape forest cover and distance to nearest settlement altered the vegetation. These variables also influenced the distributions of species traits, i.e. life forms, life strategies, affinity to forest, dispersal modes, seed characteristics, flooding tolerance and Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen, light, moisture and soil reaction. Nevertheless, physiographic area and habitat quality variables explained more variation in species composition. Landscape variables were more important in lowland areas. Forest continuity affected species composition only in lowlands. Conclusions: Although habitat quality and physiographic area explained more vegetation variability, landscape configuration was also a key factor influencing species composition and distribution of species traits. However, the results are dependent on forest geographical location, with lowland forests being more influenced by landscape variables compared to mountain forests.";"Douda, Jan";"";"Opulus Press";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"urbanization;land cover";"Urban Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400139253";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01213.x";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201600199713";"Contrasting current and potential productivity and the influence of fire and species composition in the boreal forest: a case study in eastern Canada1";"";"The capacity of a forest stand to produce timber is related to the interactions that exist between its regeneration capacity, physical site characteristics (climate, surficial deposit, drainage), and disturbances. Minimally, to be sustainably managed, a forest needs to be sufficiently productive and able to regenerate after a disturbance so that its productive capacity is maintained or enhanced. To this effect, we evaluated timber productivity over a large area (175â000 kmÂ²) covering the latitudinal extent of closed-canopy black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P) forest. Site index and relative density index were used to identify stands that cannot reach a minimum volume of trees of minimum size over one rotation. A nonparametric method was used to estimate their values for all stands within the study area. This imputation used either physical site attributes alone to assess potential productivity independent of stand history or physical and vegetation site attributes to assess current productivity. The proportion of productive stands was then estimated at the scale of landscapes ranging from 39 to 2491 kmÂ². Physical site factors alone explain 84% of the variability in the percentage of potentially productive stands (78% for currently productive stands); their combination resulted in an abrupt transition in productivity over the study area. However, burn rate alone also explains 63% of variation in the proportion of currently productive stands and 41% of the relative difference between percentages of potentially or currently productive stands. These results have implications for strategic forest management planning at land classification stage, as timber production area is assumed to remain stable through time, whereas it is apparently related to the disturbance rate.";"Rapanoela, Rija

Here we explore tradeoffs between potential gains in mapping accuracy with computational costs by integrating structural and intensity surface models extracted from LiDAR data with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and evaluating the degree to which TM, LiDAR, and LiDAR-TM fusion data discriminated land covers in the rapidly urbanizing region of Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. Using supervised maximum likelihood (ML) and classification tree (CT) methods, we classified TM data at 30m and LiDAR data and LiDAR-TM fusions at 1m, 5m, 10m, 15m and 30m resolutions. We assessed the relative contributions of LiDAR structural and intensity surface models to classification map accuracy and identified optimal spatial resolution of LiDAR surface models for large-area assessments of urban land cover. ML classification of 1m LiDAR-TM fusions using both structural and intensity surface models increased total accuracy by 32% compared to LiDAR alone and by 8% over TM at 30m. Fusion data using all LiDAR surface models improved class discrimination of spectrally similar forest, farmland, and managed clearings and produced the highest total accuracies at 1m, 5m, and 10m resolutions (87.2%, 86.3% and 85.4%, respectively). At all resolutions of fusion data and using either ML or CT classifier, the relative contribution of the LiDAR structural surface models (canopy height and normalized digital surface model) to classification accuracy is greater than the intensity surface. Our evaluation of tradeoffs between data volume and thematic map accuracy for this study system suggests that a spatial resolution of 5m for LiDAR surface models best balances classification performance and the computational challenges posed by large-area assessments of land cover.";"Singh, Kunwar K.

The selected municipalities are: Medicina, Borgo Tossignano and Castel del Rio, which represent the main territorial aspects of the Nuovo Circondario Imolese.The land use transformations are quantified through the GIS comparison of the land use maps of the years 1995, 1976, 1994 and 2003. The corresponding legends are transformed into the five categories of the first level CORINE Land Cover classes. The naturalness increases in the three territories throughout the period 1955-2003, but with different quantitative importance: limited for the territory of Medicina and progressively increasing from Borgo Tossignano to Castel del Rio. Urban areas increase too, but following a gradient opposite to the one concerning naturalness. The land use transformations in the Nuovo circondario imolese are similar to the trends reported for the same period in Italy as a whole and in many other European countries. Concerning the effects of land use transformations on the territory naturalness and biodiversity, our results highlight the critical state of the intensively used areas and the marginal areas. Some lines of action for a correct ecological planning of these different situations are suggested.";"Maria Speranza

We draw upon more than 50 years of census data and more than 30 years of remotely sensed land-cover data to reconstruct these dynamics from World War II to the present. We found that smallholders are highly flexible in their land use decisions and livelihood strategies and that such flexibility has helped them to adapt their land-use systems to produce resources in demand during market booms and conserve forests. Smallholder mosaic landscapes contain forest fragments that enhance socioecological resilience to floods and other events produced by changes in the local hydro-climatic regimes due to sea-level rise and other climate-related changes. We argue that flexibility is a tool to reduce livelihood vulnerability by facilitating adaptation to global market and climate driven changes over the long term.";"Vogt, Nathan D.

Common property resources are first contrasted with protected areas, and then combined to develop a conceptual framework for common property protected areas (CPPA). A case study of a communally owned forest reserve in Costa Rica shows how the CPPA model identifies various stakeholders and their roles, rights and responsibilities. We argue that landscapes under common property governance can extend and link protected areas across a mosaic of property types without sacrificing the wellbeing of local residents.";"Kitamura, Kenji

City planners usually demand thermal maps with a resolution below 50m. The required input data for the statistical models were meteorological data at high resolution as well as land use and land cover data including morphological data. Meteorological data were obtained through car traverses on a measuring campaign on hot summer days in July 2014. The chosen statistical approaches of stepwise multiple linear regression and artificial neural network were compared for the case study area Stuttgart, Germany. The Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) was applied to analyse the human thermal conditions taking into account both the meteorological environment and the thermo-physiological parameters including the human energy balance. The polycentric and complex spatial distribution of heat stress and heat load is clearly visible in the created maps. One hot spot is the city centre and its surrounding residential neighbourhood, the other hot spot can be detected in Bad Cannstatt (easterly of the Neckar river valley), including industrial and residential areas. Thereby, the non-linear artificial neural network model delivers better results than the stepwise multiple linear regression model. Advantages of the artificial neural network arise from the possibility to reveal non-linear dependencies and interactions between the variables resulting in a better model fit.";"Ketterer, Christine

We show that agricultural firms can obtain positive externalities from locating in close proximity to other agricultural firms, leading to agglomeration economies. Agglomeration economies lead to high levels of competition and diversity within a local agricultural supply chain and influence local prices, information flows, and private enforcement of environmental institutions. We use the theory of agglomeration economies to understand the development of soybean production in two counties along the Santarém-Cuiaba (BR-163) highway in the Brazilian Amazon: Santarém, Pará and Sorriso, Mato Grosso. We conclude that differences in environmental and land tenure institutions influenced the occurrence of agglomeration economies in these two counties, which in turn affected the total factor productivity of soy in each region. In particular, the supply chain became extremely competitive and diverse in Sorriso where few environmental regulations existed, while environmental restrictions reduced the diversification of the supply chain in Santarém. The presence of a soy agglomeration economy in Sorriso spurred innovation, increased productivity, and led to extremely rapid soy expansion in that county, while the monopolistic supply chain in Santarém reduced producers’ access to land and capital and impeded soy expansion.";"Garrett, Rachael D.

While the relationships of roads, accessibility and land cover are well-understood, they have rarely been considered across borders in national frontier regions. We therefore pursue an analysis of infrastructure connectivity and land cover change in the tri-national frontier of the southwestern Amazon where Bolivia, Brazil and Peru meet, and where the Inter-Oceanic Highway has recently been paved. We integrate satellite, survey, climate and other data for a sample of rural communities that differ in terms of highway paving across the tri-national frontier. We employ a suite of explanatory variables tied to road paving and other factors that vary both across and within the three sides of the frontier in order to model their importance for deforestation. A multivariate analysis of non-forest land cover during 2005–2010 confirms the importance of paving status and travel times, as well as land tenure and other factors. These findings indicate that integration affects land cover, but does not eliminate the effects of other factors that vary across the frontier, which bears implications for the study of globalization, trans-boundary infrastructure, environmental governance and land cover change.";"Perz, Stephen G.

"AGRIS:FR2016206468";"Un modèle multi-agents pour étudier les politiques d’affectation des terres et leurs impacts sur les dynamiques pastorales et territoriales au Ferlo (Sénégal)";"";"The present state of the landscapes and territories in the Sahel is the result of interactions between climatic, economic, social and political factors which have been taking place for more than four decades. In the north of Senegal, the Ferlo geographical space is representative of cohabitation between sylvopastoral and agricultural production systems, within which the pastoral activity is maintained under conflictual conditions as traditional complementarities between agricultural and pastoral production systems, or between pastors and communities, tend to deteriorate under land pressure. Such pressure operates for a variety of often divergent goals displaying tangible transformation indicators with social economic and environmental conversion such as illegal land access plurality, disputes and trouble in land allocation, landscape fragmentation and agricultural territory and pastoral restructuring. It is also within this framework that territory decentralisation and development policies have transferred to stakeholders the power to administer, exploit and manage natural resources and lands under their jurisdiction so as to strengthen local governance and respond to sustainable development needs of production systems. The experiment shown in this case study deals with the process of co-building and setting up tools and simulation models in order to accompany and instruct decision making by local communities responsible for applying the law 64-46 of 06 June 1964. The different steps of this participative approach leading to the “AIDA” agent model design and scenarios have been put forward, tested and evaluated by the users.

L’état actuel des paysages et des territoires sahéliens est la résultante d’interactions entre facteurs écoclimatiques, socio-économiques et politiques, à l’oeuvre depuis plus de quatre décennies. Au nord du Sénégal, l’espace géographique du Ferlo est représentatif d’une cohabitation entre des systèmes de production agrosylvopastoraux dans laquelle l’activité pastorale se maintient en compétition avec les autres, car les complémentarités anciennes entre systèmes de production agricoles et pastoraux, ou entre pasteurs et collectivite ´, tendent à se dégrader sous la pression foncière. Ces forces de pression aux intérêts quelques fois divergents ont comme indicateurs de transformation tangibles : la conversion socio-économique et environnementale ; la pluralité des modes d’accès à la terre en dehors du cadre légal ; les litiges et difficultés dans l’affectation des terres ; la fragmentation des paysages ; la restructuration agricole et pastorale des territoires. C’est aussi dans ce contexte que les politiques de décentralisation et d’aménagement du territoire ont transféré aux collectivités territoriales le pouvoir d’administrer, d’exploiter et de gérer les ressources naturelles et le foncier, afin de renforcer la gouvernance locale et de répondre aux enjeux de développement durable des systèmes de production. L’expé- rience présentée ici traite du processus de coconstruction et de mise en oeuvre d’un outil de simulation pour accompagner et instruire les prises de décision des collectivités locales chargées de l’application de la loi sur le domaine national. Les différentes étapes de cette démarche participative qui ont conduit à la conception, au test et à l’évaluation par les utilisateurs du modèle AIDA et de ses scénarios sont présentées.";"Bah, Alassane

By using a Fractional Multinomial Logit model, we find that climate variables are affecting the allocation of land use by reducing crop land and increasing pasture land. Our projections indicate that more cropping land would be altered to livestock land under climate change. In addition, cattle stocking rate could increase by the end of this century along with more pasture land or less cattle inventory because of higher temperature.

We characterize equilibrium spatial patterns of externality-generating and -receiving land uses on a two-dimensional lattice with noncooperative, profit-maximizing producers. In equilibrium, generators or recipients form one or more neighborhoods with certain geometric properties, depending on how an externality dissipates with distance and whether there is an externality generated outside the region's boundaries. Efficient land-use arrangements maximize social welfare subject to the implementability constraints stipulating that no farm-level activity, except for land use, can be directly controlled by the social planner. We characterize efficient land-use arrangements when the return to recipient land use decreases linearly with the length of the border shared with incompatible land uses. Under these assumptions, we find circumstances in which an efficient activity arrangement belongs to the set of the Nash equilibrium outcomes.

Currently, reintroduction of fire into sagebrush steppe systems may be desirable, but long-term fire effects are not well-known. In this 15-year study we used a generalized linear mixed modeling approach to analyze the response of native and invasive grass species to fire in an Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis (Wyoming big sagebrush) community in north-central Oregon, United States. This study examined responses of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass), and Poa secunda (Sandberg bluegrass) along gradients of community type and topography through time post fire. Community types were identified as either A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis dominant (brush plots) or Juniperus occidentalis (western juniper) dominant (woodland plots). Cover of B. tectorum was greatest in brush plots. B. tectorum cover increased significantly 5 yr post burn and stabilized. At 5 yr, postburn cover of B. tectorum was 135% in brush and 301% in woodland plots of preburn cover. P. spicata was more abundant in woodland plots than in brush plots. In woodland plots, P. spicata cover decreased by 49% 1 yr post burn but returned to preburn cover by 5 yr post burn. On northern exposures recovery of P. spicata cover occurred between 1 and 2 yr post burn, whereas on southern exposures recovery occurred between 2 and 5 yr post burn. The cover of P. secunda did not show a significant response to fire. These results suggest the importance of topography and plant community in determining postfire community response and underscores the importance of place-based studies to guide management and conservation actions.";"Reed-Dustin, Claire M.

"AGRIS:US201301616903";"Balancing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of agro-ecosystems: An integrated modeling approach";"";"There is an increasing need to view agro-ecosystems and to identify remedial management practices in a holistic way. An integrated model based on the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response approach was developed as a tool to assess the effects of policies for improving decision making for the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. An economic model was linked to a process-based biophysical model by a meta-model. Then, a holistic indicator-based impact assessment system was linked to the integrated model to assess policy instruments. The integrated model was applied in the intensive irrigated wheat-maize cropping system of the North China Plain in which water and nitrogen fertilizer management are known to be critical issues for sustainable resource management. The results show there is a trade-off relationship between economic return and environmental outcome. It was shown that water pricing is a more effective policy instrument for improving the sustainability of agro-ecosystem than increasing the price of nitrogen fertilizer. When the water price is raised to 1.0Yuan/m³ under a two-tariff system, the sustainability indicators for the irrigation water use efficiency was found to increase from 0.37 to 0.77, groundwater use sustainability increased from 0.05 to 0.60, nitrate leaching increased from 0.48 to 0.55 while the indicators for the farm gross margin, food self-sufficiency, and soil nitrogen balance remain unchanged. The results suggest the modeling approach developed here is very useful for evaluating policy options for complex natural resource management issues.";"Wei, Yongping

The main arguments in favour of a more critical view of the results of land privatisation and farm restructuring are that a) private farmers produce only on a minimal fraction of land with almost no machinery or purchased inputs at all, b) the income of a typical farm household is below a poverty line based on national standards, c) private farmers face substantial production and marketing risks, d) at present, it is unlikely that short- or long-term investment projects in agriculture can be credit funded. Currently, peasant farms are mainly run to produce a minimum diet for the affiliated household. The situation thus gives little reason for rosy future
perspectives concerning a market-oriented, commercial private agriculture.";"Petrick, Martin";"";"";"AGRIS";"2000-12-31";"en";"land reform;poverty;land economics";"";"";"MDA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012201386";"http://purl.umn.edu/14882";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400065079";"Native maize landraces from Los Tuxtlas, Mexico show varying mycorrhizal dependency for P uptake";"";"Different degrees of dependency on the activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) exist between native maize landraces and hybrids. In Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, the Popoluca people maintain a traditional polycultural land management with more than 15 native landraces of maize; however, it is not known whether the recent substitution of local maize for improved hybrids and fertilization has affected the integrity of the mycorrhizal symbiosis in these naturally phosphorus-poor systems. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the response of four Popoluca maize landraces and the hybrid Texcoco to the presence of native AMF in conditions of low and medium P input (5 and 65� mg� kg⁻¹, respectively). After 120� days in both P treatments, the native landraces Black and Yellow presented higher colonization and had acquired more P in their shoot biomass than the hybrid. The moderate fertilization did not appear to have affected the integrity of the mycorrhizal symbiosis, since all of the maize types presented a positive mycorrhizal dependency (2–14� %). Under low P conditions, the Texcoco hybrid maize presented one of the highest mycorrhizal dependencies; however, unlike the local landraces, this was not reflected in a higher tissue P concentration. The results obtained indicate that the native maize Black was the best at capturing symbiotic and direct P, which makes this landrace an important genetic and cultural heritage for the Popoluca and for the world.";"Sangabriel-Conde, Wendy

Land management and use can greatly impact windblown dust, thus, models such as the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) are important for identifying management practices that reduce the emission of dust. The objective of this study was to test the performance of the WEPS erosion submodel (the Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program (SWEEP)) under contrasting agricultural land use types in the Tarim Basin of northwest China. Wind erosion of a sandy soil was measured and simulated in a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) field and red date (Ziziphus jujube L.) orchard during the spring of 2012 and 2013. The SWEEP did not simulate differences in soil loss for contrasting agricultural land use types, although measured soil loss was typically smaller than that considered to be of consequence (>100 gm-2) in the original design of the SWEEP. In fact, the model simulated no erosion for all six high wind events in which we observed erosion in the cotton field and red date orchard. The insensitivity of SWEEP to simulate erosion was caused by the simulated friction velocity being consistently lower than the threshold friction velocity for the loss soil at the cotton field and red date orchard. Because SWEEP is being used to assess wind erodibility of lands and simulate regional air quality in China, SWEEP must be improved for application to lands that emit large and small amounts of windblown dust.";"Pi, Huawei

In South Africa, notwithstanding the strides that have been made to foster equitable land ownership, land reform policies have been unsuccessful in delivering land to the poor majority. Due to the nature of agriculture as a source of food production and national security, and the lack of farming skills and related competencies’ equilibrium, programmes intended to deliver land to black people have been inadequate in their reach. Whereas policy has emphasised the urgency of solving equity issues in land ownership, equally challenging has been finding the right set of programmes to achieve this without triggering a perennial land ownership squabble. After 18 years of democracy, a need remains to find a balance between continuity in food production and equitable redistribution of land in South African agriculture. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to achieve equitable and fair redistribution of land without inhibiting agricultural production, through land sharing. We show that sharing land could help fast-track the development of a farming skills and related competencies’ equilibrium between black and white farmers. The paper further demonstrates that the gains in land sharing far outweigh other programmes of land reform that have been used and suggested thus far.";"Dlamini, Thula S.

This situation has been aggravated by heavy precipitation from typhoons in the summertime. The results include serious soil erosion and mass movement in the Shih-men Reservoir watershed. In order to identify the most fragile areas and seek the triggering factors of landslide changes that can cause turbid currents in the Shih-men Reservoir watershed, this study integrates different types of satellite imagery and geographic information system data to determine changes in land cover and vegetation cover since the early 1970s. Results from spatial regression models indicate road and land uses are the main factors that lead to slope failure along roads and contribute to a large number of landslides in environmental hotspots like the Baishih River sub-watershed. Soil erosion estimates indicate a positive relationship between the increases in landslide and soil loss areas and the road system development. Therefore, human development has a significant negative influence both on sensitive mountainous watersheds and on critical environmental hotspots.";"Chen, Ying-Jung

Since the 1980s, the region has experienced severe forest fires, which have had serious consequences for the local ecosystem in terms of land degradation processes and changes in the hydrological cycle. In an attempt to reverse this situation, agroforestry programmes and aid schemes have been introduced to improve land management practices and increase the forest area and stabilize soil. However, evaluations of the environmental, economic and social impacts of these schemes have been limited. This paper considers the effectiveness of agroforestry programmes from the perspectives of farmers in the area, as revealed by a detailed survey of land users' perceptions of these measures. The paper also reflects on the implications for current and future policy. The results suggest that present assistance regimes may be insufficient to ensure adequate forest management in the future. A new approach to forest management is proposed involving greater cooperation among local farmers, diversification of species in new afforestation and the establishment of demonstration projects.";"Carvalho, T.M.M.

To prevent deleterious processes induced by fire, several policies and strategies have been implemented at national and regional scales. We perform a comparative study of policies and strategies of Portuguese and Spanish (Comunitat Valenciana) cases in order to assess the differences between them and identify their roles in forest fire prevention and in combating and mitigating impacts. To this end, we analyse the sustainability objectives stated in the legislation of each country to identify the strategies used to deal with forest fires and the extent to which they are integrated to achieve the sustainability objectives they pursue. The comparative analysis includes an assessment of sustainability, evaluated by the explicitness of the objectives, and identification of how the lines of action contribute to reach these objectives. We found different levels of complexity and that the adoption or rejection of some of the techniques is closely related to the tradition and the experience of local communities. This analysis highlights the importance of local characteristics and the stakeholders, involvement in designing effective strategies to reduce fire risk.

"AGRIS:US201400064702";"Dealing with soil variability: some insights from land degradation research in central Spain";"";"Soil variability is often seen as problematic in land degradation studies in terms of sampling effort, data interpretation and for the extrapolation of results to other areas or time periods. Examples are given from land degradation research undertaken in central Spain which demonstrate some of these problems associated with soil variability. Geostatistics is presented as a useful tool for quantifying soil variability and in particular the variogram for interpreting and understanding spatial patterns. Soil variability is also seen to complicate the issues surrounding management strategies and makes monospecific management strategies less likely to be successful. In recent years several studies have suggested that variability in soil properties and vegetation cover may reduce the risk of land degradation by minimizing the spatial extent of runoff and erosion. These studies suggest that increasing soil variability may prove to be an effective strategy for reducing the runoff and erosion risk. This paper discusses these ideas and highlights the importance of increasing thresholds above which runoff and erosion occurs for the success of such strategies. This in particular applies to many semiarid environments where thresholds are deemed to be extremely low. Finally, these concepts are placed in the context of scale where soil variability may be viewed as existing at a multitude of nested levels varying from the micro- to the macro-scale.";"Fitzjohn, C.

The landlord's enforcement ability is also shown to increase the optimal level of effort. The empirical findings support the hypothesis that female heads of households have higher tenant turnover and lower enforcement ability.

Desertification and soil degradation are severe problems in the region. The problem of drought stress is exacerbated by low and erratic rainfall and soils of limited available water holding capacity and soil organic carbon (SOC) content of less than 0.5 per cent. The SOC pool of most soils has been depleted by soil degradation and widespread use of subsistence and exploitative farming systems. The historic loss of a SOC pool for the soils of the WANA region may be 6–12 Pg compared with the global loss of 66–90 Pg. Assuming that 60 per cent of the historic loss can be resequestered, the total soil-C sink capacity of the WANA region may be 3–7 Pg. This potential may be realized through adoption of measures to control desertification, restore degraded soils and ecosystems, and improve soil and crop management techniques that can enhance the SOC pool and improve soil quality. The strategies of soil-C sequestration include integrated nutrient management (INM) and recycling, controlled grazing, and growing improved fodder species on rangeland. Improved technologies for cropland include use of INM and biofertilizers, appropriate tillage methods and residue management techniques, crop rotations and cover crops, and water and nutrient recycling technologies.

For permanent crops, which are of great importance economically and environmentally, it becomes even more challenging mainly due to the varying statistics of orchards such as the existence of different orchard types, different crown sizes even for the same type, different distances between orchards among various fields and overlapping crowns. This challenge necessitates the utilization of both spectral values and spatial relations of pixels. To accurately determine the fields of permanent crops, hazelnuts in particular, a classification system with hybrid learning, which merges an image features map (IFM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ), is proposed in this study. IFM is a variant of a self-organizing map (an unsupervised neural learning paradigm successfully used in many applications of remote-sensing imagery), which exploits both spectral and spatial information without additional computation of texture. LVQ, however, is supervised learning for fine-tuning of class boundaries. Experimental results on finding hazelnut fields using multispectral QuickBird imagery indicate that the proposed method achieves acceptable accuracies and often produces more accurate extraction than the accuracies obtained based only on spectral or on spatial information.";"Taşdemir, Kadim";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400155184";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.682659";"";"";"";"6239-6253"

A total of 54 969 MODIS pixels and co-located FIA plots were analysed to validate MODIS GPP estimates. We used a data resolution of individual MODIS pixels and co-located FIA plots, and used detailed pixel- and plot-specific attributes by applying screening variables (SVs) to assess conditions under which MODIS GPP was most strongly validated. Eight SVs were used to test six hypotheses about the conditions under which MODIS GPP would be most strongly validated. The six hypotheses addressed were (1) MODIS pixel quality checks, (2) FIA plot quality checks, (3) land-cover classification comparability of co-located MODIS pixels and FIA plots, (4) FIA plot homogeneity, (5) FIA plot tree density and (6) MODIS seasonal variation. SVs were assessed in terms of trade-off between improved relations and reduced number of samples. MODIS seasonal variation and FIA plot tree density were the two most efficient SVs, followed by basic quality checks for each data set. Sequential application of SVs indicated that combined usage of five of the eight SVs provided an efficient data set of 17 090 co-located MODIS pixels and FIA plots, which raised the Pearson correlation coefficient from 0.01 for the Complete data set of 54 969 plots to 0.48 for this screened subset of 17 090 plots. The screened subset of plots exhibited good representation of the Complete data set in terms of species abundance, plot distribution and mean productivity.

It is important to ensure the sustainability of these and other land uses and to quantify the net impacts that certain management practices have on the environment. Although other quality crop classification products are often available, temporal and spatial coverage gaps can create complications for certain regional or time-specific applications. Our goal was to develop a model capable of classifying major crops in the Greater Platte River Basin (GPRB) for the post-2000 era to supplement existing crop classification products. This study identifies annual spatial distributions and area totals of corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops across the GPRB from 2000 to 2009. We developed a regression tree classification model based on 2.5 million training data points derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) in relation to a variety of other relevant input environmental variables. The primary input variables included the weekly 250 m US Geological Survey Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized differential vegetation index, average long-term growing season temperature, average long-term growing season precipitation and yearly start of growing season. An overall model accuracy rating of 78% was achieved for a test sample of roughly 215 000 independent points that were withheld from model training. Ten 250 m resolution annual crop classification maps were produced and evaluated for the GPRB region, one for each year from 2000 to 2009. In addition to the model accuracy assessment, our validation focused on spatial distribution and county-level crop area totals in comparison with the NASS CDL and county statistics from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Census of Agriculture. The results showed that our model produced crop classification maps that closely resembled the spatial distribution trends observed in the NASS CDL and exhibited a close linear agreement with county-by-county crop area totals from USDA census data (R² = 0.90).";"Howard, Daniel M.

"AGRIS:US2016203230";"The Economic Potential of Second-Generation Biofuels: Implications for Social Welfare, Land Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Illinois";"";"This paper develops a dynamic micro-economic land use model that maximizes social welfare and internalizes externality from greenhouse gas emissions to obtain the optimal land use allocation for traditional row crops and bioenergy crops (corn stover, miscanthus and switchgrass), the mix of cellulosic feedstocks and fuel and food prices. We use this carbon tax policy as a benchmark to compare the implications of existing biofuel policies on land use, social welfare and the environment for the 2007-2022 period. The model is operationalized using yields of perennial grasses obtained from a biophysical model, county level data on yields of traditional row crops and production costs for row crops and bioenergy crops in Illinois. We show that a carbon tax policy that is directly related to carbon intensity of fuels can generate the highest social welfare among alternative policy scenarios. The existing ethanol tax credits result in substantial deadweight losses and higher GHG emissions as compared to the baseline. Ethanol blending mandates with subsidies lead to further welfare losses and higher GHG emissions. To meet advanced biofuel blending mandates, corn stover and miscanthus are used but the mix of viable cellulosic feedstocks varies spatially and temporally. Corn stover is viable mainly in central and northern Illinois while miscanthus acres are primarily concentrated on southern Illinois. The blending mandates lead to a significant shift in acreage from soybeans and pasture to corn and a change in crop rotation and tillage practices.";"Chen, Xiaoguang

"AGRIS:US201500008336";"Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis Approach for Locating Suitable Sites for Construction of Subsurface Dams in Northern Pakistan";"";"Pakistan is an agricultural country with an increasing interest for hydropower. Water management problems such as sedimentation and evaporation have been of high concern for surface water reservoirs for many years. Therefore, groundwater storage through subsurface dams could be promising, especially considering the monsoon rainfall and seasonal river flows in Pakistan. The paper aims to develop and test a methodology to locate suitable sites for construction of subsurface dams using spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA) in the northern parts of Pakistan. For the study, spatial data on geology, slope, land cover, soil depth and topographic wetness index (TWI) was used. Two weighting techniques, i.e. the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the factor interaction method (FIM), were employed and compared. The sensitivity of the two methods as well as of the model parameters was analysed. The suitability map derived from AHP yielded about 3 % (16 km²) of the total area as most suitable, about 4 % (22 km²) as moderately suitable and about 0.8 % (5 km²) as least suitable. The suitability map derived from FIM identified about 2.7 % (14 km²) of the total area as most suitable, about 4 % (22 km²) as moderately suitable and about 1 % (7 km²) as least suitable. The sensitivity analyses suggested that AHP was a more robust weighting technique than FIM and that land cover was the most sensitive factor. The methodology presented here shows promising results and could be used in early planning to locate suitable sites for construction of subsurface dams.";"Jamali, Imran Ali

"AGRIS:US2016222118";"Modelling Land Use in Rural New Zealand";"";"Regional Councils are primarily responsible for environmental management, as specified in the Resource Management Act (RMA), 1991. The Local Government Act 2002 has an integrative component, requiring consideration of social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of their communities. These two Acts are interesting, as their combination is shaping new governance structures within New Zealand. Different types of policy instruments are available to Regional Councils while carrying out their functions: regulatory, economic and voluntary. The 1990s are characterized by ‘first generation Plans’ of the RMA, which were highly rule focused. In the 2000s a marked shift occurred, mainstreaming ‘community’ and participative approaches to policy. This increased levels of trust between communities and the Regional Councils, and can be seen as building blocks in the formation of social capital. Where rules were not achieving particular policy objectives, interesting new hybrid forms of governance emerged.This paper looks at these newly-formed partnership approaches in New Zealand. The paper traces the emergence of partnerships as a collective form of action, and analyses them from an economic governance perspective. In so doing, the fundamental role of social capital is explained, as a rational economic concept. Regional Councils are centrally placed to anchor partnerships and strengthen their formation, hence strengthening social networks within the regions. The issue of riparian management is explored as a case study to inform how this could occur.";"Olssen, Alex

"AGRIS:US2016211858";"A Race to Develop: A Competing Risk Examination of the Pattern and Timing of Land Development in an Exurban County";"";"Rural-urban fringe counties (i.e. counties adjacent to other counties with large and growing urban centers) often experience intense development pressure as a result of urban growth and expansion. While growth-initiated development can take many forms, the majority of the development that occurs in these exurban counties is in the form of single-family residential dwellings. Moreover, it is in the form of subdivision developments that range in size from very small two and three lot minor subdivisions to massive multi-phase major subdivisions with hundreds of lots and numerous amenities. In this paper, we focus on the land development patterns in Carroll County, MD, an urban-fringe county in the Baltimore-Washington D.C. metro region. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether a basic set of factors, both constant and time-dependent and acting at different spatial scales, can explain the timing and location of major versus minor subdivision developments in Carroll County. Using a micro-level panel of land parcel conversion, historical land records for subdivision development and ArcGIS software a new dataset was created that traces the entire history of the subdivision process in the county. Datasets were also created that trace the history of land preservation so that we could control for official open space and its interaction with the decision to subdivide through time. Using these data and a number of land use variables created from them from 1993-2007, we apply a competing risks duration model to analyze which factors affect major versus minor subdivision development. Visual inspection as well as a descriptive analysis of a series of landscape metrics based on distance from the metropolitan center reveals a different pattern outcome for small versus large subdivisions with larger developments following more closely to the predictions of the urban economic model. Empirically, we find further evidence that the factors affecting the timing of minor versus major subdivision developments are indeed different. Distance and access to road networks have less of an effect on minor over major developments, while surrounding preservation and the option to preserve have less of an effect on major subdivisions. To make the risk comparison relevant and to focus on areas that have experienced the most fragmentation as a result of residential land conversion as well as the most policy attention, we restrict our analysis to parcels located in minimum density zoning districts.";"Wrenn, Douglas H.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016211858";"http://purl.umn.edu/62012";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201500223900";"Relationship between Riparian Vegetation and Stream Benthic Communities at Three Spatial Scales";"";"We examined the influence of riparian vegetation on macroinvertebrate community structure in streams of the Upper Thames River watershed in southwestern Ontario. Thirty-three μ-basins (129–1458 ha) were used to identify land cover variables that influenced stream macroinvertebrates. Micro-basins represented the entire drainage area of study streams and were similar in stream order (first, second) and land cover (agricultural or forest; no urban). We described the structure and composition of riparian vegetation and benthic macroinvertebrate communities at the outflow reach. The nature of the land cover was quantified for the stream network buffer (30 m) and the whole μ-basin. The objective of this study was to measure the magnitude and nature of the relationship between the riparian vegetation and benthic macroinvertebrate community at the outflow reach, stream network buffer, and whole μ-basin scales. Taxon richness (including total number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa) and Simpson’s diversity of the macroinvertebrate community all increased with increased tree cover in the riparian zone at the outflow reach scale. Simpson’s equitability was lower with greater agricultural land cover in the stream network buffer. No relationship between the macroinvertebrate community and land cover was found at the whole μ-basin scale. Analysis of the influence of land cover on stream communities within a spatial hierarchy is important for understanding the interactions of stream ecosystems with their adjacent landscapes.";"Rios, Sandra L.

Defined in its most generic form as structural constraints that provide regularities, reduce uncertainties and shape people's interactions, institutions create an enabling or controlling environment for specific governing actions and decisions to take place. Over the years, fisheries governance has relied heavily on the creation and evolution of institutions, especially those related to property rights and access rules. A growing body of literature is calling, however, for a broader notion of institutions that can deal with the social, cultural and historical aspects of fisheries, including meanings and values, trust, and norms.

However, there is still much to be learned about this economic instrument. Queensland's state government recently decided to use an auction mechanism to allocate a $12 million incentives program. This was called the Queensland Vegetation Incentives Package (VIP), and was aimed at encouraging better protection and management of high value non-remnant vegetation. The PhD work of the presenting author is using the VIP as a case study to explore the use of auctions for conservation contracts in Queensland. In particular, observing the VIP gives insight into participant behaviour and the impact of the policy formation process on an auction for conservation contracts. The VIP is particularly interesting as this is the first time a tender mechanism is being used in Australia to distribute funds on a state-wide level.

"AGRIS:US201600090551";"Good neighbours: distribution of black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata) in an urban environment";"";"Context Primates are one of the most charismatic and widely studied vertebrate groups. However, the study of new world primates in green patches within urban areas has been neglected. Such primates have been viewed as a source of human–animal conflict; however, their ecological importance to urban ecosystems and their role in human well being is poorly understood. Aims To increase understanding of both ecological and socioeconomical factors affecting the distribution, density and group sizes of urban marmosets in a large Brazilian city (Belo Horizonte). Methods A map of vegetation cover and land use was produced and employed to investigate the distribution of marmosets. An online questionnaire was extensively publicised, which permitted the public to report the occurrence or not of marmosets near their residences. For sites with low salary levels and low internet availability, face-to-face interviews were conducted. Additionally, field surveys were conducted in 120 green areas identified by spatial analysis as potential areas of occurrence. The human population density, salary levels and green areas were posteriorly correlated with marmoset distribution. Key results Despite the urbanisation and high human population density, green fragments within the city still housed marmoset groups. However, the presence of green areas did not always indicate primate presence. Group presence was significantly related to the size of parks or green areas and negatively related to built-up areas, and human density. Salary levels were related to more forested streets and possibly tolerance. Marmosets were classified as urban utilisers. Conclusions The human–wildlife conflict with marmoset species was relatively low, owing to marmoset avoidance of built-up areas. The interaction of marmoset species and city dwellers was mainly limited to borders of forest fragments and inside city parks, and appeared to be human motivated. Implications This study showed the importance of public involvement in wildlife studies in urban environments; clarifying the interaction between city dwellers and wild species is essential to mitigate negative interactions.";"Teixeira, Bruno

"AGRIS:US201600090557";"Evaluating patterns of human–reptile conflicts in an urban environment";"";"Context Reptiles, especially snakes, can cause a fear reaction in the public and are, therefore, a good model to examine human–wildlife conflicts. Human city dwellers often respond to the presence of snakes or other reptiles by calling out the responsible agency for animal control, which has to mediate the situation. Aims To determine how the temporal and spatial occurrence of human–reptile conflicts were associated with environmental conditions and socio-economic factors in a large Brazilian city (Belo Horizonte). Methods The callout reports of the Environmental Police of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, over a 7-year period from 2002 to 2008 to mediate reptile conflicts were analysed. Densities of callouts were determined by kernel-density estimator and matched with the vegetation cover and land use, to determine how the environment affected reptile callout distribution. The study area was divided into nine regions with different socio-economic and demographic characteristics to evaluate the possible effects of human factors in the conflict. Key results Reptile callouts were almost exclusively about snakes or freshwater turtles, despite a large population of wild lizards. In general, the difference in callout distribution of snakes and freshwater turtles was the result of different attitudes from city dwellers on the basis of socio-economic characteristics. Snakes were less frequent as urbanisation increased, whereas freshwater turtles were associated with water or open areas. Significantly, more conflicts occurred during the rainy season. People in areas of high per capita income used the Environmental Police as mediators more often than did those in poorer areas, but callouts were not related to human population density. Conclusions Habitat type and climate were significantly predictive of human–reptile conflicts. Human populations with higher salaries and education levels tended to resolve their conflicts with reptiles using official mediators whether the reptile was venomous or not. Implications The environmental and climatic data show that it is possible to predict when and where human–reptile conflicts are most likely. Thus, official mediators can use this information for targeted education programs. Such education programs should emphasise, at all levels of society, how to deal with such conflicts sensibly, so as to ensure the best outcomes for people and reptiles.";"Teixeira, Camila Palhares

"AGRIS:US201400133155";"European agricultural landscapes, common agricultural policy and ecosystem services: a review";"";"Since the 1950s, intensification and scale enlargement of agriculture have changed agricultural landscapes across Europe. The intensification and scale enlargement of farming was initially driven by the large-scale application of synthetic fertilizers, mechanization and subsidies of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Then, after the 1990s, a further intensification and scale enlargement, and land abandonment in less favored areas was caused by globalization of commodity markets and CAP reforms. The landscape changes during the past six decades have changed the flows and values of ecosystem services. Here, we have reviewed the literature on agricultural policies and management, landscape structure and composition, and the contribution of ecosystem services to regional competitiveness. The objective was to define an analytical framework to determine and assess ecosystem services at the landscape scale. In contrast to natural ecosystems, ecosystem service flows and values in agricultural landscapes are often a result of interactions between agricultural management and ecological structures. We describe how land management by farmers and other land managers relates to landscape structure and composition. We also examine the influence of commodity markets and policies on the behavior of land managers. Additionally, we studied the influence of consumer demand on flows and values of the ecosystem services that originate from the agricultural landscape.";"van Zanten, Boris T.

With nationally‐representative, Living Standards Measurement Survey‐type data for the years 1998, 2001, and 2005, we employ Markov chain methods within an information‐theoretic framework in an attempt to advance the analysis of structural transformation in developing countries beyond the examination of trends in mean farm sizes or Gini coefficients, approaches ill‐suited to the detection of the apparent complexities of structural change. Further, while Markov chain analysis has witnessed relatively widespread application in the investigation of structural transformation in developed nations, we offer a novel methodological extension by allowing for the simultaneous exploration of structural transformation across multiple dimensions–namely, structural change in both the distribution and use of agricultural landholdings—as well as the incorporation of microlevel determinants of farm size and land use change. The results of the inquiry, above all, suggest that Nicaragua's agricultural and livestock sector is characterized by a definitive persistence of smallholders. While a moderate tendency toward bifurcation in the distribution of landholdings would appear to obscure any immediate relationship between operational landholdings and land productivity, we contend that such trends are, in fact, consistent with the often observed inverse farm size‐productivity relationship.";"Henderson, Heath";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"NIC";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400189346";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.12098";"";"";"";"443-458"

Despite much research has been reportedly done at local and regional scales, little has been reported on the trajectories, patterns, and drivers of these two intertwining processes at the national level. This is mainly due to the fact that until recently, high resolution spatial data of land use and land cover change were not available at national level. The research reported in this paper aimed to fill this knowledge gap. Employing the China Land Use/Cover Dataset (CLUD), a national land use/cover change database our research team developed over the past decade, we analyzed the two intertwining processes at a 5 year interval from 1990 to 2010 to identify their trajectories, spatiotemporal patterns, and driving forces. Among out key findings are that (1) the nation's urban and industrial land areas increased from 4.85Ã104km2 in 1990 to 9.08Ã104km2 in 2010; (2) compared to those in the 1990s, the expansion rates of urban land and industrial land in the 2000s were respectively 2.15 and 5.79 times higher; (3) the expansion rates varied significantly across regions, revealing a distinctive spatial pattern with coastal regions being the fastest and the northeastern the slowest; (4) national development strategies and regional land-use policies had prominent impacts on land expansions; while (5) socioeconomic factors along with local and regional land-use policies explained the regional variations.";"Kuang, Wenhui

These challenges are identified underlining that these activities are often important and well present in countries with low incomes or in less favored areas. Although they are often low input production systems with lower environmental impacts, they face desertification and less water availability, genetic erosion, soil degradation and degradation of rangelands, competitions for land use. The needs of policy on more research, education, micro credits, organization and extension are enhanced. A global review of publications in the main scientific journals shows that relatively few works are still dedicated to marketing, Economic development, management and productions systems. The main subjects related to these challenges are the control of emergent diseases and parasites, the improvement of nutrition in harsh conditions, the genetic characterization of local breeds. But these results confirm that most articles have few links with the demand for innovation. The several journals in social science publish relatively few works on these livestock activities. To face these challenges, the discussion proposes new forms of governance in which priority is given to the participation of all stakeholders and the confrontation between local and scientific knowledge. This would have consequences on educational programs and training. The awareness of the public powers on these questions has to be improved by a coordinated and argued active communication.

Our objectives were to (1) review legislation that affects airports and surrounding communities relative to managing and reducing wildlife hazards to aviation; (2) identify information gaps and future research needs relative to regulated land uses on and near airports, and the effects on wildlife populations; and (3) demonstrate how information regarding wildlife responses to land-use practices can be incorporated into wildlife-strike risk assessments.We showthat guidelines for land-use practices on and near airports with regard to wildlife hazards to aviation can be vague, conflicting, and scientifically ill-supported. We discuss research needs with regard to management of stormwater runoff; wildlife use of agricultural crops and tillage regimens relative to revenue and safety; the role of an airport in the landscape matrix with regard to its effects on wildlife species richness and abundance; and spatial and temporal requirements of wildlife species that use airports, relative to implementing current and novel management techniques. We also encourage the development and maintenance of datasets that will allow realistic assessment of wildlife-strike risk relative to current airport conditions and anticipated changes to capacity. Land uses at airports influence wildlife populations, and understanding and incorporting these effects into planning will reduce risks posed to both aviation safety and wildlife species.";"Blackwell, Bradley F.

"AGRIS:US2016208976";"THE SUBSIDY FOR ADOPTING CONSERVATION TILLAGE: ESTIMATION FROM OBSERVED BEHAVIOR";"";"Due to payoff uncertainties combined with risk aversion and/or real options, farmers may demand a premium in order to adopt conservation tillage practices, over and above the compensation for the expected profit losses (if any). We propose a method of directly estimating the financial incentives for adopting conservation tillage and distinguishing between the expected payoff and the premium of adoption based on observed behavior. We find that the premium may play a significant role in farmers' adoption decisions. Even for non-adopters, conservation tillage provides a higher payoff than does conventional tillage on average, as agronomists have argued. However, non-adopters do not use conservation tillage because the expected profit gain alone does not fully compensate them for the uncertainties. To induce additional adoption, subsidies could be used. We find that in Iowa on average, the mean subsidy needed is $2.40 per acre per year for corn and $3.50 per acre per year for soybeans.";"Kurkalova, Lyubov A.

"AGRIS:US201600003886";"Monitoring of Livestock Grazing Effects on Bureau of Land Management Land";"";"Public land management agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), are charged with managing rangelands throughout the western United States for multiple uses, such as livestock grazing and conservation of sensitive species and their habitats. Monitoring of condition and trends of these rangelands, particularly with respect to effects of livestock grazing, provides critical information for effective management of these multiuse landscapes. We therefore investigated the availability of livestock grazing-related quantitative monitoring data and qualitative region-specific Land Health Standards (LHS) data across BLM grazing allotments in the western United States. We then queried university and federal rangeland science experts about how best to prioritize rangeland monitoring activities. We found that the most commonly available monitoring data were permittee-reported livestock numbers and season-of-use data (71% of allotments) followed by repeat photo points (58%), estimates of forage utilization (52%), and, finally, quantitative vegetation measurements (37%). Of the 57% of allotments in which LHS had been evaluated as of 2007, the BLM indicated 15% had failed to meet LHS due to livestock grazing. A full complement of all types of monitoring data, however, existed for only 27% of those 15%. Our data inspections, as well as conversations with rangeland experts, indicated a need for greater emphasis on collection of grazing-related monitoring data, particularly ground cover. Prioritization of where monitoring activities should be focused, along with creation of regional monitoring teams, may help improve monitoring. Overall, increased emphasis on monitoring of BLM rangelands will require commitment at multiple institutional levels.";"Veblen, Kari E.

The pollination services these bees provide can be vital in maintaining the diverse, and often endemic, dune flora. These dune environments, however, are threatened by intense off-highway vehicle (OHV) use. Conservation efforts adopted by land managers often consist of setting aside a portion of a dune system that is off-limits to OHV use, but little work has been done showing the extent to which this protects native bee communities. A two-year study of bee communities on a Great Basin sand dune complex in Dugway Proving Ground located in northwestern Utah revealed low similarity index values between closely situated collecting plots (1-40 km apart). Similarity values ranged from 0.13 to 0.70 for species composition, and from 0.07 to 0.57 when similarity was weighted by abundance. Distance between plots had no significant relationship to similarity when richness and abundance were considered. Bee similarity between plots was significantly correlated with floral similarity. These results indicate that dune conservation strategies that preserve “representative” portions of dune systems may be insufficient to protect bees and the pollination services they provide.";"Wilson, J.S.

We examined three methods for quantifying vegetation in 1-ha plots among different plant communities in the northern Great Basin: photography-based grid-point intercept (GPI), line-point intercept (LPI), and point-quarter (PQ). We also evaluated each method for within-plot subsampling adequacy and effort requirements relative to information gain. We found that, for most functional groups, percent cover measurements collected with the use of LPI, GPI, and PQ methods were strongly correlated. These correlations were even stronger when we used data from the upper canopy only (i.e., top “hit” of pin flags) in LPI to estimate cover. PQ was best at quantifying cover of sparse plants such as shrubs in early successional habitats. As cover of a given functional group decreased within plots, the variance of the cover estimate increased substantially, which required more subsamples per plot (i.e., transect lines, quadrats) to achieve reliable precision. For GPI, we found that that six–nine quadrats per hectare were sufficient to characterize the vegetation in most of the plant communities sampled. All three methods reasonably characterized the vegetation in our plots, and each has advantages depending on characteristics of the vegetation, such as cover or heterogeneity, study goals, precision of measurements required, and efficiency needed.";"Pilliod, David S.

NDVI trends were overwhelmingly negative across the grain belt with statistically significant (p[Symbol: see text]0.05) positive trends covering only 1% of the land surface. LCC was dominated by transitions between three classes; cropland, grassland, and a mixed cropland/natural vegetation mosaic. Combining our analyses of NDVI trends and LCC, we found a pattern of agricultural abandonment (cropland to grassland) in the southern range of the grain belt coinciding with statistically significant (p[Symbol: see text]0.05) negative NDVI trends and likely driven by regional drought. In the northern range of the grain belt we found an opposite tendency toward agricultural intensification; in this case, represented by LCC from cropland mosaic to pure cropland, and also associated with statistically significant (p[Symbol: see text]0.05) negative NDVI trends. Relatively small clusters of statistically significant (p[Symbol: see text]0.05) positive NDVI trends corresponding with both localized land abandonment and localized agricultural intensification show that land use decision making is not uniform across the region. Land surface change in the Northern Eurasian grain belt is part of a larger pattern of land cover land use change (LCLUC) in Eastern Europe, Russia, and former territories of the Soviet Union following realignment of socialist land tenure and agricultural markets. Here, we show that a combined analysis of LCC and NDVI trends provides a more complete picture of the complexities of LCLUC in the Northern Eurasian grain belt, involving both broader climatic forcing, and narrower anthropogenic impacts, than might be obtained from either analysis alone.";"Wright, Christopher K.

As PES schemes are being extensively adopted around the world, questions related to their institutional dimensions, as well as the role of different actors and contextual factors in PES initiation, design and implementation, arise. This paper seeks to gain an understanding of these issues by analysing three voluntary incentive schemes currently implemented in Catalonia: land stewardship — a predominantly private PES scheme aimed at enhancing biodiversity, mature forest reserves — a predominantly public scheme for protecting old-growth forest stands, and a hybrid public–private initiative for forest fire protection — forest defence groups. We develop a framework for the institutional analysis of PES extending earlier work on this subject, and we focus on actor and institutional interactions and outcomes that are likely to result from scheme implementation to draw conclusions regarding the factors that influence the success and the durability of these schemes.";"Prokofieva, Irina

FLogA utilizes only publicly available non-proprietary data, software libraries and Web services. It adopts a distributed, open, service oriented architecture that is easy to maintain and extend. Wind, as the most dynamic parameter affecting a wildfire's behavior, can be sampled around a reference direction and speed value reported by the closest METAR station, to generate multiple simulation scenarios. FLogA generates informative interactive geo-animations of simulation results with color representing a fire property of interest, such as the flame length or the forest cells burn probability, while the terrain of the forest in the background may be colored according to a characteristic of the forest (e.g. elevation, land cover, etc). Geo-animations allow the user to “fly-over” any part of the affected terrain as the fire is progressing. In addition, FLogA offers drawing tools for editing the forest's spatial properties (e.g. change fuels, define cleanings zones etc.) to generate alternative “what-if” simulation scenarios. Furthermore, it can be set to automatically monitor any European forest area and trigger fire simulations as soon as “hotspots” are posted on the Internet by satellite services.";"Bogdos, Nikos

"AGRIS:US201500163180";"Issues in using landscape indicators to assess land changes";"";"Landscape indicators, when combined with information about environmental conditions (such as habitat potential, biodiversity, carbon and nutrient cycling, and erosion) and socioeconomic forces, can provide insights about changing ecosystem services. They also provide information about opportunities for improving natural resources management. Landscape indicators rely on data regarding land cover, land management and land functionality. Challenges in using landscape indicators to assess change and effects include (1) measures of land management and attributes that are reliable, robust and consistent for all areas on the Earth do not exist, and thus land cover is more frequently utilized; (2) multiple types of land cover and management are often found within a single landscape and are constantly changing, which complicates measurement and interpretation; and (3) while causal analysis is essential for understanding and interpreting changes in indicator values, the interactions among multiple causes and effects over time make accurate attribution among many drivers of change particularly difficult. Because of the complexity, sheer number of variables, and limitations of empirical data on land changes, models are often used to illustrate and estimate values for landscape indicators, and those models have several problems. Recommendations to improve our ability to assess the effects of changes in land management include refinement of questions to be more consistent with available information and the development of data sets based on systematic measurement over time of spatially explicit land qualities such as carbon and nutrient stocks, water and soil quality, net primary productivity, habitat and biodiversity. Well-defined and consistent land-classification systems that are capable of tracking changes in these and other qualities that matter to society need to be developed and deployed. Because landscapes are so dynamic, it is crucial to develop ways for the scientific community to work together to collect data and develop tools that will enable better analysis of causes and effects and to develop robust management recommendations that will increases land's capacity to meet societal needs in a changing world.";"Dale, Virginia H.

The framework provides an overarching design that can be extended into specific model implementations to evaluate how policy, land-management preferences, and land-market dynamics affect (and are affected by) land-use and land-cover change patterns and subsequent carbon storage and flux. To demonstrate the framework, we implement a simple integration of a new agent-based model of exurban residential development and land-management decisions with the ecosystem process model BIOME-BGC. Using a stylized scenario, we evaluate the influence of different exurban residential-land-management strategies on carbon storage at the parcel level over a 48-year period from 1958 to 2005, simulating stocks of carbon in soil, litter, vegetation, and net primary productivity. Results show 1) residential parcels with management practices that only provided additions in the form of fertilizer and irrigation to turfgrass stored slightly more carbon than parcels that did not include management practices, 2) conducting no land-management strategy stored more carbon than implementing a strategy that included removals in the form of removing coarse woody debris from dense tree cover and litter from turfgrass, and 3) the removal practices modelled had a larger impact on total parcel carbon storage than our modelled additions. The degree of variation within the evaluated land-management practices was approximately 42,104 kg C storage on a 1.62 ha plot after 48 years, demonstrating the substantial effect that residential land-management practices can have on carbon storage.";"Robinson, Derek T.

The demands made by market forces for the export of primary materials have been reasons for land degradation in the big farms, and the need to survive a poverty stricken existence has forced the peasantry to damage the marginal and fragile land they worked. Successive governments did not address these underlying causes of environmental degradation, and even the opportunities afforded by the environment programme that resulted from the 1979 Sandinista revolution, did not result in significant environmental improvements. The paper briefly considers the constraints faced by the Sandinista administration and how the farmer-to-farmer programme (Campesino-a-Campesino) was brought about as a result of the impacts of the Sandinista era. The substantive part of the paper considers PCAC's significance as an agroecological programme and its advantages and limitations for improving peasants' livelihoods via dissemination of land-protective measures. The viability of the programme is assessed by field work carried out examining in detail the case of three communities, and the paper concludes that the gains made in environmental protection and conservation are in jeopardy without structural policy changes. The paper proposes that for the programme to improve its potential, adequate political will, power and organization are necessary to facilitate greater access to secure land tenure among the peasantry.";"Hawkesworth, S.

This study monitored both changes in grassland biomass production and reclamation activities to detect the nature and scale of land degradation since major economic reforms were introduced in 1978. The position of the high-resolution images within the vegetation cycles was inspected from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NDVI images at 10-day repetition and seasonal precipitation patterns. A model was developed to categorize changes in the vegetation signal activity from 30 × 30 m pixels into vegetation cover development and land-use changes between 1987 and 1996. A general increase of biomass production was evident despite the rapid increase in numbers of grazing animals. This increase in biomass was confirmed by the NOAA time series, which also revealed annual variability related to the amount and pattern of the seasonal rains. Rangeland conversion to farmland was detected, and this process has increased the area of cultivation almost fivefold. The classified area of cultivation corresponds with reported statistical records, also showing that irrigation features in virtually 100 per cent of the sown area. Signs of declining biological production, indicating land degradation processes, are few. Biomass production has increased, with a gain in the economic output from both crop and animal production.

An example of such collection is a large land cover map subdivided into a grid of smaller local landscapes, a query is a local landscape of interest, and the task is to find other local landscapes within a map which are perceptually similar to the query. Landscape search and the related task of pattern-based regionalization, requires a measure of similarity â a function which quantifies the level of likeness between two landscapes. The standard approach is to use the Euclidean distance between vectors of landscape metrics derived from the two landscapes, but no in-depth analysis of this approach has been conducted. In this paper we investigate the performance of different implementations of the standard similarity measure. Five different implementations are tested against each other and against a control similarity measure based on histograms of class co-occurrence features and the JensenâShannon divergence. Testing consists of a series of numerical experiments combined with visual assessments on a set of 400 3km-scale landscapes. Based on the cases where visual assessment provides definitive answer, we have determined that the standard similarity measure is sensitive to the way landscape metrics are normalized and, additionally, to whether weights aimed at controlling the relative contribution of landscape composition vs. configuration are used. The standard measure achieves the best performance when metrics are normalized using their extreme values extracted from all possible landscapes, not just the landscapes in the given collection, and when weights are assigned so the combined influence of composition metrics on the similarity value equals the combined influence of configuration metrics. We have also determined that the control similarity measure outperforms all implementations of the standard measure.";"Niesterowicz, Jacek

"AGRIS:US201500185954";"role of vegetation analysis by remote sensing and GIS technology for planning sustainable development: A case study for the Santos estuary drainage basin (Brazil)";"";"The role of vegetation analysis by remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to support plans for sustainable development is discussed through a proposal of an index of ecosystem “integrity” or of regeneration capacity. The index is based on the vegetation “mass” of a given land cover type and the capacity that such mass has to contrast soil erosion. The index is therefore taking into account the effects of human activities and not merely the state of ecosystems in terms of their components. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the proposed index without RS and GIS techniques. These allow, respectively, to collect and to analyze the spatial data at relative low cost and in relatively short times. Time and money are the limiting factors for all the management plans. As an example of application, we have calculated the index for the Santos estuary drainage basin (Brazil) selected as a case study within the ECOMANAGE project funded by European Commission. The area was chosen because of its great economic importance and for relevant environmental problems (industrial pollution and urbanization pressure) that could limit the development. For estimating the relative vegetation mass, we have used the Leaf Area Index, while for the soil erosion, we have used the revised universal soil loss equation model. The maps of ecosystem integrity produced by the application of the index may be very useful to guide the planners in the development of the urbanization process that is threatening the “Mata Atlantica” and the mangrove forests.";"Almeida, P.

"AGRIS:US201500161581";"Elements of regional beetle faunas: faunal variation and compositional breakpoints along climate, land cover and geographical gradients";"";"Regional faunas are structured by historical, spatial and environmental factors. We studied large‐scale variation in four ecologically different beetle groups (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae, Carabidae, Hydrophiloidea, Cerambycidae) along climate, land cover and geographical gradients, examined faunal breakpoints in relation to environmental variables, and investigated the best fit pattern of assemblage variation (i.e. randomness, checkerboards, nestedness, evenly spaced, Gleasonian, Clementsian). We applied statistical methods typically used in the analysis of local ecological communities to provide novel insights into faunal compositional patterns at large spatial grain and geographical extent. We found that spatially structured variation in climate and land cover accounted for most variation in each beetle group in partial redundancy analyses, whereas the individual effect of each explanatory variable group was generally much less important in accounting for variation in provincial species composition. We also found that climate variables were most strongly associated with faunal breakpoints, with temperature‐related variables alone accounting for about 20% of variation at the first node of multivariate regression tree for each beetle group. The existence of faunal breakpoints was also shown by the ‘elements of faunal structure’ analyses, which suggested Clementsian gradients across the provinces, that is, that there were two or more clear groups of species responding similarly to the underlying ecological gradients. The four beetle groups showed highly similar biogeographical patterns across our study area. The fact that temperature was related to faunal breakpoints in the species composition of each beetle group suggests that climate sets a strong filter to the distributions of species at this combination of spatial grain and spatial extent. This finding held true despite the ecological differences among the four beetle groups, ranging from fully aquatic to fully terrestrial and from herbivorous to predaceous species. The existence of Clementsian gradients may be a common phenomenon at large scales, and it is likely to be caused by crossing multiple species pools determined by climatic and historical factors on the distributions of species.";"Heino, Jani

Our research project was aimed at assessing the impact of grazing on dry Puna ecosystem, as understanding and predicting vegetation changes in harsh environments in the face of different disturbance regimes is required for aware and effective management. The study area was the Salinas and Aguada Blanca National Reserve. Two experimental areas were selected, characterized by deep soils with gentle slopes and by shallow soils with steeper slopes. In each area, sites with low and high disturbance regimes were identified, and vegetation was sampled using 10 × 10 m plots. The results indicated that the environmental constraints have a marked influence on the species composition, while disturbance quantitatively affects diversity. The floristic changes observed under different disturbance intensities are mainly related to the functional differentiation of the plant communities and to the decrease in vegetation cover. These processes pose a serious risk to the livelihood of the local people, because they can lead to the loss of biodiversity and economic value of pastures, as well as to soil erosion.";"Catorci, A.

Theproblems of land degradation and low agricultural productivity, which result in foodinsecurity and poverty, are particularly severe in the rural highlands of Ethiopia. Inmany areas, a downward spiral of land degradation and poverty appears to be occurring. Findingsolutions to these problems requires identifying effective entry points for farmers, governments,and civil society organizations, and understanding the potential impacts and tradeoffsthat are likely to arise from alternative interventions. This report seeks to improve thatunderstanding, using a bioeconomic model of land management and agricultural productiondeveloped for a community that is fairly typical of the situation in the Ethiopian highlands.The report assesses the potential impacts of several policy options on small farmers’ landmanagement, productivity, food security, and poverty—including increased access to fertilizercredit, food-for-work programs, other off-farm employment opportunities, and promotion oftree planting on uncultivated land. The authors find that increased use of fertilizer credit couldhelp to increase agricultural productivity, food security, and income, but could underminefarmers’ incentives to invest in soil and water conservation, leading to greater land degradation.Increased employment opportunities through food-for-work or other measures can helpto substantially increase household incomes, but would likely reduce food production and soilconservation, unless such measures are linked to conservation requirements. Promotion of treeplanting on degraded land could increase incomes significantly without compromising foodproduction or soil conservation, and, if combined with conservation incentives through food-for-work or other programs, could result in improved land management as well as increasedincomes and food security.These findings should be useful to policymakers and others seeking to improve land managementand reduce poverty in Ethiopia and other countries where such problems are severe.Beyond this, the modeling approach developed by Stein Holden, Bekele Shiferaw, and JohnPender can be usefully adapted and applied in many other African settings.";"Holden, Stein T.

The corporation bears the initial investment and earns as a return a share of the profits. The host country provides access and guarantees conditions of operation. Since the investment is totally sunk, the corporation must account in its plan not only for uncertainty in market conditions but also for the threat of nationalization. In a real options framework, where the government holds an American call option on nationalization, we show under which conditions a Nash bargaining leads to a profit distribution maximizing the joint venture surplus. We find that the threat of nationalization does not affect the investment threshold but only the Nash bargaining solution set. Finally, we show that the optimal sharing rule results from the way the two parties may differently trade of rents with option values.";"Di Corato, Luca";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"expropriation";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016214620";"http://purl.umn.edu/58292";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400162109";"Reconstructing prehistoric land use change from archeological data: Validation and application of a new model in Yiluo valley, northern China";"";"Estimation of land use during the Holocene is crucial to understand impacts of human activity on climate change in preindustrial period. Until now it is still a key issue to reconstruct amount and spatial distribution of prehistoric land use due to lack of data. Most reconstructions are simply extrapolations of population, cleared land amount per person and land suitability for agriculture. In this study, a new quantitative prehistoric land use model (PLUM) is developed based on semi-quantitative predictive models of archeological sites. The PLUM is driven by environmental and social parameters of archeological sites, which are objective evidences of prehistoric human activity, and produces realistic patterns of land use. After successful validation of the model with modern observed data, the PLUM was applied to reconstruct land use from 8 to 4ka B.P. in Yiluo valley, one of the most important agriculture origin centers in northern China. Results reveal that about 2–9% of land area in the valley was used by human activity from 8 to 4ka B.P., expanding from gentle slopes along the river to hinterlands in middle and lower parts of the valley. The land cover was affected by increasing agricultural land use during the middle Holocene.";"Yu, Yanyan

In order to improve steppe management, this study presents a framework for the monitoring of grazing intensity in Xilingol steppe of middle Inner Mongolia, northern China, by integrating the CENTURY ecosystem model-based simulation and remotely sensed MODIS data-based inversion. The CENTURY model worked well after calibrations using field data 1991–1995 of Xilinhaote and Zhenglan Banner observation stations (the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed above ground biomass (AGB) is 0.85). In order to run CENTURY spatially, regional input were formulated including data such as temperature, precipitation, AGB and soil water content (SWC) at the beginning of growing season in 2002, vegetation cover and land use. The modeled AGB at the end of the growing season in 2002 was compared with that inverted from MODIS data. The spatial variation of grazing in the research area was estimated with an iterative adjusting method. Results showed that grazing is variable throughout the study area. Grazing intensity is high and concentrated in the southwest and middle of Abarger Banner, and is low and extensive on the south of Xilinhaote, west of West Ujumchin Banner and northwest of Keshiketeng Banner. This result is comparable with the field conditions. From this work, it can be concluded that human activities such as livestock grazing can be monitored at broad scales with the integration of ecosystem modeling and remote sensing approaches.";"Feng, X.M.

Because farmland loss is affected by changing agricultural profitability, demand for land for non-agricultural purposes, and farmers' alternative employment opportunities, we include variables to control for these factors as well.  Because a high rate of farmland loss may actually be the reason a county or state begins a preservation program, we need to determine if this endogeniety is causing biased and inconsistent results.  If farmland preservation programs are only in counties with a high rate of farmland loss, then we need to establish what might have been the farmland loss rate if the program had not existed to determine if the program is having an impact.";"Lynch, Lori";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012200142";"http://purl.umn.edu/22100";"";"";"";""

A quantitative ethnobotanical study was conducted in Indigenous Territory and National Park Isiboro-Sécure, Bolivia, to investigate plant use and management in homegardens and swiddens by local Yuracaré and Trinitario ethnic groups. Ethnobotanical data of plants were obtained from 11 Yuracaré and 11 Trinitario participants through semistructured interviews. A total of 151 different cultivated or tolerated species was recorded, accounting for 21% of all inventoried plants considered useful to local Yuracarés and Trinitarios. The local use value of managed plants is almost twice that of wild plants. Managed plants score particularly higher than wild plants for medicinal, food and material applications. Most managed plants are herbs, followed by trees and shrubs. Nevertheless, managed trees have significantly higher overall use values than all other life forms. Managed trees tend to be particularly more appreciated as sources of food and materials, whereas herbaceous plants generally have a higher therapeutic value. Our results support observations made in literature that moderately humanized landscapes, and homegardens and swiddens in particular, are an important source of food and healing for forest people. Although people generally start managing plants in homegardens and swiddens because of their perceived usefulness, they are also favourable locations to experiment with the usefulness of (managed or wild) plants prevailing there. This particularly accounts for medicinal plants and it is argued that the use of managed plants in traditional medicine relates to (1) the high intensity of contact with theses species, and (2) their chemical defence strategy. To conclude, a number of policy recommendations are presented.";"Thomas, Evert

Traditional bamboo-tree gardens in West Java are known to play substantial ecological and socioeconomic roles. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between income generation and biodiversity by studying 83 bamboo-tree gardens that varied in species composition and degree of commercialization. We conducted a survey of the vegetation and interviewed the owners or managers of each plot. We identified 42 planned and utilized species and 19 associated non-use species. Eight vegetation groups were identified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), each of which varied in individual densities of different utilization species types, Simpson's diversity index, management intensities, and potential annual gross income. The group with the highest potential income generation was dominated by clove trees (Syzygium aromaticum); however, this group also had a lower level of diversity and higher levels of management intensity than the other groups, but all of the pairwise groups were not significantly different. About 60% of the villagers used at least some fuelwood as a domestic energy source, and almost all of them collected fuelwood from bamboo-tree gardens regardless of ownership. There were no significant differences in density of potential fuelwood species among the vegetation groups. There were significant positive correlations between income and most management activities. The regression model between gross income and Simpson's diversity index with the best fit was a unimodal curve, which strongly suggests that maximum diversity can be conserved at an intermediate level of income. Nevertheless, this intermediate level of gross income is probably not adequate as the primary source of income for garden owners, although some gardens had the potential to achieve higher income levels with no decline in diversity. We suggest that maximizing individual density and multistratifying canopy layers could improve profitability within perennial crop-based agroforestry systems in West Java.";"Okubo, Satoru

These forests are under considerable conversion pressure as land use intensifies with expanding human population and economic development. Conservation strategies based on the geographic patterns of botanical species richness, including the identification of meaningful floristic regions and priority areas for conservation, could improve the effectiveness of forest policy and management. These strategies should also include current threats of loss due to forest conversion to address the more urgent challenges for sustainable development. Here, we produce distribution models at ∼10km² resolution for 2319 plant species, using geo-referenced herbarium collections, corrected for spatial bias using a null model, and detailed environmental variables. Based on 1996 species with significant non-random habitat preferences, we identify four important aspects of plant species distribution in Yunnan: (1) species diversity hotspots; (2) seven major floristic regions, using a cluster analysis of species presence/absence; (3) priority areas for conservation based on the concept of the ‘irreplaceability’ value of planning units and (4) the percentage remaining natural forest among the species rich and conservation priority areas, to assess the level of endangerment.

We developed a non-linear generalized model showing that land ownership, cultural importance and biological characteristics of a plant are the most significant factors influencing farmers' decisions to intensify management of plant resources. On common land, species with high cultural importance and long life cycles are managed intensively, while, regardless of cultural importance, species with short life cycles are simply gathered. On land where particular people have an acknowledged right of use, species with long life cycles are always managed at an intermediate level of intensity regardless of their cultural importance, while for species with short life cycles, management intensity tends to slightly decrease as cultural importance increases. Even though management is generally more intensive in lands where individuals have use rights, as expected from the “supervised collective action model”, culturally important resources are more intensively managed in communal areas, probably as a result of a long tradition of consumption and of their economic importance.";"González-Insuasti, Martha S.

Mapping results were checked and refined by the same analyst with the same set of criteria. The results show during the last 20 years urban areas in China have increased exponentially more than 2 times. The greatest area of urbanization changed from Northeastern provinces in 1990s to the Southeast coast of China in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, and Zhejiang in 2010s. Urban areas are mostly converted from croplands in China. Approximately 17750 km2 croplands were converted into urban lands. Furthermore, the conversion from 2000 to 2010 doubled that from 1990 to 2000. During the 20 years, the most urbanized provinces are Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong and Zhejiang. We also analyzed built-up areas, gross domestic production (GDP) and population of 147 cities with a population of greater than 500000 in 2009. The result shows coastal cities and resource-based cities are with high economic efficiency per unit of built-up areas, resource-based cities have the highest population density, and the economic efficiency of most coastal provinces are lower than central provinces and Guangdong.

This review presents a short description of each form of soil degradation, including data regarding known extents and rates, and then reviews the methods with respect to direct and indirect modelling approaches. Two types of obstacles to achieving wide regional detection of soil degradation are revealed. The first concerns the complex and non-unique relationships between remote-sensing indicators and different soil properties, such as roughness, soil moisture (SM), soil salinity, and organic matter content. The second concerns the difficulties involved in acquiring data on subsurface soil properties. In view of these difficulties, we recommend expanding the use of phenomenological models capable of estimating soil-degradation potential according to combinations of environmental conditions, thus enabling remote-sensing efforts to be focused on local areas where the environmental threat is highest. The second avenue for improving the contribution of remote sensing on a wide regional scale involves the application of integrative methods, such as those based on hyperspectral, multisensory, and multitemporal approaches, as well as those that incorporate environmental information (such as topography, soil types, and precipitation).";"Shoshany, Maxim

"AGRIS:US201400169026";"efficient method for change detection of soil, vegetation and water in the Northern Gulf of Mexico wetland ecosystem";"";"Mapping and monitoring wetland ecosystems over large geographic areas based on remote sensing is challenging because of the spatial and spectral complexities of the inherent ecosystem dynamics. The main objective of this research was to develop and evaluate a new method for detecting and quantifying wetland changes in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) region using multitemporal, multispectral, and multisensor remotely sensed data. The abundance of three land- cover types (water, vegetation, and soil) was quantified for each Landsat 30 m pixel for 1987, 2004, 2005, and 2006 using a regression tree algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using an independent reference data set derived from a high-resolution QuickBird image, and several statistics including average error (AE), relative error (RE), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). For per-pixel percentage estimation, the AE is under 10% for water prediction, 9.5–11.4% for vegetation, and 9–11.1% for soil. The correlation coefficients between predicted and reference data range from 0.90 to 0.96 for water, from 0.80 to 0.89 for vegetation, and from 0.79 to 0.86 for soil. The high accuracy achieved by this method is attributed to the high quality of training data and the rigorous calibrations applied to multisensor and multitemporal satellite imagery. Based on the multitemporal estimation of the three land-cover components, spatial and temporal changes of the land-cover types from 1987 to 2006 were quantified and analysed. The study demonstrates that the method provided useful information on the abundance and changes of the key land-cover types in the NGOM region where long-term disturbances and episodic events occurred. Such information is valuable for monitoring land and vegetation loss and recovery processes, and for understanding possible drivers of the coastal wetland evolution in the region.";"Yang, Limin

"AGRIS:US201500198906";"Net exchanges of CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O between marshland and the atmosphere in Northeast China as influenced by multiple global environmental changes";"";"Natural wetland ecosystem plays an important role in global climate change due to its large amounts of stored carbon and nitrogen. The Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, encompasses large area of natural freshwater marshy wetlands. However, the magnitude and temporal patterns of major greenhouse gases (GHGs: CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O) in this region remain far from certain. Here we used a process-based ecosystem model to examine GHGs fluxes and their underlying mechanisms in the marshland across the Sanjiang Plain over the period 1949–2008. Simulation results indicated that during the past 60 years, the Sanjiang Plain's marshland acted as a net CO₂ sink of 4.20 ± 0.44 Tg C yr⁻¹, while approximately 0.46 ± 0.02 Tg C yr⁻¹ for CH₄ and 0.02 ± 0.00 Tg N yr⁻¹ for N₂O were released to the atmosphere. Land cover and land use change (LCLUC) was the primary driver for GHGs changes. Climate change and tropospheric ozone (O₃) pollution decreased CO₂ uptakes, yet elevated CO₂ concentration and nitrogen deposition increased CO₂ uptake. Tropospheric O₃ pollution and nitrogen deposition decreased CH₄ emission by 7.94 Gg C and 0.41 Gg C, respectively, while elevated CO₂ concentration increased the CH₄ emission by 133.81 Gg C. Accumulatively, tropospheric O₃ pollution and climate change contributed approximately 5.37% and 4.89% to the increased N₂O emission, respectively, while elevated CO₂ concentration reduced 2.81% of the N₂O emission. The global warming potential (GWP) ranged from −1.81 Tg CO₂eq yr⁻¹ in the 1970s to 29.15 Tg CO₂eq yr⁻¹ in the 2000s. The decadal GWP by CO₂ fluxes shifted from negative values between the 1950s and the 1990s to positive values in the 2000s, while CH₄ and N₂O emissions enhanced GWP from the 1950s to the 2000s. The total GWP decreased from the 1950s to the 1970s, but increased from the 1980s to the 2000s. This suggested that the reduced GWP by decreased CH₄ emissions was gradually offset by the increased GWP by increased N₂O emissions and decreased CO₂ sink from the 1980s to the 2000s, implying that a full accounting of the greenhouse gas balance is essential in assessing global change impacts.";"Wang, Lili

"AGRIS:US201500196748";"role of vegetation–microclimate feedback in promoting shrub encroachment in the northern Chihuahuan desert";"";"Many arid and semi‐arid landscapes around the world are affected by a shift from grassland to shrubland vegetation, presumably induced by climate warming, increasing atmospheric CO₂concentrations, and/or changing land use. This major change in vegetation cover is likely sustained by positive feedbacks with the physical environment. Recent research has focused on a feedback with microclimate, whereby cold intolerant shrubs increase the minimum nocturnal temperatures in their surroundings. Despite the rich literature on the impact of land cover change on local climate conditions, changes in microclimate resulting from shrub expansion into desert grasslands have remained poorly investigated. It is unclear to what extent such a feedback can affect the maximum extent of shrub expansion and the configuration of a stable encroachment front. Here, we focus on the case of the northern Chihuahuan desert, where creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) has been replacing grasslands over the past 100–150 years. We use a process‐based coupled atmosphere‐vegetation model to investigate the role of this feedback in sustaining shrub encroachment in the region. Simulations indicate that the feedback allows juvenile shrubs to establish in the grassland during average years and, once established, reduce their vulnerability to freeze‐induced mortality by creating a warmer microclimate. Such a feedback is crucial in extreme cold winters as it may reduce shrub mortality. We identify the existence of a critical zone in the surroundings of the encroachment front, in which vegetation dynamics are bistable: in this zone, vegetation can be stable both as grassland and as shrubland. The existence of these alternative stable states explains why in most cases the shift from grass to shrub cover is found to be abrupt and often difficult to revert.";"He, Yufei

"AGRIS:US201600188920";"Irrigation Management Reform in Northern China: Case Studies in Shanxi Province";"";"Irrigation in northern China is exposed to declining groundwater resources and institutional issues. As a response, authorities have developed measures that include differentiated resource allocation and charging, collective and individual water rights, a block pricing system, prepaid access to water, and realâtime monitoring of resource and use. This paper analyses this alternative management model and its implications at the farm and system levels, using institutional, technical and economic analyses of case studies from Qingxu County, northern China. The results show that the prepaid system helps solve costârecovery, freeâriding, agency and resource overuse problems. All water fees are prepaid, therefore fully collected. However, while most operation and maintenance costs are covered, personnel costs are covered in only one case, due to low water fees. The agency problem is also addressed by the continuous monitoring of water resources. Water use value is high compared to actual water fees, owing to high maize yields and reasonable use of supplemental irrigation. This indicates potential for a water price increase, if needed. This paper shows that the new management system at the county level epitomizes China's whole rural financial reform and the realignment of local water institutions with public administrative layers. It finally discusses achievements, pending questions and limitations for longâterm impacts.";"Li, He

"AGRIS:US201500162925";"Characterizing river habitat quality using plant and animal bioindicators: A case study of Tirino River (Abruzzo Region, Central Italy)";"";"A study on different types of bioindicator was carried out to detect river habitat quality in Central Italy. It was investigated the effectiveness of different bioindication models based on three biotic components: (i) vascular plants – hemeroby index for aquatic (Hw) and terrestrial species (Hₛ), and Ellenberg's soil nutrients indicator (N); (ii) aquatic macroinvertebrates – extended biotic index (EBI); (iii) soil microarthropods – index of soil biological quality (QBS-ar). The aim of this study was to compare the five independently derived indices, in order to stress their differences and similarities in the two river environmental compartments – aquatic and terrestrial. The study area is located in the Abruzzo region (Italy) and is bordered by National Parks of Gran Sasso (Parco Nazionale del Gran Sasso) and Majella Mountains (Parco Nazionale della Majella). 14 sampling sites along the Tirino river and two on the Pescara river (just off the confluence of the two rivers) were surveyed for the three biotic components of the ecosystem. Vegetation was surveyed by rectangular plots (20m wide) in two parallel belts: water and shore; aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected according to the extended biotic index standard method, and edaphic microarthropods were extracted in soil sampling according to the index of soil biological quality (QBS-ar) standard method. There was a very good agreement among the indices and Nonmetric Multi Dimensional Scaling (NMDS), carried out on species, distinguishing an upper course with good environmental quality and a lower part of the riverine system with lower environmental quality; this division corresponds to the CORINE Land Cover class of the sites. Mann–Whitney test showed that ordination of sites was differentiated more by terrestrial than aquatic indices. Agreement among indices and species ordination highlights the fact that bioindicators are related to habitat quality as a result of the multiple ecosystemic interactions among the biotic components of the ecosystem.";"Testi, A.

"AGRIS:US201500052140";"effect of fireline intensity on woody fuel consumption in southern Australian eucalypt forest fires";"";"SummaryThe relationship between woody fuel consumption and fireline intensity was assessed using data collected at controlled fires and wildfires in south-western Western Australia, central Victoria and south-eastern New South Wales. The combined dataset consisted of fires in a range of dry eucalypt forests. Fire behaviour varied from slow, self-extinguishing prescribed burns to intense, fast—moving fires burning under conditions of extreme fire danger. Fireline intensity ranged from 50 kW m⁻ˡ to <31000 kW m⁻¹. Woody fuel consumption ranged from 31% to 100%, and generally increased with fire intensity. Percentage consumption was highest for small woody fuels where the diameter was between 0.6 cm and 2.5 cm. Fireline intensity had a statistically significant, positive relationship with the proportion of woody fuel consumed by both controlled fires and wildfires. Two generalised linear models (GLM) describing woody fuel consumption as a function of fireline intensity were developed, one applicable to the prescribed fire environment (with fireline intensities typically < 750 kW m⁻¹) and the other to the full range of fireline intensities. The prescribed burning model produced the best fit and lowest error statistics.The findings of this research have important practical implications for the management of fire to reduce fuel loads, maintain habitat and manage carbon stocks in fire-prone eucalypt forests. The woody fuel consumption models presented may assist the assessment of potential climate change impacts on coarse woody debris in Australian southern eucalypt forests. The results of this research suggest that predicted changes to fire regimes and fire intensity associated with climate change in southern Australia could result in greater woody fuel consumption and carbon release during bushfires and a reduction in woody fuel loads in dry eucalypt forests. Use of low-intensity prescribed fires may provide a practical way of managing woody fuel stocks to achieve particular land management objectives.";"Hollis, J. J.

Using data collected from a survey of randomly selected pastoral households from two districts of Ghanzi and Kgalagadi South, Botswana, this paper outlines the major constraints affecting contemporary extensive pastoral systems. Because of the prevailing semi-arid climate, recurrent drought outbreaks were cited as a common challenge in both study areas together with lack of fenced grazing areas. Stock theft was also highlighted as a challenge, even though it was more pronounced in Kgalagadi South. In Ghanzi area, the other important challenges included loss of livestock due to predation, while stray animals, stock theft and loss of livestock due to road accidents were equally important. Kgalagadi South pastoral households experienced serious shortage of drinking water for their livestock, followed by inadequate grazing land and limited access to distant markets. The preceding, together with several other less prominent challenges revealed in this study, exert pressure on pastoral livelihoods. There is need, therefore, to address these perceived challenges and strengthen resilience through effective policy reviews to secure rural livelihoods.";"Mosalagae, Diphetogo

"AGRIS:US201400018448";"Dairying in the Antipodes: recent past, near prospects";"";"The majority of dairy farmers and processors in Australia and New Zealand are considered world class due to their ability to produce dairy products at a cost that is competitive on the world market without requirement for subsidy. International and domestic forces beyond the farm influence the international competitiveness of Antipodean dairy systems, as much or more than, the within-farm characteristics of the systems. Critical external forces include: world population growth, protein demand from increasingly wealthy developing countries, dairy supply from domestic and international producers, international dairy prices and exchange rate volatility. Within farm, the keys to persistent profitability, business survival, and growth will continue to be management ability and labour skill as well as the relationship between milksolids (milk fat + milk protein) produced per system and total production costs. Domestic forces will include competition for resources such as land, water, quality labour and capital, and public expectation that farms will meet the costs of community environmental and welfare objectives. Public and industry investment in research, development and extension in innovations that increase productivity is essential if dairying is to remain competitive. The operation of the comparative advantage principle determines which industries thrive, or decline, in an economy. New Zealand dairying has a strong comparative advantage over alternative pastoral industries which will continue. In Australia, the comparative advantage of dairy farming over alternative activities is less clear-cut. History shows that the best farmers and processors handle risks such as market and climate volatility and other challenges better than others, and their prospects are positive. However, world class performers in the future dairy industry will certainly not be all, or even the majority, of the current population of dairy farmers.";"Clark, Dave

"AGRIS:US201600017106";"Adoption intensity of soil and water conservation technologies: a case of South Western Uganda";"";"Important signs of agricultural land quality deterioration are apparent in many countries, including declining yields and a switch to crops that demand fewer nutrients. This is despite efforts to curb land degradation rates through the years, including the attempt to promote use of soil and water conservation (SWC) technologies. This study was done in Kabale district in the South Western highlands of Uganda. Data analysis was done using cross-sectional data from 338 households. A Tobit model was used to identify the factors that influence intensity of adoption of different SWC technologies at parcel level. Results indicate that higher proportions of individual parcels having SWC technologies are associated with availability of labor, education level, and age of the household head, access to SWC related training, more tropical livestock units, neighboring parcels having SWC technologies on them, high fertility levels, location of the parcel, and expected access to parcels in a given period of time. Large size of operated land and long distances from parcels to the homesteads are associated with lower adoption intensity. The importance of each of these aspects varies depending on technologies of focus. Measures to improve the quality of training and extension services have been recommended. In addition, improvement of physical infrastructure such as roads and institutional infrastructure such as tenure security enhancement has been recommended.";"Turinawe, Alice

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

"AGRIS:US201500010673";"Impact of urbanization and agriculture on the occurrence of bacterial pathogens and stx genes in coastal waterbodies of central California";"";"Fecal pollution enters coastal waters through multiple routes, many of which originate from land-based activities. Runoff from pervious and impervious land surfaces transports pollutants from land to sea and can cause impairment of coastal ocean waters. To understand how land use practices and water characteristics influence concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens in natural waters, fourteen coastal streams, rivers, and tidal lagoons, surrounded by variable land use and animal densities, were sampled every six weeks over two years (2008 & 2009). Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; Escherichia coli and Enterococci) and Salmonella concentrations, the occurrence of Bacteroidales human, ruminant, and pig-specific fecal markers, E. coli O157:H7, and Shiga toxin (stx) genes present in E. coli, were measured. In addition, environmental and climatic variables (e.g., temperature, salinity, rainfall), as well as human and livestock population densities and land cover were quantified. Concentrations of FIB and Salmonella were correlated with each other, but the occurrence of host-specific Bacteroidales markers did not correlate with FIB or pathogens. FIB and Salmonella concentrations, as well as the occurrence of E. coli harboring stx genes, were positively associated with the fraction of the surrounding subwatershed that was urban, while the occurrence of E. coli O157:H7 was positively associated with the agricultural fraction. FIB and Salmonella concentrations were negatively correlated to salinity and temperature, and positively correlated to rainfall. Areal loading rates of FIB, Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 to the coastal ocean were calculated for stream and river sites and varied with land cover, salinity, temperature, and rainfall. Results suggest that FIB and pathogen concentrations are influenced, in part, by their flux from the land, which is exacerbated during rainfall; once waterborne, bacterial persistence is affected by water temperature and salinity.";"Walters, Sarah P.

The nutrient loading from both point and nonpoint sources has reduced the quality of the tributaries and the lake ecosystem. There is a need for comprehensive modeling of strategies to protect the lake and watershed ecosystems. This study uses a watershed systems modeling to assess hydrologic flows and nutrient loads in order to quantify effectiveness of management practices in reducing runoff and nonpoint source pollution. The study uses GIS to process spatial data and simulation modeling to assess hydrologic and contaminant processes at a watershed scale. Management strategies are evaluated by quantifying the effect of targeted best management practices (BMPs) in urban, forest and agricultural land uses. The results show that urban and forest loss can affect the watershed and lake ecosystems. There is a need for spatially targeted policies to sustain the lake watershed.

"AGRIS:US201300881862";"Estimating the effects of adjacency and green-up constraints on landowners of different sizes and spatial arrangements located in the southeastern U.S";"";"The maximum clearcut size and green-up period is important for land managers adhering to voluntary and regulatory guidelines. Therefore the impact of actual and hypothetical clearcut size restrictions is a concern for forest landowners who manage land and intend to practice forestry for profit. In this research, the effect of a 97.1 ha (240 ac) clearcut size constraint with a green-up period of 2-yrs is assessed for forest landowners with different forest land sizes, ownership patterns, and age class distributions. A meta heuristic which consists of threshold accepting, 1-opt tabu search, and 2-opt tabu search is used to develop spatially-constrained forest plans for 27 hypothetical forest landowners. These results are compared to a relaxed solution produced with linear programming, and statistical analyses are used to determine significant differences. The analysis provided enough evidence to suggest that two factors (size of ownership pattern and initial age class distribution), and one interaction factor (ownership sizexinitial age class distribution) are significant in explaining the differences in the percent reduction in forest plan value among the forests managed by the hypothetical forest landowners. From an absolute value reduction perspective, small-sized older forests were most affected. From a percent value point of view, one can conclude from this analysis that landowners with small-sized forests and young initial age class distributions will be significantly more affected by potential adjacency and green-up restrictions in the southeastern U.S. than other types of landowners.";"Zhu, Jianping

It shows that insecurity of property rights not only reduces the level of activity of the land rental market, but also causes market segmentation. A principal-agent framework is used to model the utility maximization of both the tenant and the landlord, where the landlord accounts for the risk of losing the land when it is not traded within a narrow local circle of confidence. Using data collected with a new methodology that enable the entire market to be characterized, we show that insecure property rights lead to matching in the tenancy markets along socio-economic group and hence severely limit access to land for the rural poor.  Our results also show the importance of a minimum endowment of assets to obtain access to land in the rental market.";"MacOurs, Karen";"";"";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"DOM";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012204246";"http://purl.umn.edu/19603";"";"";"";""

Seedling emergence was significantly higher in experimental units exposed twice and three times to controlled fire than in unburned experimental units. The highest average seedling survival was recorded with triple exposure to controlled fires. Emergence, survival and growth of seedlings from seeds exposed to acid scarification and 600°C for 5 min were higher in the burned experimental units than in the unburned ones. In the former, seedling survival was higher beneath a P. caldenia canopy than in an adjacent open site, though seedling emergence was similar in both planting sites. Our results suggest that postfire conditions characterized by a reduction in the vegetative cover and competition interference and an increase in soil temperatures and nutrients levels (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus) may facilitate the establishment of P. caldenia seedlings in the Caldenal.";"De VILLALOBOS, ANA E.

"AGRIS:US201600198382";"Riverscapes downstream of hydropower dams: Effects of altered flows and historical land-use change";"";"Dams strongly impair the fluvial environment by altering downstream flows. We analysed riverscapes downstream of three dams and hypothesized that different dam types in rivers with diverse history of land-use and land cover (LULC) change have significant riparian cover differences at diverse biogeomorphic units (banks, riverbanks, islands). We performed a temporal comparison using pre-dam (1965) and post-dam (2013) high-resolution airborne imagery. A new approach was devised to correct the spatial offset between historical and contemporary imagery. Riparian vegetation and LULC (200m-buffer) were mapped in three rivers of Portugal regulated by the dams Touvedo (run-of-river), Vilarinho das Furnas and Fronhas (storage reservoirs). Five landscape metrics, measures of shape complexity, area and edge effect of riparian patches were computed, including the Weighted Class Area, a metric developed to better interpret the landscape variation. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of highly altered riverscapes in the post-dam period. For all case studies riparian patches are presently larger, but with less complex shapes and smaller edges. In the present study riparian patches encroach into the river channel, occupy more area and are larger at the two reservoir rivers than at the run-of-river setting. Riparian growth trajectory at the latter is mainly outwards from the active channel and non-vegetated areas in riverbanks and banks are significantly larger; likely due to the washing flows. Redundancy analyses indicated that riparian change was driven by both LULC (agricultural land abandonment and unmanaged forests) and hydrological alterations that jointly determine the structure and spatial trajectories of riparian expansion.";"Aguiar, Francisca ConstanÃ§a

"AGRIS:US201500193130";"Assessment of future water resources and water scarcity considering the factors of climate change and social–environmental change in Han River basin, Korea";"";"Water resources are influenced by various factors such as weather, topography, geology, and environment. Therefore, there are many difficulties in evaluating and analyzing water resources for the future under climate change. In this paper, we consider climate, land cover and water demand as the most critical factors affecting change in future water resources. We subsequently introduce the procedures and methods employed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of each factor on the change in future water resources. In order to consider the change in land cover, we apply the Multi-Regression approach from the cellular automata-Markov Chain technique using two independent variables, temperature and rainfall. In order to estimate the variation of the future runoff due to climate change, the data of the SRES A2 climate change scenario were entered in the SLURP model to simulate a total of 70 years, 2021–2090, of future runoff in the Han River basin in Korea. However, since a significant amount of uncertainties are involved in predicting the future runoff due to climate change, 50 sets of daily precipitation data from the climate change scenario were generated and used for the SLURP model to forecast 50 sets of future daily runoff. This process was used to minimize the uncertainty that may occur when the prediction process is performed. For future water balance analysis, the future water demand was divided into low demand, medium demand and high demand categories. The three water demand scenarios and the 50 daily runoff scenarios were combined to form 150 sets of input data. The monthly water balance within the Han River basin was then calculated using this data and the Korean version of Water Evaluation and Planning System model. As a result, the future volume of water scarcity of the Han River basin was predicted to increase in the long term. It is mostly due to the monthly shift in the runoff characteristic, rather than the change in runoff volume resulting from climate change.";"Kim, Soojun

However, intensive livestock grazing has severely degraded the steppe grassland. A sophisticated grazing management is therefore essential for an economically viable use of the grassland without amplifying its desertification. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different grazing management systems and grazing intensities (GI) on liveweight gain (LWG) of sheep grazing the Inner Mongolian steppe in order to derive recommendations for a sustainable grassland use which considers both, farmers' interests of a profitable livestock production as well as environmental goals. A 5-year grazing experiment was conducted in June–September of 2005–2009 in which six different GI's (≥12, 6–12, 4.5–6, 3–4.5, 1.5–3, and ≤1.5kg herbage dry mass kg⁻¹ liveweight) and two different grazing systems were installed. The two systems included an alternating grazing system where grazing and hay-making alternated annually between two plots, and a continuous grazing system where the same plots were used either for hay-making or for grazing each year. Grazing system had no or only minor effects on sheep's LWG. However, LWG per sheep linearly decreased with increasing stocking rate, resulting in diminishing responses in LWG per ha. LWG per sheep and per ha were lowest in a dry year and decreased with advancing vegetation period. In view of our earlier published data on the effect of GI on the steppe vegetation, we conclude that grazing at GI's which allows for an end-of-season biomass that is sufficient to prevent grassland degradation does not lead to large deprivations in liveweight yield. Complementary management strategies such as supplement feeding of grazing animals may compensate for this deprivations as well as for inter- and intra-annual variations in herbage growth and quality. They can thus further contribute to a sustainable use of Inner Mongolian steppe.";"Lin, Lijun

One way of addressing this problem is use of organic nutrient resources. This paper examines their cost-effectiveness as capital investments in replenishment of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) and soil organic matter (SOM) in smallholder, Maize-based cropping systems. On-farm trials were established in Maragwa and Kirinyaga Districts in 2003/04. Maize was planted in 3 replicates in randomised complete block design (RCBD) using different levels of organic and inorganic fertilizer resources. A blanket rate of 40kg P/ha was applied in all treatment except the control to increase organic N-utilization efficiency. The test crop was harvested, oven-dried and weighed. Net Present Values (NPV) were computed using Partial Budgeting Analysis Model. Increasing levels of inorganic N increased maize yields significantly (P<0.05). However, higher yields were necessary but not sufficient criteria to determine profitability of different treatments. Manure + 60 kg N/ha gave highest NPV (USD 564), Manure + 40kg N/ha gave second highest NPV (USD 511) in Maragwa District while Manure + 60kg N/ha gave highest NPV (USD 633) and Manure + 40kg N/ha second highest NPV (USD 618) in Kirinyaga District. These results suggested that higher N-levels were not necessarily the most economical. Use of organic resources with modest amounts of mineral fertilizers seemed more profitable and held the key to enhancement of nutrient budgets, food security and rural livelihoods.";"Ramisch, J.

"AGRIS:US201301819144";"Understanding the Lessons and Limitations of Conservation and Development";"";"The lack of concrete instances in which conservation and development have been successfully merged has strengthened arguments for strict exclusionist conservation policies. Research has focused more on social cooperation and conflict of different management regimes and less on how these factors actually affect the natural environments they seek to conserve. Consequently, it is still unknown which strategies yield better conservation outcomes? We conducted a meta-analysis of 116 published case studies on common resource management regimes from Africa, south and central America, and southern and Southeast Asia. Using ranked sociodemographic, political, and ecological data, we analyzed the effect of land tenure, population size, social heterogeneity, as well as internally devised resource-management rules and regulations (institutions) on conservation outcome. Although land tenure, population size, and social heterogeneity did not significantly affect conservation outcome, institutions were positively associated with better conservation outcomes. There was also a significant interaction effect between population size and institutions, which implies complex relationships between population size and conservation outcome. Our results suggest that communities managing a common resource can play a significant role in conservation and that institutions lead to management regimes with lower environmental impacts.";"OLDEKOP, JOHAN A.

"AGRIS:US201300950911";"Landscape-level dynamics of grassland-forest transitions in British Columbia";"";"Grasslands in the interior British Columbia of Canada are adjacent to forests and are susceptible to tree encroachment. Grazing, fire suppression, and climate variability are among factors affecting vegetation dynamics in the ecotone between grassland and forest, but topographic factors such as slope aspect, slope degree and elevation may interact with these factors and result in uneven changes in vegetation among landscape elements. Nine sites with a total of approximately 50,000 ha of grasslands and forests in the Cariboo/Chilcotin forest region of British Columbia were selected to study the effect of slope aspect, slope degree and elevation on vegetation distribution, dynamics and forest expansion from the 1960's to 1990's. Vegetation maps of the 1960's and 1990's were generated using aerial photos and overlaid with GIS layers including aspect, slope and elevation. The classification of open grassland, treed grassland, open forest and closed forest was based on the percent coverage of coniferous species, ranging from 0-5%, 5-15%, 15-35%, and > or = 35%, respectively. A probability index (P-value) was developed to test the effect of aspect, slope, and elevation on vegetation distribution, dynamics, and forest expansion based on the distribution and changed areas. Results show that open grasslands occurred on southerly aspects and the shift to treed grassland occurred mostly on these aspects. The probability of vegetation shift from open to treed grasslands decreased with increasing slope degree, probably due to the less favorable moisture regime on steep slopes. Treed grassland also shifted to open forest on south facing slopes and more level sites. In contrast, closed forest most often occurred on northerly facing slopes and the shift from open to closed forests was most likely to occur there. The greatest changes in vegetation cover types occurred at mid-elevations between 700 and 1,000 m. Management plans aimed at the control of tree encroachment and forest ingrowth should take these topographic factors into consideration.";"Bai, Y.

"AGRIS:US201301684113";"Accountability of experts in the Danish national park process";"";"In 2002 the Danish Minister of Environment initiated a process to investigate the possibilities of establishing national parks in Denmark. For this purpose experts were mobilised to investigate the status and potentials of the areas in question. The national park process was extensive in scope and complex, and in theory such complexity is assumed to make it difficult for non-experts to understand all the relevant aspects of policy. This exclusion of non-experts may lead to scientification of politics. Furthermore politicisation of science might occur as experts might advocate political interests disguised as objective science, and policy-makers might select results that further their own interests. As a result policy-makers risk losing a source of legitimacy, scientists risk losing credibility and the citizens risk losing the possibility to hold policy-makers accountable for their decisions, which puts democracy at risk. This paper examines the accountability relationships that experts were a part of in the national park process. These include accountability towards the employer, towards the buyer and towards the general public. The purpose is to determine if these relationships were adequate to circumvent the problems associated with scientification of politics and to discuss how accountability relationships and thereby democracy could be strengthened. The empirical analysis shows that in the national park process experts were mainly accountable towards the National Forest and Nature Agency. There were formal accountability relationships between the experts and the local steering committees and the national advisory group, but these relationships were less significant. Moreover, despite the fact that the process was deemed unusually open to the public by the participants, the relationship between experts and the public cannot be characterised as an accountability relationship and could have been improved by including experts in the deliberative fora of the process.";"Lund, Dorthe H.

"AGRIS:US201301819143";"Local Land-Use Planning to Conserve Biodiversity: Planners' Perspectives on What Works";"";"Because habitat loss due to urbanization is a primary threat to biodiversity, and land-use decisions in urbanizing areas are mainly made at the local level, land-use planning by municipal planning departments has a potentially important--but largely unrealized--role in conserving biodiversity. To understand planners' perspectives on the factors that facilitate and impede biodiversity conservation in local planning, we interviewed directors of 17 municipal planning departments in the greater Seattle (Washington, U.S.A.) area and compared responses of planners from similar-sized jurisdictions that were ""high"" and ""low performing"" with respect to incorporation of biodiversity conservation in local planning. Planners from low-performing jurisdictions regarded mandates from higher governmental levels as the primary drivers of biodiversity conservation, whereas those from high-performing jurisdictions regarded community values as the main drivers, although they also indicated that mandates were important. Biodiversity conservation was associated with presence of local conservation flagship elements (e.g., salmonids) and human-centered benefits of biodiversity conservation (e.g., quality of life). Planners from high- and low-performing jurisdictions favored different planning mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, perhaps reflecting differences in funding and staffing. High performers reported more collaborations with other entities on biodiversity issues. Planners' comments indicated that the term biodiversity may be problematic in the context of local planning. The action most planners recommended to increase biodiversity conservation in local planning was public education. These results suggest that to advance biodiversity conservation in local land-use planning, conservation biologists should investigate and educate the public about local conservation flagships and human benefits of local biodiversity, work to raise ecological literacy and explain biodiversity more effectively to the public, and promote collaboration on biodiversity conservation among jurisdictions and inclusion of biodiversity specialists in planning departments.";"STOKES, DAVID L.

Two well‐documented management regimes, conservation and afforestation using a contour trenching technique were monitored. Biomass data on annual vegetation were collected from field survey and compared to a time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A significant relationship between NDVI and biomass (r� =� 0.83, P� <� 0.01) confirmed the applicability of satellite information to monitoring biomass production in this low productivity area. However, a strong positive relationship between NDVI and precipitation (r� =� 0.96� ±� 0.01, P� <� 0.001) prevented the conventional use of trend analysis to detect changes in biomass productivity. Trends in the NDVI and precipitation use efficiency were similar in both sites due to a rainfall effect. Use of a reference site revealed the magnitude and direction of change in biomass productivity in the different land management regimes. Measures of soil organic matter confirmed these differences between the two managed sites and the reference site. We suggest that the use of abandoned lands for a reference may enhance the ability to detect changes in biomass productivity in drylands.";"Helman, D.

The objective of this study was to assess impacts of long-term (>75 years) grazing during spring (SPG), summer (SUG), winter (WG) and exclosure (non-grazed control) treatments on soil nutrients, penetration resistance and infiltration tests. METHODS: A soil sampling campaign was carried out to collect soil to a depth of 60 cm to analyse bulk density, soil physical and chemical parameters as well as soil compaction and infiltration. RESULTS: Generally, grazing treatments reduced soil organic C (SOC) stocks and C:N ratios, and modified soil properties. There was higher SOC stock (0.128 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) in the exclosure than in the SPG (0.096 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), SUG (0.099 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) and WG (0.105 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). The C:N ratios exhibited similar pattern to that of C. From the grazing treatments, the WG demonstrated 7 to 10 % additional SOC stock over the SPG and SUG, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Short period animal exclusion could be an option to be considered to improve plant nutrients in sandy soils of South Africa. However, this may require a policy environment which supports stock exclusion from such areas vulnerable to land degradation, nutrient and C losses by grazing-induced vegetation and landscape changes.";"Talore, D.

Survey data for 1993 and 1994 are used to estimate Tobit functions, compute elasticities of adoption and intensity of use, perform robustness tests and estimate alternative models.  Controlling for land and labor abundance and other factors we find that those who have more ownership rights over farmland, and who do more controlled feeding of livestock, tend to invest more in both technologies.  The result suggests that responding to land scarcity with clearer property rights over cropland and pasture could help promote investment in soil conservation, and raise the productivity of factors applied to land.";"Kazianga, Harounan

Markets are also impeded by disputes over third-party effects due to the interdependencies of water users and complex institutional arrangements that dilute decision-making authority.

The objectives of the study are twofold: (i) to present and discuss an original analysis of the incomeâenvironment relationship in an economic-convergent and environmentalâdivergent country and (ii) to evaluate the impact of the (changing) productive structure and selected socio-demographic characteristics on the level of land vulnerability. The econometric analysis indicates that the relationship between GDP and land degradation across Italian provinces is completely reverted once we move from a cross-sectional analysis to panel estimates. While economic and environmental disparities between provinces go in the same direction, with richer provinces having lower levels of LD, over time the growth process increases LD with the economic structure acting as a significant variable.";"Esposito, Piero

This article analyzes the decisions of landowners in Maine, where forests have been heavily harvested and much land has been converted to non-forest use. Data on these landowners and their land were obtained from primary and secondary sources, satellite change detection analysis, and structured interviews. We found that there are several different landowner groups making different harvesting decisions in response to different incentives. In northern Maine, deforestation occurred at a rapid rate in the 1970s-1990s due to the activities of paper companies, which were harvesting heavily in the aftermath of a spruce budworm epidemic and which were doing liquidation harvesting preparatory to leaving Maine. In the southern area of the state, deforestation is due primarily to small landowners converting land for development and contractors doing “cut and run” forestry. The Maine case shows that even in a small area, there can be multiple causes for deforestation.";"Acheson, James M.

"AGRIS:US201301880386";"Soil properties and their spatial pattern in an oasis on the lower reaches of the Tarim River, northwest China";"";"In this study, classical, geostatistical methods and a geographical information system have been used to identify soil properties including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (total N), salt content (SC) and soil moisture (SM), and their spatial variation as well as their relationships with groundwater, land use, and soil texture. The data came from 36 soil samples from 0 to 20cm depth, and 36 groundwater samples in the Tikanlik Oasis on the lower reaches of the Tarim River, northwest China. The objective was to provide a scientific basis for understanding the heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of soil properties on a large scale with the goal of accelerating the sustainable development of agriculture in the oasis. The results showed that the SC and SM of the surface soil varied greatly, but the SOC and total N varied very little. A possible reason for the low variability of SOC and total N was the relatively consistent human activities within the typical agricultural oasis with more than 75% land used as cropland and orchards, because there was no significant effect of land use types on soil total N and SOC. Geostatistical analysis and the kriging estimator showed that SC and SM had a strong spatial autocorrelation. One-way ANOVA and LSD suggested that land use was the main structural indicator that resulted in the spatial autocorrelation of SC and SM within the 0-20cm soil depth through its significant differences in soil texture, irrigation and groundwater. In particular, croplands and orchards had significantly higher SM, silt and clay particle percentages and lower SC compared to other land uses due to regular irrigation. Additionally, irrigation could effectively relieve the degree of the hazard from soil salt and soil water stress in cropland.";"Zhou, H.H.

We addressed this question in the case of the European Roller Coracias garrulus, an endangered species listed in Annex I of the European Union directive for bird conservation. For secondary hole-nesting birds, such as rollers, the breeding micro- and macrohabitat selection may rely on the location of the nest hole in a tree and its immediate surrounding environment as well as the larger scale foraging habitat. We used both of these criteria to compare the characteristics of Green Woodpecker Picus viridis holes that either were or were not occupied by breeding pairs of the European Roller. Our study was carried out in an agricultural landscape of southeastern France where the population of European Roller is trending towards an increase. When compared to unoccupied holes, occupied holes were at a lower height (approx. 6 m above ground) and were preferentially located in dead trees with other holes in close vicinity. Occupied holes were also located in landscapes with lower land use intensity (i.e., higher proportions of meadows, fallow lands, and fewer hedgerows and built areas) than non-occupied holes. Finally, fallow lands and meadows harboured more Orthoptera, an important food resource for rollers, than other land cover categories. Thus, our results highlight the importance of these land covers for the species management and indicate that they may be favourable areas for nest-box provisioning.";"Bouvier, Jean-Charles

"AGRIS:US201400034895";"Uncertainty in biomass supply estimates: Lessons from a Yakama Nation case study";"";"A review of the four main wood energy sectors in the U.S. was conducted to explore historic trends and the impact of alternative energy prices and public policies on wood energy consumption. High oil prices have triggered the adoption of government regulation and financial incentives to promote greater use of wood energy over the last four decades. However, the amount of wood energy consumed in the U.S. industrial sector was driven mainly by the output of the pulp and paper products industry and not by energy prices or any particular public policy incentive. Residential consumption of wood energy was positively correlated with competing energy prices. Public policies seem to have had a greater impact on wood energy consumption in the electric power sector and over the last four decades have concentrated on promoting biopower with a recent shift to liquid cellulosic biofuels. High oil prices and a series of public policies such as tax credits, loans, grants, and renewable energy standards have resulted in higher consumption of wood energy from 2004 to 2009 in the residential, electric power and commercial sectors by an estimated 5, 2, and less than 1 percent annually, respectively. The impact of new federal programs such as the Biomass Crop Assistance Program remains to be observed. Continuation of public incentives and preferential regulations for renewable energy appears to be necessary for a steady increase in U.S. wood energy consumption.";"Richardson, Jeffrey J.

ANARCHY: MODELING THE EVOLUTION OF INSTITUTIONS";"";"This paper gives a general mathematical definition of an institution, and presents an explicit formal method by which to incorporate institutions in a standard general equilibrium model.  We illustrate our concept using a modified Prisoner's dilemma game in which property rights over natural resources emerge from an anarchy-like state of nature.  Two players decide voluntarily and non-cooperatively whether to give up some fraction of their personal resource to set up an enforcement mechanism that punishes defecting players (i.e., players that do not opt to cooperate).  This enforcement mechanism constitutes a credible threat, and is central to the establishment of bilateral cooperation (i.e, government).  We highlight the importance of imperfect information (proposition 1) and risk averse behavior (propositions 2 and 3) for bilateral cooperation to be sustained as the unique Nash-equilibrium.  Proposition 1 formalizes an idea of Brennan and Buchanan (1985) that the legitimacy of governments is based on their contribution to reducing uncertainty.  Proposition 3 justifies an assumption made by Sened (1997) that rational individuals respect governments dictating specific institutions.";"Mittenzwei, Klaus

"AGRIS:US201301819536";"Assessing the effects of agricultural management practices on carbon fluxes: Spatial variation and the need for replicated estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange";"";"Replicated measurements of Net Ecosystem CO₂ Exchange (NEE) were made on four arable plots using two eddy covariance (EC) towers that were moved at regular intervals. Replicated plots were created by dividing a large arable field into four approximately equal areas (∼2.5ha). Regular adjustments of the EC measurement height (1.5-1.9m) due to seasonal changes in canopy height ensured that the analyzed fluxes were derived from the individual plots. This was sufficient to make high-quality flux measurements with the energy balance accounting for up to 96% of the available energy in the system. The replicated experiment included two treatment plots managed with conventional tillage practices (CON) and two plots managed with non-inversion tillage (NIT). The mean annual NEE (aNEE) over all plots and years showed a carbon uptake of -163g [C]m⁻² y⁻¹. Plot to plot variability ranged between 9 and 70g [C]m⁻² y⁻¹. Differences in leaf area index (LAI) were the most likely cause of plot to plot variability. For the majority of the experiment spatial variation was greater than treatment effects and provided over half the total annual uncertainty, demonstrating the need to address spatial variability when assessing aNEE using EC techniques. Interannual variation in the measured fluxes was greater than the plot-to-plot or the treatment variations, most likely due to differences in water availability, although this could be confounded by changes in spatial variability due to other environmental factors or management operations. The proportionally large uncertainty associated with spatial and interannual variability when compared to the measured fluxes, suggests that NEE estimates are, in the short term, unlikely to result in sufficiently accurate estimates of net biome productivity (NBP) for assessing the slow accumulation/loss of SOC associated with altered tillage management without a much larger number of replicated plots. Whilst the approach used has limited statistical power it could be modified to accommodate a large number of replicates to provide more robust estimates of treatment differences.";"Davis, P.A.

"AGRIS:US201500058292";"Zoning, land use, and urban tree canopy cover: The importance of scale";"";"Declining urban tree canopy cover in the United States underscores the importance of elucidating factors that influence the distribution of urban trees. This is particularly relevant as most urban trees are located on private property while their canopies maintain ecosystem services that constitute public goods. Thus, municipalities establish institutions in the form of canopy cover goals and various policies to incentivize private actions to meet those goals. However, urban land use, as governed by municipal zoning policies, plays a role in the abundance, distribution, and potential future location of urban trees independent of policies meant specifically to manage canopy. For instance, previous research finds that lands zoned for residential and park development have the highest canopy cover relative to other land uses. Yet, little research has explored whether this conclusion holds across scales of analysis and how it might influence our understanding of potential canopy cover and relative canopy cover. Thus, we ask, does the nature of the relationship between zoning and canopy cover change between aggregated and disaggregated zoning scales and how might this knowledge improve the sustainability of urban forest management? To answer this question, we classified high resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images of Bloomington, Indiana land cover and compared existing, potential and relative canopy cover across aggregated and disaggregated zones. Results demonstrate an important exception to the oft-cited theory that residential lands have higher canopy cover, a conclusion that our data supports only at the scale of an aggregated interpretation of zoning. At a disaggregated scale, residential high density zones are significantly different than all other residential zones and more akin to commercial zones in terms of all canopy metrics. For urban forest managers and urban planners, this suggests the relevance of fine-scale variation in land-use policies and related canopy cover policies.";"Mincey, Sarah K.

"AGRIS:US201400003035";"Patterns of beta diversity in Europe: the role of climate, land cover and distance across scales";"";"Aim We test the prediction that beta diversity (species turnover) and the decay of community similarity with distance depend on spatial resolution (grain). We also study whether patterns of beta diversity are related to variability in climate, land cover or geographic distance and how the independent effects of these variables depend on the spatial grain of the data. Location Europe, Great Britain, Finland and Catalonia. Methods We used data on European birds, plants, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles, and data on British plants, Catalonian birds and Finnish butterflies. We fitted two or three nested grids of varying resolutions to each of these datasets. For each grid we calculated differences in climate, differences in land‐cover composition (CORINE) and beta diversity (βsim, βJaccard) between all pairs of grid cells. In a separate analysis we looked specifically at pairs of adjacent grid cells (the first distance class). We then used variation partitioning to identify the magnitude of independent statistical associations (i.e. independent effects in the statistical sense) of climate, land cover and geographic distance with spatial patterns of beta diversity. Results Beta diversity between grid cells at any given distance decreased with increasing grain. Geographic distance was always the most important predictor of beta diversity for all pairwise comparisons at the extent of Europe. Climate and land cover had weaker but distinct and grain‐dependent effects. Climate was more important at relatively coarse grains, whereas land‐cover effects were stronger at finer grains. In the country‐wide analyses, climate and land cover were more important than geographic distance. Climatic and land‐cover models performed poorly and showed no systematic grain dependence for beta diversity between adjacent grid cells. Main conclusions We found that relationships between geographic distance and beta diversity, as well as the environmental correlates of beta diversity, are systematically grain dependent. The strong independent effect of distance indicates that, contrary to the current belief, a substantial fraction of species are missing from areas with a suitable environment. Moreover, the effects of geographic distance (at continental extents) and land cover (at fine grains) indicate that any species distribution modelling should take both environment and dispersal limitation into account.";"Keil, Petr

"AGRIS:US201301796889";"Managing water by managing land: Addressing land degradation to improve water productivity and rural livelihoods";"";"The premise of this paper is that the key to effective water resources management is understanding that the water cycle and land management are inextricably linked: that every land use decision is a water use decision. Gains in agricultural water productivity, therefore, will only be obtained alongside improvements in land use management. Expected increases in food demands by 2050 insist that agricultural production - and agricultural water use - must increase. At the same time, competition for water between agricultural and urban sectors will also increase; and the problem is further compounded by land degradation. A global survey suggests that 40% of agricultural land is already degraded to the point that yields are greatly reduced, and a further 9% is degraded to the point that it cannot be reclaimed for productive use by farm level measures. Soil erosion, nutrient depletion and other forms of land degradation reduce water productivity and affect water availability, quality, and storage. Reversing these trends entails tackling the underlying social, economic, political and institutional drivers of unsustainable land use. This paper is based on a review of global experiences, and its recommendations for improving water management by addressing land degradation include focusing on small scale agriculture; investing in rehabilitating degraded land to increase water productivity; and enhancing the multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. These options can improve water management and water productivity, while also improving the livelihoods of the rural poor.";"Bossio, Deborah

Waterlogging and salt-affected soil problems have serious implications for irrigated areas leading to socio-economic and agricultural development problems. In the present study, timely and accurate detection of land degradation through remote sensing and hydrosalinity indicators, along with their characteristics and severity classification in a GIS environment, has been undertaken to provide, determine, assess and map reliable geo-information of environmental land degradation. This research deals with an assessment of hydrosalinity and environmental land degradation based on some new, but simple and practical, approaches for assessing salinity and spread of land degradation through digital image processing, geo-statistics and geochemistry. This analysis utilises Landsat 8, ASTER GDEM data, hydrochemical and statistical analyses using a GIS, together with other field collected data sets for the same date of May 2014. The hydrosalinity mapping and the statistical data analysis of TDS, major ions, groundwater grouping and hydrochemical facies and also water table maps between 1994 and 2014 reveals that the main sources of groundwater recharge and water bodies are mostly attributed to the continuous seepage from newly cultivated lands. The new flow regime is the main contributing factor to the rising water level, water salinity and waterlogging problems. Moreover, the spatial distribution of major ion content could be attributed to the leaching of aquifer materials along the flow path (Na, Ca, and Cl), the study area affected by agricultural pollution (Mg and SO₄) and the leaching process which acts on the easily soluble evaporate-rich fluvio-marine sediments of a shallow aquifer (NO₃ and PO₄). The spatial distribution maps of the physico-chemical properties of soil such as EC, pH, SAR, Na, Cl, SO₄ and Ca are compared with remote sensing salinity indices and then integrated to classify and map the salinity and salt-affected soil by using GIS tools. These indicate that increases in soil salinity levels pose a serious threat to sustainable agricultural developments that requires special attention to maintain an appropriate soil–water plant relationship by providing an adequate drainage system. The identification of land degradation mitigation measures requires thorough knowledge of the ground and surface water, human activities, and the salinity dynamics of the study area.";"Arnous, Mohamed O.

The objectives of this study were to analyze the landuse/land cover and to map functional zones of the urban forest in the upper catchment area of Addis Ababa. This study identifies five landuse/land cover types: (i) Eucalyptus–Juniperus dominated forest, (ii) mixed native forest, (iii) built-up areas, (iv) Eucalyptus plantation (v) crop/grazing lands. The vegetation analysis shows 44 woody plant species representing 31 families, out of which 13 tree species, 29 shrubs and two species of lianas. The woody species diversity was 1.35 with the species richness and evenness of 44 and 0.80, respectively. This indicates that the forest has poor species diversity which is attributed to high anthropogenic pressure and monoculture plantation development strategies in the last decades. The density of plants ranged from 25 for Olea europea to 825 individuals per hectare for Eucalyptus globules from the tree layers and from 50 for Dombeya torrida and Erica arborea to 900 individuals per hectare for Myrsine africana from shrub layers. Based on importance value index (IVI), Eucalyptus globulus and Juniperus procera showed the highest IVI of 96.37 and 54.80, respectively as compared to other species. The forest structure showed higher contagious distribution where out of the recorded 44 species, 37 species showed contagious distribution. The result also showed poor regeneration potential in all studied forest layers. Based on the landuse/cover analysis, the phytosociological study and field observation, this study recommends six urban forest zoning.

Some recent research has considered modifying this standard present value model by acknowledging that returns from the market may be discounted at a different interest rate than returns from government payments (Goodwin, Mishra, and Ortal-Magne) and also that the discount rate itself may be time-varying.  However, very little research has considered how changes in the overall risk to agriculture may affect farmland values.  An exception is Moss, Shonkwiler and Schmitz (2004).  We use time series panel data from the USDA for United States, 1960-2004 and a structural equations model with latent variables for the rate of return on farm assets and for the real risk-adjusted interest rate. We find that a secondary effect of agricultural policies that reduces the overall risk to agriculture may increase farmland values (and thus farm sector wealth). Government payments are offsetting the negative impact of high volatility of returns to farming.";"Mishra, Ashok K.

"AGRIS:US201400105213";"Forest cover change trajectories and their impact on landslide occurrence in the tropical Andes";"";"Tropical mountain regions are prone to landslide hazards. Given the current land pressure with increasing occupation of steep uplands, landslide hazards are expected to increase in the near future. Understanding the factors that control landslide hazards is therefore essential. Rare event logistic regression allows us to perform a robust detection of landslide controlling factors. This technique is here applied to the tropical Andes to evaluate the impact of dynamic land cover changes on landslide occurrences. Land cover change trajectories (i.e. dynamic evolution of land cover through time) were specifically included in the probabilistic landslide analysis. While natural physical processes such as slope undercutting by rivers and failure of oversteepened slopes are important in this tropical mountainous site, landslides are increasingly associated with human activities. The data show that land cover trajectories are associated with landslide patterns. In this humid mountainous site, forest degradation does not lead to a measurable increase in landslide occurrence. However, few years after forests are converted to pastures, a rapid decline of slope stability is observed. Land cover conversion from forest to pasture permanently reduces slope stability. It is assumed that major changes in soil properties and hydrology induced by the vegetation conversion play a role in accelerating landslide hazards.";"Guns, Marie

Detailed maps of modeled local carbon-dioxide emissions for a 4 km² residential neighborhood in Vancouver, BC, Canada are produced. Inputs to the emission model include urban object classifications (buildings, trees, land-cover) automatically derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and optical remote sensing in combination with census, assessment, traffic and measured radiation and climate data. Different sub-models for buildings, transportation, human respiration, soils and vegetation were aggregated. Annual and monthly CO₂ emissions were modeled on a spatial grid of 50 m for the entire study area. The study area overlaps with the source area of a micrometeorological flux tower for which continuous CO₂ flux data (net exchange) were available for a two-year period. The measured annual total was 6.71 kg C m⁻² yr⁻¹with significant seasonal differences (16.0 g C m⁻² day⁻¹ in Aug vs. 22.1 g C m⁻² day⁻¹ in Dec correlated with the demand for space heating) and weekday-weekend differences (25% lower emissions on weekends attributed to traffic volume differences). Model results were weighted using the long-term turbulent source areas of the tower. Annual total modeled (7.42 kg C m⁻² yr⁻¹) and measured emissions agreed within 11%, but show more substantial differences in wind sectors dominated by traffic emissions. Over the year, agreement was better in summer (5% overestimation by model) vs. winter (15% overestimation), which is partially attributed to climate differences unaccounted for in the building energy models. The study shows that direct CO₂ flux measurements based on the EC approach - if sites are carefully chosen - are a promising method to validate fine-scale emission inventories/models at the block or neighborhood scale and can inform further model improvements.";"Christen, A.

By exploiting periods of high and low appreciation that caused various increases in wealth for farmers owning various shares of their farmland, we examine whether U.S. grain farmers expanded their acres harvested or acres owned in response to an increase in their land wealth. We find that land wealth had little effect on farm size. However, for similarly-sized farms, a larger ownership share (10 percentage points) led to an increase in the growth of land owned (2 percentage points). Because older farmers own more of the land that they farm, greater land appreciation slows the rate at which younger farmers acquire land relative to older farmers.";"Weber, Jeremy G.

Better characterization of surface albedo for individual land cover types can reduce the uncertainty in estimating changes to Earth’s radiation balance due to land cover change. This paper presents new albedo look-up maps (LUM) using a multi-scale hierarchical approach based on MODIS BRDF/albedo products and Landsat imagery. Ten years (2001-2011) of MODIS BRDF/albedo products were used to generate global albedo climatology. Albedo LUMs of land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) at multiple spatial resolutions were generated. The albedo LUMs included monthly statistics of white-sky (diffuse) and black-sky (direct) albedo of each IGBP class for visible, near infra-red and shortwave broadband under both snow-free and snow-covered conditions. The albedo LUMs were assessed by using the annual MODIS IGBP land cover map and the projected land use scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Land-Use Harmonization (LUH) project. The comparisons between the reconstructed albedo and the MODIS albedo data product show good agreements. The LUMs provide high temporal and spatial resolution global albedo statistics without gaps for investigating albedo variations under different land cover scenarios and could be used for land surface modeling.";"Gao, Feng

Although physically based estimates of surface reflectance (SR) ultimately provide the most accurate representation of Earth's surface properties, there has never been a globally consistent SR dataset at the spatial resolution (b1 ha) or temporal extent (~40 years) of the Landsat mission. To increase the consistency and robustness of Landsat-based land cover monitoring, we atmospherically corrected the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) implementation of the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum(6S) radiative transfer model. The GLS provides synoptic, orthorectified, cloud-free Landsat coverage of Earth's land area in four nominal epochs (1975, 1990, 2000, and 2005). This paper presents the resulting GLS surface reflectance dataset and a global assessment of the 2000- and 2005-epoch data against coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily SR and Normalized Bidirectional Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) measurements. Agreement with respect to MODIS SR and NBAR data is very high, with overall discrepancies (Root-Mean-Squared Deviation (RMSD)) between 1.3 and 2.8 percent reflectance for Landsat-7 Enhanced ThematicMapper Plus (ETM+) and between 2.2 and 3.5 percent reflectance for Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM). The resulting Landsat surface reflectance dataset and the associated qualitymetrics for each image are hosted on the Global Land Cover Facilityweb site for free download http://www.landcover.org/data/gls_SR).

This algorithm is based on an empirical rotation model and was tested on Landsat image pairs over the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee; Uinta–Wasatch–Cache National Forest, Utah; San Juan National Forest, Colorado; and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, California. The illumination correction process successfully eliminated correlation between Landsat reflectance and illumination condition. Comparison to forest-change maps derived from uncorrected images showed significant disagreement, ranging from 23% to 45%. Validated against high-resolution (1 m or less) time-serial images, the illumination correction decreased overestimation of forest gains and losses and improved specificity in detection of major forest changes. The overall accuracy increases 34% at the Cherokee Forest site and about 10% at the other three sites. The disagreement rate between change maps from the original and corrected Landsat images increased with increasing terrain inclination angle, with the relationship between illumination condition and the disagreement rate following a V-shaped curve that varied among sites. The lowest disagreement rate occurred when illumination condition was slightly smaller than that of a horizontal field. The correction for topographic illumination should be considered as a standard pre-processing step for land cover classification and land use change detection, especially for mountainous areas.";"Tan, Bin

This study leverages the unique characteristics of a national land-based USDA survey on farmland values and cash rents to estimate broad, national-level determinants of the market value of cropland and pastureland.

Field surveys of herpetofauna were conducted during 1994-2000 in Tochigi Prefecture, which covers ca. 6400 km_ of mainland Japan and includes a wide range of elevation, annual mean temperature, and human population densities. We evaluated whether (i) regional herpetofauna are distributed along a gradient of climate and elevation, as well as land cover and land use, and (ii) 'climate/elevation' and 'landcover' variables differ in their relative contribution. Ordination indicated a strong geographic gradient in species composition that was correlated with climate, elevation, land cover and land use. Reptiles were strongly influenced by land cover and land use (residential, agricultural, and forested area), while amphibians responded to all gradients (climate, elevation, and land cover and land use). All species with declining populations listed in the Prefectural Red Data Book were associated with mid-elevation regions, where anthropogenic modification is most intensive.

"AGRIS:US201301537645";"Regulating industrial forest concessions in Central Africa and South America";"";"Tropical countries face special specific problems in implementing sustainable forest management (SFM). In many countries, questions are raised on whether tropical forests should be publicly, commonly or privately owned and managed in order to enhance sustainability. Other debates also focus on whether small-scale enterprises are better positioned than large-scale industrial concessions to reduce poverty and attain sustainable management. In countries where large tracts of forest are state-owned, concessions are viewed as a means of delivering services of public and collective interest through an association of private investment and public regulation. However, the success of an industrial concession model in countries with large forest resource endowment to achieve multiple goals such as sustainable forest management and local/regional development depends on two critical assumptions. First, forest functions and services should be managed and maintained as public goods. In many cases, additional uses - and corresponding rights - can take place alongside logging activities. Industrial concessions can be more efficient than other tenure models (such as community-based forest management and small-scale enterprises) in achieving SFM, add value to raw material and comply with growing environmental norms. This is especially the case in market-remote areas with low population density and poor infrastructure. Secondly, to achieve these different outcomes, any concession system needs to be monitored and regulated, especially in contexts dominated by asymmetrical information between regulating authorities and concessionaires. New institutional responses have recently been put forward in several countries, providing valuable materials to design a renewed policy mix which associates public and private incentives. This paper provides a survey of the experience of forest concessions in several Central African and South American countries. The concession system is examined in order to clarify the issues involved, the problems encountered, and what can be learned from the shared experience of these countries in the last decade. This paper argues that despite a sometimes patchy record, concessions can help promote SFM so long as they are packaged with a certain number of specific measures.";"Karsenty, Alain

Peri-urban forests are under strong anthropic pressure. Any activity needs a previous identification of stakeholders, landscape perception, socio-economic trends in local communities and their relationships with land and natural resources. Kinshasa (capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC) is a 10 millions inhabitants city with rapid growth and increasing impacts on surrounding villages linked with forest natural resources. This paper describes the relationship amongst local communities stakeholders and their relations with land areas and wood resources. Two areas surrounding Kinshasa (Bas-Congo and Bateke Plateaux) are considered as major fuel-wood and charcoal supply zones for the city. Those two areas are different in terms of land pressure (very high in Bas-Congo and focused on riparian forests on Bateke Plateaux), but show the same pattern of overuse of the forest and woody natural resources. In both areas, local management of forest resources by the traditional authorities (heads of village or lineage) has failed. Local population willingness for reforestation and forest restoration activities is much more important in Bas-Congo than on Bateke Plateaux. In both areas, shifting cultivation due to slash and burn practices for agricultural and charcoal practices are more and more quick. This has strong negative impact on the potential of regeneration process with local forest species. Sustainability of forest natural resources management by communities is discussed in regard to the on going negotiations on community based forest management regulations.";"Vermeulen, C.

Knowledge of the suitability of the land to behave as an ecological corridor thus provides very significant input to land-use planning. Nature conservation and land-use planning are by their nature spatial problems.

The present paper proposes the integration of the GIS with a specific MCA technique, named Analytic Network Process to assess the ecological value of the land in the Piedmont Region (northern Italy). The results are obtained in the form of maps to be used as decision variables in planning.

In Ethiopia, many of these soil conservation projects were implemented following the severe drought of 1974. To capture long-term impacts of these initiatives, a study was conducted in Anjenie Watershed of Ethiopia, assessing fanya juu terraces and grass strips constructed in a pilot project in 1984, and which are still functional 25 years later. Data were collected from government records, field observations and questionnaire surveys administered to 60 farmers. Half of the respondent had terraced farms in the watershed former project area (with technology) and the rest were outside the terraced area (without technology). The crops assessed were teff, barley and maize. Cost–benefit analyses were used to determine the economic benefits with and without terraces, including gross and net profit values, returns on labour, water productivity and impacts on poverty. The results indicated that soil and water conservation had improved crop productivity. The average yields on terraced fields for teff, barley and maize were 0.95tha⁻¹ (control 0.49), 1.86tha⁻¹ (control 0.61), and 1.73tha⁻¹ (control 0.77), respectively. The net benefit was significantly higher on terraced fields, recording US$ 20.9 (US$ −112 control) for teff, US$ 185 (US$ −41 control) for barley and US$ −34.5 (US$ −101 control)ha⁻¹yr⁻¹ for maize, respectively. The returns on family labour were 2.33, 1.01 and 0.739US$man-day⁻¹ for barley, teff and maize grown on terraced plots compared to US$ 0.44, 0.27 and 0.16man-day⁻¹ for without, respectively. Using a discount rate of 10%, the average net present value (NPV) of barley production with terrace was found to be about US$ 1542 over a period of 50 years. In addition, the average financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was 301%. Other long-term impacts of terracing included farmers’ growing of maize on terraced fields as a result of water conservation. Currently, farmers also grow barley on terraced fields for two crop seasons per year unlike the experiences on farms without terraces. Household incomes and food security had improved and soil erosion drastically reduced. Many farmers had adopted terracing doubling the original area under the soil conservation pilot project and consequently improving environmental conservation in the watershed.";"Adgo, Enyew

"AGRIS:US201500082742";"Combining the effects of surrounding land-use and propagule pressure to predict the distribution of an invasive plant";"";"The distribution of invasive plants across a landscape is largely governed by disturbance invoking anthropogenic land-use practices and propagule pressure. However, spatial variability associated with anthropogenic disturbances and propagule pressure is seldom used to develop distribution models of invasive plants. This study makes use of large-scale survey data to develop a spatially explicit predictive model for the invasive wetland plant—purple loosestrife. Using loosestrife presence data and land use land cover information, we first predicted loosestrife occurrences in two types of wetland habitat, namely herbaceous wetlands and open-water edges, with a series of logistic regression models that incorporated surrounding land-use at three different neighborhood scales. The best-fitting surrounding land-use model was then combined with three different distance constraint models that simulated propagule pressure. Loosestrife occurrence as a function of surrounding land-use showed best fit at a neighborhood radius of 400 m. Predictions made from the surrounding land-use model at the 400 m scale were fairly accurate and loosestrife invasion of wetland locations were correlated with the proportion of anthropogenic land-use conditions. Inclusion of an autocovariate simulating propagule pressure improved model fit and performance significantly. Model findings suggest that spatially explicit incorporation of surrounding land-use yields an ecologically realistic projection of invasion risk wherein disturbance prone habitat edges tend to be more invasible. Combining this prediction with location specific estimates of propagule pressure further reduces uncertainty by spatially constraining areas of high invasion risk. Our approach is applicable to other invasive plants since it is based on two key drivers of plant invasion: disturbance and propagule-pressure.";"Thomas, Shyam M.

"AGRIS:US201600185862";"Impacts of internal and external policies on land change in Uruguay, 2001â2009";"";"Policies play a pivotal role in determining land change. Uruguay has been subject to first a rise and then decline in plantations of exotic trees as a result of internal Uruguayan government policies, and a recent substantial increase in soybean cultivation that may be attributed to Argentinean policies. To properly assess the relationship between land change and changes in land-use policies, vegetation change for Uruguay from 2001 to 2009 was mapped using MODIS imagery. Between 2001 and 2009, the area covered by exotic tree plantations declined by 1435 kmÂ², and 34 681 kmÂ² of herbaceous cover was converted to agricultural cover, mainly soybean cultivation. Uruguay and Argentina implemented land-use policy changes following the 2002 economic collapse. Rapid increase in exotic tree plantations, mainly in the 1990s, may have been stimulated by Uruguayan government incentives, while their recent decline coincides with the subsequent elimination of these incentives. The rapid increase in soybean production may be largely attributed to recent tax regimes in Argentina and lack of export tax in Uruguay combining to provide a favourable financial climate for Uruguayan soybean cultivation. Soybean cultivation is predicted to continue to expand in Uruguay, while exotic tree plantations should also increase in importance owing to the recent establishment of the world's largest pulp mill.";"REDO, DANIEL J.

The species is frequently encountered in various types of habitats. We collected over 600 distributional records from available literature, museum collections, and our own field work and used bioclimatic and land cover characteristics to develop a model of potential distribution for M. watsonana . According to the model, the most important factors limiting the distribution of M. watsonana are: precipitation in wettest quarter exceeding 250–300 mm, precipitation in coldest quarter lower than 40 mm and exceeding 250 mm, altitudes above 2500 m and slopes steeper than 10.5°. The model suggests that most of the Iranian Plateau is suitable for the species except for some isolated areas such as the Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut deserts in Iran, Helmand basin in Afghanistan, the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan, the western Chagai-Kharan deserts of Pakistani Balochistan, and Thar and Cholistan deserts in eastern Pakistan. The most important factor in these regions appears to be the extremely low rainfall during coldest quarter of the year. The outer boundary of the distribution of M. watsonana follows important biogeographic barriers that are also clearly delimited by climatic conditions.";"Hosseinian Yousefkhani, Seyyed Saeed

"AGRIS:US201500217253";"Land suitability evaluation for development using a matter-element model: A case study in Zengcheng, Guangzhou, China";"";"Land suitability evaluation can assist in the efficient use of land resources at a regional level. This is an important issue because of the pressures that an increasing population and economic growth have put on limited land resources. Matter-element theory, which was first put forward by the Chinese mathematician Cai Wen, has shown potential for solving incompatibility problems. Based on the matter-element model, this paper uses land use, roads, water bodies, population density, distance from center of the city, geodetic height, and slope as factors in modeling land suitability for development. Zengcheng, an urban–rural administration was used as a case study for applying the matter-element model to assessing the suitability of land for development. The model was cross referenced with local urban plans for verification and the results of this study show that the model constructed was effective at assessing the suitability of land for development. According to both the classification map created using the matter-element model and the statistics on the of land suitability classes, the study area was found to have a considerable amount of land which is highly suitable for development. After the category ‘highly suitable’, the next largest total land area was in the category of ‘not suitable’ for development, while there was relatively little land classified as moderately and marginally suitable. The percentage of the total land area of each class of suitability was 41.80%, 34.22%, 16.35% and 7.64%, respectively. Apart from this, the study also demonstrated the advantage of matter-element models over fuzzy theory, as they provide much more information. For example, all integrated degree of all classes in the paper had ranges from −1 to 1, but differed from each other by percentage. In the category of ‘highly suitable’ only 45.51% of matter-elements fully conformed to the criteria (those within a range of 0–0.5925), while the remainder (54.49%) did not corresponded to the requirements of the category, but did have the potential to do so with relatively few changes (those within a range of −0.3923–0 degrees). This data provides us with an understanding of the potential and limitation to development of the land in the region.";"Gong, Jianzhou

"AGRIS:US201500217252";"Horse riding posing challenges to the Swedish Right of Public Access";"";"Increasing numbers of horses are being kept for sports and leisure purposes in peri-urban areas throughout the Western world. This expansion of the equestrian sector represents a multifunctional transition, with new production of rural goods and services and increasing influence on land use. In Sweden, the number of horses has increased from 70,000 to approximately 300,000 over the last 30 years. This increase is putting pressure on the traditional Right of Public Access, an old custom allowing the public to walk, cycle or ride on private or state-owned property. This paper analyses multifunctional land use in peri-urban areas in order to provide a deeper understanding of the potential conflicts arising due to the expanding equine sector and to assess how these can affect the Swedish right of public access and spatial planning. A survey of horse riders and landowners in three peri-urban regions of Sweden revealed that these groups differ in their attitudes towards the Right of Public Access. The data also showed that the expanding equine sector is generating new demands on rural areas and there are questions regarding how the current system of open accessibility can meet the increasing market for equestrian leisure activities. The main conclusion is that there seems to be a strong need for intervention and deliberate creation of new ways of handling the accessibility question, where both a bottom-up and top-down approach may be useful.";"Elgåker, Hanna

"AGRIS:US2016202151";"Effectiveness of Trade Sanctions as an Enforcement Mechanism in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Agreements in Agriculture and Forestry";"";"This study explores the conditions under which a trade sanction can be an effective enforcement mechanism used by the US against China in global greenhouse (GHG) mitigation in agriculture and forestry. The problem has the structure of prisoner’s dilemma and hence both the US and China have incentive to free-ride in GHG emissions abatement. It is found that if the US joined the rest of the world (ROW) in emissions abatement in agriculture and forestry, the US could also convince China to comply with abatement using trade sanctions. In this study, trade sanctions are considered as a deterrent to free-riding. For threats of trade sanctions to become a viable enforcement mechanism tariff rates have to achieve two conditions defined in this study: credibility and effectiveness. In a scenario where China is the only region refusing to implement an emissions tax on its GHG from agricultural and forestry sectors it is shown that there may be a window in which trade sanctions constitute a viable enforcement mechanism for the environmental agreement. This window is depicted by tariff rates below 9% (these rates achieve credibility) and above an increasing lower bound (denoting rates achieving effectiveness). The lower bound intersects 9% at a carbon tax of $80/TCE implying that; 1) at carbon taxes above $80/TCE trade sanctions are no longer a viable enforcement mechanism for the environmental agreement, and 2) the viability of trade sanctions as an enforcement mechanism may be limited to a certain level of targeted abatement.";"Irfanoglu, Zeynep Burcu

The paper presents an original method dealing with the forest site types delineation. The suggested method consists in integrating a typological key in a GIS aiming at producing a thematic map that describes forest site types. Data used are the soil map of Belgium (digitized at the scale 1:20,000) and a digital elevation model built from a topographic map (scale 1:10,000). The typological key is mainly based on the methodology used by Thill et al. (1988) in the site types system for central Ardenne, the potential vegetation map of Sougnez and Dethioux (1975) and the ecoregion map of Delvaux and Galoux (1962). In that respect, site types are closely linked to the soil map and the phytosociological classification. So, they can be connected to the afforestation guide and different phytosociological and autecological studies concerning forest species. It is then possible to map the potential habitats or the site potentialities related to tree species. The key is valid for the Ardenne ecoregion located in Southern Belgium (elevation higher than 300 m). It has to be validated through an intensive use in the field, taking into account its imprecision linked to the types of collected data, chieffly those being digitized. The integration of such a tool in a SIG can be considered as an original way in terms of integrated forest management or forest sites description in the context of the project """"Natura 2000"""" launched by the European Union.

"AGRIS:US201600191354";"Exploring local consequences of two land-use alternatives for the supply of urban ecosystem services in Stockholm year 2050";"";"Ecosystem services (ESs) are gaining ground in urban policy as a key to attaining sustainable cities. However, strategic and land-use planners need operational and accessible tools to better understand the consequences of policy and planning measures. Based on a study of the City of Stockholm and its surrounding region, we argue that spatially explicit land-use mapping is a good base for modeling and visualizing the supply of urban ESs provided by different patterns of Service Providing Units. By adding more detailed characteristics of land use through the concept of Service Providing Elements (SPEs), and by assessing synergies and trade-offs between these attributes, implications for the supply of ESs at different scale levels could be identified and discussed. Detailed land-use mapping and ES modeling were applied to two future land-use alternatives. The supply of eight urban ESs was found to vary significantly between the two alternatives depending on the ratios of different SPEs, even within identical land-use classes. One of the land-use alternatives had significantly higher potential for food and energy provision, much higher air cooling and air quality regulation capacity especially in densely built areas, showed less surface sealing, and provided better conditions for mental recreation. The exception was supply of physical recreation opportunities, where the other land-use option had an advantage. These differences became more accentuated when we zoomed in on two local urban areas. Based on these findings, our main conclusion is that, in order to provide planning and policy-making with an adequate knowledge base, it is necessary to move beyond land-use classes, as defined by European data sets like Urban Atlas, and toward tools capable of capturing more detailed aspects of land use and its relations to the supply of urban ESs. This should be made a priority, especially in early stages of planning and policy formation, and also used to support development of urban by-laws, procurement arrangements, neighborhood and building certification, etc. The approaches used in the study can serve as a valid starting point for further development of such tools and methods compatible with plannersâ ordinary working modes. However, to make such progress possible, the ecosystem service research community needs to step up to the challenge of delivering locally specific and useful data on how urban land-use links to ES supply, including synergies and trade-offs between different ESs.";"Kain, Jaan-Henrik

"AGRIS:US201600006049";"Ecohealth and Aboriginal Testimony of the Nexus Between Human Health and Place";"";"The spread of industrial civilizations has been particularly traumatic for the last remaining hunter-gatherer societies. Manifestations of this include expatriation from ancestral lands, sickness, poverty, and environmental degradation. Northern Australia has been no exception despite remaining a stronghold of Aboriginal cultures and still containing vast areas of relatively intact landscapes. Most Aboriginal people reside in remote settlements where they remain on the negative extreme of basic indicators such as life expectancy and educational attainment. In addition, biodiversity declines are being documented from loss of Aboriginal fire management and invasion by feral species. There has been little consideration of potential health, social, economic, or environmental benefits of routinely hunting, gathering or being on their land. This reflects a Western philosophical position that segregates land management and health policy, a view at odds with Aboriginal peoples’ testimony of the indivisibility of people and land. Here we report perspectives from Arnhemland gathered through observation and unstructured and semistructured interviews. Themes that emerged included the high level of detailed, complex knowledge of their traditionally owned lands, the perceived urgency about passing this on to younger people, and the need that both land and people have for each other for the well-being of both. Primary motivations for returning to traditional lands were gathering food, escaping from stresses, and educating young people. The many barriers included no transport, family problems, frequent funerals, and other cultural or family obligations. This work forms part of a larger transdisciplinary research program that aims to inform policy about sustainable futures in northern Australia.";"Johnston, Fay H.

Three indicators of components’ balance have been proposed and tested for spatial and temporal coherence.

Participatory approaches were used to describe and map the indigenous land unit (ILU) classification system in four villages. Soil and crop analyses indicated good correspondence between conventional productivity assessments and farmers' more qualitative descriptions of the ILUs. Patterns of land ownership were investigated to explore the relationship between the diversity of ILU land-holding, location and history of settlement. Results demonstrated that farmers have developed a sophisticated yet practical framework for managing their land that integrates knowledge of land type, productivity and optimum management under different rainfall scenarios in an unpredictable environment. The framework also clarified the perspective of farmers with regard to growing grain legumes. Their apparent reluctance was more often a pragmatic and rational decision to use the land for something more suitable. The authors conclude that an understanding of this framework offers real benefits to local professionals working for extension institutions and NGOs in agricultural development in northern Namibia, particularly in allowing the targeting of relevant interventions and support to specific farmer groups. It is likely that the practical approach to documenting and exploring the utility of local land-related knowledge systems used in this research has broad applicability in Africa and beyond.";"Hillyer, A.E.M.

"AGRIS:US201500082525";"Influencing factors on the implementation of forest reserves in Switzerland";"";"In 1999, an international expert team found the neglect of biodiversity issues in Swiss forest policy to be one of its biggest weaknesses. Influenced by this scientific assessment, the Federal Forest Agency developed forest reserve guidelines with measurable objectives in cooperation with the constituent states (cantons). To assess the outcomes of the Swiss forest reserve concept, we surveyed cantons’ implementation degree in 2011. In a previous paper, Kaeser et al. (For Policy Econ 3:6–13, 2013) discussed the survey’s results from the perspective of new forms of governance in Swiss biodiversity policy. However, the use of different governance approaches could only partly account for the differences between the cantons’ forest reserve areas. As a continuation of this study, the present paper contributes to the discussion about the influencing factors on the implementation of forest reserves in Swiss cantons. For this purpose, we examine the effect of institutional drivers, public policies, property rights and user conflicts in 22 Swiss cantons on their forest reserve areas by using a multiple regression. The effect of financial conditions and the share of protective forest of the cantons on forest reserves is statistically significant. The findings indicate that the potential for forest reserves in protective forests in the mountains has been neglected so far. A combination of forest reserves and protective forests could result in a win–win-situation of ‘less effort for the management of protective forest’ and ‘more biodiversity’.";"Kaeser, Alexandra

"AGRIS:US201400141266";"Vulnerability of African mammals to anthropogenic climate change under conservative land transformation assumptions";"";"Recent observations show that human-induced climate change (CC) and land transformation (LT) are threatening wildlife globally. Thus, there is a need to assess the sensitivity of wildlife on large spatial scales and evaluate whether national parks (NPs), a key conservation tools used to protect species, will meet their mandate under future CC and LT conditions. Here, we assess the sensitivity of 277 mammals at African scale to CC at 10[prime] resolution, using static LT assumptions in a 'first-cut' estimate, in the absence of credible future LT trends. We examine the relationship between species' current distribution and macroclimatic variables using generalized additive models, and include LT indirectly as a filter. Future projections are derived using two CC scenarios (for 2050 and 2080) to estimate the spatial patterns of loss and gain in species richness that might ultimately result. We then apply the IUCN Red List criteria A3(c) of potential range loss to evaluate species sensitivity. We finally estimate the sensitivity of 141 NPs in terms of both species richness and turnover. Assuming no spread of species, 10-15% of the species are projected to fall within the critically endangered or extinct categories by 2050 and between 25% and 40% by 2080. Assuming unlimited species spread, less extreme results show proportions dropping to approximately 10-20% by 2080. Spatial patterns of richness loss and gain show contrasting latitudinal patterns with a westward range shift of species around the species-rich equatorial zone in central Africa, and an eastward shift in southern Africa, mainly because of latitudinal aridity gradients across these ecological transition zones. Xeric shrubland NPs may face significant richness losses not compensated by species influxes. Other NPs might expect substantial losses and influxes of species. On balance, the NPs might ultimately realize a substantial shift in the mammalian species composition of a magnitude unprecedented in recent geological time. To conclude, the effects of global CC and LT on wildlife communities may be most noticeable not as a loss of species from their current ranges, but instead as a fundamental change in community composition.";"Thuiller, Wilfried

"AGRIS:US201600058211";"Assessment of SAR speckle filters in the context of object-based image analysis";"";"The initial step in most object-based classification methodologies is the application of a segmentation algorithm to define objects. In the context of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis, the presence of speckle noise might hamper the segmentation quality. The aim of this study is to assess the segmentation performance of SAR images when no filter or different filters are applied before segmentation. In particular, the performance of the mean-shift segmentation algorithm combined with different adaptive and non-adaptive filters is assessed based on both synthetic and natural SAR images. Studied filters include the non-adaptive Boxcar filter and four adaptive filters: the well-known Refined Lee filter and three recently proposed non-local filters differing, in particular, in their dissimilarity criteria: the Hellinger and the Kullback–Leibler filters are based on stochastic distances, whereas the NL-SAR filter is based on the generalized likelihood ratio. Two measures were used for quality assessment: -index and -index. Over-segmentation was assessed by the -index, the ratio of the resulting number of segments to the number of connected components of the ground-truth classes. The accuracy of the best possible classification given on the segmentation result was assessed with ground truth information by maximizing the -index. A Monte Carlo experiment conducted on synthetic images shows that the quality measures significantly differ for the applied filters. Our results indicate that the use of an adaptive filter improves the performance of the segmentation. In particular, the combination of the mean-shift segmentation algorithm with the NL-SAR filter gives the best results and the resulting process is less sensitive to variations in the mean-shift operational parameters than when applying other filters or no filter. The results obtained may help improve the reliability of land-cover classification analyses based on an object-based approach on SAR data.";"Morandeira, N. S.

From 2000 to 2002 the number of farmers who had converted to organic farming in South Africa increased sixfold, and although organic farming still accounts only for a minute percentage of the total number agricultural producers, the increasing importance of this sector is apparent. Based on survey results, information was gathered about organic farmers in South Africa concerning socio-demographic aspects, farming operations, motivations and problems of the conversion process. These results were analysed in the context of possibilities to support the organic farming movement theoretically and practically.
With respect to the findings it is recommended that the conversion to organic farming should be supported, not necessarily via direct financial support to the organic farmers, but by means of different instruments such as the development of an improved infrastructure for marketing, networking and information exchange. Several areas for future research are identified to increase our understanding of organic farming in the South African context.";"Niemeyer, Katharina

"AGRIS:US201500220963";"Impact of land cover homogenization on the Corncrake (Crex crex) in traditional farmland";"";"CONTEXT: The loss of landscape heterogeneity is causing declines of farmland biodiversity around the world. Traditional farmland regions are often highly heterogeneous and harbor high biodiversity, but are under threat of land cover homogenization due to changing agricultural practices. One species potentially affected by landscape homogenization is the Corncrake (Crex crex), which is threatened in Western Europe but remains widespread in the traditional farmland regions of Eastern Europe. OBJECTIVES: In this study we present a case study aiming to assess the potential threat of landscape homogenization for the Corncrake in Romania. We first examined current Corncrake distribution in relation to woody vegetation cover, landscape heterogeneity, and topography (measured at three different spatial scales), as well as human disturbance, throughout the existing agricultural mosaic. Second, we predicted potential future distribution of suitable Corncrake habitat in response to land cover homogenization by simulating a reduction in land cover diversity. RESULTS: Corncrakes were present in grassland and arable fields, and preferentially occupied remote areas that were wet and flat, and had high land cover diversity at the 100 ha scale. The simulation of land cover diversity loss revealed that even a moderate reduction of land cover diversity could drastically reduce the extent of suitable Corncrake habitat. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the high conservation value of traditional heterogeneous farmland for the Corncrake. Therefore, to protect the Corncrake in traditional farmland, pro-active policy measures should encourage the continuation of mixed farming practices to maintain a diversity of land covers.";"Dorresteijn, Ine

"AGRIS:US201500220961";"effect of landscape structure on two species of different trophic levels in an arid environment";"";"CONTEXT: Insect species of different trophic level will respond differently to landscape configuration. OBJECTIVE: In this context we explore the way landscape structure affects the distribution and abundance of the whitefly Siphoninus phillyreae and its predator Clitostethus arcuatus in olive orchards. METHODS: Adult individuals of these two species were collected using sticky traps placed in 12 olive host patches in Argentina. Host patches were detected and quantified using Landsat 5 TM images. Different landscape metrics were estimated for the study area land covers. PLSR analysis techniques were employed to relate the mean abundance of the studied species and the landscape measures. RESULTS: The Landsat land use estimations showed that most of the vegetation is limited to particular irrigated spots or urban areas. 89 % of the land cover is exposed soil, 10 % is xerophytic vegetation, 0.56 % is introduced urban vegetation and 0.31 % is occupied by olive orchards. S. phillyreae was positively affected by total area of olive orchards, followed by total area of urban vegetation, and negatively affected by the perimeter of olive focal patch and the proximity of other urban vegetation patches. C. arcuatus was positively affected by the perimeter of the host patch, the total area of olive orchards and the mean proximity of urban vegetation patches. CONCLUSION: We concluded that although the total area of the herbivore host was the most influential variable affecting the two species, each of them was affected in different way by other landscape elements.";"Grilli, Mariano P.

"AGRIS:FR2014017431";"Categorising farming practices to design sustainable land-use management in mountain areas";"";"In European mountain areas, shrub encroachment resulting from farmland abandonment is most often managed by mechanical operations such as roller chopping or controlled burning, which have proved to be ineffective and unsustainable. Recent agroecological findings highlight the potential impact of grazing on long-term shrub dynamics. We thus explored the potential contribution of livestock farms to the management of shrub encroachment. We studied the diversity of livestock practices and strategies on the scale of a small mountain valley in France where a land-use management plan was initiated. We interviewed 33 livestock farmers with a comprehensive approach and analysed the data in partnership with local land-use managers. To categorise farming practices, we used an innovative constructivist method based on knowledge engineering techniques and tools such as repertory grids. Our results show that the diversity of land-use practices can be summed up by ten practices related to three management domains: (i) livestock management, that is, splitting herds into batches, leading animals to pasture and breeding choices; (ii) the feeding system, including indoor feeding during the year, the hierarchy between haymaking and grazing in spring and the system’s forage autonomy; and (iii) farmland utilisation and maintenance, which comprises hillside use, spatial configuration of grazed areas, maintenance practices and technical choices to cut meadows. We also show that farmers combine these practices within six types of strategies: ensuring feeding security and simplifying labour (type A), maintaining farmland heritage (type B), taking advantage of hillsides (type C), focusing on animal care (type D), combining areas, periods and batches (type E), or selling on local markets (type F). This makes it possible to identify: (1) farmers’ strategies that have the greatest impact on shrub encroachment; and (2) practices that may develop into more sustainable management of shrub encroachment. Our work is thus a first step in developing sustainable land-use management plans in rural areas threatened by shrub encroachment. In return, this deep understanding of farmers’ strategies allowed us to address socially pertinent scientific issues related to the dynamics of grazed plant communities.";"Girard-Fourty , Nathalie

In this study we develop a comprehensive and consistent framework for analyzing the global economic interactions and the direct and indirect impacts of biofuels production on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We utilize a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model which consists of interaction of energy commodities with explicit biofuels and their by-product sectors, land endowment classified by agro-ecological zones, and emission of four major GHGs - carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases from agricultural and economic activities, including emissions associated with biofuel feedstock, crop conversion to fuel, and land cover conversion through change in ecosystem carbon stock. This study also pays special attention to pasture-crop and Conservative Reserve Program land due to their potential sectoral competition for land. In this paper, we examine the proposed policies for biofuels expansion in the US, EU and Brazil, as well as alternative potential trajectories of larger and smaller growth, including a collapse of the traditional biofuels market. The impact on GHG emissions are decomposed and associated with the individual drivers behind the biofuels boom, including: changes in subsidies, rising oil prices, and other major policy drivers.";"Birur, Dileep K.

Of special concern is the loss of mangrove forest in coastal areas such as Quang Ninh, Vietnam, which is adjacent to the World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay. Understanding the status and changes of land cover/land use for coastal shrimp farms and mangrove forests can support environmental protection and decision-making for sustainable development in coastal areas. Within this context, this paper uses the 1999/2001 Landsat ETM+ and the 2008 ALOS AVNIR-2 imagery to investigate the contraction and expansion of shrimp farms and mangrove forests in coastal areas of Ha Long and Mong Cai, which now have a high concentration of intensive and semi-intensive shrimp farms. Images were separately analyzed and classified before using post-classification comparisons to detect land cover/land use changes in the study area. The results of this study found that the area of mangrove forest has been reduced by an estimated 927.5� ha in Ha Long and 1,144.4� ha in Mong Cai, while shrimp farming areas increased by an estimated 1,195.9 and 1,702.5� ha, respectively, over the same period. The majority of shrimp farms in Mong Cai were established at the expense of mangrove forest (49.4� %) while shrimp farms in Ha Long were mainly constructed on areas previously occupied by bare ground (46.5� %) and a significant proportion also replaced mangroves (23.9� %). The remarkable rate of mangrove loss and shrimp farming expansion detected in this study, over a relatively short time scale indicate that greater awareness of environmental impacts of shrimp farm expansion is required if this industry is to be sustainable, the important estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems are to be protected over the long term, and the capturing and storing of carbon in mangrove systems are to be enhanced for global climate change mitigation and for use as carbon offsets.";"Bui, Thuyet D.

"AGRIS:US201301825088";"Do ecological networks in South African commercial forests benefit grassland birds? A case study of a pine plantation in KwaZulu-Natal";"";"Grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and fragmented, but are poorly protected. Commercial afforestation poses a particular threat to grassland biodiversity because areas suitable for forestry coincide with those supporting the greatest richness of endemic and threatened biota. To comply with international forestry standards, commercial timber growers leave “ecological networks” of interconnected open corridors within plantations: however, the value of these networks for conservation is unclear. This study investigated how bird community composition, richness and density were influenced by habitat extent, connectivity and quality in a grassland ecological network in a forestry plantation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed birds and measured local vegetation characteristics throughout the network. There were at least five open habitat types within the network and bird communities responded clearly to differences between these habitats: all network communities showed a distinct shift away from those typical of control grasslands. There were three distinct groups of species in the network: (1) grassland specialists, (2) habitat generalists and (3) non-grassland species. Grassland specialists were restricted to areas that are burned regularly and to large, contiguous open areas or wide grassland corridors. We found no evidence for the importance of physical connectivity among open habitats for birds in the study area. Instead, it appears that the establishment of so-called ecological networks at this scale has created much unsuitable habitat for grassland specialist species. We suggest consolidation of open areas and a rotational, biennial burning regime as a more appropriate management strategy for commercial plantations in these Critically Endangered montane grasslands.";"Lipsey, Marisa K.

Standardized interviews with farmers assessed agricultural practices in terms of agricultural inputs (nitrogen fertilization and pesticides), livestock density and crop types. The proportion of semi-natural habitats was calculated for each site. We showed negative effects of agricultural intensification on species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees. By contrast, bee species richness increased with the amount of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Using a co-inertia analysis, we found an opposition between two types of agricultural specialization: towards crop production or towards animal husbandry. Species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees were greater in sites turned towards crop production. In these sites, flowering crops provided abundant food resources for bees whereas, in the other group of sites, intensive animal husbandry led to landscapes dominated by forage crops rather than flower-rich permanent grasslands. We also showed that bumblebees seemed to be less sensitive to agricultural intensification than solitary bees.";"Le Féon, Violette

Ground-truthed satellite image analysis indicates that between 1987 and 1996, net reforestation occurred in the 1,015.12 km2 study region. While some reforestation can be attributed to a 1987 ban on logging, the area of reforestation greatly exceeds that of previously clear-cut areas. Further, new area was also deforested between 1987-1996. Thus, the observed land-cover changes most likely represent a complex mosaic of changing land-use patterns across time and space. We estimate a random-effects probit model to capture drivers of land-cover change that are spatial, temporal or both.  We employ two techniques to correct for spatial error dependence in econometric analysis suitable to qualitative dependent variables.  Lastly, we simulate the impact of anticipated changes in transportation costs on land cover.  We find that market accessibility, increase in national coffee prices, and agricultural suitability are the most important determinants of recent land-cover change.";"Munroe, Darla K.

"AGRIS:US201400064670";"causes and spatial pattern of land degradation risk in southern Mauritania using multitemporal AVHRR-NDVI imagery and field data";"";"Multitemporal 1 km NOAA/AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maximum composite imagery was utilized in combination with rainfall, soil types, and field survey data on dominant rural activities to assess the risk of land degradation in southern Mauritania. Mauritania is one of eight continental West African Sahel countries that stretch from Chad to the northwestern Atlantic coast, and from the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert to the northern limit of the Sudanian climatic zone. The major environmental problem these countries are currently facing is the temporally and spatially erratic character of rainfall, frequently leading to general or local droughts since the late-1960s with subsequent increase of human pressure on the natural resource base and degradation. Image deviation was applied to maximum NDVI composites of the growing season (June to October) for the period 1990–99 to detect temporal and spatial change patterns over the study area. Only pixels whose values were lower than their temporal mean minus 0ċ5 standard deviation were retained as areas under threat. These were combined with soil types and the spatial pattern of deforestation (fuelwood and building material collection areas) grazing, and agricultural land to determine the causes of lowering primary biological productivity. The results show that the below-normal NDVI values generally coincide with the patterns of below-normal rainfall: deforestation, and overgrazing areas, agricultural land, and low primary biological productivity soil types. Thus the observed substantial decrease in biomass production results from the combined impacts of frequent rainfall deficits and uncontrolled resource-base exploitation by the local population. Large chunks of land that show consistent low biomass production are also observed on unproductive soils. Finally, the below-normal rainfall, below-average NDVI values, and human impacts images were cross-classified to produce a three-class (low, moderate, and high) land degradation risk map along with a table containing the area covered by each class. A Boolean mask of the degradation risk map applied to the soils map showed that all soil types in southern Mauritania are at risk of degradation. These products could serve as a strong basis for decision making in regard to planning resource allocation for environmental rehabilitation.";"Thiam, A.K.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"deforestation;land degradation;grazing";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"MRT;TCD";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400064670";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.533";"";"";"";"133-142"
"AGRIS:US201400138515";"Forest fragments modulate the provision of multiple ecosystem services";"";"Agricultural landscapes provide the essential ecosystem service of food to growing human populations; at the same time, agricultural expansion to increase crop production results in forest fragmentation, degrading many other forest‐dependent ecosystem services. However, surprisingly little is known about the role that forest fragments play in the provision of ecosystem services and how fragmentation affects landscape multifunctionality at scales relevant to land management decisions. We measured the provision of six ecosystem services (crop production, pest regulation, decomposition, carbon storage, soil fertility and water quality regulation) in soya bean fields at different distances from adjacent forest fragments that differed in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada. We observed significant effects of distance‐from‐forest, fragment isolation and fragment size on crop production, insect pest regulation, and decomposition. Distance‐from‐forest and fragment isolation had unique influences on service provision for each of the ecosystem services we measured. For example, pest regulation was maximized adjacent to forest fragments, while crop production was maximized at intermediate distances‐from‐forest. As a consequence, landscape multifunctionality depended on landscape heterogeneity: the range of field and forest fragment types present. We also observed strong negative and positive relationships between ecosystem services that were more prevalent at greater distances‐from‐forest. Synthesis and applications. Our study is one of the first to empirically measure and model the effects of forest fragments on the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem services in an agro‐ecosystem at the landscape and field scales relevant to landowners and managers. Our results demonstrate that forest fragments, irrespective of their size, can affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services in surrounding fields, but that this effect is mediated by fragment isolation across the landscape. Our results also suggest that managing habitat fragmentation and landscape structure will improve our ability to optimize ecosystem service provision and create multifunctional agricultural landscapes.";"Mitchell, Matthew G.

In order to describe the areas with high soil erosion risk (SER) and to develop adequate erosion prevention measures, SER in the DRR was assessed by integrating the CORINE model with GIS and RS. The main factors of soil erosion including erosivitiy, soil erodibility, topography and vegetation cover were determined from daily meteorological data, field survey soil profile data and soil sample analysis, digital elevation model (DEM), and land use and land cover (LULC), respectively. Landsat 5 TM imagery was used to generate a LULC classification. The results indicate that 59.1%, 31.2%, and 2.3% of the study area were under low, moderate, and high actual erosion risks, respectively. The results also indicate the study area is in low to moderate erosion risk level on the whole. The areas with moderate to high erosion risk continuously distributed in the southwest of the study area, and sporadically distributed in the north of the study area. Low erosion risk areas mainly located in the east. Up till now, most of the semi-quantitative models have not been applied extensively.

"AGRIS:US201500008100";"Soil microbial properties and temporal stability in degraded and restored lands of Northeast Brazil";"";"Human activities, such as land use change, cause severe land degradation in many ecosystems around the globe with potential impacts on soil processes. Restoration practices aim at reverting such impacts and reconstituting the biotic composition and functioning of an ecosystem to its initial condition. The aim of this study was to monitor soil microbial properties in degraded lands in Northeast Brazil and to compare those with land under restoration. Soil samplings were conducted in 2009, 2010 and 2011 in two different seasons (wet and dry season) at sites differing in degradation status: native vegetation (NAT), moderately degraded land (MDL), highly degraded land (HDL), and land under restoration for four years (RES). Soil microbial properties showed pronounced fluctuations between seasons with higher levels of functioning in the wet than in the dry season. Soil microbial biomass and enzymes had significantly higher values under native vegetation than in degraded land, while restored land mostly corresponded to native vegetation. Soil microbial biomass, respiratory quotient and enzyme activities were more strongly affected by land degradation than soil chemical properties. Soil microbial properties varied more between seasons and years in highly degraded land than under native vegetation suggesting a buffering effect of the native vegetation on soil microbial processes. However, land degradation effects on soil microbial properties were significant in both seasons. Moreover, our results indicate that the land restoration practice applied here shifted soil microbial community composition as indicated by soil microbial stoichiometry. Our results indicate that land degradation strongly deteriorates soil microbial properties and their stability in time, but that land restoration practices likely are successful in promoting the recovery of some soil microbial functions, even after only four years. However, shifts in soil microbial community composition in restored lands may have significant feedback effects on element cycles.";"Araújo, Ademir Sérgio Ferreira

"AGRIS:FR2016224020";"Landscape economics: the road ahead";"";"The aims of this paper are to delineate some important topics in landscape economics, and also to put landscape policy in the perspective of the sustainable development. The research issue is about the relationships between the development paths and landscape changes, paved with examples of consensus, controversies, and conflicts. Landscape is a polysemic term, many approaches and definitions exist for it, and as a consequence, economists should adopt or elaborate their own landscape definition or concept (the most suitable to their general methodology, and related to their most familiar concepts). Landscape appears to be a local public good. That definition correspond to the property rights market failure arising from the co-visibility. Co-visibility makes it difficult in general to identify precisely the link between each owner action and the agregate landscape outcome. As a consequence, landscape ownership appears to be scattered into a multiplicity of actors of various nature (individual, communal, statal…). How to exploit that analogy with non point source pollution is a challenge for landscape economics research. Each actor has his own objective and management criteria, either for agricultural, forestry, industrial or residential activities. Moreover, there are multiple public policies aimed at sustaining each activity. Inevitably, public policies failures arise, and so the need for coordination actions aimed at landscape maintenance and preservation. Because the local public good nature of the landscape, it’s worth to look at the models of public good joint production. How to agregate actions from different land owners into a resulting landscape, or how to coordinate actions scattered among multiple landowners in order to get a specific desired outcome is a real challenge ? In some case, the responsability of changes is concentrated in the hand of few decision makers, in some others, the responsability is more diffuse, and the non point production function of the landscape could be approximated by an additive function. The issue of the agregation of actions is closely related to the one of preferences heterogeneity and agregation. Because a specific landscape project could be appreciated as beneficial or detrimental by different people, it’s necessary to separate the stage of evaluation, the stage of decision making and the stage of implementation. Issues of coordination of actions arising at the implementation stage should take for granted the landscape objectives and the social value of the project. Eventually, the design of Institutional arrangements to manage landscape should take onto account his nature of common pool resource. The paper is organized so as to take stock from the contributions of the research community in Landscape economics, and also to signal some missing links and promising paths. Naturally, our paper does not exhaust all the topics, we will concentrate on three topics : preferences definition and evaluation, joint production, and governance.";"Lifran, Robert";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Reports & Research";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=FR2016224020";"http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/35833";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400183487";"Climate-smart agriculture global research agenda: scientific basis for action";"";"BACKGROUND: Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) addresses the challenge of meeting the growing demand for food, fibre and fuel, despite the changing climate and fewer opportunities for agricultural expansion on additional lands. CSA focuses on contributing to economic development, poverty reduction and food security; maintaining and enhancing the productivity and resilience of natural and agricultural ecosystem functions, thus building natural capital; and reducing trade-offs involved in meeting these goals. Current gaps in knowledge, work within CSA, and agendas for interdisciplinary research and science-based actions identified at the 2013 Global Science Conference on Climate-Smart Agriculture (Davis, CA, USA) are described here within three themes: (1) farm and food systems, (2) landscape and regional issues and (3) institutional and policy aspects. The first two themes comprise crop physiology and genetics, mitigation and adaptation for livestock and agriculture, barriers to adoption of CSA practices, climate risk management and energy and biofuels (theme 1); and modelling adaptation and uncertainty, achieving multifunctionality, food and fishery systems, forest biodiversity and ecosystem services, rural migration from climate change and metrics (theme 2). Theme 3 comprises designing research that bridges disciplines, integrating stakeholder input to directly link science, action and governance. OUTCOMES: In addition to interdisciplinary research among these themes, imperatives include developing (1) models that include adaptation and transformation at either the farm or landscape level; (2) capacity approaches to examine multifunctional solutions for agronomic, ecological and socioeconomic challenges; (3) scenarios that are validated by direct evidence and metrics to support behaviours that foster resilience and natural capital; (4) reductions in the risk that can present formidable barriers for farmers during adoption of new technology and practices; and (5) an understanding of how climate affects the rural labour force, land tenure and cultural integrity, and thus the stability of food production. Effective work in CSA will involve stakeholders, address governance issues, examine uncertainties, incorporate social benefits with technological change, and establish climate finance within a green development framework. Here, the socioecological approach is intended to reduce development controversies associated with CSA and to identify technologies, policies and approaches leading to sustainable food production and consumption patterns in a changing climate.";"Steenwerth, Kerri L

"AGRIS:US201600186259";"Native wildflower plantings support wild bee abundance and diversity in agricultural landscapes across the United States";"";"Global trends in pollinatorâdependent crops have raised awareness of the need to support managed and wild bee populations to ensure sustainable crop production. Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of North America where production of pollinatorâdependent crops is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. Seasonâlong monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. Further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes.";"Williams, Neal M.

"AGRIS:LV2016026893";"Une approche multi-échelles des arbitrages entre production fourragère et biodiversité dans un agroécosystème prairial";"";"Agri-environmental measures have not been able to halt the decline of biodiversity in agricultural systems. Agricultural practices aimed at preserving diversity on a field scale appear to be deficient. This study models the interactions between grazing/mowing practices and the ecological dynamics of two grassland bird species (Northern Lapwing and Common Redshank) at three nested spatial scales (field, farm and landscape). On a field scale, grazing periods and intensity determine the balance between production and conservation. Optimal ecological performance is achieved at intermediate production levels. On a farm scale, the extent of different agricultural practices determines this balance. Nevertheless, bird conservation always carries a cost in terms of production. On a landscape scale, the spatial layout of land use is also taken into account in determining this balance.

Après une vingtaine d'années de mise en œuvre, les mesures agri-environnementales n'ont pas permis d'enrayer le déclin de la biodiversité dans les paysages agricoles. Des études récentes défendent l'idée que des mesures efficaces demanderaient non seulement de développer des pratiques favorables à la biodiversité à l'échelle de la parcelle mais aussi de favoriser des usages et des agencements spatiaux de ces usages qui accroissent l'hétérogénéité des paysages. On dispose à ce jour de peu de quantifications sur la relation production agricole / biodiversité dans des paysages plus ou moins hétérogènes. L'objectif de cette étude est d'analyser à différentes échelles spatiales la relation entre production fourragère et conservation d'oiseaux dans un agroécosystème prairial exploité par des élevages bovins viande. La démarche de recherche s'appuie sur le développement de plusieurs modèles basés sur la théorie de la viabilité. Ces modèles formalisent à trois échelles spatiales emboitées (parcelle, exploitation, paysage) les interactions entre les pratiques de pâturage et de fauche et les dynamiques écologiques de deux espèces d'oiseaux prairiaux (vanneau huppé et chevalier gambette) et apportent quatre résultats principaux. A l'échelle de la parcelle : 1) les périodes et les intensités de pâturage sont des déterminants majeurs de l'arbitrage entre production et conservation ; 2) les meilleures performances écologiques sont atteintes aux niveaux intermédiaires de performances productives. 3) A l'échelle de l'exploitation agricole, la proportion des différents usages agricoles est un levier majeur de l'arbitrage entre production et conservation mais la conservation des oiseaux a toujours un coût en termes de production. 4) A l'échelle du paysage, l'agencement spatial des usages module l'arbitrage entre production et conservation. L'ensemble de ces résultats révèle des leviers d'arbitrage spécifiques aux différentes échelles. A chacune de ces échelles, l'interaction entre différents modes d'exploitation est à la base des mécanismes d'arbitrage entre production et conservation. L'importance de l'agencement spatial des modes d'exploitation suggère que la conciliation entre production et conservation pourrait fortement bénéficier de coordinations accrues entre exploitations agricoles.";"Leger, Francois

"AGRIS:US201301849596";"Framing the landscape: Discourses of woodland restoration and moorland management in Scotland";"";"There is a long-standing debate in Scotland over the use of upland areas, as initiatives to restore the native Caledonian pine forest are vying with traditional moorland management for shooting. Our study set out to improve our understanding of argumentation processes with regard to these issues. We conducted semi-structured interviews with a wide range of local people, including both stakeholders with professional interests and randomly contacted members of the public. We then explored the frames that our interview partners chose in interaction with us to make sense of the interviews. While we had anticipated that they would frame our conversation as a debate between woodland restoration and hunting interests, some of them chose different framing contexts, such as animal welfare, biodiversity enhancement, or climate change. Often, these frames had a strong social element: the roles and relationships of different groups of actors were described, and our interview partners positioned themselves within these stress fields. Strikingly, those interviewees who did use the ‘woodland restoration versus hunting’ frame described themselves explicitly as being somewhere in between the different camps and as being able to understand both sides of the debate. Rather then establishing their social identity alongside those with polarised views, these interviewees – even if they had professional interests that were strongly inclined towards a particular group – constructed their identity as neutral, pragmatic or as a mediator between extremes. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings for both the methodology of socio-environmental research and our understanding of the social complexities underlying environmental disputes.";"Fischer, Anke

Следует акцентировать внимание на целесообразности повышать привлекательность вложения инвестиций в комплекс поощрительных мер различной направленности. Необходимо участие государства в развитии инфраструктуры рынков с.-х. продукции, дотационная государственная продовольственная политика, демонополизация кредитной, транспортной и перерабатывающей инфраструктурных составляющих, а также срочное принятие мер по усилению государственного и муниципального контроля за оборотом с.-х. угодий.";"Savkin V.I.

"AGRIS:US201400183489";"Underutilized wild edible plants in the Chilga District, northwestern Ethiopia: focus on wild woody plants";"";"BACKGROUND: Ethiopia encompasses an extraordinary number of ecological zones and plant diversity. However, the diversity of plants is highly threatened due to lack of institutional capacity, population pressure, land degradation and deforestation. An adequate documentation of these plants also has not been conducted. The farmers in Ethiopia face serious and growing food insecurity caused by drought, land degradation and climate change. Thus, rural communities are dependent on underutilized wild edible plants to meet their food and nutritional needs. Hence, this study was conducted to examine the distribution, diversity, role, management condition and associated traditional knowledge of underutilized wild edible plants with a focus on woody plants in the Chilga District, northwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: A questionnaire survey, semi-structured interviews, preference and direct matrix rankings, a market survey and focused group discussion methods were employed for data collection. Data were collected from 96 respondents. A plant inventory was also conducted on 144 quadrates in two agroecologies and in three uses. Both quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods were used. Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.0 was used for statistical analysis. Analysis of Variance (P <0.05) was used to compare diversity indices and species richness between agroecologies and among kebeles. RESULTS: Thirty-three underutilized wild edible plants were recorded in the study area. Of the recorded plants, 45% were trees. Fruits (76%) were the most frequently used plant parts. More than half of the respondents (56.3% in the midland and 66.7% in the lowland area) consumed underutilized wild edible plants for supplementing staple food. Underutilized wild edible plant citation of the poor was significantly higher (P <0.05) than medium and rich classes. Underutilized wild edible plants in the study area were threatened by agricultural expansion, overharvesting for fuel wood and construction, and by overgrazing. However, these plants have been given minimum conservation attention. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-three underutilized wild edible plants were recorded in the study area. The community consumes underutilized wild edible plants for supplementing staple food, filling food gaps and for recreation. The local community applies only some management practices to some wild edible plants. Therefore, special management is needed to sustain the benefits of these plants.";"Tebkew, Mekuanent

"AGRIS:US201600202279";"Water balance comparison of two small experimental basins with different vegetation cover";"";"In a river, the flow directly affects the physical and chemical properties of its water, with further consequences for aquatic biota. Land use practices and vegetation cover play a significant role in the water cycle. The wide-spread perception of forest cover, in terms of hydrology is that forests may reduce water runoff: although in rare instances the contrary has been reported. Water runoff varies seasonally and depends on the forest tree species. By no means can it be considered constant over large expanses of area or for various rainfall patterns. In this paper, the results of a long-term hydrological survey conducted in two experimental microbasins (operated by the Institute of Hydrology SAS, IH SAS) with different land use practices are presented. The RybÃ¡rik microbasin (0.119 km2) is dominated by row crop production. The basin was 70% cultivated by the state farm and 30% by a private farm. The LesnÃ½ microbasin (0.086 km2) is covered by a deciduous hornbeam regrowth forest (Carpinus betulus). The analysis revealed that the difference in the runoff from the forest and the agricultural land increases with increasing precipitation; however, at some point (extreme precipitations with low probability) the runoff from these basins is nearly equal.";"PekÃ¡rovÃ¡, Pavla

In particular, we examine the use of SSCCs in the Segura River Basin (southeastern Spain). The decision to install a cover depends on the potential evaporation losses, reservoir characteristics, cover effectiveness, the value of water, filtration requirements, water salinity, government subsidies and the installation, operation and maintenance costs. The economic viability of the investment increases with the value of the saved water, i.e., with water scarcity, and is greater when water quality is poor. Hence SSCCs can be helpful in arid and semi-arid regions facing water shortages and water quality problems. The farm-level decision to install a cover depends largely on the cost of purchasing water, when water is generally available, and the profit from increased crop production or enlarged farmlands, when water is scarce.";"Martínez Alvarez, V.

"AGRIS:US201301638870";"modified climate diagram displaying net water requirements of wetlands in arid and semi-arid regions";"";"Flooding regimes in arid and semi-arid regions are heavily influenced by climate change and water shortage, water regulations, and increased water demands. Wetlands managed as part of regulated water systems in agricultural landscapes often require external water supplies to sustain or support desired properties or services. Therefore, water resource managers must weigh water requirements necessary to support wetland functions alongside other water demands. This paper presents a simple method of using a modified climate diagram to display net water requirements for a managed wetland in Xi'an, China. The net water requirements were estimated using the DRAINMOD simulation model by assuming that evaporation is the only path for water loss. For this case study, the ratio of water supply to air temperature was adjusted to 1:1. Three water supply estimates were generated to support a desired water table depth of 30cm for 5%, 12.5%, and 25% of the growing season in Xi'an. When water supply reaches or exceeds a curve, it creates a wetter condition than that represented by the curve. The results also indicate that timing of recharge is very important in preserving wetland hydrology in dry regions. This modified climate diagram prompts an intuitive understanding of the relationship between recharge and consequent wetness of a wetland. It may be used as a standard tool for determining adequate water demand in arid regional water resources management that considers wetland protection or restoration.";"Jia, Z.

The present study examines the use and applicability of freely available global elevation data source (3 arc seconds finished Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)) in landform characterisation, geomorphometry, river basin studies and other allied scientific applications in comparison with contour elevation data derived from the surveyed topographical sheets. The relief data extracted from a conventionally digitised geo-information science dataset of topographic contours (1:50,000) are compared with the SRTM-DEM and the variations are analysed. The automated geomorphometric and landform parameters derived from the contour DEM and the computed statistical properties of those parameters have substantial agreement with the same parameters derived from the SRTM-DEM. At the same time, localised variations also exist in some spatial domains. Derivative landscape analysis outputs from the SRTM-DEM suggest the wide acceptability and applicability of the freely available SRTM data source, especially in the regional scale applications related to hydrological modelling, terrain characterisation, disaster management and land degradation studies.";"Prasannakumar, V.

"AGRIS:US201301665867";"Post-Wildland fire Desertification: Can Rehabilitation Treatments Make a Difference";"";"Desertification, caused by land degradation as opposed to the immediate creation of classical deserts, is of prime concern in the 21st century. As a result of human activities and climate change, the land loses its proper hydrologic function and biological productivity. Desertification affects 33 % of the earth's surface and over a billion people. Fire-related desertification has a number of environmental, social, and economic consequences. The two key environmental consequences are soil erosion and non-native plant invasions. Erosion after wildland fires can be in the range of <1 Mg ha-1 to 370 Mg ha-1, depending on fire severity, degree of water repellency, slope, and post-fire rainfall events. Soil losses in the high end of that range definitely exceed soil loss tolerances and contribute to desertification. Non-native plants are typically ten times as abundant on landscapes burned by wildland fires than on unburned lands. Seeding has been used for many years as a prime Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) treatment. Until recently, this seeding contributed to non-native plant invasions because fast-growing but non native plant seeds were used. The use of native plant seeds and sterile hybrids has reduced this problem somewhat. However, even certified weed-free seed lots have low percentages of non-native plant seeds. Recent use of wet and dry mulches have contributed to reduced post-wildland fire erosion rates, but they are quite expensive. This paper examines post-wildland fire desertification and the capabilities of BAER treatments to deal with this growing problem.";"Neary, Daniel G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"desertification;land management";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301665867";"http://hdl.handle.net/10113/32606";"";"";"";"129-144"
"AGRIS:US201600190530";"Optimal conservation planning of multiple hydrological ecosystem services under land use and climate changes in Teshio river watershed, northernmost of Japan";"";"Most anthropogenic activities impacted on water quality and quantity, and further impacted on ecosystem services (ESs) in watershed are related to land use and climate changes those may cause losses of ecosystem functions. Effective information regarding ESs and their optimal priority conservation planning responded to land use and climate changes provide useful support for diverse stakeholders in ESs planning, management and policies. This study integrated the approach of spatially explicit ESs (water yield, inorganic nutrient, organic nutrient and sediment retentions) by using hydrology and material flow model (Soil and Water Assessment Tools, SWAT model) into systematic conservation of hydrological ESs according to land use and climate changes in Teshio watershed located in the north of Hokkaido, Japan. We investigated the spatial patterns and the hotspots of ESs changes to determine the spatial pattern of changes in systematic conservation optimal area of ES protection in terms of ESs protection targets. Under the land use and climate change scenarios, the forest land use significantly affected on the water yield, sediment, organic-Nitrogen (N) and organic-Phosphorous (P) retentions. The agricultural land (paddy and farmland fields) impacted on the inorganic-N and inorganic-P retentions. We applied the systematic conservation model (MARXAN model) to optimize the area for management of hydrological ESs satisfied the protection targets (30% and 50% of potential maximum ESs values among all scenarios) in all and individual ecosystem services, respectively. The simulated results indicated that the areas of spatial optimal ESs protection for all hydrological ESs were totally different from those for individual ESs. For bundles of ESs, the optimal priority conservation areas concentrated in southwest, north, and southeast of this watershed, which are related to land use, topography and climate driving factors. These places could guarantee ESs sustainability from both environmental protection and agricultural development standpoints. The priority conservation area turned more compact under climate change because the increased precipitation and temperature increased ESs amount. For individual ESs, the optimal priority conservation areas of water yield, sediment retention and organic nutrient retention were traded off against those of inorganic nutrient retention (lower Jaccard's indexes and negative correlations of selection times). Especially, the negative correlation of selection times increased as the conservation target increased from 30% to 50%. The proposed approach provided useful information for assessing the responses of ESs and systematic conservation optimal planning to the land use and climate changes. The systematic conservation optimal areas of hydrological ESs provided an effective trade-off tool between environmental protection (sediment and organic nutrient retentions) and economic development (water yield and inorganic nutrient retention).";"Fan, Min

The model inputs consist of long-term statistical climate data, i.e. the NCEP/NCAR database, high resolution topography and land cover data. The 200 m resolution wind resource maps were validated with observed mean wind speeds from 10 met stations located along the coastlines of the territory studied. These comparisons have shown that the wind atlas provides a good representation of the wind resource throughout the territory of Nakhon Si Thammarat and Songkhla provinces, Thailand. The technical power potential and potential annual energy production are then identified. Results from the technical power potential at 80 m above ground level show that a total of 1374 MW of wind farms, generating annually 3.6 TWh of electricity, could be installed; while 407 MW of small wind turbines (50 kW), generating annually 1.0 TWh of electricity, could be installed.";"Waewsak, Jompob

"AGRIS:US201500209243";"dominant erosion processes supplying fine sediment to three major rivers in tropical Australia, the Daly (NT), Mitchell (Qld) and Flinders (Qld) Rivers";"";"The tropics of northern Australia have received relatively little attention with regard to the impact of soil erosion on the many large river systems that are an important part of Australia's water resource, especially given the high potential for erosion when long dry seasons are followed by intense wet season rain. Here we use ¹³⁷Cs concentrations to determine the erosion processes supplying sediment to two major northern Australian Rivers; the Daly River (Northern Territory), and the Mitchell River (Queensland). We also present data from five sediment samples collected from a 100km reach of the Cloncurry River, a major tributary of the Flinders River (Queensland). Concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs in the surface soil and subsurface (channel banks and gully) samples were used to derive ‘best fit’ probability density functions describing their distributions. These modelled distributions are then used to estimate the relative contribution of these two components to the river sediments. Our results are consistent with channel and gully erosion being the dominant source of sediment, with more than 90% of sediment transported along the main stem of these rivers originating from subsoil. We summarize the findings of similar studies on tropical Australian rivers and conclude that the primary source of sediment delivered to these systems is gully and channel bank erosion. Previously, as a result of catchment scale modelling, sheet-wash and rill erosion was considered to be the major sediment source in these rivers. Identifying the relative importance of sediment sources, as shown in this paper, will provide valuable information for land management planning in the region. This study also reinforces the importance of testing model predictions before they are used to target investment in remedial action.";"Caitcheon, Gary G.

Costâbenefit analyses have been used successfully as a conservation tool to identify sites that provide the greatest conservation benefit per unit cost. Our goal was to apply costâbenefit analysis to the question of how to prioritize land management efforts, in our case the application of prescribed fire to natural landscapes in Wisconsin, USA. We quantified and mapped frequently burned communities and prioritized management units based on a suite of indices that captured ecological benefits, management effort, and the feasibility of successful longâterm management actions. Data for these indices came from LANDFIRE, Wisconsin's Wildlife Action Plan, and a nationwide wildlandâurban interface assessment. We found that the majority of frequently burned vegetation types occurred in the southern portion of the state. However, the highest priority areas for applying prescribed fire occurred in the central, northwest, and northeast portion of the state where frequently burned vegetation patches were larger and where identified areas of high biological importance area occurred. Although our focus was on the use of prescribed fire in Wisconsin, our methods can be adapted to prioritize other land management activities. Such prioritization is necessary to achieve the greatest possible benefits from limited funding for land management actions, and our results show that it is feasible at scales that are relevant for land management decisions.";"Hmielowski, Tracy L.

Additionally, the majority of these studies have focused on freshwater systems and it is not clear whether results are transferable to estuarine and marine systems. We examined how sampling unit scale controls the relationship between landscape structure and sediment metal concentrations in small estuarine systems in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We varied the spatial extent of the contributing watersheds used to calculate landscape structure and assessed linear relationships between estuarine sediment metal concentrations and the total area of developed and agricultural lands at each scale. Area of developed lands was consistently related to sediment metals while total agricultural land was not. Developed land had strongest associations with lead and copper; weakest with arsenic and chromium; and moderate associations with cadmium, mercury, and zinc. Local (i.e., less than 15-20 km from a sampling station) land uses have a greater impact than more distant land uses on the amount of toxic metals reaching estuarine sediments.";"Hollister, Jeffrey W.

Much of it is surrounded by a containment levee built to hold back the annual floodwaters of the Ouachita River. In 2009, two extreme floods, with water levels over 4 m above the flood stage, breached the levee, leaving the area inside the levee inundated for an extended period of time. We investigated the mortality of trees and saplings following these floods. During the initial reforestation efforts, which began in 1998, trees were planted both inside and outside the levee, allowing us to compare tree and sapling mortality based on location, inside or outside the levee. The average mortality of all trees was 40.59%, and the average mortality of all saplings was 48.23%. Both tree and sapling mortality resulted from a significant interaction between elevation and location inside or outside the levee. Overall, results indicated increased mortality at lower elevations for the area inside the levee. Outside the levee, mortality was unaffected by elevation because floodwaters were able to recede naturally. Levee removal would restore a more traditional flooding regime, likely reducing tree and sapling mortality during future floods.";"Reid, Matthew L.

In 2003 a research study looked at the position of smallholders; the survey was carried out using questionnaires and interviews. The farms included in the survey were situated in 3 counties in the Southern Great Plain of Hungary and in 3 counties of the western part of the country (Transdanubia). The results of the survey showed that there was a firm tendency of concentration among the Hungarian individual farms. Though their average size is about 3 ha, the number and area of farms over 50 ha size are rapidly growing and taking a significant part of the total individual agricultural area. The number of small farms is great but their total farming area is relatively small. The concentration takes place primarily due to renting. The land market is sluggish mainly owing to the land-buying restrictions and the small intention to sell of those owners who are waiting for higher prices. Land prices are low but rising, especially on the Western border of the country, near to Austria. The dominance of arable production and within that cereal production, especially on the larger individual farms, points to a prevalence of extensive farming The present support and subsidy system fortifies this tendency. When comparing the Southern Plain with western Transdanubia, it can be said that agricultural production is greater in the former region and more people are involved in agriculture. There is a higher share of under-cover production of vegetables and ornamental plants and animal husbandry. However, it seems that in western Transdanubia the spirit of enterprise is stronger than in the Southern Plain: more farmers enter into contractual agreements, more farmers make use of credits and subsidies, and the farms operate with greater profitability. Nevertheless, the proximity of western Transdanubia to industrial and service centers and, furthermore, its closeness to Austria tend to suppress agricultural activities.
The regression analyses with respect to efficiency and profitability and the cluster analyses supported the assessments of the descriptive analyses and produced the following main conclusions: the larger farms, farmed by younger and better-educated individuals, are more efficient and profitable than the others. Furthermore, farmers with significant conceptions for development seem to achieve greater profitability.";"Burger, Anna

The study finds that higher land slope and higher variance of rain, as transaction‐cost‐increasing natural effects, lead to smaller hazelnut land holdings. High slope and weather variation can increase the costs of monitoring the laborers, make moving inputs or output up and down harder, limit the use of machinery, and reduce contractual performance of labor contracts. For farm production functions, land is a complex input with measurable interactions with nature. Contrary to common production theory approaches that take natural properties of land as given, the study develops a production function that incorporates natural properties, such as, slope and rain variance. The study utilizes two separate data sets for the estimations. The first data set explores the characteristics of hazelnut farmers, while the second one analyzes the regional characteristics of hazelnut farms.";"Demir, Ibrahim";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land ownership;farmers";"";"";"TUR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600089944";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.12211";"";"";"";"81-90"

Previous studies have identified important environmental factors controlling stand structure and productivity at the plot level, but these have not been applied at the landscape level because of small-scale spatial variability. The goal of this study is to compare the differentiation of koa forest types across an elevation/temperature gradient ranging from 1200 to 2050 m asl (17–13°C mean annual temperature (MAT)) through the analysis of field measurements of forest structure and fine-resolution remotely sensed imagery. Several vegetation indices (VIs) (atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), simple ratio (SR) and modified simple ratio (MSR)) are calculated from IKONOS satellite imagery of these stands and analysed using supervised classification techniques. This procedure allows a clear differentiation of koa stands from areas dominated by grasses, shrubs and bare lava. Across the elevation gradient, VIs allow differentiation of three koa forest stand classes at upper, intermediate and lower elevations. In agreement with the image classification, analysis of variance (ANOVA) of tree height and leaf phosphorus (P) suggests that there are also three significantly different groups of koa stands at those elevations. A landscape-scale map of land cover and koa stand classes demonstrates both the general trend with elevation and the small-scale heterogeneity that exists across the elevation gradient. Application of these classification techniques with fine spatial resolution imagery can improve the characterization of different koa stand types across the islands of Hawai‘i, which should aid both the conservation and utilization of this ecologically important species.";"Morales, Rodolfo Martinez

Certain metrics have been shown to be predictable with changes in scale; however, no studies have verified such predictions using independent fine-grained data.Our objective was to use independently derived land cover datasets to assess relationships between metrics based on fine- and moderate-grained data for a range of analysis extents. We focus on metrics that previous literature has shown to have predictable relationships across scales.The study area was located in eastern Connecticut. We compared a 1m land cover dataset to a 30m resampled dataset, derived from the 1m data, as well as two Landsat-based datasets. We examined 11 metrics which included cover areas and patch metrics. Metrics were analyzed using analysis extents ranging from 100 to 1400m in radius.The resampled data had very strong linear relationships to the 1m data, from which it was derived, for all metrics regardless of the analysis extent size. Landsat-based data had strong correlations for most cover area metrics but had little or no correlation for patch metrics. Increasing analysis areas improved correlations.Relationships between coarse- and fine-grained data tend to be much weaker when comparing independent land cover datasets. Thus, trends across scales that are found by resampling land cover are likely to be unsuitable for predicting the effects of finer-scale elements in the landscape. Nevertheless, coarser data shows promise in predicting fine-grained for cover area metrics provided the analysis area used is sufficiently large.";"Parent, Jason R.

After devising a physical marginality index for olive cultivation based on soil quality and slope, we estimate an approximate area of 200,000 hectares of marginal olive plantations in Andalusia. The risk of abandonment of these farmlands increases with the decoupling of the CAP subsidies and with the socio-economic characteristics of the production. The probable abandonment of these areas implies the negative consequences of wild forestation. We present some actions to minimize the negative effects of this process, being the use of grass cover and hedgerows, on an initial qualitative analysis, the most positive measures.";"Arriaza Balmón, Manuel

"AGRIS:US201300755626";"Relationships between Danish organic farming and landscape composition";"";"This article presents an investigation of relationships between organic farming and landscape composition in Denmark. Landscape composition was analysed in terms of density of uncultivated landscape elements (I), number of land uses per hectare (II), diversity of land use (III) and mean field size (IV). Two analytical approaches were used. The first was based on an examination of the national agricultural registers for 1998, 2001 and 2004. The second approach used aerial photo interpretation for an analysis of 72 conventional and 40 organic farms within three sample areas for 1982, 1995 and 2002. The national analysis indicated that organic farming has a direct effect on landscape composition. In 2001, organic farms were characterised by a higher number of land uses per ha, a higher land use diversity and smaller mean field sizes. From 1998 to 2004, conversion to organic farming was related to an increasing number of land uses per ha, increasing land-use diversity and decreasing mean field sizes. Relationships between organic farming and landscape composition were independent of variations in regional location, farm size or farm size change. At the level of sample areas, a significant relationship between organic farming and landscape composition was only found for densities of small biotopes. However, when differences in farm size and physical geographical conditions between conventional and organic farms were taken into account, several significant differences in landscape composition were clarified in two of the three sample areas. Furthermore, changes in landscape composition following conversion to organic farming were largely biased by the characteristics of the sample areas. Thus, in contrast to the national level, the sample area study indicated that differences in landscape composition between organic and conventional farms were not a direct implication of organic farming practices, but were related to variations within other parameters and to the location of organically farmed land.";"Levin, G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land use planning;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"DNK";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300755626";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.10.018";"";"";"";"330-344"

Farm agents optimize their utility with the help of a linear-programming algorithm that takes into account natural, economic and personal restrictions. Interactions between farms take place on the land market, which is modelled as an equilibrium market. The model is applied in three typical grassland regions in southern Bavaria. The results indicate that the CAP reform of 2003 has various significant consequences for grassland use. In particular, the decreasing profitability of dairy farming will lead to low-intensity forms of grassland use, including mulching. In general, land rents will increase due to the effects of decoupling.";"Roeder, Norbert

Data from two sample-based inventories conducted by the USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program were combined for this analysis--the FIA forest resources inventory and the National Woodland Owner Survey (NWOS). We looked for relationships between product value and investment in woodlands, as reflected in volumes and tree quality. We also examined whether measures of diversity reflected specific management focus. Our results partially supported our hypotheses. Woodland-focused ownership reasons were found to have larger volumes and individual tree sizes. We found that a passive woodland ownership reason--that woods were “part of the farm”--generally had lower volumes per hectare. Although we were not able to differentiate between different forest product classes and measures of volume, we did find that those landowners who harvested veneer had more volume than those who harvested for firewood. Woodland owners who salvage-harvested their woodlands--a harvesting reason that is more reactive than proactive--exhibited lower volumes per hectare than those who harvested for more proactive, product-focused reasons. Biodiversity was also found to be related to the ownership focus and harvest intent. Generally, there was lower diversity in overstory species when the woodland was viewed merely as “part of the farm,” when the product harvested was fence posts and when timber was harvested for salvage or land clearing. The small sample size limits our analysis, but we can conclude that focusing the woodland owners on management of their woodlands--regardless of what the specific management goals might be--should increase productivity and biodiversity of those woodlands.";"Moser, W.

We investigate the cost of forest-based carbon sequestration by analyzing econometrically micro-data on revealed landowner preferences, modeling six major private land uses in a comprehensive analysis of the contiguous United States. The econometric estimates are used to simulate landowner responses to sequestration policies. We treat key commodity prices as endogenous and predict carbon storage changes with a carbon sink model. Our estimated sequestration costs exceed those from previous engineering cost analyses and sectoral optimization models. Our estimated sequestration supply function is similar to the carbon abatement supply function from energy-based analyses, suggesting that forest-based carbon sequestration merits consideration in a cost-effective portfolio of domestic US climate change strategies.";"Lubowski, Ruben N.

Attitudes, individual characteristics, economic diversity of landowners' household portfolio, and physical and ecological conditions were explanatory variables in Logit regression models of interest. Habitus and field, the values and institutions of farm operators, were included in the framework. Knowledge of the practice, perceived problems with the environment and attitude/habitus variables had a positive effect on the probability of being interested in riparian buffers. Knowledge of the practice was the most important factor in explaining interest in the case of forest farming, followed by attitudes about trees and concern for future generations, both habitus variables. Field variables like CRP payments representing familiarity with government programs that support conservation, had no significant effect on interest in riparian buffers.

Forage, soil and blood plasma samples were collected during 4 months of the year after a 1-month interval, and Mn concentrations were assessed after wet digestion using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that Mn concentration in soil ranged from 48.28 to 59.44 mg/kg, with incoherent augment and decline across sampling periods, and effect of sampling period on soil Mn was also found to be significant (P < 0.05). The mean levels of Mn in soil appeared higher than the critical value and sufficient for forage crop requirement. The Mn concentration in forage ranged between 24.8 and 37.2 mg/kg, resulting deficient based on the requirement allowance of Mn for livestock grazing animals, therein with almost unchanged forage Mn concentration. The Mn values in blood plasma of rams varied from 0.066 to 0.089 mg/l, with a consistent increase based on sampling period, and the effect of sampling periods on plasma Mn was found to be highly significant (P < 0.05). The Mn levels in ram blood plasma were lesser than the normal level suggesting reasonable need for supplementation. Our study revealed the role of Mn availability in soil and plant species amassing capability on the transport of Mn in the soil-plant-animal system. Results indicated a much higher accumulation rate at the sampling characterized by vegetation dominated by legumes in comparison to grasses, crop residues and mixed pasture and a pronounced seasonal supply of Mn at the four sampling period of grazing land of diverse botanical composition.";"Khan, Zafar Iqbal

In this program called “FarmLink”, four farmers/landowners were employed part-time as “advisors” and trained by University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Natural Resources District personnel. Topics included basic buffer design and benefits, availability of incentive programs, and sales techniques. These individuals then contacted their neighbors to explain the need for and benefits of buffers and other conservation practices. In early 2003, 42 landowners were contacted, leading to contracts for the establishment of 16 separate conservation practices on 24.8 ha (61.3 acres) of farmland. These included just over 8 ha (20 acres) of grassed waterways or similar plantings and 14 ha (35 acres) of streamside buffers. In addition, because of information received in the training sessions, one of the advisors installed 1.7 ha (4.3 acres) of streamside buffers, 0.45 ha (1.1 acres) of grassed waterways, and 2.0 ha (5.0 acres) of grasses and forbs on his own land. During these contacts, it became apparent that: (1) many farmers and landowners were not familiar with the multitude of programs available to assist with the installation and maintenance of conservation practices; and (2) landowners generally appreciated the personal touch of someone coming out to talk directly to them, pointing out specific areas on their land where conservation practices could best be implemented, discussing available compensation programs, and describing management needed to help ensure practice success. Although one-to-one contacts cannot be used in all cases, it was demonstrated to be effective in this watershed.";"Shelton, David P.

"AGRIS:US201301576004";"Non-operator landowner interest in agroforestry practices in two Missouri watersheds";"";"Land tenure has long been considered a critical factor in determining the adoption and long-term maintenance of agroforestry practices. Empirical evidence from non-US settings has consistently shown that secure land tenure is positively associated with agroforestry adoption. In the US, over 40% of private agricultural land is farmed by someone other than the owner. Given the importance of land tenure in agroforestry decisions in other countries and the magnitude of non-operator landownership in the US, there has been surprisingly little focus on land tenure in the temperate agroforestry literature. Using data from a 1999 survey in Missouri, this study explores factors associated with non-operator landowner interest in agroforestry. Results suggest that differences in farming orientation are linked to interest in agroforestry. Closer ties to farming, stronger financial motivations for landownership, and higher proportion of land planted to row crops were negatively related to interest in agroforestry among non-operator landowners. Environmental or recreational motivations for landownership and contacts with natural resource professionals were positively associated with interest in agroforestry. These results, consistent with earlier qualitative research suggesting that farm operators who have a strong “conventional farming identity” were less interested in agroforestry, point to a divide between landowners for whom environmental and recreational values play an important role in ownership motivation and those for whom financial considerations take precedence. The findings imply that agroforestry development programs in the US should take non-operator landowners and their farming and ownership orientations into account when designing research and outreach efforts.";"Arbuckle, J.

We first collected, homogenised and drew physical thematic maps, which were then linked to biological and human features. We then performed a gap analysis of land heterogeneity compared with Natural Protected Areas and Natura2000 network on the basis of three categories: Total gaps, Partial gaps, and Protected. Moreover, we assessed the conservation status of the land units by summarising the environmental quality using the Index of Landscape Conservation. We identified and mapped 3 Land Regions, 24 Land Systems, and 149 Land Facets. Total gaps account for 28% of the country, Partial gaps for 38% and Protected for 34%. The Natura2000 network is more representative than the system of National Protected Areas of the overall land heterogeneity as regards both the types (18 out of 24) and extent (72%) of the Land Systems. Low conservation status prevails in the Land Facets of the Mediterranean Region located along the coasts and plains on sedimentary deposits, whereas high and very high conservation status is found along the higher belts of the Alpine and Apennine chains. These results highlight the potential use of ecological land classification for biodiversity monitoring and conservation purposes, e.g. when identifying land units that need to be recovered or targeted for enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services protection.";"Capotorti, Giulia

All transformations of historical maps onto modern coordinate systems are however burdened with difficulties when it comes to accuracy. We show that a detailed land survey of the present landscape may enable transformation of an old cadastral map directly onto the present terrain with very high accuracy. The detailed resulting map enabled us to locate remnants of semi-natural grasslands and man-made structures with continuity from 1865 and to test hypotheses about relationships between landscape changes and landscape characteristics. The main land-cover change 1865-2002 was decrease of arable fields, and addition of three new land-cover classes: horticultural, orchard and abandoned areas. Of the 330 man-made structures present in 1865, only 58 remained in 2002, while 63 new structures had been built after 1865. We found that semi-natural grasslands with continuity since 1865 were situated on ground with significantly lower production capacity than mean 1865 production capacity. The man-made structures with continuity since 1865 were also associated with areas with significantly lower production capacity than the 1865 mean, situated in significantly steeper terrain but not further from the hamlet. Our study illustrates the potential of digitised and accurately transformed historical cadastral maps combined with detailed field surveys for analysis of land-cover and structural changes in the cultural landscape.";"Hamre, Liv Norunn

But, because agriculture yields low revenues, agricultural workers often need a source of additional income. Agriculture combines excellently with the growing of medicinal herbs, organic farming, handicrafts and tourism. Rural tourism, as originally conceived, is a source of revenue to supplement income from agriculture. In Hungary, however, the ties between these two activities are very weak.Our current research is focused on assessing the willingness of land owners and agricultural entrepreneurs in the Northern Great Plain region to engage in rural tourism, as well as the willingness of rural hosts to start agricultural activities. Additionally, we seek to assess the potential opportunities for combining agricultural activities and rural tourism in the region by identifying the factors behind the successful operation of profitable enterprises pursuing both lines of business. We also look at the potential economic results from these two activities, and how they might change the revenue levels of the region’s dwellers. We have administered our questionnaire to 122 enterprises so far.   ------------------------------------ A mezőgazdaság a vidéki területek életében, a vidékfejlesztésben jelentős funkciókat töltött és tölt be ma is. A mezőgazdaság alacsony jövedelemtermelő képessége kapcsán azonban szükségessé válhat a mezőgazdaságban dolgozók jövedelmének kiegészítése. A tevékenységhez kitűnően kapcsolható a gyógynövénytermesztés, biogazdálkodás, kézművesipari termékek előállítása és az idegenforgalom. A falusi vendéglátás klasszikus értelemben a mezőgazdaságból származó jövedelmet egészíti ki, azonban magyar viszonyok között a két tevékenység általában alig kapcsolódik egymáshoz. Jelenlegi kutatásunkban arra törekszünk, hogy felmérjük az Észak-alföldi Régióban működő mezőgazdasági vállalkozók, földtulajdonosok hajlandóságát falusi turizmus végzésére, falusi vendéglátók készségét mezőgazdasági tevékenység folytatására, továbbá a mindkét tevékenységet végző gazdaságok sikeres működésének feltételeit meghatározva, lehatárolni a régió potenciális lehetőségeit a mezőgazdasági tevékenység és a falusi vendéglátó tevékenység összekapcsolására. Vizsgáljuk továbbá azt is, hogy a két tevékenységnek milyen gazdasági eredménye lehet, illetve azok hogyan befolyásolhatják a vizsgált régióban élők jövedelemviszonyait. Munkánk során eddig összesen 122 vállalkozás kérdőíves felmérését végeztük el.";"Szabo, Bernadett

The objective of this study was to map the land cover of the Cerrado biome based on the segmentation and visual interpretation of 170 Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite scenes acquired in 2002. The following land cover classes were discriminated: grasslands, shrublands, forestlands, croplands, pasturelands, reforestations, urban areas, and mining areas. The results showed that the remnant natural vegetation is still covering about 61% of the biome, however, on a highly asymmetrical basis. While natural physiognomies comprise 90% of the northern part of the biome, only 15% are left in its southern portions. Shrublands were the dominant natural land cover class, while pasturelands were the dominant land use class in the Cerrado biome. The final Cerrado's land cover map confirmed the intensive land use pressure in this unique biome. This paper also showed that Landsat-like sensors can provide feasible land cover maps of Cerrado, although ancillary data are required to help image interpretation.";"Sano, Edson E.

To maintain the vitality of these areas governments have employed a variety of policies, some of which are designed to facilitate innovation and enhance landowner innovativeness. However, little research has investigated the antecedents to landowner innovativeness and whether innovativeness positively impacts economic performance in this setting. The present study investigates these issues in the context of Norwegian forestland owners and their involvement in non-timber forest products and services (a form of ecosystem services). The authors present a conceptual model hypothesizing that social networking, entrepreneurial climate, and a learning orientation each have a direct, positive impact on landowner innovativeness and innovativeness has a direct, positive impact on economic performance. Property size is included as a moderating variable. Data were collected via a mail survey and a total of 683 useable responses were received reaching an adjusted response rate of 35%. Results show that social networking and a learning orientation positively impact innovativeness, but that entrepreneurial climate does not. Innovativeness was found to positively impact economic performance. The authors outline implications of the findings that may be used by policy makers, landowners and research.";"Nybakk, Erlend

However, there are limited opportunities for children to be landscape planners and the elements children believe are important in the design and planning of their ideal community are unknown. Therefore, this investigation reports on an active teaching activity for children and presents a research study on children's perceptions and preferences in designing an ideal community. The participants are children between 3rd and 10th grade in a rural migrant farming community in Michigan. Foam-core models were produced and analyzed to answer the following research questions: (i) what are the key dimensions of an ideal community and (ii) are there hidden patterns of preference? Using principal component analysis, 87% of what is important to the rural students regarding ""ideal communities"" can be explained. The first component represents what is familiar to the children, Their Place, and accounts for nearly 28% of the variance. This study also produced a conceptual spatial map of an ideal community for all of the student participants. The map reveals that a school provides a link to many other aspects of children's lives.

"AGRIS:QL2012002403";"Approaches to alleviating poverty in rural Pakistan";"";"More than 12 million people added to the poor in Pakistan between 1993 and 1999. The rising poverty was the result of poor governance and slow economic growth (Asian Development Bank 2002). All available evidence on poverty trends in Pakistan suggests that the problem of poverty in the country worsened during the 1990s, and this was more so in rural areas than in urban areas. Rural economy of the country is caught up in a vicious circle of problems  rapidly increasing population resulting in decreasing per capita resource base, low literacy level, continued high level of inequity in resource distribution, slow growth in both farm and non-farm sectors, and more importantly, continued poor governance. All these factors adversely affected the efforts to reduce poverty. Agricultural economy, which forms the backbone of broader rural economy of the country, is presently facing three major inter-related problems: (1) increasing water scarcity coupled with continued poor performance of irrigation systems, (2) increasing degradation of land and water resources, and (3) farmers poor access to other key production inputs and services  all resulting in actual agricultural productivity levels continuing to be much below the achievable potential levels. Enhancing agricultural productivity through removing these constraints, especially for small farms, is one of the keys to address the problem of food and income poverty. This paper provides an overview of poverty trends in Pakistan. It highlights fundamental issues related to rural poverty and offers key approaches to enhancing agricultural productivity for food security and poverty alleviation in rural Pakistan.";"Hussain, Intizar";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"land ownership;farmers";"";"";"PAK";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QL2012002403";"http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H043756.pdf";"";"";"";""

In the presence of selectivity bias, separate stochastic production frontiers are estimated for low and high adopters. The main results indicate that households with higher levels of investments in soil conservation show higher average TE than those with a lower level of investments. Constrains in the rural land and credit markets are likely explanations for these differences. The results also indicate that for farms with lower levels of investments in soil conservation access to credit is a significant factor explaining the sources of inefficiency. Conversely, households with higher levels of investments have the highest partial output elasticity for land, the highest levels of TE and the smallest farms. These results are consistent with the presence of a failure in the land market which would limit access to land to the more efficient producers.";"Solis, Daniel

This research focuses on four resettlement villages. Household interviews were conducted to learn more about variations in living conditions, traditions and culture in the villages that were relocated independently compared to villages in which relocation had merged older villages together. The case study suggests that most resettlers wanted to remain exclusively with their own village members. However, it was impossible for every village to have its own resettlement location given the scarcity of the land and resources in the resettlement areas. As a result, some villages were merged with other villages in the newly developed resettlement villages. On a different note, the NT2 project provided superior compensation for the resettlers when compared with other similar projects in Laos. However, the NT2 project had insufficient land resources to satisfy the agricultural needs of the resettlers and thus created a situation where the livelihood of the villages will not be sustainable when the project concludes its support for the resettlers.";"Souksavath, Bounsouk

Essa implicação é confirmada quando testada em um painel de dados censitários municipais da  Amazônia brasileira no período 1970-96 e esse resultado se mantem mesmo quando se controla o problema da  endogeneidade do número de posseiros na especificação de uma equação de desflorestamento.

"AGRIS:US201600185527";"Comparative assessment of different methods for using land-cover variables for distribution modelling of Salamandra salamandra longirotris";"";"Predictive models are frequently used to define the most suitable areas for species protection or reintroduction. Land-cover variables can be used in different ways for distribution modelling. The surface area of a set of land-cover classes is often used, each land-cover presence/absence or the distance to them from any point of the study area can be preferred; multiple types of land-cover variables may be combined to produce a single model. This paper assesses whether different approaches to using land-cover variables may lead to different ecological conclusions when interpreted for conservation by focusing on the distribution of the salamader Salamandra salamandra longirostris, an endangered amphibian subspecies in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Twenty-eight land-cover classes and another 42 environmental variables were used to construct four different models. Three models used a unique type of land-cover variable: either the presence of each class, the surface area of each class or the distance to each class, with all three variable types jointly entered in a fourth model. All models attained acceptable scores according to some criteria (discrimination, descriptive and predictive capacities, classification accuracy and parsimony); however most of the assessment parameters computed indicated a better performance of the models using either the surface area of land classes or the distance to them from every sampled square, compared to the model using class presences. The best scores were obtained with the fourth model, which combined different types of land-cover variables. This model suggested that oak forest fragmentation in favour of herbaceous crops and pastures may have negative effects on the distribution of S. s. longirostris. This was only partially suggested by the first three models, which considered a single type of land-cover variable, demonstrating the importance of considering a multi-variable analysis for conservation planning.";"ROMERO, DAVID

The key aspect of this development is a process based description of nutrient generation process on the land surface and its related nutrient release with hydrologic runoff and soil erosion. Whereas the conventional modelling uses the event mean concentration method for nutrient dynamics modelling and estimates nutrient loads from catchments to the rivers this study has introduced an export function based release related with flow capacity. The river module solves the dynamic equation for transport and chemical reaction. The model output is available in high spatial and temporal resolution, which was tested and verified applying in two catchment areas from different hydro-climatic backgrounds. The model was able to simulate short term high intensity flood events as well as long term seasonal patterns. The simulated results for most of the nutrient parameters are within acceptable range as reflected by measures of statistical indices and visual interpretation. For example, the R² values for different nutrient levels in the Saru River, Japan are within the range of 0.83–0.99 and 0.66–0.87 for calibration and validation, respectively. Similarly, the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values for different nutrient levels in the Saru River range between 0.06–0.22 and 0.06–0.26 for calibration and validations, respectively. The maximum load of nutrients in each grid was extracted from time series output, analyzed further and presented in two dimensional maps, which showcase the usefulness of the model in decision making process for management of land and maintenance of the in-stream water quality.";"Alam, Md Jahangir

Three states out of 6 states in the study area were purposively selected to cover 3 ethnic groups. A state was selected to cover at least one ethnic group. 4 villages were randomly selected in each state to make a total of 12 sample villages. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire from 20 randomly selected rural women in each sample village to make a total of 240 respondents. Interview schedule was used to get information from 3 key informants in each sample village. The results of the study showed that rural women have restricted access to the exploitation of firewood and forest fruits on communal and family lands in the study area. They however have free and independent access to exploit fodder among the 3 ethnic groups while rural women have free access to exploit snails and mushrooms among the Yoruba ethnic groups in the study area. Chi-square test (p <0.05) shows that a significant association exists between total income earned by rural women and the income they earned from the exploitation of forest resources in the study area. This means that if the access of rural women to the exploitation of forest resources in the study area is improved, income earned by rural women will also increase. The results further showed that the impacts of the access of rural women to the exploitation of forest resources on rural household welfare include provisions of income, food and medicinal materials as well as money rural women spent on their children's education, health care and household feeding.";"Adedayo, A.G.

We performed a pilot study in the suburban Shepherd Creek watershed located in Cincinnati, Ohio to evaluate the practicality of voluntary incentives for stormwater quantity reduction on privately owned suburban properties. Stream discharge and precipitation were monitored 3years before and after implementation of the stormwater management treatments. To implement stormwater control measures, we elicited the participation of citizen landowners with two successive reverse-auctions. Auctions were held in spring 2007, and 2008, resulting in the installation of 85 rain gardens and 174 rain barrels. We demonstrated an analytic process of increasing model flexibility to determine hydrologic effectiveness of stormwater management at the sub-catchment level. A significant albeit small proportion of total variance was explained by both the effects of study period (∼69%) and treatment-vs.-control (∼7%). Precipitation–discharge relationships were synthesized in estimated unit hydrographs, which were decomposed and components tested for influence of treatments. Analysis of unit hydrograph parameters showed a weakened correlation between precipitation and discharge, and support the output from the initial model that parcel-level green infrastructure added detention capacity to treatment basins. We conclude that retrofit management of stormwater runoff quantity with green infrastructure in a small suburban catchment can be successfully initiated with novel economic incentive programs, and that these measures can impart a small, but statistically significant decrease in otherwise uncontrolled runoff volume. Given consistent monitoring data and analysis, water resource managers can use our approach as a way to estimate actual effectiveness of stormwater runoff volume management, with potential benefits for management of both separated and combined sewer systems. We also discuss lessons-learned with regard to monitoring design for catchment-scale hydrologic studies.";"Shuster, William

Soil properties of the study area such as texture, depth, electrical conductivity, drainage, calcium carbonate content and slope were derived from a semi-detailed soil study carried out on the North Andimeshk Plain on a scale of 1:20,000. Once the soil properties were analyzed and evaluated, suitability maps were generated for surface, sprinkler and drip irrigation methods using Remote Sensing (RS) techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS). The obtained results showed that there was not found highly suitable lands for all the irrigation methods. The results demonstrated that by applying sprinkler irrigation instead of surface and drip irrigation methods, the land suitability of 5429 ha (35.74%) of the North Andimeshk Plain’s land could be improved substantially. However, by applying drip irrigation instead of surface and sprinkler irrigation methods, the suitability of 9764 ha (64.27%) of this plain’s land could be improved. By applying sprinkler irrigation instead of surface and drip irrigation methods, the arability of 21,250 ha (72.53%) in the Abbas Plain will improve. In addition by applying drip irrigation instead of surface and sprinkler irrigation methods, the land suitability of 6275 ha (21.42%) of this plain will improve. The comparison of the different types of irrigation techniques revealed that the drip and sprinkler irrigation methods were more effective and efficient than the surface irrigation methods for improving land productivity. Moreover, the main limiting factor in using surface and sprinkler irrigation methods in this area were soil texture, soil depth and slope. Also, the main limiting factors in using drip irrigation methods were soil calcium carbonate content, texture and depth.";"Rezania, Ali Reza

The watershed contributes a significant amount of water to Lake Nakuru National Park, an internationally recognized Ramsar site, as well as groundwater supplies for local communities and the city of Nakuru. Three land use maps representing a 17-year period when the region underwent significant transitions served as inputs for hydrologic modeling using the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) tool, a GIS-based hydrologic modeling system. AGWA was used to parameterize the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a hydrologic model suitable for assessing the relative impact of land cover change on hydrologic response. The SWAT model was calibrated using observation data taken during the 1990s with high annual concordance. Simulation results showed that land use changes have resulted in corresponding increases in surface runoff and decreases in groundwater recharge.

"AGRIS:US201600076218";"conceptual framework to analyse the land-use/land-cover changes and its impact on phytodiversity: a case study of North Andaman Islands, India";"";"Phytodiversity is affected both by natural and anthropogenic factors and in Island ecosystems these impacts can devastate or reduce diversity, if the native vegetation is lost. In addition to rich species richness and diversity, Island systems are the sites of high endemism and any threat to these ecosystems will consequently lead to loss and extinction of species. To understand the dynamics including feedbacks of these changes in phytodiversity of North Andaman Islands, a conceptual framework is proposed which focuses on understanding the land-use and land-cover changes and its impact with phytodiversity. In considering land-use and land-cover changes this work highlights the direct and indirect drivers of changes—socio-economic, biophysical and climatic factors. Migration of population, their socio economic needs and government policies were identified as major driving forces threatening the phytodiversity of these Islands. Apart from human beings, natural disasters like tsunami and introduced herbivorous animals like elephants also contributed to forest destruction in these Islands. The integrated analysis based on such framework will provide insights for holistic resource management including ecological conservation.";"Prasad, P. Rama Chandra

"AGRIS:US201500183506";"Simulation of land use/land cover change and its effects on the hydrological characteristics of the upper reaches of the Hanjiang Basin";"";"In any watershed, many factors influence land use/cover change (LUCC). The nonlinear relationships between these factors and LUCC are very complicated and make it difficult to build a model that is capable of accurately simulating the range of physical processes. The aim of this study was: (1) to simplify the structure of a simulation model and improve its simulation speed, and (2) evaluate the impact of land use/cover change on surface runoff and evapotranspiration. Firstly, a coupled cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN) watershed land use/cover change simulation model, calibrated and validated using 1980 and 2000 land use data, respectively, was developed. It was used to simulate land use/cover type in the upper reaches of the Hanjiang Basin for 2020. Results indicate that the area of paddy field, dry land, shrubbery and construction land by 2020 will have increased; however, woodland, grassland and water areas will have decreased. Secondly, hydrological processes in the upper reaches of the Hanjiang Basin were simulated using the SWAT model. Finally, variations in watershed surface runoff and evapotranspiration for the LUCC 1980 and 2000 scenarios and the simulated 2020 scenario were analyzed. Results show that there is an increasing trend in the annual average runoff flowing into the Danjiangkou Reservoir, and that land use change has more influence on runoff throughout the year than during the flood season. The annual average evapotranspiration, annual runoff variation coefficient and annual runoff distribution coefficient were predicted to increase. Results confirm that (1) the ANN–CA model is capable of simulating land use/cover change for multiple classes, (2) the SWAT model facilitates sustainable land management planning, and (3) coupling the two models provides a new method for assessing the potential redistribution of land use types in the future.";"Deng, Zhimin

"AGRIS:US201600091937";"Spatial overlap in a solitary carnivore: support for the land tenure, kinship or resource dispersion hypotheses?";"";"There are several alternative hypotheses about the effects of territoriality, kinship and prey availability on individual carnivore distributions within populations. The first is the land‐tenure hypothesis, which predicts that carnivores regulate their density through territoriality and temporal avoidance. The second is the kinship hypothesis, which predicts related individuals will be clumped within populations, and the third is the resource dispersion hypothesis, which suggests that resource richness may explain variable sociality, spatial overlap or temporary aggregations of conspecifics. Research on the socio‐spatial organization of animals is essential in understanding territoriality, intra‐ and interspecific competition, and contact rates that influence diverse ecology, including disease transmission between conspecifics and courtship behaviours. We explored these hypotheses with data collected on a solitary carnivore, the cougar (Puma concolor), from 2005 to 2012 in the Southern Yellowstone Ecosystem, Wyoming, USA. We employed 27 annual home ranges for 13 cougars to test whether home range overlap was better explained by land tenure, kinship, resource dispersion or some combination of the three. We found support for both the land tenure and resource dispersion hypotheses, but not for kinship. Cougar sex was the primary driver explaining variation in home range overlap. Males overlapped significantly with females, whereas the remaining dyads (F–F, M–M) overlapped significantly less. In support for the resource dispersion hypothesis, hunting opportunity (the probability of a cougar killing prey in a given location) was often higher in overlapping than in non‐overlapping portions of cougar home ranges. In particular, winter hunt opportunity rather than summer hunt opportunity was higher in overlapping portions of female–female and male–female home ranges. Our results may indicate that solitary carnivores are more tolerant of sharing key resources with unrelated conspecifics than previously believed, or at least during periods of high resource availability. Further, our results suggest that the resource dispersion hypothesis, which is typically applied to social species, is applicable in describing the spatial organization of solitary carnivores.";"Elbroch, L.

"AGRIS:US201500071595";"Human Ecology of Regrowth in the Tropics";"";"As the losses of tropical forests have accumulated over the past three decades, largely deforested areas have increased in extent in the tropics, and observers have begun to ask questions about the circumstances under which tropical forests reemerge in deforested areas. This article addresses these questions through a meta-analysis of 63 case studies of tropical forest cover change that report net regrowth in forests. Regrowth tends to occur in largely deforested highlands. The types of regrowth (spontaneous versus planted) vary considerably from continent to continent, with spontaneous regrowth predominant in the Americas, agro-forestry prevalent in East Africa, and forest plantations common in Asia. Forest reforms that secure land tenure and allocate to locals the proceeds from the sale of forest products associate positively with the incidence of regrowth. Increases in the size of the non-farm sector and the extent of out-migration also seem to spur an expansion in tropical regrowth. Policies that build on these pre-existing trends in landscapes and livelihoods should promote further regrowth in the tropics.";"Rudel, Thomas K.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"019;014;142";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500071595";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2011.588457";"";"";"";"340-354"

Surveys were conducted with the landowners in order to obtain their opinions of the land reallocation results. The purpose of the survey study was to determine which of the two land reallocation models they preferred. 66.1% (39 people) of the interviewed landowners stated that they were pleased with their land reallocation on the basis of the conventional land reallocation model. This compares with 89.9% (53 people) of the landowners who expressed that they were pleased with the outcome of the SDSS-based model.

We utilise a sample based approach used in a previous pan-tropical deforestation survey to derive information on land cover and burned areas in the two major biomes of Mato Grosso: Amazon and Cerrado. Land cover and burned area are mapped for three years (2000–2005–2010) over 77 sample sites (10000ha each) distributed systematically throughout the state which covers 90.337 Mha. Our results indicate continuing forest degradation by fires in the state and potentially increasing fire susceptibility of the Amazon forests, regardless of the decrease in deforestation. 2010 witnessed the most extensive fire-induced forest degradation (~300000ha) in the forests of the Amazon biome among the study years, regardless of the fact that the fire season was less severe than in 2005. Deforestation in the Amazon biome in Mato Grosso dropped from 590000hayear-1 in the 2000–2005 period to 190000hayear-1 in the second half of the decade.

However, fuel maps are difficult to generate and update, because many regions of the world lack fuel descriptions or adequate mapped vegetation attributes to assign these fuelbeds spatially across the landscape. This paper presents a process to generate fuel maps for large areas using remotely sensed information and ancillary fuel characteristic data. The Fuel Characteristic Classification System was used to build fuelbeds for South America and predict potential fire hazard using a set of default environmental variables. A land-cover map was combined with a biome map to define 98 fuelbeds, and their parameters were assigned based on information from global datasets and existing Fuel Characteristic Classification System fuelbeds or photo series. The indices of potential surface fire behaviour ranged from 1.32 to 9, whereas indices of potential crown fire and available fuel for combustion had low to medium values (0–6). This paper presents a geospatial fuels map for South America. This map could be used to assess fire hazard, predict fire behaviour under defined environmental conditions or calculate fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It could also be easily updated as new remotely sensed information on vegetation becomes available.";"Pettinari, M. Lucrecia

"AGRIS:US201600126537";"Challenging the concept of Aboriginal mosaic fire practices in the Lake Eyre Basin";"";"Mosaic burning is the deliberate creation of a mosaic of patches representing different fire histories. It is often recommended for management of Australia’s natural landscapes, on the assumption that it enhances biodiversity and reduces fire hazard through increased spatial and temporal diversity of fuel loads and species composition. It is also suggested that such fire practices were used throughout Australia by traditionally living Aboriginal people. Although the creation of a patchwork of different fire histories may be an effective management tool in modern land management, the evidence for universal mosaic burning before European settlement deserves scrutiny. The records of explorers, early settlers and anthropologists relating to a large portion of the Lake Eyre Basin, particularly the Channel country and the Simpson Desert region, were examined. It is concluded that extensive gaps in the records of smokes and large fires are important and meaningful, and do not represent a failure to record fires. The case for universal mosaic burning in the region is not supported by the evidence although mosaic burning did occur in specific circumstances. Fire practices were shaped by complex and interacting factors including the vegetation and terrain type, for example the occurrence of spinifex-dominated sandhills or stony deserts; seasonal conditions and the presence or not of adequate fuel loads; how readily Aboriginal people could access country and their reasons for using or not using fire; the stocking of the pastoral country and spread of feral animals; and government policies about fire.";"Kimber, R.

BFAST enables the decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal and noise components, resulting in the detection of gradual and rapid land cover changes. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series derived from the MODIS and VEGETATION (VGT) standard products were analysed. The time series decomposition resulted in the mapping of the burned area and the demonstration of the post-fire vegetation recovery trend. The observed gradual changes revealed an increase of NDVI values over time, indicating post-fire vegetation recovery. Spatial validation of the generated burned area maps with a higher resolution reference map was performed and probability statistics were derived. Both maps achieved a high probability of detection – 0.90 for MODIS and 0.87 for VGT – and a low probability of false alarms, 0.01 for MODIS and 0.02 for VGT. In addition, the Pareto boundary theory was implemented to account for the low-resolution bias of the maps. BFAST facilitated detection of fire-induced changes using image time series, without having to set thresholds, select specific seasons or adjust to certain land cover types. Further evaluation of the approach should focus on a more comprehensive assessment across regions and time.";"Katagis, Thomas

An object-based classification scheme was developed to map the major land-cover types using multi-temporal Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and European Remote-Sensing (ERS) (C-band VV) images covering the time period from 1993 to 2007. The developed scheme mapped the post-fire land-cover types accurately: 0.84 Kappa coefficient and 90.5% overall accuracy. The use of the ERS backscatter coefficient contributed to decreasing the commission errors related to the mapping of forested areas and to overcoming misclassifications that occurred between forested areas and shrublands located in shadowed areas. Results indicated that the forest regeneration rate is rather slow, especially in areas where the degree of burn severity was high while the largest part of the burned area is, to date, covered by low vegetation and shrubs. Nevertheless, a gradual shift from low vegetation to shrubland was observed. A preliminary investigation on the use of the ERS backscatter coefficient and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index to monitor forest regeneration revealed that the backscatter coefficient could provide information related to changes in dense regenerating pine forests for the first 18 years after the fire event, whereas the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index was found to be sensitive to the regenerating forest understorey vegetation. However, further investigation is needed to confirm these findings.";"Polychronaki, A.

The relation between land cover type and fire was investigated at a broad scale, in order to analyse land cover differences in fire proneness. The selection ratio for nine different land cover categories was calculated for the fire perimeters mapped in Southern Europe between 2000 and 2008. The results obtained were then compared per country and region. The fire proneness of topographic classes and its potential association with land cover types were also assessed. At a broad scale, shrublands and grasslands were the most preferred by fire, whereas artificial surfaces and agricultural areas were less fire prone. Forests showed intermediate values of selection ratio. Principal components and cluster analysis identified three regions with significant differences among them: the Mediterranean area, the Balkans and Turkey–Cyprus. Slopes >25% and with a north aspect were also less susceptible to burning. The identification of common land cover and topographic characteristics allows for the application of common management strategies in Southern Europe, coupled with particular measures adjusted to the conditions that are country- and region-specific.";"Oliveira, Sandra

A robust urban and agricultural land market has emerged, characterized by purchases, rapidly rising real land prices, and outsiders from Accra acquiring agricultural holdings for residential and commercial use. The fact that residences are being built, commercial firms are being established, and large firms are acquiring land for commercial interests attests to the ability of the customary system to enable transfers for productive activity. Nevertheless, limited or uncertain property rights increase investment costs and differential access to information in the land market affects equity. This paper seeks to better understand: (a) the land market in peri-urban Accra, (b) the process by which land held by indigenous communities is transferred to outsiders enabling the conversion of unoccupied or agricultural land into residential or commercial uses, and (c) the contradictions and frictions that exist at the interface of land transfers under customary and statutory systems. It further seeks to examine the possibility that uncertain property rights and high litigation costs are constraining commercial and agricultural investment, and to identify the economic and social factors that determine levels of premiums associated with transactions, and the duration of the customary allocation.";"Kasanga, R.

The goal was to construct a spatial typology of farming systems and assess their influence on the extent and spatial distribution of deforestation, forest re-growth, and agriculture expansion in southern Chile between 1999 and 2007. We present a farm typology and its spatial rendering through the combination of farm-cadastral information and land cover and change data. Using multivariate statistical methods, four types were identified. Type I (1565 subsistence farms) and type II farms (1016 multifunctional farms) comprised 94% of the total farms under study. Type III (28 forest farms) and type IV farms (137 specialized dairy farms) represented the remaining 6%, but accounted for 35% of the deforested area. Using Kernel density estimation, it was determined that areas of high deforestation density were related to high concentrations of type I and IV farms, whereas agriculture expansion was related to types I and II. Overall, subsistence farms had the largest influence on the landscape in terms of the spatial extent and concentration of LUCC processes. These results are relevant for planning, especially in countries where rural landscapes are still dominated by farming activities.";"Carmona, A.

We present 5 years (2004-2008) of eddy-covariance (EC) observations of N₂O fluxes from an ecosystem transitioning from wet managed grassland to a broadleaf forestry. One sector of the EC footprint was converted to forestry during the observation period, while the remainder of the footprint remained under intensively managed grassland. The daily N₂O fluxes were responsive to the rainfall and changes in soil moisture, whereas the annual and monthly emissions depended on the amount of nitrogen fertilisers applied. During the year of forest establishment, mechanical disturbances increased N₂O emissions from the forest sector, even higher than the adjacent grassland; in the following 3 years, the intensity of the nitrous oxide flux dropped to approximately one-third of the previous “grassland” level of emission. At the same time, the grassland sector recorded approximately a 20% decrease of flux intensity, coinciding with a reduction in fertiliser application. These observations led us to conclude that while reduced fertilisation and the cessation of grazing contributed to the reduction of N input, a certain period is required for the new forest to establish, settle and mature and thereby to attain a stable rate of emission of N₂O emissions.";"Mishurov, Mikhail

The interviewed forest owners have identified the regulatory framework as highly restrictive having as a result various patterns of behaviours from strict compliance with the rules to illegal activities. Several patternsof self-reported attitudes are discussed in respect to relevant forestowners' typologies and lead to deduced hypotheses about the attitudes and behaviour of Romanian forest owners towards multi-funcionality.

However, the key requirement, in all cases, is effective institutional development.";"Atkinson, Doreen";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land ownership;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500071193";"http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2013.785021";"";"";"";"29-34"

Filterable reactive phosphorus concentrations increased over time and were attributed to the irrigation of poor anion storage capacity (ASC) soils and irrigation-return flows. Differences were noted between measured nitrogen and phosphorus loads and those predicted by Overseer®, which were attributed to a combination of low ASC soils, spray irrigation and artificially drained soils receiving effluent.

Effects of salinity and sodicity on floculation, dispersion, infiltration, hydraulic conductivity, runoff and seal formation were taken into consideration in assessment. In many studies it is indicated that high natrium concentration of soil decreases infiltration and hydraulic conductivity values and stimulates crust formation and dispersion occurrence associated with many factors such as texture, structure, Ca and Mg concentration in solution. In addition to that, it was emphasized that aggregate formation increased and runoff decreased while EC values of irrigation water increased. Dispersion effects of natrium in soils including dominant kaolinite clay minerals is lower than in soils that found dominantly montmorillonit clay minerals. In addition, fine soils have trend for dispersion more than coarse soils in terms of textural properties of soils.

Bu makalede tuzluluk ve alkaliliğin toprakların bazı fiziksel özellikleri üzerine etkileri tartışılmıştır. Değerlendirmede tuzluluk ve alkaliliğin flokülasyon, dispersiyon, infiltrasyon, hidrolik iletkenlik, yüzey akış ve kabuk oluşumuna etkileri esas alınmıştır. Çoğu çalışmalarda topraktaki yüksek sodyum konsantrasyonunun, toprağın tekstürü, strüktürü, çözeltideki Ca ve Mg konsantrasyonu gibi birçok faktörle ilişkili olarak, toprağın infiltrasyon ve hidrolik iletkenlik değerlerini düşürdüğü, yüzey kabuğu oluşumunu ve dispersiyonu teşvik ettiği belirtilmektedir. Ayrıca, sulama suyunun EC değerindeki artışa paralel olarak toprakta agregat oluşumunun teşvik edildiği, yüzey akış değerinin ise azaldığı görülmektedir. Toprak fiziksel özelliklerindeki bu olumlu değişimin derecesini, topraktaki baskın kil minerali çeşidi ve toprak tekstürü belirlemektedir. Kaolinit grubu (1:1 tipi) killerin yaygın olduğu topraklarda sodyumun dispers edici etkisi, montmorillonit grubu (2:1 tipi) killerin baskın olduğu topraklara göre daha düşük seviyededir. Tekstür özellikleri bakımından ise ince bünyeli topraklar kaba bünyeli topraklara göre daha fazla dispers olma eğilimindedirler.";"Yakupoğlu, T., Ondokuz Mayıs Univ., Faculty of Agriculture, Samsun (Turkey).

The actual gender relations within rural communities and the emergence of strategies that are being pursued in communal land processes are obscured and often ignored in policies about communal rangelands, which overemphasise ‘the ecological and economic impact’ and the balancing of these dimensions. As active, primary users, women play a central role in livelihoods supported by communal rangelands yet their access to land is mediated through their relationships with men, effectively circumventing women's land autonomy. A wider debate is necessary to advance the largely superficial policy considerations of women's position in relation to communal rangelands land and their social exclusion on the basis of traditional control of land, forms of access and claiming of use rights. The paper discusses the complexity of land rights under communal land tenure and argues that, despite traditional and policy barriers, women in traditional systems of male-dominated land rights have had some success in accessing communal rangelands. Greater policy impetus is necessary to leverage equitable and independent land access for women amidst debates about management of communal rangelands.";"Kleinbooi, Karin";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"women;land rights;rangelands;rural areas;land tenure";"Land & Gender;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500071194";"http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2013.797027";"";"";"";"17-21"

The position of those who favour privatisation has been strengthened by the belief that the only environmentally sound way to manage the range is to subdivide it into private ranches because traditional open-range pastoralism is environmentally destructive. This point of view is at variance with an ever-increasing body of research. Insufficient attention has been given to the sustainable nature of communal rangeland in savanna areas and to the needs of the poor who depend upon them.

"AGRIS:US201400168415";"Are Swiss birds tracking climate change? Detecting elevational shifts using response curve shapes";"";"Climate change is affecting biodiversity worldwide inducing species to either “move, adapt or die”. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework for analysing range shifts, namely a catalogue of the possible patterns of change in the distribution of a species along elevational or other environmental gradients and an improved quantitative methodology to identify and objectively describe these patterns. Patterns are defined in terms of changes occurring at the leading, trailing or both edges of the distribution: (a) leading edge expansion, (b) trailing edge retraction, (c) range expansion, (d) optimum shift, (e) expansion, (f) retraction, and (g) shift. The methodology is based on the modelling of species distributions along a gradient using generalized additive models (GAMs). Separate models are calibrated for two distinct periods of assessment and response curves are compared over five reference points. Changes occurred at these points are formalized into a code that ultimately designates the corresponding change pattern. We tested the proposed methodology using data from the Swiss national common breeding bird survey. The elevational distributions of 95 bird species were modelled for the periods 1999–2002 and 2004–2007 and significant upward shifts (all patterns confounded) were identified for 35% of the species. Over the same period, an increase in mean temperature was registered for Switzerland. In consideration of the short period covered by the case study, assessed change patterns are considered to correspond to intermediate patterns in an ongoing shifting process. However, similar patterns can be determined by habitat barriers, land use/land cover changes, competition with concurrent or invasive species or different warming rates at different elevations.";"Maggini, Ramona

"AGRIS:US201400012785";"Integrated Approach to Crop Genetic ImprovementF";"";"[Formula: see text] [ Martin A. J. Parry ] The balance between the supply and demand of the major food crops is fragile, fueling concerns for long‐term global food security. The rising population, increasing wealth and a proliferation of non‐food uses (e.g. bioenergy) has led to growing demands on agriculture, while increased production is limited by greater urbanization, and the degradation of land. Furthermore, global climate change with increasing temperatures and lower, more erratic rainfall is projected to decrease agricultural yields. There is a predicted need to increase food production by at least 70% by 2050 and therefore an urgent need to develop novel and integrated approaches, incorporating high‐throughput phenotyping that will both increase production per unit area and simultaneously improve the resource use efficiency of crops. Yield potential, yield stability, nutrient and water use are all complex multigenic traits and while there is genetic variability, their complexity makes such traits difficult to breed for directly. Nevertheless molecular plant breeding has the potential to deliver substantial improvements, once the component traits and the genes underlying these traits have been identified. In addition, interactions between the individual traits must also be taken into account, a demand that is difficult to fulfill with traditional screening approaches. Identified traits will be incorporated into new cultivars using conventional or biotechnological tools. In order to better understand the relationship between genotype, component traits, and environment over time, a multidisciplinary approach must be adopted to both understand the underlying processes and identify candidate genes, QTLs and traits that can be used to develop improved crops.";"Parry, Martin A.

The original daily temperature and relative humidity data were collected from 96 meteorological stations in the region and analyzed by a Mann–Kendall test and linear trend. The results showed that (1) the WVP possesses vertical zonality and longitude zonality, which decreased from the low to high with the elevation increasing, and the WVP changed obviously from the northwest and southeast to the middle of the ARNC. (2) WVP exhibited an abrupt increasing trend in most of the stations over the past 51 years; only four meteorological stations displayed upward trend in the ARNC. The WVP in the desert increased most rapidly, followed by the oasis and mountainous area. (3) The northwest of Xinjiang and northwest of the Hexi Corridor were sensitive to the water vapor change. Thus, further studies should be performed on the relations between the land use and cover and the water vapor change.";"Yao, Junqiang

Spatio‐temporal patterns of change covering 1982–2011 are discussed in the context of changes in land use and land cover (LULCC). LOCATION: Global. METHODS: This study takes advantage of the different phenological cycles of recurrent vegetation (herbaceous vegetation) and persistent vegetation (woody/shrub cover) in combining trend analyses of global‐scale vegetation based on different annual/seasonal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics. Spatial patterns of combined vegetation trends derived from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI are analysed using land‐cover information (GLC2000). RESULTS: The direction of change in annual and seasonal NDVI metrics is similar for most global terrestrial ecosystems, but areas of diverging trends were also observed for certain regions across the globe. These areas are shown to be dominated by land‐cover classes of deciduous forest in tropical/subtropical areas. Areas of observed change are found in dry deciduous forest in South America and central southern Africa and are in accordance with studies of hotspot LULCC areas conducted at local and regional scales. The results show that dense time series of EO data can be used to map large‐scale changes in ecosystem functional type that are due to forest cover dynamics, including forest degradation, deforestation/reforestation and bush encroachment. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We show that areas characterized by changes in ecosystem functioning governed by LULCC at regional and global scales can be mapped from dense time series of global EO data. The patterns of diverging NDVI metric trends can be used as a reference in evaluating the impacts of environmental changes related to LULCC and the approach may be used to detect changes in ecosystem functioning over time.";"Fensholt, Rasmus

Options for a science–policy platform for land";"";"The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) remains the only ‘Rio Convention’ that is not well served by the scientific community and lacks the equivalent of an IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) or the proposed IPBES (Intergovernmental Science–Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). The mounting pressures on land (and water) that can drive its degradation include population growth and associated food security concerns, over use, creeping degradation, competition between agriculture and renewable energy production, carbon sequestration and land acquisition by foreign entities. These environmental and human pressures clearly require urgent policy attention. We report the results of a survey of the scientific community on the need and possible options for a science–policy platform that focuses on land. The paper then describes the remit and role of an independent platform, the benefits and possible modalities that are inclusive and build on existing institutional structures. Both short-term and longer term options are presented that can respond to immediate needs while establishing a mechanism that can handle the interacting and sometimes overlapping aspects of land covered by other Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs). Short-term options include establishing a platform via an ad hoc working group within the proposed IPBES that would feed its outputs into the UNCCD and other relevant MEAs. Long-term options include a more polycentric approach, establishing a network of networks that could evolve into a fully-fledged Independent Platform on Land Degradation given sufficient support, interest and leadership from the international and donor communities.";"Thomas, R.J.

"AGRIS:US201500221357";"Modelling the effect of habitat fragmentation on climate‐driven migration of European forest understorey plants";"";"AIM: The rate of climate change might exceed the migration capacity of plants, particularly where habitats became fragmented by human land use. Except for some tree species, the extent to which habitat fragmentation decreases migration rates has nevertheless been little evaluated. Here, we compare simulated migration rates of understorey herbs, which comprise the big part of temperate forest plant diversity, under varying levels of fragmentation at a continental scale. LOCATION: Europe. METHODS: We combined simulations of demography and seed dispersal to simulate migration of 16 hypothetical forest herb species through a virtual, continuously forested landscape of 50 × 50 km and through 1179 50 × 50 km regions spanning most of the European Union's territory plus Norway and Switzerland. Each region was subdivided into a 250‐m raster of sites, which were rated as suitable to a species if covered by forest according to current land cover maps and future land cover scenarios. The 16 hypothetical species were defined by combinations of those trait values that control demographic and dispersal processes. RESULTS: In continuous forests, simulated migration rates of the 16 species varied between ~95 and ~225 m/y. Current forest fragmentation was predicted to reduce migration rates to about 70% on average across the continent, but to below 25% in many parts of western and southern Europe. Under future land use, migration rates might slightly increase in economically marginal regions. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that even on a continuously forested continent most understorey herbs would be unable to track climate warming and that habitat fragmentation will reduce migration rates to values an order of magnitude lower than expected climate velocities in parts of Europe. We conclude that, instead of concentrating conservation efforts in protected areas, facilitating the movement of species through the average countryside should become a conservation priority.";"Dullinger, Stefan

"AGRIS:US201500217739";"South Africa's national REDD+ initiative: assessing the potential of the forestry sector on climate change mitigation";"";"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) is regarded by its proponents as one of the more efficient and cost effective ways to mitigate climate change. There was further progress toward the implementation of this mechanism at the 16th Conference of Parties (COP) in Cancun in December 2010. Many countries in southern African, including South Africa, have not been integrated (do not participate) into the UN-REDD+ programme, probably due to their low forest cover and national rates of deforestation. This paper discusses the potential contribution of REDD+ activities to the South African Government's pledge of reducing national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 34% below business as usual by 2020. A number of issues such as complex land tenure system, limited forest cover and other conflicting environmental issues present challenges for REDD+ in South Africa. Despite these genuine concerns, REDD+ remains a practical strategy to contribute to climate change mitigation for South Africa. The paper raises the need for development of a variety of emission reduction programmes – not only in the energy sector. The paper also assesses several national options and opportunities towards a working REDD+ mechanism. It concludes by identifying key mechanisms for moving forward to prepare for REDD+ actions in South Africa and raises the urgent need for national dialogue between stakeholders and institutions to evaluate the feasibility of making use of the mechanism in South Africa and the Southern African Development Cooperation (SADC) region. The paper further addresses possible synergies and conflicts between the national climate change and forestry policies towards REDD+ development. It suggests that REDD+ should be part of the national dialogue on policy to respond to climate change and should be integrated into the national flagship programmes that the national climate change white paper seeks to implement. A multiple-benefit REDD+ initiative for South Africa can benefit from these international financial initiatives. It is anticipated that this initiative will provide a platform to enhance policy, institutional and technical stakeholder capacities to access financial incentives that may lead to sound environmental practises.";"Rahlao, Sebataolo

Using a combination of inductive and deductive approaches, land cover and fly distribution maps are analysed in a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate the suitability of different land cover units for the three groups (subgenera) of Glossina. All land cover datasets used for and produced by the study comply with the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). At the continental scale, a strong correlation between land cover and tsetse habitat is found for both the fusca and palpalis groups, whereas a weaker correlation found for the morsitans group may be indicative of less restrictive ecological requirements. At the regional and national levels, thematic aggregation of the multi-purpose Africover datasets yielded high-resolution, standardized land cover maps tailored for tsetse habitat for eight East African countries. The national maps provide remarkable spatial resolution, thematic detail and geographical coverage. They may be applied in subsequent phases of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control projects, including the planning of entomological surveys, actual tsetse control operations and planning for land use in reclaimed areas. The methodology and datasets discussed in the paper may have applications beyond the tsetse and trypanosomiasis issue and may be used with reference to other arthropod vectors, vector-borne and parasitic diseases.";"CECCHI, G.

Vizsgálatunk alapján megállapítható, hogy Nyugat-Dunántúlon azoknak a gazdáknak a körében, akik – a növénytermesztés és az ál-lattenyésztés mellett – már ma is rendelkeznek erdőterületekkel, viszonylag so-kan lennének hajlandóak újabb erdőket telepíteni gyenge minőségű szántó- és gyepterületeiken. Végső elhatározásukat azonban a támogatások alakulásától te-szik függővé. Azt várják, hogy a telepítés költségeinek normatív támogatásán felül részesüljenek abból az Európai Unióban szokásos támogatásból is, amely az erdővel betelepített területek több évtizedig elmaradó jövedelmét pótolja. Mivel az őshonos fafajok telepítései a vadkárokkal szemben jóval érzékenyebbek, ará-nyuk a programban előirányzott mértékig csak akkor lesz növelhető, ha a kárel-hárítás nagy költségei továbbra is megkülönböztetett támogatási célként szere-pelnek. A támogatási rendszer körültekintő alakítása tehát egyre fontosabb, ma már szinte egyedüli eszköze az Erdőstratégia céljai megvalósításának. A gyenge minőségű szántó- és gyepterületek erdősítése szükségszerűen felveti a mező- és erdőgazdálkodás egy vállalaton belüli társításának kérdéseit. Felmé-résünk eredményei azt mutatják, hogy az erdők telepítési és művelési technoló-giájának megváltozása, speciális eszközszükséglete következtében napjainkban már alig érvényesül az erdőgazdálkodásnak a növénytermelés idényszerű mun-kaerő-felhasználását kiegyenlítő hatása. További vizsgálatok lennének szüksége-sek azonban ahhoz, hogy a modern, természetközeli erdőgazdálkodásban  (pél-dául a szálalásos erdőművelésben) milyen lehetőségek rejlenek a mezőgazdasági vállalatok erőforrásainak jobb kihasználására, bevételi forrásainak bővítésére (erdei haszonvételek, falusi turizmus stb.). The targets for forest plantation in the new National Forests Strategy depend fundamentally on the decisions of private landowners, because new forests can only be planted on private land presently classed for agricultural cultivation. Our investigations has shown that relatively many farmers in Western Dunántúl (Trans-Danubia) who already posses forests would be prepared to plant new forests on poor arable and grazing land in addition to plant cultivation and animal husbandry. Their final decision for going ahead depends on the extent of support. Farmers expect to receive in addition to the normative support for costs of plantation the usual European Union support, which compensates for the income from forested land lost for decades. As plantations of indigenous species are far more sensitive to damages by wild animals, their occurrence in the targeted proportion can only be increased if the large costs of damage control are carried on being listed for differential target support. A carefully considered construction of support system plays an increasingly important role; it is almost the last resort in these days for achieving the targets of Forestry Strategy.The forestation of poor arable and grazing land inevitably brings forward the problems of coupling agriculture and forestry activities within one enterprise. According to our studies due to changes in the technology of forest plantation and cultivation and the use special machinery, the balancing effects of seasonal work in plant cultivation and forestry hardly apply in these days. Further studies would be required to explore the scope for better utilization of human resources and enhancement of income in modern nature friendly forestry (for example, special forestry practices, leasing, village tourism, etc.).";"Andrasevits, Zoltan

Unfortunately, map updating requires costly, time-consuming manual image interpretation to achieve accurate spectral threshold placement for land-change masking. The purpose of this study is to minimize time and costs associated with manual image interpretation of change thresholds by developing a new, semi-automated method using support vector machines (SVM). The results of this study show that the SVM change detection method produced more accurate results and required considerably less time and user effort than the manual change detection method, and is thus an effective alternative to manual methods of land-cover map updating.";"Schwert, B.

Model-based decomposition technique is primarily used for land-cover classification mainly because microwave scattering from land is composed of various scattering mechanisms. On the other hand, this technique has not been widely used for oceanic applications since the scattering from sea is mostly surface scattering, and obtaining a classification of different types of scattering is not as important as that on land. However, if an object is present on the sea surface, which gives rise to different scattering characteristics from the sea surface, the decomposition approach may be a useful technique for the detection and classification of the object. We suggest two approaches for target detection on the sea surface. One is to use the model-based decomposition as a polarimetric band-stop filter to block the dominant scattering from the background sea surface, and the other is to focus on the optimized double-bounce scattering component associated with the target using a rotation scheme of the polarimetric matrix. The advantage of these methods is the simplicity of the concept and the algorithm, in which no target-centric analysis is necessary. Experimental results show that model-based decomposition analyses can work as powerful target detectors, effectively separating scattering by targets from dominant background scattering from the sea surface.";"Sugimoto, Mitsunobu

Design/Methodology/Approach: The study was conducted in five villages of Rewari district in Haryana using a Mixed Methods Research Approach. After a qualitative discussion with the parents in groups, a personal interview survey was administered among 75 parents having diverse demographic and socio-economic profiles. The descriptive statistics and chi-square tests have been used for validating the hypotheses on Parents' perception towards inclusion of agriculture in school curriculum. Findings: Result of the study shows that parents who are older in age, farmers by occupation and have landholdings greater than three acres view the inclusion of agriculture in curriculum in a positive manner. It was also found that parents who viewed vocational training favourably also viewed inclusion of agriculture positively. Practical Implications: This research has an implication for policy makers and school administrators while formulating teaching and learning strategies. The study also provides insights in school curriculum development by the educationists based on local requirement.

A critical component of this work is landholder involvement in kangaroo management that results in commercial gain. We are developing strategies for landholders to add value to the harvest at the same time as achieving better control over the impact that kangaroos can have on their land. This paper outlines FATE's experiences with two related initiatives exploring landholder involvement in kangaroo harvest in the rangelands. First, a trial in the Barrier Ranges of north-western New South Wales demonstrates the potential benefits of collaboration for landholders in reducing their exposure to kangaroo harvest variability and the associated business risks. Second, an analysis of the various enterprise models which landholders could employ to enter the kangaroo industry identifies opportunities for landholders and kangaroo harvesters to collaborate for mutual benefit. Several challenges exist in bringing these potential benefits to fruition. The paper includes: (1) analysis of harvest data across collaborating properties; (2) progress towards allocation of harvest tags on a group rather than an individual property basis; (3) results of discussions between key stakeholders; and (4) a description of models for landholder involvement and analysis of the extent to which they can achieve multiple benefits.";"Baumber, A.

However, independent family farms did not become the predominant sector in most of Eastern Europe. A new dual (or bi-modal) agrarian structure emerged, consisting of large farm enterprises (with much less social functions than they had before), and very small peasant farms or subsidiary plots. The paper compares five case studies, looking at agrarian actors, property rights, state influence, and rural poverty. These are Russia, Armenia, Moldova and Uzbekistan in the EECCA region, and China's Xinjiang province in Asia. The paper concludes that state influence is still substantial, property rights regimes are quite diverse and rural poverty remains medium to high. State-led agrarian reform, in particular where a redistributive (or restitution-based) land reform was implemented led in some cases to land-based wealth redistribution, but policies and institutions were lacking to support the individual farm sector. More often the outcome was a rapid transfer of land in the hands of corporate farm enterprises, reversing the initial process of ‘re-peasantization’. It seems that the old ‘Soviet dream’ of mega-farm enterprises in the ‘transition to capitalism’ has regained prominence, with huge agro-holdings ‘calling the shots’, providing an insecure future for agricultural workers, peasants and farmers.";"Spoor, Max";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land reform;property rights;farmers";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"151;142;143;VNM;MDA;CHN;UZB;RUS;ARM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014017";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2011.652949";"";"";"";"175-194"

Above-ground biomass as an indicator of vegetation cover and biodiversity was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, estimation of tree density and biomass with the aim of assessing the extent to which vegetation covers the soil surface. Tree density is significantly different between agricultural and semi-natural systems with an average of 96 and 90 trees ha⁻¹ observed in Rakai and Mayuge respectively. Agricultural fields in Mayuge (9.4 ton ha⁻¹) are associated with significantly higher tree biomass compared with those in Rakai (7.6 ton ha⁻¹). Semi-natural systems in Rakai have an average tree biomass of 10.1 ton ha⁻¹. Agricultural land use systems in the Lake Victoria catchment of Mayuge resemble semi-natural systems in terms of tree biomass as seen from satellite image analysis, supported by extensive field observations. The high and medium biomass cover does imply a relatively continuous vegetative ground cover that would minimize soil loss due to water erosion.";"Isabirye, M.

This paper tries to econometrically analyze the efficiency difference between farming groups and family farming, using original plot yield data from a district in Japan. We accomplish this by, first, analyzing the empirical determinants behind the farmers’ choice of participation forms in farming groups based on communities. Second, we verify the presence of free-riding at community-based farming groups which adopts an income-pooling system. Results of the regression analysis showed that for the choice of participation forms in farming groups the most important factor is family labor force. Estimating yield differences between farming group plots and family farming plots shows that farming groups is less efficient due to the incentive problem. Since the core problem of community-based farming groups seems to be the trade-off between efficiency and equity, even if farming groups yield level decreases, the adoption of commission paid according to each plot’s yield is not necessarily desirable. Therefore, a profit distribution mechanism in community-based farming groups should be designed, taking equity issues also into consideration.";"Nakajima, Shinsaku

In addition to chemical and physical soil quality indicators, dehydrogenase and phenol oxidase activity were measured, ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (¹³C NMR) and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of soil organic matter were collected, and visible, near-infrared reflectance (VNIR) spectra of whole soil were collected. Enzyme activities were positively correlated with several soil quality indicators and labile fractions of soil organic matter (r� =� 0.58–0.92), and were negatively correlated with DRIFT indices of decomposition stage and recalcitrance (r� =� −0.62 to −0.76). A comparison of vegetative and land management practices was scored using the soil management assessment framework (SMAF)—a soil quality index. Perennial vegetation (i.e., native prairie, restored prairie, and timothy) plots exhibited the greatest soil quality (SMAF scores 93.6–98.6 out of 100), followed by no-till and conventionally cultivated plots, with wheat outranking corn. Among fertilization practices, soil quality followed the order: manure� >� inorganic fertilizer� >� unamended soil. Finally, in the estimation of soil properties, VNIR spectra generally outperformed DRIFT spectra using partial least squares regression� (PLSR) and multiple, linear regression (MLR). The strongest estimates of dehydrogenase and phenol oxidase activity were found using MLR models of VNIR spectra (R²� >� 0.78, RPD� >� 2.20). Overall, this study demonstrates the potential utility and versatility of enzymes in modeling and assessing changes in soil organic carbon fractions and soil quality, and emphasizes the benefits of maintaining long-term agricultural experiments.";"Veum, Kristen S.

With decreasing opportunities to claim natural forests for agriculture and shrinking landholdings, rotational agriculture on smaller holdings allows insufficient time for fallow to regenerate naturally into secondary forest. This case study examines how Peruvian farmers use “improved fallows” as an adaptive response to a situation of decreasing soil fertility and how the farmers describe the rationale underlying the various actions taken in these modified fallow systems. The results indicate that farmers establish improved fallows using contextual ecological knowledge and various techniques to introduce a large diversity of tree species. This practice is also used to restore degraded land to agricultural production. The tasks of maintaining productivity on agricultural land and reforesting degraded areas is becoming increasingly urgent in the Amazon, making agricultural practices that involve reforestation and tree management highly relevant. Since swidden farming systems are the basis for the livelihoods of most Amazon smallholders, good farming practices elaborated by swidden farmers are important for sustainable small-scale family farming systems in the Amazon.";"Marquardt, Kristina

In practice, it is suggested that these cases are the outcomes of a spectrum of property rights.  The standard economic theory of the use of open-access resources as developed by Western economists is outlined and ways in which it has limited applicability to developing countries are suggested.  This theory does not, for example, consider the possibility that incomes in open-access situations may fall to subsistence levels, as appears to be common in developing countries.  A model is presented in which the long-run equilibrium involves a subsistence level of income which may be at or near a poverty level.  This seems more relevant for developing countries.  It is shown that governments in developing economies may be unable to find workable policies that will extricate communities from such a poverty trap.  Reasons why governments in developing countries may allow such a situation to occur are discussed.  The limitations of using new technologies to increase harvesting productivity and reduce poverty are discussed.

Globally, the size of the MTA estate is likely to be very large, but just how large is unknown. Our preliminary analyses has identified that MTAs cover at least 1% of the Earth's surface. This figure is believed to be closer to 5–6% as no verifiable data exist for the majority of Africa, South America and Asia. MTAs occur in all major global ecosystems and have the potential to increase the global protected area network by at least 25%. MTAs therefore have an important complementary role to play in global conservation. However public policy makers, the scientific community, government agencies, and nongovernment organizations have largely ignored MTAs as a conservation resource. To realize the potential major contribution to conservation that MTAs can play we propose four key policy changes: (1) better document the environmental values of MTAs, (2) develop integrated MTA land management models, (3) increase dedicated financial resources for the land management of MTAs, and (4) strengthened global leadership to manage MTAs as an environmental resource.";"Zentelis, Rick

The major requirement for almost all research needed for sustainable forest management is extensive and intensive monitoring. GIS is a convenient tool for integrating remotely sensed data and various other kinds geo-referenced data. Detailed spatial and temporal change patterns of the land uses in the area were quantified by interpreting aerial photographs of the years 1945 and 1973 and a satellite image of 2001. The results showed that the rate of forest growth is significantly larger during the second period (1973-2001) than during the earlier one (1945-1973). This is mostly due to the introduction, in 1980, of a protection regime, including two high-protection core areas, and a buffer zone. From 1945 to 2001 the openings which are important as hunting biotopes for raptors were significantly decreased. Apart from the protection of the area that was played an important role in the forest changes the effects of various landscape parameters (elevation, slope, distance from the roads and urban areas, aspect, soil depth, geology, erosion and forest density) on these changes were examined.";"Triantakonstantis, D.P.

Understanding how an animal interacts with elements of the landscape helps predict its response to habitat loss and changes in land cover. We tested the hypothesis that the extent of movement depends on landscape composition in a threatened freshwater turtle, Emydoidea blandingii. We measured habitat composition at multiple spatial scales, ranging from the home range to the landscape scale. We built multiple linear regression models to predict home range size from the proportional use of 5 land-use categories, while controlling for intrinsic factors (sex, body size). We found that landscape composition significantly influenced home range size in the Blanding's turtle; however, the models explained a low proportion of the observed variation in home range size, meaning that landscape composition had a weak effect on movement. Our results also suggest that sex and body size have little influence on home range size in Blanding's turtles. More research is needed to determine the factors driving movement in this species, and overall, we recommend cautious use of models predicting space use as a function of landscape composition in a conservation context.";"Fortin, Gabrielle

"AGRIS:DJ2012048223";"Cambodian peasant's contribution to rural development: a perspective from Kampong Thom Province";"";"The paper aims to identify the rationality of peasant communities and their contribution to rural development in Kampong Thom province. To do so, an interdisciplinary analytical framework addresses the dynamics of land use and land tenure, the strategies of labor force allocation as well as the determinants of land and labor agricultural productivities amongst peasant communities. It rests on details field surveys in two communes located in very distinct agro-ecological settings of Kampong Thom province. A land use change analysis based on time-series aerial photos is conducted with participatory inventories of natural resources. It shows that endogenous management of forest and fisheries resources generate significant incomes and, at the same time, contribute to maintaining biodiversity. The paper analyses how this contribution is challenged by the non-peasant actors involved in massive State land privatization. Aiming to full employment, peasant households enjoy a great flexibility in the way they allocate labor force, especially in line with the age of active labor and the fluctuation of labor opportunity costs. Principally due to an unequal land holding distribution, agricultural income is unfairly distributed but this inequality is actually balanced by the access to common-pool resources of crucial importance for the poorest and by the recourse to non farming activities, which is an important factor of socio-economic differentiation amongst households. The main economic indicators of rice production confirm that peasant households always try to maximize their income in step with the production factor they have in relatively less amount. A land market simulation stresses that, contrarily to theoretical assumptions, land access through sale (and purchase) does not result in a fairer land distribution. Nevertheless, land leases amongst peasant households seem more promising to ensure equitable access to land as they are embedded in collective security mechanisms activated by peasantry. The paper argues that peasant communities in the studied area constitute a solid basis for rural development as they offer a very good articulation between economic efficiency, social justice and environmental sustainability. Finally, recommendations are formulated to properly address peasant contribution to rural development in the new national agrarian policies.";"Diepart, JC.";"";"Les Presses agronomiques de Gembloux";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"";"rural development;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KHM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012048223";"http://www.pressesagro.be/base/text/v14n2/321.pdf";"";"";"";"321-340"

"AGRIS:US201500220000";"Biotic resistance in freshwater fish communities: species richness, saturation or species identity?";"";"Some communities are susceptible to invasions and some are not. Why? Elton suggested in 1958 that the ability of the community to withstand invading species – its biotic resistance – depends on the number of resident species. Later contributors have emphasized the habitat's ability to support species, as well as the contribution of individual species to the resistance. In this study we use information from 184 introductions of Arctic char into Swedish lakes to study both abiotic and biotic aspects of the resident community's ability to resist introductions. We find that the best model included the proportion of forest cover and the proportion of agricultural land cover in the watershed in combination with the presence versus absence of northern pike. Thus, the most important biotic factor to explain the outcome of introductions of Arctic char is the presence of northern pike, a large piscivore. This means that one single species explains the outcome of the introductions better than does the species richness or the saturation level of the community.";"Henriksson, Anna

Due to the vast amount of inputs (water, fertilizers, fuel, etc.) required, and outputs of various agricultural residues (vegetable waste, plastic sheeting, phytosanitary product containers, etc.), the impact of this type of production system to the environment is considerable in particular if pursued without a sound and sustainable territorial planning. Thus, very high-resolution images provided by satellites such as QuickBird and Ikonos can be useful to plan the expansion of the greenhouse crop-production system in a sustainable way, as well as to reduce the environmental impact of the actual greenhouses improving the inputs use efficiency (water, fertilizers, phytosanitary products, etc.). This work is focused on automated detection of the boundaries of greenhouses using for this purpose the classification results from very high-resolution multi-spectral images of Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared (RGBNIR) from QuickBird and Ikonos satellites. First, a supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and an Extraction and Classification of Homogeneous Objects (ECHO) both using all the four bands were carried out with focus on plastic greenhouses detection. In the second step, the detected greenhouses according to the classification results were vectorized automatically to generate polygons with irregular borders. In the third step, the irregular contours of polygons were converted into straight lines using an algorithm based on the Hough transformation. The input parameters of this algorithm were obtained by two different procedures: calibration and pseudo-calibration. In the calibration process, the parameter set is obtained from a sample of greenhouses minimizing the area and perimeter errors. In the pseudo-calibration process, a parameter set is obtained for each greenhouse but it is a high time-consumer task. The calibration yielded 66.7% for QuickBird and 49% for Ikonos image of correct delineation of greenhouses. Pseudo-calibration improved success rate and reduced performance difference between the two types of images. The proposed algorithm is able to delineate any greenhouse contour if the proper parameters set is correctly derived.";"Agüera, F.

However, cattlemen-panther conflicts and lack of trust in wildlife agencies is undermining panther conservation efforts. Based on semi-structured interviews and group meetings with Florida cattlemen, we examine how cattlemen’s land stewardship practices support panther conservation, and causes of conflicts with the panther and wildlife agencies. Given the heterogeneous attitudes of cattlemen and their varying economic conditions, a complementary suite of programs is needed to achieve efficient conservation of the panther and panther habitat. Current and proposed government incentive programs are unlikely to attain the level of habitat conservation required to recover the Florida panther. We suggest that efforts should be made to build social capital and trust by engaging influential cattlemen in panther conservation actions, thereby lending credibility to conservation initiatives and improving the rate of uptake and levels of commitment by other cattlemen. Moreover, providing cattlemen with payments that are contingent on keeping lands as unimproved pasture or wildlife habitat without mandating particular land management practices may be an effective policy alternative.";"Pienaar, Elizabeth Frances

Using focus groups, a household survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity, plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and access to stable markets. Our pilot study suggests that the convergence of grassroots mobilization and political-institutional change is a central leverage point for developing more resilient food systems.";"Blesh, Jennifer

In the Italian Alps, grassland patches enclosed in a forest matrix are progressively disappearing. Two alpine valleys (Pesio and Pejo), having similar land-use history, were chosen as representative of management conditions of western and eastern Italian Alps, respectively. This study aims at interpreting the effect of abandonment on grassland patch plant diversity, considering land cover changes of the last 60 years, and assessing the role of ecological, topographic, management and landscape configuration on current grassland species richness. The total area of grassland patches has declined by 54 and 91 % at Pesio and at Pejo, respectively. Actual grassland patch species richness was mostly influenced by ecological factors, such as quantity of light, soil moisture and reaction, then by topographic features, especially slope, and finally by management intensity. Landscape factors exerted a slightly significant effect on plant diversity. In the two valleys, differences on management practices were detected. Even though in the western valley the conservation of several grazing activities contributed to slow down the process of patch reduction, many species-rich grasslands were generally under-grazed. Conversely, in the eastern valley, despite a denser road network, the stronger decline of grassland patch extension was linked to the hay making decline. At the same time, overuse of grassland patches near farms reduced plant species richness. As a conclusion, plant species richness was weakly related to the area of grassland patches and current and historical landscape configuration were of relatively lower importance than ecological, topographic and management factors, when evaluated at patch-level.";"Orlandi, Stefano

In a novel approach, we used a long-term time series including historical map data to predict the influence of one century of tropical forest change on keystone species or indicator groups in the Kakamega–Nandi forests, western Kenya. Four time steps of land cover data between 1912/13 and 2003, derived from Landsat satellite imagery, aerial photography and old topographic maps, formed the basis for extrapolating species abundance data on the army ant Dorylus wilverthi, the guild of ant-following birds and three habitat guilds of birds differing in forest dependency. To predict the species' spatio-temporal distribution, we combined spatially explicit geographical information system (GIS)-based modelling with statistical modelling, that is, ordinary least square (OLS) regression models for D. wilverthi and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models for ant-following birds. We directly related bird habitat guilds to five forest classes as distinguished in the land cover time series. Extrapolation results over time predict dramatic losses in abundance for D. wilverthi (56%), ant-following birds (58%) and forest bird individuals in general (47%) due to a forest loss of 31% and small-scale fragmentation within the past century. Extrapolations based on a scenario of further deforestation revealed the negative consequences of clearing and splitting up continuous forest into isolated patches, whereas a reforestation scenario suggests the positive impact of natural forest regrowth and indigenous-tree planting. This study demonstrates the high potential of integrating remotesensing and field-based faunal data for landscape-scale quantitative assessments over time. In addition, it shows the suitability of extrapolation studies for evaluating measures of forest conservation.";"Lung, Tobias

"AGRIS:US201600125502";"Projected robust shift of climate zones over West Africa in response to anthropogenic climate change for the late 21st century";"";"The response of West African climate zones to anthropogenic climate change during the late 21st century is investigated using the revised Thornthwaite climate classification applied to ensembles of CMIP5, CORDEX, and higher-resolution RegCM4 experiments (HIRES). The ensembles reproduce fairly well the observed climate zones, although with some notable discrepancies. CORDEX and HIRES provide realistic fine-scale information which enhances that from the coarser-scale CMIP5, especially in the Gulf of Guinea encompassing marked landcover and topography gradients. The late 21st century projections reveal an extension of torrid climates throughout West Africa. In addition, the Sahel, predominantly semi-arid in present-day conditions, is projected to face moderately persistent future arid climate. Similarly, the Gulf of Guinea shows a tendency in the future to experience highly seasonal semi-arid conditions. Finally, wet and moist regions with an extreme seasonality around orographic zones become less extensive under future climate change. Consequently, West Africa evolves towards increasingly torrid, arid and semi-arid regimes with the recession of moist and wet zones mostly because of the temperature forcing, although precipitation can be locally an important factor. These features are common to all multimodel ensembles, a sign of robustness, with few disagreements in their areal extents, and with more pronounced changes in the higher-resolution RCM projections. Such changes point towards an increased risk of water stress for managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and thus add an element of vulnerability to future anthropogenic climate change for West African water management, ecosystem services and agricultural activities.";"Sylla, Mouhamadou Bamba

To inventory and monitor this urban development effectively, remote sensing provides a viable source of data from which updated land cover information can be extracted efficiently and cheaply. In this study, data from three satellite datasets, Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5 TM), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat 7 ETM+) and Terra/Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), acquired during 1987, 2000 and 2005, respectively, were used to detect and evaluate Hurghada's urban expansion. Five change detection techniques were tested to detect areas of change. The techniques considered were image differencing, image ratioing, image overlay, multidate principal component analysis (PCA) and post-classification comparison. The post-classification comparison was found to be the most accurate procedure and produced three land use/land cover (LULC) maps of the years 1987, 2000 and 2005 with overall accuracies of 87.8%, 88.9% and 92.0%, respectively. The urban expansion analysis revealed that the built-up area has expanded by ∼40 km² in 18 years (1987–2005). In addition, 4.5 km² of landfill/sedimentation was added to the sea as a result of the coastal urban development and tourist activities. The booming coastal tourism and population pressure were considered to be the main factors driving this expansion, and some natural and artificial constraints constrained the physical shape of the city. The expansion is represented by urban fringe development, linear, infill and isolated models. Topography, lithology and structures were also analysed as possible factors that influenced the expansion. The understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of Hurghada's urban expansion is the cornerstone for formulating a view about the future urban uses and for making the best use of the limited resources that are available.";"Kamh, Samir

We therefore determined whether fish yield in RF can be increased without increasing nitrogen (N) loss into the environment (i.e., the risk of N pollution) by management of N inputs. In an experiment comparing traditional RF (with fertilization, with very low fish feed) with fish monoculture (FM; without fertilization, with very low fish feed), and rice monoculture (RM; with fertilization, without fish feed), rice yields were equivalent in traditional RF and RM, fish yields were relatively low in both FM and RF, and traditional RF released less N into the environment than RM but more N than FM. In a second experiment, an increase in fish stocking density and associated increase in fish feed in RF did not decrease rice yield, but increased fish yield and increased the release of N into the environment. A third experiment indicated that adjusting the ratio of N added as fertilizer vs. N added as feed to 37% fertilizer-N and 63% fish feed-N increased fish yield without reducing rice yield or N use efficiency and without increasing the release of N into the environment. Our results indicate that fish yield can be increased in the traditional RF system without increasing N pollution by managing the relative quantities of N added as fertilizer vs. feed";"Hu, Liangliang

Assigning a value to the development is difficult and can be costly. Data was collected on 409 preservation transactions from 3 Maryland counties and supplemented with farm level spatial data via GIS.  A hedonic price analysis is conducted to determine the marginal return to different farm characteristics using a spatial econometric model to correct for spatial correlation.  Parcel characteristics such as distance to city and town, number of acres, prime soils and current land-use explain eighty percent of the variation in easement values.  As expected, characteristics perform least well in explaining easement values in transfer of development right programs.  This information can help formulate policy decisions and selection criteria to maximize the preservation of the agricultural economy and/or maximize public preferences.  A supply curve is constructed using simulations that determine non-participant parcels' easement values.  To preserve the remaining eligible acres in these three counties, $167 million would be needed.

One popular solution to stabilize while conserving intertidal habitat is the use of “living shoreline” techniques which are designed to mimic natural shoreline communities by using native plants and animals. However, little information is available on the success of living shoreline stabilization. This project evaluated the wave energy attenuation associated with living shorelines that contained Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and/or Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in a wave tank. Four living shoreline techniques were assessed, including a control (sediment only), oysters alone, cordgrass alone, and a combination of oysters plus cordgrass. Time since deployment (newly deployed, one-year after deployment) was also assessed to see how wave energy attenuation changed with natural oyster recruitment and plant growth. Wave energy was calculated for each newly deployed and one-year old shoreline stabilization treatment using capacitance wave gauges and generated waves that were representative of boat wakes in Mosquito Lagoon, a shallow-water estuary in Florida. All one-year old treatments attenuated significantly more energy than newly-deployed treatments. The combination of one-year old S. alterniflora plus live C. virginica was the most effective as this treatment reduced 67 % of the wave energy created by a single recreational boat wake, compared to bare sediment. Natural resource managers and landowners facing shoreline erosion issues can use this information to create effective stabilization protocols that preserve shorelines while conserving native intertidal habitats.";"Manis, Jennifer E.

"AGRIS:US201500211815";"No scientific consensus on GMO safety";"";"A broad community of independent scientific researchers and scholars challenges recent claims of a consensus over the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In the following joint statement, the claimed consensus is shown to be an artificial construct that has been falsely perpetuated through diverse fora. Irrespective of contradictory evidence in the refereed literature, as documented below, the claim that there is now a consensus on the safety of GMOs continues to be widely and often uncritically aired. For decades, the safety of GMOs has been a hotly controversial topic that has been much debated around the world. Published results are contradictory, in part due to the range of different research methods employed, an inadequacy of available procedures, and differences in the analysis and interpretation of data. Such a lack of consensus on safety is also evidenced by the agreement of policymakers from over 160 countries - in the UN’s Cartagena Biosafety Protocol and the Guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius - to authorize careful case-by-case assessment of each GMO by national authorities to determine whether the particular construct satisfies the national criteria for ‘safe’. Rigorous assessment of GMO safety has been hampered by the lack of funding independent of proprietary interests. Research for the public good has been further constrained by property rights issues, and by denial of access to research material for researchers unwilling to sign contractual agreements with the developers, which confer unacceptable control over publication to the proprietary interests.The joint statement developed and signed by over 300 independent researchers, and reproduced and published below, does not assert that GMOs are unsafe or safe. Rather, the statement concludes that the scarcity and contradictory nature of the scientific evidence published to date prevents conclusive claims of safety, or of lack of safety, of GMOs. Claims of consensus on the safety of GMOs are not supported by an objective analysis of the refereed literature.";"Hilbeck, Angelika

"AGRIS:US201600102757";"Centrarchid Assemblages in Floodplain Lakes of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley";"";"The family Centrarchidae is a principal and visible component of the ichthyofauna in most warmwater ecosystems in North America, and many of its species provide key recreational fisheries. We examined the significance of various local environmental factors to 13 centrarchid species in 53 floodplain lakes (remnant channels) of the Mississippi alluvial valley to identify major environmental gradients influential in structuring centrarchid assemblages. With few exceptions, changes in forest representation in the land cover, both in the lakeshore and the catchment, had the strongest associations with centrarchid assemblages. Other influential factors included depth, water clarity, and primary productivity. Connectivity to adjacent streams was weakly correlated with centrarchid assemblage structure and correlated only with a small number of species. Lake area did not appear to affect centrarchid assemblages. Recognition that land cover has the strongest correlation with centrarchid assemblage composition suggests a landscape basis for developing management plans. However, conservation and restoration of native centrarchid assemblages in these unique ecosystems will require both watershed management to curtail inputs and in-lake management to reverse years of neglect.

"AGRIS:US201500084499";"Evapotranspiration models of different complexity for multiple land cover types";"";"A comparison between half-hourly and daily measured and computed evapotranspiration (ET) using three models of different complexity, namely, the Priestley–Taylor (P-T), the reference Penman–Monteith (P-M) and the Common Land Model (CLM), was conducted using three AmeriFlux sites under different land cover and climate conditions (i.e. arid grassland, temperate forest and subhumid cropland). Using the reference P-M model with a semiempirical soil moisture function to adjust for water-limiting conditions yielded ET estimates in reasonable agreement with the observations [root mean square error (RMSE) of 64–87W/m-2 for half-hourly and RMSE of 0.5–1.9mm/day for daily and similar to the complex Common Land Model (RMSE of 60–94W/m-2 for half-hourly and RMSE of 0.4–2.1mm/day1 for daily) at the grassland and cropland sites. However, the semiempirical soil moisture function was not applicable particularly for the P-T model at the forest site, suggesting that adjustments to key model variables may be required when applied to diverse land covers. On the other hand, under certain land cover/environmental conditions, the use of microwave-derived soil moisture information was found to be a reliable metric of regional moisture conditions to adjust simple ET models for water-limited cases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the utility of the simplified methods for different landscapes.";"Choi, Minha

"AGRIS:QY2016100028";"A comparative analysis of conservation agriculture systems: Benefits and challenges of rotations and intercropping in Zimbabwe";"";"Increasing soil degradation in southern Africa and the potentially negative effects of climate change demand ?greener? solutions to reverse this trend. Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as one of those solutions and field level data show marked benefits of this new cropping system. Nevertheless, the use of rotations and/or associations in CA systems is challenging at both the farm and community level. Intercropped maize (Zea mays L.) with grain legumes, cowpea and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. (Millsp.)), as well as maize rotated with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. (Walp)) and sunnhemp (Crotalaria ochroleuca L.) was studied for up to eight seasons under CA and conventional agriculture in Zimbabwe. The objective of this study, carried out on-farm and on-station, was to highlight the effects of CA systems on some soil quality indicators and crop productivity. Where possible the specific effects of rotation and intercropping was separated and compared with monocropping. The on-station and on-farm results show: an increase of up to 331% in water infiltration, a 31% greater soil carbon in the top 60 cm than on adjacent conventionally ploughed fields, a 6% lower bulk density in the top 10 cm and 32.5?36 t ha−1 less cumulative soil erosion in CA fields after seven cropping seasons compared with the conventional control treatment. The comparative productivity analysis between continuous maize, maize intercropped with cowpea or pigeonpea and maize in rotation with cowpea or sunnhemp, shows marked benefits of rotation especially in CA systems. The benefits of CA especially when rotated with leguminous crops, increase over time, suggesting that there are improvements in soil structure and fertility. However, field level benefits will not increase the overall adoption of rotations and intercropping in CA systems, unless the socio-economic constraints at the farm and community level are addressed.";"Thierfelder, C.

"AGRIS:US201600044917";"Curiosity killed the bat: Domestic cats as bat predators";"";"Domestic cats are suspected to have an impact on wild populations of birds and small mammals, but published reports of predation on bats are either rare or anecdotal. We based our study on 1012 records of bats admitted at four wildlife rescue centres in peninsular Italy in 2009–2011. We hypothesized that (1) cats prevalently prey on bats emerging from roosts, so newborns or non volant juveniles should be less exposed to predation; (2) because cats occur in human settlements, the bat species most frequently involved are house-roosting (3) predation is season-biased, most events being more likely to take place in summer when females congregate in roosts to reproduce; (4) predation events concentrate in sparse-urban and rural areas, where free-ranging cats occur more frequently; and (5) some individual cats may specialize in capturing bats. We found that predation by cats was the first cause of rescue for bats in the study area, accounting for 28.7% of records of adult bats admitted to rehabilitation centres. Although most bats caught by cats belonged to house-roosting species, at least 3 of the 11 species affected were tree- or cave-roosting. Predation affected more frequently adult females in summer and thus threatened reproductive colonies, which were often subjected to repeated predations. As predicted, predation events were associated with land cover, being more abundant in rural and sparse urban areas, where cats are more often allowed to stay outdoor, as confirmed by the results of a cat owner survey we carried out. Cats are explorative mammals, so they may be easily attracted at bat roosts by sensory cues involving sound, smell and vision. Our analysis covered a broad geographical area over a relatively long period and suggests that the threat posed to bats by cats may be significant and should be carefully considered in conservation plans. Strategies to mitigate this impact should encompass the control of feral cat populations and indoor restriction of owned cats at least where predation on bats is probable.";"Ancillotto, Leonardo

Rich terrestrial and aquatic species communities are found throughout Neotropical forests, habitats increasingly threatened by land management practices. Plant-held waters, phytotelmata, are ecologically important discrete microhabitats harboring many specialist invertebrates and are abundant in tropical forests. In this study, using artificial tree holes, we examined invertebrate tree hole communities in a mature forest of Los Tuxtlas and in a managed habitat adjacent to the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station. Based on the proximity of human and livestock communities to managed habitats and the dispersal limitations of some phytotelmata specialists, we expected to find community composition differences between the two habitats. We found distinct differences in chironomid colonization; Tanypodinae, a predaceous subfamily, was present in the managed habitat and its omnivorous counterpart, Chironominae, was present in the forest. We found differences in mosquito colonization with more predaceous Toxorhychites in the managed habitat. Haemagogus mosquitoes were only present in the managed habitat. These results indicate different colonization ability across phytotelmata specialists and warn of larger community shifts and potential public health hazards with continued and intensified forest fragmentation and degradation.";"Khazan, Emily S.

The objective of this study was to review the extent to which UK land management is accounted for as a source of emission of ammonia (NH₃), nitrous oxide (N₂O), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), organic nitrogen (Nₒᵣg), methane (CH₄), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), particulate matter (PM) and heavy metals (HM), in comparison with the current state of scientific knowledge; to ascertain whether there is evidence for significant gaps or that key emission sources have been overlooked. The processes leading to emissions of NH₃, N₂O and CH₄ are largely understood and all major sources are thought to be captured in the current inventory. Quantification of uncertainties in the estimates for some of these sources is still required, as is an assessment of the potential improvement in accuracy of estimates through the development of country-specific emission factors for N₂O and CH₄ in particular. There is limited knowledge about sources and processes leading to emissions of Nₒᵣg and the role that these may play in local and global nitrogen budgets. Land management is known to be a source of NOₓ, NMVOC and PM emissions, and potentially also HM emissions. Improved quantification is required to assess the importance of land management as a source of these pollutants in comparison with other sectors and, if appropriate, to determine the potential for mitigation.";"Misselbrook, T.H.

This summary report comprises key tenure issues about tenure and natural resource management in The Gambia. It looks at definitions of tenure and resource-management vocabulary, formal legislation and customary tenure arrangements, and areas where tenure issues are the most contentious. Having identified the key problems in the current tenure systems, the report then addresses various approaches that government and donors may wish to take in confronting these problems. These proposals range from replacing customary tenure regimes with new legal frameworks to looking for ways to strengthen established customary arrangements. The report goes on to consider how individuals working in the natural resource domain can better respond to tenure concerns through designing and implementing projects.

In this study different types of land use/land cover (LULC) types were analysed by employing object-oriented classification approach to dual TerraSAR-X images (HH and HV polarisation) at African Sahel. For that purpose, multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) of the Definiens software was used for creating the image objects. Using the feature space optimisation (FSO) tool the attributes of the TerraSAR-X image were optimised in order to obtain the best separability among classes for the LULC mapping. The backscattering coefficients (BSC) for some classes were observed to be different for HH and HV polarisations. The best separation distance of the tested spectral, shape and textural features showed different variations among the discriminated LULC classes. An overall accuracy of 84 % with a kappa value 0.82 was resulted from the classification scheme, while accuracy differences among the classes were kept minimal. Finally, the results highlighted the importance of a combine use of TerraSAR-X data and object-oriented classification approaches as a useful source of information and technique for LULC analysis in the African Sahel drylands.";"Biro, Khalid

The major process of desertification takes place in the arid and semi-arid areas. To allocate spots of stable degradation of vegetation, the transition zone was first identified. Productivity of vegetation in transfer zone is slightly dependent on climate conditions. Multi-year digital maps of vegetation index were generated with NOAA satellite images. According to the result, the territory of the republic was zoned by means of vegetation productivity criterion. All the arable lands in Kazakhstan are in the risky agriculture zone. Estimation of the productivity of agricultural lands is highly important in the context of risky agriculture, where natural factors, such as wind and water erosion, can significantly change land quality in a relatively short time period. We used an integrated vegetation index to indicate land degradation measures to assess the inter-annual features in the response of vegetation to variations in climate conditions from low-resolution satellite data for all of Kazakhstan.

We evaluated the productivity and phenology of western South Dakota mixed-grass prairie in the period from 2000 to 2008 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI is based on 250-m spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. Growing-season NDVI images were integrated weekly to produce time-integrated NDVI (TIN), a proxy of total annual biomass production, and integrated seasonally to represent annual production by cool- and warm-season species (C₃ and C₄, respectively). Additionally, a variety of phenological indicators including cool-season percentage of TIN were derived from the seasonal profiles of NDVI. Cool-season percentage and TIN were combined to generate vegetation classes, which served as proxies of the conditions of plant communities. TIN decreased with precipitation from east to west across the study area. However, the cool-season percentage increased from east to west, following patterns related to the reliability (interannual coefficient of variation [CV]) and quantity of midsummer precipitation. Cool-season TIN averaged 76.8% of the total TIN. Seasonal accumulation of TIN corresponded closely (R² > 0.90) to that of gross photosynthesis data from a carbon flux tower. Field-collected biomass and community composition data were strongly related to TIN and cool-season percentage. The patterns of vegetation classes were responsive to topographic, edaphic, and land management influences on plant communities. Accurate maps of biomass production, cool- and warm-season composition, and vegetation classes can improve the efficiency of land management by facilitating the adjustment of stocking rates and season of use to maximize rangeland productivity and achieve conservation objectives. Further, our results clarify the spatial and temporal dynamics of phenology and TIN in mixed-grass prairie.";"Rigge, Matthew

"AGRIS:US201400144538";"Hydrologic responses to land cover change: the case of Jedeb mesoscale catchment, Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia";"";"The objective of this study was to quantify the impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) change on the hydrology of the Jedeb, an agricultural dominated mesoscale catchment, in the Abay/Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. Two methods have been used. First, the trends of certain daily flow variability parameters were evaluated to detect statistical significance of the change of the hydrologic response. Second, a conceptual monthly hydrological model was used to detect changes in the model parameters over different periods to infer LULC change. The results from the statistical analysis of the daily flows between 1973 and 2010 reveal a significant change in the response of the catchment. Peak flow is enhanced, i.e. response appears to be flashier. There is a significant increase in the rise and fall rates of the flow hydrograph, as well as the number of low‐flow pulses below a threshold level. The discharge pulses show a declining duration with time. The model result depicts a change in model parameters over different periods, which could be attributed to an LULC change. The model parameters representing soil moisture conditions indicated a gradual decreasing trend, implying limited storage capacity likely attributed to increasing agricultural farming practices in the catchment. This resulted in more surface runoff and less infiltration into the soil layers. The results of the monthly flow duration curve analysis indicated large changes of the flow regime. The high flow has increased by 45% between the 1990s and 2000s, whereas the reduction in low flows was larger: a 15% decrease between 1970s and 1980s, 39% between 1980s and 1990s and up to 71% between 1990s and 2000s. These results, could guide informed catchment management practices to reduce surface runoff and augment soil moisture level in the Jedeb catchment.

expansion claimed more than 1 million acres per year between 1960 and 1990, yet is not seen as a threat to most farming, although it may reduce production of some high-value or specialty crops. The consequences of continued largelot development may be less sanguine, since it consumes much more land per unit of housing than the typical suburb. Controlling growth and planning for it are the domains of State and local governments. The Federal Government may be able to help them in such areas as building capacity to plan and control growth, providing financial incentives for channeling growth in desirable directions, or coordinating local, regional, and State efforts.";"Heimlich, Ralph E.

"AGRIS:US201500223911";"Definition of British Water Beetle Species Pools (Coleoptera) and their Relationship to Altitude, Temperature, Precipitation and Land Cover Variables";"";"Pooled water beetle species lists from 1826 British national grid 10-km squares were analysed using multivariate ordination and classification methods. The relationships of pool groups to the climate, altitude and land cover variables were assessed using constrained and partial ordinations. Ordination of the species pool data indicated a major trend between squares in the north-west of Scotland and those in southern England, illustrating differences in acid and basic water standing water. Secondary variation was from acid standing water to fast-flowing streams and rivers. Classification generated nine species pool groups. These showed a distinct north-west to south-east trend but there was no obvious coastal or brackish water effect on distribution. The climatic and land cover variables were all significantly related to each other, and to north-south variation in grid square location, but the constrained ordination results indicated that that the most important influence on water beetle species pool distribution was mean summer temperature. Although the amount of variation explained by the environmental variables was low, spatial variation in the environmental predictors was almost as important as the environmental variables themselves in determining species pool composition. Mean annual temperature was also strongly correlated with species pool distribution with two land cover variables slightly less important. Altitude and precipitation had the least influence. The water beetle national recording scheme database appears to be of sufficiently high quality for environmental investigations at the British scale. There is considerable potential for the synthesis of invertebrate species distribution, land cover and climate change predictions in the assessment of environmental change. The results, together with previous work on other invertebrate species, indicate that changing summer temperatures may have a considerable influence on the distribution British invertebrate species.";"Eyre, M.

Environmental variables included land cover within lake watersheds, and within-lake, water and sediment characteristics. CCA indicated that sediment fraction smaller than 63μm (f<63), open water area, turbidity, and percent woodland and agricultural cover in watersheds were significant environmental variables explaining 36.6% of variation in macrophyte cover. When Province was added to the analysis as a spatial covariate, these environmental variables explained 30.8% of the variation in macrophyte cover. CCA also indicated that pH, f<63, percent woodland cover in watersheds, open water area, emergent vegetation area, and organic matter content were significant environmental variables explaining 43.5% of the variation in macrophyte biomass. When Province was added to the analysis as a spatial covariate, these environmental variables explained 39.1% of the variation in macrophyte biomass. The f<63 was the most important environmental variable explaining variation for both measures of macrophyte abundance (cover and biomass) when Province was added as a spatial covariate to the models. Percent woodland in watersheds, turbidity, open water area, and Ca+Mg explained 34.5% of the variation in macrophyte community composition. Most species showed a negative relationship with turbidity and open water area except for Potamogeton richardsonii, Stuckenia pectinata, and filamentous algae. Our study further demonstrates the extent to which macrophyte abundance and community composition are related to site- and watershed-scale variables including lake morphology, water and sediment characteristics, and percent land cover of adjacent uplands.";"Kissoon, La Toya T.

"AGRIS:US201400128763";"Sustainable vegetable cultivation in Vietnam - prospects and constraints";"";"Vegetable production has an increasing importance in most of the Asian countries. The leader in production per capita is China followed by South Korea, North Korea and Vietnam. In Vietnam, vegetable production is at the moment on 4th place of all agricultural commodities. In the past, in Vietnam as in other South-East-Asian countries, the production of rice, sugar cane, cassava and maize often as monoculture was typical. The cropping pattern in Vietnam started to change into a multi-culture system in regions where also vegetables are cultivated – a welcome benefit for sustainability of the land use system. The cultivation area of all field crops increased from 2005 to 2009 with 5.4% while vegetable cultivation area increased with 30%, respectively. In the Red River Delta in North Vietnam the area for vegetable cultivation increased from 71 ha in 1990 to 219 ha in 2009, i.e., with 308% and the vegetable production with 373%. There are high potentials for further increasing vegetable production because of the increasing market demands caused by higher incomes, increasing number of tourists and possibilities for export. ‘Land Suitability Analysis and Evaluation’ in order to find out the appropriate land for the different horticultural crops is highly recommended to establish sustainable cultivation systems. In general, land suitability analysis considers the influences of physical, social, economic, infrastructure and environmental issues for horticultural crops. Following the result of the land analysis and evaluation it is also possible to identify limitations and input requirements for the sustainable production. This analysis has to be applied frequently, in particular in urban and periurban regions, where the vegetable area decreased, e.g., in the Red River Delta with 52% to 65 but also in rural areas where vegetable cultivation increased with 53%. Beside the potentials there are still constraints for sustainable vegetable cultivation. More effort is necessary in order to improve and stabilize the soil fertility, to introduce integrated cropping methods by appropriate use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides and to avoid their misuse. The latter seems to be very important because the cultivation area of all crops in Vietnam increased from 2000 to 2009 with 10.32% while chemical fertilizer use increased with 31.71%. In this regard reuse of bio-wastes preferable as compost for organic fertilization should be developed and improved. Also the very small farm size with 0.3-0.4 ha and 1.3 ha often with high fragmentation of less than 500 m2 is disturbing for sustainable vegetable cultivation. These small field plots cause difficulties for intensive farming such as irrigation, field care and organization of sustainable cropping patterns.";"Bohme, M.H.";"";"International Society for Horticultural Science";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land use;land suitability;rural areas";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"VNM;KOR;CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400128763";"http://www.actahort.org/";"";"";"";"21-31"

Drawing production data from household survey conducted in the highlands of Ethiopia, we estimate a stochastic production function to evaluate the effects of variety richness, land degradation, and their interaction on the mean and the variance of wheat yield. Ethiopia is a centre of diversity for durum wheat and farmers manage complex variety mixtures on multiple plots. Econometric evidence shows that variety richness increases farm productivity. Variety richness also reduces yield variability but only for high levels of genetic diversity. Simulations with estimated parameters illustrate how planting more diverse durum wheat varieties on multiple plots contributes to improving farmer’s welfare.";"Di Falco, Salvatore

The steep slope farming considers very little environmental suitability and sustainability. This study was conducted in 2004, covering a total area of 87,223 ha. Soil samples were analyzed for soil texture, pH, C, N, P, K, CEC, exchangeable cations, and base saturation. Soil characteristics data were used for land suitability evaluation for vegetables crops using the Automated Land Evaluation System (ALES) program. The results showed that 36,992 ha (42.4%) of the area is located in the elevation of 400-700 m a.s.l. and about 46,786 ha (53.6%) with elevation >700 m a.s.l. The district is dominated by volcanic parent materials (83.31%), deriving Andisols with shallow (<50 cm) to medium (50-100 cm) soil depth, high phosphate retention and little to many rock fragments. Landform is mainly hilly to mountainous with slopes >15% covering 40,600 ha (46.55%) area. The district’s annual rainfall ranges from 2,375-3,054 mm with 7-9 wet months (rainfall >200 mm) and <3 dry months (rainfall <100 mm). Land suitability analysis indicated that <15% of the total area is very suitable (S1) for vegetables. The majority of the land is moderately suitable (S2) and marginally suitable (S3) for asparagus, garlic, green beans, chili, long beans, potatoes, cabbage and tomatoes, with limiting factors of steep slope, coarse to stony texture, high nutrient retention and low water availability. Other limiting factors include high rainfall, weak aggregates of the Andisols, and steep slopes, causing a high erosion hazard, unless proper soil conservation measures are implemented. Selection and implementation of locally adaptable conservation techniques and P nutrient management are important for sustainable vegetable farming in this area.";"Mulyani, A.

"AGRIS:US2016209536";"Highway Franchising and Real Estate Values";"";"It has become increasingly common to allocate highway franchises to the bidder that offers to charge the lowest toll. Often, building a highway increases the value of land held by a small group of developers, an effect that is more pronounced with lower tolls. We study the welfare implications of highway franchises that benefit large developers, focusing on the incentives developers have to internalize the effect of the toll they bid on the value of their land. We study how participation by developers in the auction affects equilibrium tolls and welfare. We find that large developers bid more aggressively than construction companies that own no land. As long as land ownership is sufficiently concentrated, allowing developers in the auction leads to lower tolls and higher welfare. Moreover, collusion among developers is socially desirable. We also analyze the case when the franchise holder can charge lower tolls to those buying her land (toll discrimination). Relative to uniform tolls, discrimination decreases welfare when land is highly concentrated, but increases welfare otherwise. Finally, we consider the welfare implications of subsidies and bonuses for proposing new highway projects.";"Engel, Eduardo M.R.A.

Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) are very significant tools in achieving this goal. In the near future the Sanliurfa - Suruc Plain can be more valuable for the people of the region in terms of both crop variety and economical perspective once the irrigation is started and more than one crop each year is harvested. Pistachio is one of the chief productions among others that are well adapted to the conditions of the region. Also the fact that pistachio can be grown economically in the unsuitable areas for cultivated agriculture further enhances its significance for the region. In this study, current pistachio growing areas and also the potentially suitable lands to grow pistachio in the Sanliurfa-Suruc Plain were determined using a satellite image obtained in 2004 and the model developed by Sahin (2007), respectively. The model performs geographical analysis incorporating soil, topography and climate information in order to determine land suitability for particular crops under certain conditions. Overall the results showed that pistachio growing areas in 2004 was around 17,254 ha, whereas the potential fields were as much as 30,785 ha according to the model results suggesting that planted areas for pistachio can be doubled. It seems that shallow and stony areas may even be better suited for pistachio compared to currently pistachio growing areas of the plain.";"Sahin, Y.

The aim of this study was to investigate how basic soil properties respond to different management systems. For this purpose we sampled rangeland management systems under communal (continuous grazing), commercial (rotational grazing) and land reform (mixture of grazing systems) farming. Within each of these systems a grazing gradient was identified with decreasing grazing pressure with increasing distance to the water points. Results showed that communal farms with continuous grazing were generally depleted in the respective nutrient stocks. The depletion increased with rising grazing pressure. Along that line there was a breakdown of macroaggregates with losses of the C and N stored therein. However, the commercial farms also exhibited a decline of macroaggregates and their associated C content nearby the water points. Aggregate fractionation is a sensitive indicator for detecting the beginning of soil degradation in this biome; yet, degradation was less pronounced under the rotational grazing of the commercial farms than under communal property right conditions. Hence, soil analyses confirm that fences and appropriate grazing periods are needed to manage these rangelands sustainably.";"Kotzé, E.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes of soil fertility quality between the 1980s and 2000s in different cropping systems and its significance to crop productivity and sustainability. METHODS: We collected all published data on crop yields and soil parameters from 58 long-term experiments in three typical double-cropping systems in China, including maize-wheat (M-W), rice-rice (R-R) and rice-wheat (R-W) cropping systems, and selected seven fertilizer treatments in each experiment, including inorganic fertilizer [nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP), nitrogen and potassium fertilizer (NK), phosphorus and potassium fertilizer (PK) and balanced mineral fertilizer (NPK)], combined NPK with farmyard manure (NPKM) or crop straw (NPKS), and no fertilizer application (served as control). For comparison, an integrated fertility quality index (IFQI) was used to estimate the variations in soil fertility in different cropping systems. Moreover, the mean production variability index (PVI, %) in each cropping system was calculated to evaluate the stability of crop production. RESULTS: Over cropping systems, the averaged relative yields of PK, NK and NP ranged from 38.0 to 97.4� %, while the mean yields can be increased by 2.4–5.1� % in NPKM, compared to NPK. The mean yields were similar between NPK and NPKS for maize and wheat crops, but the yield was increased by 4.3–10.0� % in NPKS. Among the different treatments, the highest variability of cereal productivity was obtained in NK, PK or Control, while the lowest value was mostly recorded in NPKM or NPKS in these three cropping systems. Relative to the control, the IFQIs in fertilization treatments were increased by 9.4–150.0� %, 6.2–41.5� % and 1.3–17.5� % in M-W, R-W and R-R systems, respectively (except for PK treatment in R-R system). However, changes of IFQI in topsoil differed among fertilizer treatments, and greater increases existed in the treatments receiving organic residues (NPKM and NPKS). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in crop yield is exponentially correlated with the increased IFQI over treatments in three cropping systems. Over the treatments and systems, production variability among years is shown to be negatively, linearly related to IFQI (P < 0.001). Therefore, the high grain yield and low production variability can be simultaneously achieved by increasing soil fertility in all three cropping systems.";"Shang, Qingyin

A külföldiek földvásárlási tilalmának megszüntetését nemcsak az EU szabad áru,- személy- és tőkeforgalomra vonatkozó irányelvei és jogszabályai követelik meg, hanem a kapitalizmus szabad áruforgalomra, vagyontárgyak és szolgáltatások forgalmára vonatkozó piaci törvényei is.

These include in the first place that the domestic market should be liberalised as soon as possible by lifting restrictions on land acquisition and ownership to strengthen agricultural development. Lifting the prohibition of land acquisition by foreigners is a requirement arising not only from the directives and regulations of the EU concerning the free movement of goods, persons and capital but also from the rules of the market economy relating to the free movement of goods, property and services. The majority of the new Member States have already considerably released or completely abolished the restrictions on the free trade in land. Nevertheless, the Hungarian government intends to request the EU to renew the seven-year moratorium on the free market of land for another three years. Moreover, the national land regulation to be enacted will probably impose heavy restrictions on the free trade in land after the moratorium is lifted.The state should rightly use the public land fund – or at least part of it – for the alleviation of poverty.";"Burgerne Gimes, Anna";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016200310";"http://purl.umn.edu/99178";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400106088";"Effects of Land-Use Change on Soil Organic Carbon and Nitrogen";"";"Although the literature is full of references to soil degradation under forest cultivation, very little information is available on changes in soil properties following deforestation of the Hyrcanian area in northern Iran. Also, the literature provides little information on the effects of conversion from deforested cropland to grazing, a likely direction of land-use change in northern Iran. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of conversion of native forests into farmlands and/or grazing lands on soil properties and nutrients in the Hyrcanian forest. The dominant land uses are native forest, dryland farming of barley and wheat, and grazing. Three transects were established on hill slopes of the study area. Transects represented three land-use changes that occurred from 1967 to 2004 and included mature forest (Fagus orientalis and Acer velotinom) converted to dryland farming (barley and wheat) in 1970s, dryland farming converted to irrigated rice farming in mid-1980s, and dryland farming not cultured from 1986 to now. Average transects slope gradients were 23° (T₁), 15° (T₂), and 4° (T₃). Three positions (top, middle, and bottom of hill slope) were selected on each transect to represent each land-use type. Therefore, nine sites were selected to analyze land-use change effects on soil properties. Twenty-m vertical transects were established perpendicular to main transects. At each vertical transect, three surface soil samples (0–25 cm) were collected to measure soil properties.

Comparisons of mean differences among land uses revealed that soils under native forest contained 4.73% SOC and 0.474% total N, which were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than contents under grazing (1.76% SOC, 0.323% total N) or dryland faming (1.37% SOC and 0.248% total N).

The gradual roll-out of computerization of land registry systems across Andhra Pradesh’s 387 sub-registry offices (SROs) allows us to combine quarterly administrative data on credit disbursed by all commercial banks for a 11 year period (1997-2007) aggregated to the SRO level with the date of shifting registration from manual to digital. Computerization had no credit effect in rural areas but led to increased credit-supply in urban ones. A marked increase of registered urban mortgages due to computerization supports the robustness of the result. At the same time, estimated impacts from reduction of stamp duty are much larger, suggesting that, without further changes in the property rights system, impacts of computerization will remain marginal.";"Deininger, Klaus W.

NATURAL EVOLUTION: DETERMINATS OF HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTIAL LOCATION CHOICE AND SUBURBANIZATION";"";"Using a unique dataset on the characteristics, origin, and destination of households who engaged in intrametropolitan moves in the Columbus, Ohio area, we estimate a hybrid conditional logit choice model of residential location that separately identifies the push/pull influence of local public goods, namely school quality and public safety, from household income and other lifecycle effects.  Our results provide evidence of both a ""natural evolution"" of households, due to income and household structural changes, as well as a ""flight from blight"", due to higher crime rates, lower school quality, and lower quality of housing stock in the central city.  In comparing the magnitudes of these variables, we find that the influence of public school quality is consistently larger than the influence of household income across all locations and particularly in the central city.  Rather than being largely a result of the ""natural evolution"" of households as incomes grow over time, our results provide evidence that the central city's inferior public goods, most notably school quality, have played a much more dominant role in pushing households to suburban locations.  This finding has important implications for central city, suburban, and exurban communities that seek to counteract the movement of population to the outer suburbs and beyond.";"Bayoh, Isaac

"AGRIS:US201500041861";"Visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy as a predictive indicator of soil properties";"";"It is becoming increasingly important to improve spatial resolutions of soil maps as a fundamental information layer for studying ecological processes and to tackle land degradation. There is growing interest in the use of remote sensing technologies to assist the identification and delineation of spatial variation in soils. This paper investigates whether selected properties of extensively weathered, low fertility soils can be predicted using high-resolution reflectance spectra over the range 400–2500nm. Clay content, carbonate concentration, organic carbon content and iron oxide content were analysed for 300 soil samples collected from the Jamestown, Belalie district, South Australia. The paper also examines the efficacy of this soil analysis methodology to supplement or replace traditional soil sampling in soil survey to increase sampling density and improve the spatial resolution of soil maps. Reflectance spectra were obtained from air-dried samples under controlled laboratory conditions using an ASD FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer. Partial least squares regression was used to examine relationships between soil mineralogy, clay content and organic carbon and the reflectance spectra and identify the wavelengths contributing to prediction of these soil properties. Results show that it is possible to predict clay content, soil organic carbon, iron oxide content and carbonate content. Cross-validation R² values for all analyses were above 0.5 and the residual prediction difference (RPD) was acceptable for all soil properties. Carbonate and clay content were more accurately predicted than iron oxide and organic carbon. All samples were collected from the same geographical area such that they represented physical properties over a naturally occurring range and provide a prediction that could be related to subsequent image analysis or be used to carry out local scale soil survey. A rapid and reliable form of soil mapping could be developed from this methodology.";"Summers, D.

Such ecological regionalisations reflect spatial combinations of biotic and abiotic characteristics and therefore may serve for environmental planning and monitoring issues. Referring to two case studies the paper presents how to calculate and map ecological defined regions from geodata by use of decision tree models and GIS-techniques. The first study deals with marine environments, exemplified by benthic habitats in the North Sea. The second study is on an ecological land classification of Europe which was computed using surface data on potential natural vegetation, elevation, soil texture and several climatic elements. Both the marine and the terrestrial ecoregions maps were combined with exposure data provided by environmental monitoring activities. The ecological land classification of Europe was intersected with measurement data on the metal loads in mosses taken from the German part of UN ECE moss surveys. In this way, the temporal development of the metal bioaccumulation within ecoregions since 1990 was assessed. The benthic habitat map was used to regionalise the temporal trend of the temperature conditions near the sea floor for the months of July and January from 1995 to 2000 by analysing these measurements according to the spatial categories of the habitat map. In the future, both ecological regionalisations should be used as a spatial framework for the analysis of up-to-date meteorological and phenological data in order to disclose climate change induced impacts.";"Pesch, Roland

These worksheets are used by NRCS as part of the criteria for creating a conservation plan to qualify landowners for payments under the USDA Farm Bill Conservation Title. Presently, most worksheets are filled out by hand or in personal computer spreadsheets. If worksheets such as these were available over the web, landowners could also self-assess the conditions on their farms or ranches before requiring assistance of NRCS conservation planners or technical service providers. Because many conservation worksheets have a similar style and behavior, we created an automated web-script generator that produces a dynamic web-page worksheet from a common template file and a configuration file. A worksheet-specific configuration file provides the details for the worksheet. The template, configuration files, and web scripts are all in PHP (PHP hypertext processor). Each configuration file required approximately 5 h to program, a savings of more than 4 d compared with a web-based worksheet programmed individually with a scripting language. In this way, various conservation worksheets can be quickly created for the web, as well as be easily maintained. As an example, we produced a suite of assessment worksheets used by Oregon NRCS with our automated web-form conservation worksheet system. Those worksheets are accessible at: http://yukon.een.orst.edu/ms_apps/wq_indexes/forms/index_menu.html (verified 5 May 2006).";"Steiner, J.J.

Overall, there are fewer statistically significant relationships in the referenda results estimation than in the selection estimation.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish current distributions and community arrangements of small mammals to provide important baselines for monitoring and conserving biodiversity into the future. METHODS: We used 4,408 archived museum and open-access records and the machine learning algorithm, RandomForests, to create high-resolution spatial niche models for 17 species of rodents and shrews in Alaska. Models were validated using independent trapping results from 20 locations stratified along statewide mega-transects, and an average species richness curve was calculated for field samples. Community cluster analyses (varclus) identified geographic patterns of sympatry among species. Species models were summed to create the first small-mammal species richness map for Alaska. RESULTS: Species richness increased logarithmically to a mean of 3.3 species per location over 1,500 trap-nights. Distribution models yielded mean accuracies of 71 % (45–90 %), and maps correctly predicted a mean of 75 % (60–95 %) of occurrences correctly in the field. Top predictors included Soil Type, Ecoregion, Landfire Land-cover, December Sea Ice, and July Temperature at the geographic scale. Cluster analysis delineated five community groups (3–4 species/group), and species richness was highest (11–13 species) over the Yukon-Tanana Uplands. CONCLUSIONS: Models presented here provide spatial predictions of current small mammal biodiversity in Alaska and an initial framework for mapping and monitoring wildlife distributions across broad landscapes into the future.";"Baltensperger, Andrew P.

"AGRIS:US201600130861";"Effect of Widespread Agricultural Chemical Use on Butterfly Diversity across Turkish Provinces";"";"Although agricultural intensification is thought to pose a significant threat to species, little is known about its role in driving biodiversity loss at regional scales. I assessed the effects of a major component of agricultural intensification, agricultural chemical use, and land‐cover and climatic variables on butterfly diversity across 81 provinces in Turkey, where agriculture is practiced extensively but with varying degrees of intensity. I determined butterfly species presence in each province from data on known butterfly distributions and calculated agricultural chemical use as the proportion of agricultural households that use chemical fertilizers and pesticides. I used constrained correspondence analyses and regression‐based multimodel inference to determine the effect of environmental variables on species composition and richness, respectively. The variation in butterfly species composition across the provinces was largely explained (78%) by the combination of agricultural chemical use, particularly pesticides, and climatic and land‐cover variables. Although overall butterfly richness was primarily explained by climatic and land‐cover variables, such as the area of natural vegetation cover, threatened butterfly richness and the relative number of threatened butterfly species decreased substantially as the proportion of agricultural households using pesticides increased. These findings suggest that widespread use of agricultural chemicals, or other components of agricultural intensification that may be collinear with pesticide use, pose an imminent threat to the biodiversity of Turkey. Accordingly, policies that mitigate agricultural intensification and promote low‐input farming practices are crucial for protecting threatened species from extinction in rapidly industrializing nations such as Turkey.

Lowering of the acceptable daily concentration of particulate matter from 65 to 35 μg/m3 will bring much closer scrutiny of prescribed burning practices from the air quality community. To work within this narrow window, land managers need simple tools to allow them to estimate their potential emissions and examine trade-offs between continued use of prescribed fire and other means of fuels management. A critical part of the emissions estimation process is determining the amount of fuel consumed during the burn. This study combines results from a number of studies along the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina to arrive at a simple means of estimating total fuel consumption on prescribed fires. The result is a simple linear relationship that determines the total fuel consumed as a function of the product of the preburn fuel load and the burning index of the National Fire Danger Rating System.";"Goodrick, Scott L.

This paper presents a land classification in zones featured by different criticality levels of atmospheric pollution, considering pollutant time series as functional data: we call this proposal “Functional Zoning”. Our proposal is articulated in order to also meet two specific requirements: upscaling pollutant concentration data to the municipality scale, since municipalities are the reference territorial administrative units for undertaking actions; aggregating different pollutants in order to provide a multi-pollutant zoning outcome reflecting the air quality status. Specifically, we present three different alternatives to upscale data from a regular grid to the municipality scale. Then, to aggregate by pollutant, we evaluate two strategies summarizing time series: the assessment of an air quality index and the use of the Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA). The partition of municipalities is obtained by clustering air quality time series and MFPCA scores. In particular, the proposed functional zoning is carried out for Piemonte (Northern Italy), considering the hourly concentration fields of the main pollutants. We obtain six classifications of the same land and we propose a comparison study of the different strategies’ results, by mapping and analyzing the differences between clusters’ labels. By taking into account the comparison study’s findings, we finally suggest an analysis strategy to environmental agencies and policy makers to obtain an easily interpretable outcome at a very reasonable computational cost.";"Ignaccolo, Rosaria

We monitored sites along two agricultural hillslopes to assess the effects of field management and hydrology on P transfers in surface runoff at different landscape positions. Surface runoff varied by landscape position, with saturation excess runoff accounting for 19 times the volume of infiltration excess runoff at the north footslope position, but infiltration excess runoff dominated at upslope landscape positions. Runoff differed significantly between south and north footslopes, coinciding with the extent of upslope soil underlain by a fragipan. Phosphorus in runoff was predominantly in dissolved reactive form (70%), with the highest concentrations associated with upper landscape positions closest to fields serving as major sources of P. However, the largest loads of P were from the north footslope, where runoff volumes were 24 times larger than from all other sites combined. Loads of P from the north footslope appeared to be primarily chronic transfers of desorbed soil P. Although runoff from the footslope likely contributed directly to stream flow and hence to stream water quality, 27% of runoff P from the upslope sites did not connect directly with stream flow.

For example, in July 2001, Washington State adopted new forest practice rules for private ownerships, which were aimed primarily at improving habitat for aquatic and riparian species. Before adopting the new rules, an environmental impact assessment was conducted in which three alternatives were considered in detail for their contributions to riparian habitat. Implications for upland species were not considered, although riparian protection has the potential to make contributions to habitat for obligate late-seral species. Effects of the three management alternatives were projected on private lands 200 years into the future, holding constant current practices on other lands managed for timber (federal, tribal, and state). The resulting distribution of late-seral forest across the Western Olympic Peninsula was compared. Simulations predicted that late-seral forest would cover between 39 and 48% of the landscape, well above the 8% that it currently occupies. Five to 21% of this late-seral forest would be on private lands (compared to <1% currently), and 71-85% on public lands (compared to 91% currently). Landscape pattern analysis indicated that the total amount of late-seral forest was significantly different among the three scenarios. However, there was no discernible difference in interior forest area, edge density, and mean distance between patches between a “no-action” alternative and the alternative that was ultimately adopted into rule. The most protective alternative had significantly more interior forest area and greater mean distance between patches, but it also had significantly higher edge density as a result of the linear nature of the riparian reserves and small patches of steep, unstable slopes. Our analysis framework will be useful for evaluating the effects of alternative management scenarios on landscape pattern across broad geographic areas with complex ownership.";"Tyler, M.W.

Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300m resolution) and CORINE (100m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.";"Brown, Greg

Recent developments in spatial information technologies enabled cost and energy saving in crop yield prediction. The aim of this paper was to predict yield of the three major crops and yield loss under soil salinity effect which is one of the most important limitation in many Mediterranean countries. Crop yields were estimated using vegetation indices and Stepwise Linear Regression (SLR) derived from Landsat (Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper) TM/ETM satellite images. Additionally, related crop pattern of the area was mapped using multi-temporal Landsat data set using object based classification. Soil salinity was mapped using radial basis function and field measurements with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) accuracy of 0.96dSmâ1. The predictions were validated using real-time field measurements. Mean percent error (MPE) for wheat, corn and cotton were 7.9%, 8.8% and 6.3% respectively. Crop yield estimates were incorporated with various degrees of soil salinity. Soil salinity ranging between 8 and 10dSmâ1 resulted yield loss of 55%, 28%, and 15% in corn, wheat and cotton respectively. The highest soil salinity resistance was observed only at cotton in 18dSmâ1 with 55% yield loss.";"Satir, Onur

However, the existing literature fails to support convergent validity of benefit transfer using the stated-preference method. This empirical study examines the convergent validity of benefit transfer using the choice modeling method, a potentially promising technique compatible with the heterogeneity of the transfer contexts. Based on a survey designed for Rhode Island (RI) and modified only slightly for Massachusetts (MA), regarding coastal land management, four convergent validity tests were conducted on the benefit transfer from RI to MA. Although results fail to support convergent validity in all aspects, the empirical tests show benefit transfer using the choice modeling method maybe acceptable, and even empirically reliable depending on the policy objectives and the context.";"Jiang, Yong

"AGRIS:US201600102984";"Hierarchical Community Occurrence Model for North Carolina Stream Fish";"";"The southeastern USA is home to one of the richest—and most imperiled and threatened—freshwater fish assemblages in North America. For many of these rare and threatened species, conservation efforts are often limited by a lack of data. Drawing on a unique and extensive data set spanning over 20 years, we modeled occurrence probabilities of 126 stream fish species sampled throughout North Carolina, many of which occur more broadly in the southeastern USA. Specifically, we developed species-specific occurrence probabilities from hierarchical Bayesian multispecies models that were based on common land use and land cover covariates. We also used index of biotic integrity tolerance classifications as a second level in the model hierarchy; we identify this level as informative for our work, but it is flexible for future model applications. Based on the partial-pooling property of the models, we were able to generate occurrence probabilities for many imperiled and data-poor species in addition to highlighting a considerable amount of occurrence heterogeneity that supports species-specific investigations whenever possible. Our results provide critical species-level information on many threatened and imperiled species as well as information that may assist with re-evaluation of existing management strategies, such as the use of surrogate species. Finally, we highlight the use of a relatively simple hierarchical model that can easily be generalized for similar situations in which conventional models fail to provide reliable estimates for data-poor groups.

The present study investigates the urban growth of Tiruchirapalli city, Tamilnadu using IRS satellite data for the years 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010. The eight satellite images are enhanced using convolution spatial enhancement method with Kernel (7 × 7) edge enhance function. Supervised classification method is used to classify the urban land use and land cover. The GIS is used to prepare the different layers belonging to various land uses identified from remotely sensed data.

"AGRIS:US201500205171";"Modelling snow water equivalent and spring runoff in a boreal watershed, James Bay, Canada";"";"The hydrology of boreal regions is strongly influenced by seasonal snow accumulation and melt. In this study, we compare simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) and streamflow by using the hydrological model HYDROTEL with two contrasting approaches for snow modelling: a mixed degree‐day/energy balance model (small number of inputs, but several calibration parameters needed) and the thermodynamic model CROCUS (large number of inputs, but no calibration parameter needed). The study site, in Northern Quebec, Canada was equipped with a ground‐based gamma ray sensor measuring the SWE continuously for 5 years in a small forest clearing. The first simulation of CROCUS showed a tendency to underestimate SWE, attributable to bias in the meteorological inputs. We found that it was appropriate to use a threshold of 2 °C to separate rain and snow. We also applied a correction to account for snowfall undercatch by the precipitation gauge. After these modifications to the input dataset, we noticed that CROCUS clearly overestimated the SWE, likely as a result of not including loss in SWE because of blowing snow sublimation and relocation. To correct this, we included into CROCUS a simple parameterisation effective after a certain wind speed threshold, after which the thermodynamic model performed much better than the traditional mixed degree‐day/energy balance model. HYDROTEL was then used to simulate streamflow with both snow models. With CROCUS, the main peak flow could be captured, but the second peak because of delayed snowmelt from forested areas could not be reproduced due to a lack of sub‐canopy radiation data to feed CROCUS. Despite the relative homogeneity of the boreal landscape, data inputs from each land cover type are needed to generate satisfying simulation of the spring runoff.

Trends in gully and river channel erosion, and their relation to triggering environmental changes can proffer valuable insights into sustainable development in Northern Ethiopia. In order to assess the region-wide change in gully and river channel morphology over 140years, a set of 57 historical photographs taken in Tigray, and, clearly displaying gully cross-sections, were precisely repeated from 2006 till 2009. Ninety-two percent of the gully and river sections (n=38) increased in cross-sectional area during the studied period, especially after 1975. Two repeatedly photographed catchments of Lake Ashenge and Atsela allowed a detailed study of gully development from 1936 until 2009. A conceptual hydrogeomorphic model was devised for these catchments and validated for the Northern Ethiopian Highlands. Three major phases can be distinguished in the hydrological regime of the catchments. In the first phase, between 1868 (or earlier) and ca. 1965, the relatively stable channels showed an oversized morphology inherited from a previous period when external forcing in environmental conditions had caused the channels to shape. In the second phase (ca. 1965 – ca. 2000), increased aridity and continued vegetation clearance accelerated the channel dynamics of the gully and river system. The third phase (ca. 2000 – present) started after the large-scale implementation of soil and water conservation measures. In 2009, 23% of the gully and river sections were stabilizing. This paper validates previous research indicating severe land degradation in the second half of the 20th century. Additionally, it demonstrates that the recent erosive cycle started around 1965 and, that at the present time, improved land management stabilizes headwater streams.";"Frankl, Amaury

Models predict a threshold response in dispersal success with increasing habitat fragmentation. A threshold is defined as an abrupt, disproportionate decline in dispersal success at a certain proportion of habitat in the landscape. To identify potential empirical threshold responses in invasion success to landscape structure, we quantified the relationship between progression of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) invasion wavefront across Michigan (1985-1996) and the structure of the Michigan landscape using two indices of invasion success and six landscape metrics. We also examined the effect of scale of analysis and choice of land cover characterization on our results by repeating our analysis at three scales using two different land cover maps. Contrary to simulation model predictions, thresholds in invasion success did not correspond closely with thresholds in landscape structure metrics. Increased variation in invasion success indices at smaller scales of analysis also suggested that invasion success should be studied at larger spatial extents (>=75 km²) than would be appropriate for characterizing individual dispersal events. The predictions of individual dispersal models across neutral landscapes may have limited applications for the monitoring and management of vagile species with excellent dispersal capabilities such as the gypsy moth.";"Nesslage, Geneviève M.

"AGRIS:US201400018460";"No longer tracking greenery in high altitudes: Pastoral practices of Rupshu nomads and their implications for biodiversity conservation";"";"Nomadic pastoralism has thrived in Asia’s rangelands for several millennia by tracking seasonal changes in forage productivity and coping with a harsh climate. This pastoralist lifestyle, however, has come under intense transformations in recent decades due to socio-political and land use changes. One example is of the high-altitude trans-Himalayan rangelands of the Jammu and Kashmir State in northern India: major socio-political reorganisation over the last five decades has significantly impacted the traditional pasture use pattern and resources. We outline the organizational transformations and movement patterns of the Rupshu pastoralists who inhabit the region. We demonstrate the changes in terms of intensification of pasture use across the region as well as a social reorganisation due to accommodation of Tibetan refugees following the Sino-Indian war in 1961 to 1962. We focus in particular on the Tso Kar basin - an important socio-ecological system of livestock herding and biodiversity in the eastern Ladakh region. The post-war developmental policies of the government have contributed to these modifications in traditional pasture use and present a threat to the rangelands as well as to the local biodiversity. In the Tso Kar basin, the number of households and livestock has almost doubled while pasture area has declined by half. These changes have potentially negative consequences for the long-term resilience of nomadic pastoralism as well as for the survival of rare local wildlife. To increase the pastoralist standard of living, having fewer pastoralists may be the only solution, and alternative livelihood options may bring this about. Development programmes should concentrate on enhancing opportunities for herders so that there is a greater diversity of employment opportunities and potentially better chances for the persistence of biodiversity.";"Singh, Navinder J

The thematic information considered by the LCCS, however, is intrinsically related to vegetation physiognomy and does not report important eco-climatic features. Our aim is to develop a methodology to enrich LCCS maps with information on vegetation productivity and phenology derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The LCCS has recently been applied in East Africa by the Africover project. The proposed methodology is developed and tested in Tanzania using MODIS NDVI data for a 5-year period (2001-05). Annual NDVI profiles of Africover polygons were extracted from MODIS imagery. These profiles, composed of 23 NDVI values per year, were averaged over the study period, purified for possible land-cover errors and converted into a more manageable format composed of 24 half-month values. The resulting NDVI profiles were first analysed visually and then evaluated statistically against rainfall measurements taken at 12 Tanzanian stations. The steps involved were as follows: NDVI values were aggregated on a monthly basis and represented with a one-digit integer to obtain an extended code; a subset of parameters describing vegetation development and phenology was identified, thus obtaining a restricted codification; and finally, the information loss resulting from both the extended and restricted codification was evaluated with respect to the original NDVI profiles. NDVI profiles of different Africover classes can differ in mean values but tend to have a similar shape, linked to the seasonality of local vegetation. Both NDVI annual averages and seasonal variations are strictly dependent on rainfall patterns, particularly in arid zones. The tested codifications effectively summarize the eco-climatic information contained in the polygon NDVI profiles, with the extended and restricted codifications retaining > 90% and 80% of such information, respectively. The proposed methodology is capable of enriching LCCS polygons with eco-climatic information derived from MODIS NDVI data. Such information is related to vegetation development and seasonality, and can be efficiently condensed at various levels of detail.";"Maselli, Fabio

Their conservation value, however, is threatened throughout Europe by peat extraction and particularly conifer afforestation, which can compromise the physico-chemical habitat quality of peatland lakes through excessive inputs of forestry-derived dissolved and particulate substances. To quantify the effect of conifer plantation forestry on the conservation value of these habitats, we compared the hydrochemistry and assemblages of aquatic Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Odonata of replicate lakes across three distinct catchment land uses: (i) unplanted blanket bog only present in the catchment, (ii) mature conifer plantation forests only present in the catchment and (iii) catchments containing mature conifer plantation forests with recently clearfelled areas. All three catchment land uses were replicated across regions of sedimentary and igneous geology. Lakes with afforested catchments, in both geologies, had elevated concentrations of plant nutrients, total dissolved organic carbon and heavy metals, the highest concentrations being recorded from the clearfell lakes. Coleoptera and Heteroptera assemblages responded strongly to forestry-mediated changes in water chemistry, whereas Odonata assemblages responded more to catchment geology – geology being confounded by altitudinal differences between lakes. The greatest species-quality scores (SQSs) and species richness were recorded from the clearfell lakes. Three of the four International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) nationally red-listed species recorded during this study were, however, absent from clearfell lakes. Our findings demonstrate that plantation forestry can have a profound impact on the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and conservation value of small blanket bog lakes, primarily via eutrophication. Despite indices such as SQS scores and species richness appearing to reveal a beneficial response of blanket bog lake communities to habitat deterioration, they mask that certain ‘emblematic’ species are being severely negatively impacted by the disturbance caused by plantation forestry. Considering the need for fertiliser to produce economically viable plantation forest crops, coupled with the inefficiencies of peat soils in retaining applied nutrients, the degradation of peatland lakes is likely to become more prevalent as plantation forestry continues to expand worldwide.";"Drinan, T.J.

Collaboration between stakeholders at the landscape level is suggested as the most efficient ‘model’ for the management of many wildlife species such as deer. However, there has been limited research to evaluate the effectiveness of collaborative management for deer or how it is perceived by individual landowners. Here, we take an integrative quantitative and qualitative approach to evaluate the relative importance of different ecological and social drivers for management in determining the impacts of deer on woodland sites managed for conservation objectives in the East of England, UK. Our results suggest that the ecological impacts of deer are widely recognised amongst landowners, with many management decisions based on observations of site ecology. Furthermore, current financial incentives serve as an important motivation for land owners to actively manage deer. We found no evidence that deer management focused at the level of individual sites is effective for achieving ecological management objectives. In contrast, collaborative management with neighbouring land owners can help to reduce conservation impacts, especially in relation to the larger deer species. The study highlights the importance of landscape-scale collaborative management in delivering conservation objectives. It also demonstrates the importance of understanding social factors, alongside ecological ones, in designing effective conservation management strategies.";"Austin, Zoë

There was a good agreement between the simulated and observed values of CH₄ and N₂O emissions. The difference between observed and simulated CH₄ emissions in all sites ranged from −11.6 to 62.5 kg C ha⁻¹ season⁻¹. Most discrepancies between simulated and observed seasonal fluxes were less than 20% of the field estimate of the seasonal flux. The relative deviation between observed and simulated cumulative N₂O emissions ranged from −237.8 to 28.6%. However, some discrepancies existed between observed and simulated seasonal patterns of CH₄ and N₂O emissions. The model simulated zero N₂O emissions from continuously flooded rice fields and poorly simulated CH₄ emissions from Allahabad site. For all other simulated cases, the model satisfactorily simulated the seasonal variations in greenhouse gas emission from paddy fields with different land management. The model also simulated the C and N balances in all the sites, including other gas fluxes, viz. CO₂, NO, NO₂, N₂ and NH₃ emissions. Sensitivity tests for CH₄ indicate that soil texture and pH significantly influenced the CH₄ emission. Changes in organic C content had a moderate influence on CH₄ emission on these sites. Introducing the mid-season drainage reduced CH₄ emissions significantly. Process-based biogeochemical modeling, as with DNDC, can help in identifying strategies for optimizing resource use, increasing productivity, closing yield gaps and reducing adverse environmental impacts.";"Babu, Y.

"AGRIS:US201600089809";"Stewardship of Natural Resources: Definition, Ethical and Practical Aspects";"";"Stewardship is potentially a usefulconcept in modernizing management philosophies. Use ofthe term has increased markedly in recent years, yetthe term is used loosely and rarely defined in landmanagement literature. The connections between thispractical usage and the ethical basis of stewardshipare currently poorly developed. The followingdefinition is proposed: ``Stewardship is theresponsible use (including conservation) of naturalresources in a way that takes full and balancedaccount of the interests of society, futuregenerations, and other species, as well as of privateneeds, and accepts significant answerability tosociety.'' A religious interpretation would require thephrase ``and ultimately to God'' to be added.Stewardship has both secular and religiousinterpretations and it will be desirable to developboth of these aspects in parallel. A task forphilosophers is to establish whether the ethical basisof stewardship is sufficient to address environmentalconcerns or whether it is necessary to embrace widerethical approaches. Stewardship occupies similarground to several other concepts of use and managementof resources, particularly sustainability. It canbuild on sustainability by encouraging a broader viewof who and what should benefit from managementactivity. In particular, it focuses attention on therole of managers in providing public benefit and onenvisaging other species as a form of ``stakeholder'' inmanagement decisions. Stewardship is applicable acrossthe widest range of fields of resource use and alsohas relevance to aspects of land tenure and propertyrights. Application of stewardship will require someadjustments in the roles of private managers/ownersvis-à-vis government. It might providemanagers with an expanded role and, importantly, amore positive image, both of themselves and in theeyes of the public. Stewardship could alsobe developed in a way that has relevance to citizensin general (as opposed to managers and owners ofresources), through their interactions with naturalresources as consumers.";"Worrell, Richard

Studies of the purported desertification effects associated with shrub encroachment are often restricted to relatively few study areas, and document a narrow range of possible impacts upon biota and ecosystem processes. We conducted a study in degraded Mediterranean grasslands dominated by Stipa tenacissima to simultaneously evaluate the effects of shrub encroachment on the structure and composition of multiple biotic community components, and on various indicators of ecosystem function. Shrub encroachment enhanced vascular plant richness, biomass of fungi, actinomycetes and other bacteria, and was linked with greater soil fertility and N mineralization rates. While shrub encroachment may be a widespread phenomenon in drylands, an interpretation that this is an expression of desertification is not universal. Our results suggest that shrub establishment may be an important step in the reversal of desertification processes in the Mediterranean region.";"Maestre, Fernando T.

On the island of Mauritius, many remaining wetlands are being rapidly converted and fragmented by intense land-use demands. We surveyed 209 coastal wetlands on Mauritius to assess their biophysical attributes, land-use activities, and patterns of disturbance, to help identify factors that threaten wetland biodiversity. Most wetlands exhibited severe edge-related disturbances and more than half were fragmented. Plant species richness was highest in larger, unfragmented wetlands and lower in wetlands with degraded margins. Urban wetlands were smaller and more likely to be fragmented than those adjoining other land uses such as grazing and agriculture. Flooding of urban homes and infrastructure was more likely to occur near fragmented than natural wetlands. Ongoing wetland decline in Mauritius not only contributes to the loss of local biodiversity but reduces the larger ecosystem role these habitats play in regulating surface water and protecting adjacent marine habitats.";"Laurance, Susan G.W.

"AGRIS:US201500015649";"Pluri-energy analysis of livestock systems – A comparison of dairy systems in different territories";"";"This paper introduces a generic assessment method called pluri-energy analysis. It aims to assess the types of energy used in agricultural systems and their conversion efficiencies. Four types of energy are considered: fossil energy, gross energy contained in the biomass, energy from human and animal labor and solar energy. The method was applied to compare smallholder low-input dairy-production systems, which are common in developing countries, to the high-input systems encountered in OECD countries. The pluri-energy method is useful for analyzing the functioning of agricultural systems by highlighting their modes of energy management. Since most dairy systems in South Mali (SM) are low-input systems, they are primarily based on solar and labor energy types and do not require substantial fossil-energy inputs to produce milk. Farms in Poitou-Charentes (PC) and Bretagne (BR) show intermediate values of fossil-energy use for milk production, similar to that found in the literature for typical European systems. However, fossil-energy use for milk production is higher on PC than BR farms because of a higher proportion of maize silage in the forage area; grazing pastures are more common on BR farms. Farms on Reunion Island (RI) require a relatively large amount of fossil energy to produce milk, mainly because the island context limits the amount of arable land. Consequently, milk production is based on large imports of concentrated feed with a high fossil-energy cost. The method also enables assessment of fossil-energy-use efficiency in order to increase the performance of biological processes in agricultural systems. Comparing the low-input systems represented by SM to the high-input systems represented by RI, PC and BR, an increase in solar-energy conversion, and thus land productivity, was observed due to intensification via increased fossil-energy use. Conversely, though fossil-energy use at the herd level increased milk productivity, its effect on gross-energy conversion by the herd was less evident. Partitioning the total on-farm gross energy produced among animal co-products (milk, meat and manure) highlights the major functions of SM herds, which are managed to produce organic crop fertilizers.";"Vigne, Mathieu

"AGRIS:US201600020487";"influence of land use on forest structure, species composition, and soil conditions in headwater-slope wetlands of coastal Alabama, USA";"";"Wetlands are impacted by surrounding land use and land cover (LULC), but little information is available specifically on headwater wetlands. A total of 30 headwater wetlands were examined in coastal Alabama, USA, representing a range of surrounding LULC. Percent cover by forest, agriculture, and impervious surface area (ISA) (i.e., urban land use) were quantified in each corresponding watershed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate collinearity within land use data and produce orthogonal variables that represented gradients of forest cover, agriculture, and urban land use. Canopy tree density, diameter, species cover, importance values, and soil value/chroma were measured in each wetland. Exotic species cover was significantly related to land use change with increases in exotic shrubs associated with decreases in watershed forest cover. Field observations and analysis suggest that extensive colonization by the exotic shrub Ligustrum sinense may inhibit tree recruitment and alter wetland forest structure. Increases in shrub/sapling prevalence index (a measure of hydrophytic vegetation) and soil chroma were positively correlated to increased watershed conversion to agriculture (and concurrent loss of forest cover). Strategies for conserving the services associated with these wetlands should include minimizing surrounding forest loss and maintaining groundwater inflow.";"Barksdale, W. Flynt

THE POTENTIAL FOR COMPENSATION VIA MONETARY PAYOUTS AND GRAZING ALTERNATIVES";"";"In response to environmental pressure, public land agencies in Nevada have reduced animal unit months (AUMs) of grazing on public lands. This has resulted in economic losses to ranchers, increased conflict between ranchers and the public land agencies, and general unrest in the ranch community. One approach to resolving the problems might be to compensate ranchers for lost grazing privileges. In this study, we employ the results of the Nevada Ranch Survey to examine ranchers' willingness to accept a one-time payment to retire grazing rights, as well as three other means of ""compensating"" ranchers that enable them to earn a living from the public lands despite reduced access to public forage. The results suggest that ranchers are not keen on being compensated in any form, expressing a desire to continue ranching. However, those most amenable to compensation and a reworking of the social contract are those who have the best relationship with the public land manager and view the public agencies in a positive light";"Hobby, Thomas G.

This is particularly important given climate change and environmental deterioration as a result of rapid urbanization. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of urban sprawl on dynamics of forest carbon stock and density in Xiamen, a typical city experiencing rapid urbanization in China. Forest resource inventory data collected from 32,898 patches in 4 years (1972, 1988, 1996 and 2006), together with remotely sensed data (from 1988, 1996 and 2006), were used to investigate vegetation carbon densities and stocks in Xiamen, China. We classified the forests into four groups: (1) forest patches connected to construction land; (2) forest patches connected to farmland; (3) forest patches connected to both construction land and farmland and (4) close forest patches. Carbon stocks and densities of four different types of forest patches during different urbanization periods in three zones (urban core, suburb and exurb) were compared to assess the impact of human disturbance on forest carbon. In the urban core, the carbon stock and carbon density in all four forest patch types declined over the study period. In the suburbs, different urbanization processes influenced forest carbon density and carbon stock in all four forest patch types. Urban sprawl negatively affected the surrounding forests. In the exurbs, the carbon stock and carbon density in all four forest patch types tended to increase over the study period. The results revealed that human disturbance played the dominant role in influencing the carbon stock and density of forest patches close to the locations of human activities. In forest patches far away from the locations of human activities, natural forest regrowth was the dominant factor affecting carbon stock and density.";"Ren, Yin

The experiment was carried out in the Bohemian Forest Mts. at the altitude of 1150-1170m for 10 years. We applied three treatments (mowing, mulching - i.e., cutting and crushing of the sward into small pieces which are left at the site to decompose, abandonment - fallow) to a mountain meadow with dominant Deschampsia cespitosa, Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra and Hypericum maculatum. The aboveground biomass was significantly highest in the fallow treatment and lowest in the mown one, the belowground biomass was the lowest in the fallow treatment and the highest in the mown one. The litter accumulation was higher in the fallow treatment than in the mulched one, where, nonetheless, the mulched material persisted for more than one growing season. The treatments significantly affected the plant species diversity and shifts of dominance among certain species were observed. Decrease of the species richness was observed in the fallow plot, while slightly lowered Shannon diversity and evenness were observed in the mown plot. If regular mowing of mountain meadows is not feasible for economic or technical reasons, mulching can represent an economically advantageous alternative. It will temporarily check the successional changes that sooner or later occur in meadows left fallow.";"Mašková, Zuzana

Study was performed on Haplic Luvisol in Hněvčeves (Czech Republic). Two soil profiles, which were in close distance from each other, were chosen: under the conventional tillage, and under the 30 years ago reestablished permanent grass cover. Soil structure was analyzed using the micromorphological method. Soil hydraulic properties were measured in the laboratory using multistep outflow experiments performed on undisturbed 100-cm³ soil samples. Tension disk infiltrometers and Guelph permeameter were used to measure unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivities in the field. While soil properties studied in the deeper Bt2 and C horizons were relatively similar at both sites, properties of the A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons measured at both sites were evidently different. Lower retention ability and slightly lower unsaturated hydraulic conductivities for h ₀ =−2cm (from disk infiltrometers), K(h ₀ =−2cm), were measured at the arable land than those at grassland. This indicated that the fractions of the large capillary pores (pore radii between 20μm and 740μm) and also matrix pores (pore radii lower than 20μm) in the A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons of the soil profile under the conventional tillage were smaller than those in the horizons of the soil profile under the permanent grass. Larger and more variable saturated hydraulic conductivities, K s (from the Guelph permeameter tests) and differences between the K s and K(h ₀ =−2cm) values were obtained at arable land than at grassland. This denoted that the fractions of gravitational pores (pore radii larger than 740μm) and connectivity of large pores in the A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons of the soil profile under the conventional tillage were greater than those in the horizons of the soil profile under the permanent grass. Thus grassland soil showed well reestablished stable soil structure with favorable soil hydraulic properties not only in the A horizons, but also in the deeper Bt1 horizon.";"Kodešová, Radka

"AGRIS:US201301921190";"Ploughing a poorly drained grassland reduced N₂O emissions compared to chemical fallow";"";"Managed grasslands occupy a large portion of the agricultural landbase, are rich in C and N and therefore represent a risk for emissions of N₂O during landuse change. Two adjacent grassland plots, one amended with 100m³ ha⁻¹ of liquid swine manure annually since 1978 and an unamended grassland were either (i) left with vegetation intact (Control) or killed by glyphosate in the autumn. Glyphosate-treated subplots were either (ii) left as an undisturbed chemical fallow, (iii) ploughed by full inversion tillage (FIT) in the autumn, or (iv) in the spring. Cumulative emissions of N₂O over the measuring period (static chambers), soil solution NO₃-N (tension lysimeters) and soil NO₃-N (KCl extraction) were monitored following tillage for one fallow year. Emissions of N₂O decreased in the order: amended chemical fallow (3.0gNm⁻²), amended spring-FIT (2.0gNm⁻²), amended autumn-FIT and unamended chemical fallow (1.7gNm⁻², both), unamended spring-FIT (1.2gNm⁻²) and the unamended autumn-FIT subplots (0.9gNm⁻²) while grassland controls emitted 0.07 and 0.09gNm⁻² for the unamended and amended plots, respectively. Emissions of N₂O were positively correlated with soil solution NO₃-N at 30-cm depth in the chemical fallow, but negatively with soil solution NO₃-N at 45cm in FIT subplots. In chemical fallow soils, N₂O was likely produced as the NO₃ ⁻ mineralized at the soil surface moved down the soil profile, enriching denitrification sites at shallow depths during rainfall events. In contrast, FIT placed the C and N required for denitrification deeper in the soil profile, and complete reduction to N₂ was likely favoured. On these poorly drained grassland soils, FIT reduced emissions of N₂O relative to a chemical fallow by a factor of 2 to 3 for equivalent soil NO₃-N. Emission factors accounting for the interaction between soil characteristics - in this case drainage conditions - and management practices may be important in providing accurate N₂O emission estimates.";"MacDonald, J.

As a consequence, the soil gas and water fluxes and therefore soil functions were affected by grazing. We investigated two steppe ecosystems characterized by two plant communities: Stipa grandis (SG) and Leymus chinensis (LCh) and different grazing intensities: ungrazed since 1979 (UG79), continuously grazed (CG, at the SG site) and winter grazed (WG, at the LCh site). The undisturbed soil samples, for determination of saturated (k s) and unsaturated (k u) hydraulic conductivities and air conductivities (k a), were collected in vertical and horizontal direction from two soil horizons. The coefficients of anisotropy were calculated as ratios of the values obtained for the samples taken in horizontal direction to the values of the vertical samples. The results indicated a good recovery of soil structure at the sites ungrazed for more than 30 years. Furthermore, the recovery was more pronounced at the LCh site compared with the SG site. The results suggested that grazing causes significant changes in anisotropy of soil functions related to rearrangement of aggregates and creation of a platy soil structure. The results of the coefficients of anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity showed that they depend on the matric potential for both treatments.";"Reszkowska, Agnieszka

But the situation of grasslands was itself the outcome of the history of past ages, especially the deep changes that occurred during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The changes and the underlying responsible factors were analysed for four regions chiefly devoted to grasslands (Normandy, Charente, Limousin, Thiérache). The characteristics of each region's identity are also of interest. Lastly, the agricultural recommendations put forward for pasture seeding (choice of species, seeding rates, seed origin) are presented. Some of the mechanisms responsible for the changes are still to be seen at work presently. On the other hand, the large decrease in farm labour, the abundance of which was decisive for some of the past changes, will have heavy consequences for future changes.

"AGRIS:US201400182727";"nearest-neighbor imputation approach to mapping tree species over large areas using forest inventory plots and moderate resolution raster data";"";"The paper describes an efficient approach for mapping multiple individual tree species over large spatial domains. The method integrates vegetation phenology derived from MODIS imagery and raster data describing relevant environmental parameters with extensive field plot data of tree species basal area to create maps of tree species abundance and distribution at a 250-m pixel size for the entire eastern contiguous United States. The approach uses the modeling techniques of k-nearest neighbors and canonical correspondence analysis, where model predictions are calculated using a weighting of nearest neighbors based on proximity in a feature space derived from the model. The approach also utilizes a stratification derived from the 2001 National Land-Cover Database tree canopy cover layer. Data pre-processing is also described, which includes the use of Fourier series transformation for data reduction and characterizing seasonal vegetation phenology patterns that are apparent in the MODIS imagery. A suite of assessment procedures is applied to each of the modeled dataset presented. These indicate high accuracies, at the scales of assessments used, for total live-tree basal area per hectare and for many of the most common tree species found in the study area. The end result is an approach that enables the mapping of individual tree species distributions, while retaining much of the species covariance found on the forest inventory plots, at a level of spatial detail approaching that required for many regional management and planning applications. The proposed approach has the potential for operational application for simultaneously mapping the distribution and abundance of numerous common tree species across large spatial domains.";"Wilson, B.

"AGRIS:US201301921194";"Does cultivation influence the content and pattern of soil proteins";"";"Proteins comprise one of the largest N inputs to soils. There is, therefore, a need to investigate the factors involved in the inputs and fate of proteins in soil. While land use management is expected to influence the amount and diversity of soil proteins, the responses of protein as a source of mineralizable N to land use changes have not yet been studied. We hypothesized that extractable soil protein could be a sensitive indicator in evaluating the effect of stress in ecosystem. Soil samples were collected in October of 2009 from a native forest (Typic Calcixerolls) and a native rangeland (Typic Calcixerepts) as well as adjacent cultivated fields in Zagros area, central Iran. Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1% (w/v) SDS was used for soil protein extraction. The results showed that soil protein content decreased by 64% and 55% in cultivated sites, as compared with their corresponding native forest and native rangeland sites, respectively. To determine the effects of land use changes on soil protein pattern, SDS-PAGE was carried out. Electrophoretic patterns of soil proteins from agricultural soils were clearly different from those of native lands. Protein bands ranged from 17 to 90kDa and from 20 to 62kDa in native forest and in the adjacent cultivated soils, respectively. Protein bands were detected in the range of 17-57kDa for the native rangeland soil but in the range of 17-198kDa for the adjacent cultivated soil. Land use changes were found not only to decrease significantly the amount of soil proteins but also to influence the protein pattern. We achieved the objective of this paper which was to show the potential of the quantity and diversity of soil proteins as indicators of land use changes. The presented soil protein extraction method as well as soil protein content and pattern determination require further validation in a variety of soils types, climates and land use systems.";"Khalili, Banafshe

"AGRIS:US201400169406";"Production of global land cover data – GLCNMO";"";"Global land cover is one of the fundamental contents of Digital Earth. The Global Mapping project coordinated by the International Steering Committee for Global Mapping has produced a 1-km global land cover dataset – Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations. It has 20 land cover classes defined using the Land Cover Classification System. Of them, 14 classes were derived using supervised classification. The remaining six were classified independently: urban, tree open, mangrove, wetland, snow/ice, and water. Primary source data of this land cover mapping were eight periods of 16-day composite 7-band 1-km MODIS data of 2003. Training data for supervised classification were collected using Landsat images, MODIS NDVI seasonal change patterns, Google Earth, Virtual Earth, existing regional maps, and expert's comments. The overall accuracy is 76.5% and the overall accuracy with the weight of the mapped area coverage is 81.2%. The data are available from the Global Mapping project website (http://www.iscgm.org/). The MODIS data used, land cover training data, and a list of existing regional maps are also available from the CEReS website. This mapping attempt demonstrates that training/validation data accumulation from different mapping projects must be promoted to support future global land cover mapping.";"Tateishi, Ryutaro

"AGRIS:US201400169403";"Tracking desertification on the Mongolian steppe through NDVI and field-survey data";"";"Changing environmental and socio-economic conditions make land degradation, a major concern in Central and East Asia. Globally satellite imagery, particularly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, has proved an effective tool for monitoring land cover change. This study examines 33 grassland water points using vegetation field studies and remote sensing techniques to track desertification on the Mongolian plateau. Findings established a significant correlation between same-year field observation (line transects) and NDVI data, enabling an historical land cover perspective to be developed from 1998 to 2006. Results show variable land cover patterns in Mongolia with a 16% decrease in plant density over the time period. Decline in cover identified by NDVI suggests degradation; however, continued annual fluctuation indicates desertification – irreversible land cover change – has not occurred. Further, in situ data documenting greater cover near water points implies livestock overgrazing is not causing degradation at water sources. In combination of the two research methods – remote sensing and field surveys – strengthen findings and provide an effective way to track desertification in dryland regions.";"Sternberg, Troy

"AGRIS:US201400169408";"Towards long-multitemporal change detection using SVI differencing by integrated DWT–ISOCLUS: a model for forest temporal dynamics mapping";"";"Characterisation and mapping of land cover/land use within forest areas over long-multitemporal intervals is a complex task. This complexity is mainly due to the location and extent of such areas and, as a consequence, to the lack of full continuous cloud-free coverage of those large regions by one single remote sensing instrument. In order to provide improved long-multitemporal forest change detection using Landsat MSS and ETM + in part of Mt. Kenya rainforest, and to develop a model for forest change monitoring, wavelet transforms analysis was tested against the ISOCLUS algorithm for the derivation of changes in natural forest cover, as determined using four simple ratio-based Vegetation Indices: Simple Ratio (SR), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalised Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) and modified simple ratio (MSR). Based on statistical and empirical accuracy assessments, RDVI presented the optimal index for the case study. The overall accuracy statistic of the wavelet derived change/no-change was used to rank the performances of the indices as: RDVI (91.68%), MSR (82.55%), NDVI (79.73%) and SR (65.34%). The integrated discrete wavelet transform–ISOCLUS (DWT–ISOCLUS) result was 42.65% higher than the independent ISOCLUS approach in mapping the change/no-change information. The methodology suggested in this study presents a cost-effective and practical method to detect land-cover changes in support of decision-making for updating forest databases, and for long-term monitoring of vegetation changes from multisensor imagery. The current research contributes to Digital Earth with regards to geo-data acquisition, data mining and representation of one forest systems.";"Ouma, Yashon O.

Vegetation was sampled using objective methods and data collected on soils, land cover, location and management. Climate data were obtained from an available database. Examination of the first axis of vegetation variation as defined by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) showed a gradient from the Irish and British samples to those from France. The Spanish samples formed a separate group on the second axis. The species composition along the gradients is discussed. Correlations between the vegetation gradients and environmental variables were determined. The strongest correlations with the first DCA axis were for temperature, latitude, soil organic matter, grazing and land cover. The second DCA axis was highly correlated with rainfall, altitude and land cover. The third and fourth DCA axes were more difficult to interpret but appeared to be related to land cover. The results indicate that climate factors are important at this scale, but should not be considered in isolation and that factors relating to land cover and management should also be taken into account.";"Duckworth, J.C.

Intérêts pour l'environnement";"";"In certain regions where mixed farming prevails, the specialization of the farms (with the progressive disappearance of livestock) has brought about uniform methods of land occupation which run counter the environmental functions of farming. For that matter, grasslands and perennial covers have beneficial effects, but their insertion or their maintenance have to be thought out at the territorial scale. The environmental effects of grasslands and perennial forages are described (on soil quality, on the flows of substances such as nitrate and pesticides, on biodiversity, on the landscape, etc.). The area of these perennial covers is of importance, but the way they are inserted spatially in the territory has also to be considered. In certain regions these perennial covers can only be maintained through a voluntary policy of maintenance of livestock on the territories' farms. The association between the rearing of herbivorous stock consuming as much as possible locally produced herbage and the production of cash crops remains basic for a sustainable territorial development and implies the setting-up of new organizations among farms at the local level.";"Lemaire, Gilles";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"fr";"environment;agriculture";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=LV2016008641";"http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/15415";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400158822";"Principles for life cycle inventories of land use on a global scale";"";"PURPOSE: To assess the diverse environmental impacts of land use, a standardization of quantifying land use elementary flows is needed in life cycle assessment (LCA). The purpose of this paper is to propose how to standardize the land use classification and how to regionalize land use elementary flows. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In life cycle inventories, land occupation and transformation are elementary flows providing relevant information on the type and location of land use for land use impact assessment. To find a suitable land use classification system for LCA, existing global land cover classification systems and global approaches to define biogeographical regions are reviewed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A new multi-level classification of land use is presented. It consists of four levels of detail ranging from very general global land cover classes to more refined categories and very specific categories indicating land use intensities. Regionalization is built on five levels, first distinguishing between terrestrial, freshwater, and marine biomes and further specifying climatic regions, specific biomes, ecoregions and finally indicating the exact geo-referenced information of land use. Current land use inventories and impact assessment methods do not always match and hinder a comprehensive assessment of land use impact. A standardized definition of land use types and geographic location helps to overcome this gap and provides the opportunity to test the optimal resolution of land cover types and regionalization for each impact pathway. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION: The presented approach provides the necessary flexibility to providers of inventories and developers of impact assessment methods. To simplify inventories and impact assessment methods of land use, we need to find archetypical situations across impact pathways, land use types and regions, and aggregate inventory entries and methods accordingly.";"Koellner, Thomas

"AGRIS:US201500199255";"Landslide susceptibility assessment in Limbe (SW Cameroon): A field calibrated seed cell and information value method";"";"The dissected volcanic terrains around Limbe, SW Cameroon are frequently affected by small scale but destructive landslides. In this study, a raster-based data driven method involving seed cells is used to build a landslide susceptibility model for the Limbe area. Factors considered to be potential controls of slope failure within this area include slope gradient, rock type, distance from roads, slope orientation, mean annual precipitation, soil type, land cover type, stream density and distance from stream. 63 small to very small translational and rotational landslide scars were identified through extensive field work. Landslide data is randomly divided into a training (75%) and validation set (25%) and seed cells are generated by creating 25m buffer zones around the head scarp of each scar. The quantitative relationship between landslide seed cells and the above-mentioned factors is established by a data driven approach to obtain weighted factor classes. Summing weighted factor layers, a continuous scale of susceptibility indices is obtained and reclassified into 5 susceptibility classes. Seed cells obtained from the validation data set were used to evaluate the quality of several models involving different controlling factors. Our preferred model combines the weight of 6 factors (i.e. slope gradient, land cover, mean annual precipitation, stream density, proximity to roads and slope orientation). 78% of the validation seed cells are located within the high to very high susceptibility class, which occupy 16.9% of the study area. The obtained susceptibility map is combined with the outline of urban areas and key infrastructures to evaluate zones that are vulnerable to the impact of future slope failures. Such an approach will assist civil protection and urban planning efforts in SW Cameroon.";"Che, V.B.

"AGRIS:KE2007200205";"Evaluation of two soil carbon models using two Kenyan long term experimental datasets";"";"RothC and Century are two of the most widely used soil organic matter (SOM) models. However there are few examples of specific parameterisation of these models for environmental conditions in East Africa. The aim of this study was therefore, to evaluate the ability of RothC and the Century to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) resulting from varying land use/management practices for the climate and soil conditions found in Kenya. The study used climate, soils and crop data from a long term experiment (1976-200 I) carried out at The Kabete site at The Kenya National Agricultural Research Laboratories (NARL, located in a semi-humid region) and data from a 13 year experiment carried out in Machang'a (Embu District, located in a semi-arid region). The NARL experiment included various fertiliser (0, 60 and 120 kg of Nand P20S ha -1), farmyard manure (FYM-5 and 10 t ha -1) and plant residue treatments, in a variety of combinations. The Machang'a experiment involved a fertiliser (51 kgNha-l) and a FYM (0, 5 and IOtha-l) treatment with both monocropping and intercropping. At Kabete both models showed a fair to good fit to measured data, although Century simulations for treatments with high levels of FYM were better than those without. At the Machang'a site with monocrops, both models showed a fair to good fit to measured data for aU treatments. However, the fit of both models (especiaUy RothC) to measured data for intercropping treatments at Machang' a was much poorer. Further model development for intercrop systems is recommended. Both models can be useful tools in soil C predictions, provided time series of measured soil C and crop production data are available for validating model performance against local or regional agricultural crops.

They are an integrated part of research activities concerning the privatisation and restructuring of farm enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe and take up the subject of Discussion Paper 18. 31 questions were formulated. The answers were evaluated using multivariate statistical methods. Comprehensive knowledge was obtained about number and size of land and capital shares, voting mode, indebtedness, cost of social security contributions for the employees and of the support for household plots and ensuing consequences for the profitability of enterprises. Within a farm, land shares are principally of the same size varying between 2.6 and 48.5 hectares. Farm workers hold 53.0 % of the land shares and 53.3 % of the capital. In 14 out of 23 corporations the voting mode was not in agreement with the legal rules. A significant nonlinear relationship between acreage and profitability could be confirmed. Compared with medium-sized farms, the profitability was higher in some very large (>20 thousand ha) and also in relatively small farms (approx. 4 thousand ha). In case of the latter it was to be checked up whether and which way restructuring would be feasible in order to raise the profitability level. The average cost efficiency of large-scale farms as used in Russia for reporting on profitability was 3.4 % in 1999. If the costs of social security contributions by the farms for the workers, support for family farms and sometimes unusually high depreciation rates are neglected, the average cost efficiency is clearly higher (25.5 %). 15 farms out of 59 believe that they are able to settle the debt problem under their own steam; 9 hope for contributions by the government, and 35 expect a full assumption of their debts by the state.";"Schulze, Eberhard

The landscape included three forest environments (warm-dry, cool-moist, and cold) as well as a mixture of publicly and privately owned lands. Our models were state and transition formulations that treat vegetation change as probabilistic transitions among structure and cover types. We simulated background natural disturbance (i.e., historical), active fuel treatment, and fire suppression only disturbance scenarios for 200 or 500 years, depending on scenario. Several interesting landscape hypotheses emerge from our scenario simulations: (1) changes in management approach in landscapes the size of our study area may take decades to play out owing to the time required to grow large trees and the feedback loops among disturbances, (2) the current landscape is considerably different from that which might exist under a natural disturbance regime, (3) fire suppression alone does not mimic background natural disturbances and does not produce abundant large tree structure, and (4) dense, multi-layered large tree forests may be particularly difficult to maintain in abundance in this and similar landscapes owing to wildfire and insect disturbances.";"Hemstrom, Miles A.

Participatory forest management has been increasingly supported by fiscal policy, land tenure reforms, management models and capacity building initiatives. It has also become an important discourse for sustainable forest management (SFM) in China. Since the early 1990s, we have seen participatory forest management piloted at community levels, scaled to regional levels and institutionalized in policy at the national level. However, obvious challenges for enhanced adoption exist, including institutional barriers, little research, poor practices and a failure to replicate lessons learned from successful cases. To enhance SFM through participatory forest management, it is recommended that China decentralizes forest management, resolves forest tenure issues, improves multi-sectoral cooperation, incorporates the concept of participatory forest management into key forestry programs and enhances capacity for research and practice.";"Liu, J.

The anthropogenic heat discharge was estimated with a remote sensing-based surface energy balance model, which was parameterized using land cover, land surface temperature, albedo, and meteorological data. The building energy use was estimated using a GIS-based building energy simulation model in conjunction with Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration survey data, the Assessor’s parcel data, GIS floor areas data, and remote sensing-derived building height data. The spatial patterns of anthropogenic heat discharge and energy use from residential and commercial buildings were analyzed and compared. Quantitative relationships were evaluated across multiple scales from pixel aggregation to census block. The results indicate that anthropogenic heat discharge is consistent with building energy use in terms of the spatial pattern, and that building energy use accounts for a significant fraction of anthropogenic heat discharge. The research also implies that the relationship between anthropogenic heat discharge and building energy use is scale-dependent. The simultaneous estimation of anthropogenic heat discharge and building energy use via two independent methods improves the understanding of the surface energy balance in an urban landscape. The anthropogenic heat discharge derived from remote sensing and meteorological data may be able to serve as a spatial distribution proxy for spatially-resolved building energy use, and even for fossil-fuel CO₂ emissions if additional factors are considered.";"Zhou, Yuyu

The common resources usually used in wildfire detection are lookout towers, terrestrial mobile brigades, aerial reconnaissance and the general public. The objectives of this paper are (i) to analyse the relative importance of the different detection systems in Portugal and Spain, according to their spatial and temporal patterns, (ii) to assess the territorial variables related to the performance of fire detection systems in the Iberian Peninsula, and (iii) to develop an explanatory model aiming to inform fire detection policies. Pursuing this aim, a common wildfire and territorial database for the whole Iberian Peninsula was developed, thus enabling common cartographic and statistical analyses. Results show the importance of land cover variables and population density on the proportion of fire detections made by the different systems in both countries. Despite certain national specificities, many common features were found, allowing the identification of general patterns of fire detection distribution and performance for the Iberian Peninsula. Models developed at the regional and sub-regional levels indicate that high population density and high proportion of forestlands are associated with higher proportion of detection by population, whereas higher proportion of shrublands corresponds to higher proportions of detections by other systems, particularly lookout towers. The conclusions obtained and the approaches applied could be used with similar objectives in other countries and regions to inform policy decisions regarding the allocation of resources for wildfire detection.";"Rego, Francisco

"AGRIS:US201500217151";"Intermediate levels of property rights and the emerging housing market in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam";"";"Vietnam introduced a Policy of Renovation (‘Doi Moi’ Policy) to restructure the economy in 1986. Under this policy, the Land Use Right Certificate was introduced as a form of tenure for agricultural land and urban land, according to the Land Laws of 1987 and 1993, respectively. However, by 2001, most properties and/or land in Vietnam still did not have a legal title. Although Vietnam's land reforms in the 1990s provided some of the weakest private rights among the transition countries, big cities like Ho Chi Minh City are presently homes to thriving housing markets. Transactions of ‘property without a physical entity and legal title’ in the real estate market show how property ownership can be formed in order to operate within different institutional contexts. This paper highlights that ‘intermediate levels of property rights’ are the driving forces behind the thriving housing market in Ho Chi Minh City.";"Thien Thu, Truong

The analysis shows that the direction and strength of the dynamics is highly dependent on the physical intricacies and social relations implicated in these two types of intangible property. As the development of intangible property rights lies at the heart of postindustrial knowledge economies, the study of the genetically modified conflict is also instructive for understanding social change in the agri-food sector and in society more generally.";"Gill, Bernhard";"";"Inderscience Publishers";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"property rights;farmers";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600190461";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1504%2FIJARGE.2009.023074";"";"";"";"14-36"

Habitat and landscape scale variables played a similar general role in explaining the presence of the eight observed reedbed passerines. Reed island area was the most important factor; however, owing to the small average island area (1.74 ha), this simply indicates that too small reed patches were not occupied. A preference for an elongated shape (reedbed edges) was important for half of the species, and no other variables were included into the model of more than two species. The important practical conclusion is that both habitat and landscape scale factors should be considered in nature conservation management of reedbeds.";"Báldi, András";"";"Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600000714";"http://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F068.041.0105";"";"";"";"1-6"

In addition, the grain and the type of data collected and data transformation adopted can influence restoration monitoring results. In this paper, we assessed the effect of changing indicator, grain size (i.e., plot dimension) and data transformation in discriminating different mapped plant communities, relying on vascular plant composition data. We considered flora entities at different taxonomic scales of resolution as indicators and used biological forms such as life forms, growth forms and a combination of the two types, i.e., life and growth forms, as rough plant traits. We also analysed the contribution of species as indicators of the different land cover classes by performing an Indicator Species Analysis. We evaluated the effect of changing indicator (taxonomic resolution, life and growth forms and indicator species), grain size and data transformation using permutational multivariate analysis of variance on cover data expressed in percentages and as simple presence/absence. Our results demonstrated that indicators such as taxonomic resolution and biological forms have partial success in discriminating between plant communities, only for the analysis performed on presence/absence data, and that the effects of changing indicator varied depending on the data transformation used. On the contrary, indicator species are coherently effective and changing the grain size has a moderate influence on their ability to discriminate among the habitat types investigated. Hence, indicator species emerged as a promising tool in restoration monitoring. Although indicators are not supposed to substitute comprehensive surveys of vegetation, their use can help redirect considerable time, resources and expertise to more replication and better sampling design.";"Marignani, M.

The experiment was set up in a completely randomized design in a factorial layout with five replications. The vemicompost treatment was applied in six different levels, including 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75% fertilizer. Further, AM fungi treatment was applied in two levels (inoculating with and without AM fungi). The results showed a decreasing trend in shoot and root dry weight, potassium content, total nitrogen content (TNC), leaf area, leaf relative water content (LRWC), and water holding capacity (WHC) as the vermicompost application rate decreased. In addition, the AM mycorrhizal fungi inoculation significantly increased shoot and root dry weight, potassium content, TNC, leaf area, LRWC, and WHC values and decreased soil bulk density across all vermicompost treatments. However, soil pH and EC were not influenced by AM fungi. Vermicompost treatments also influenced soil properties, including soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bulk density. A higher vermicompost application rate significantly increased soil pH and EC while it decreased soil bulk density. Overall, bio fertilizers showed positive effects on both soil and plant characteristics and could be recommended for management practices to improve plant productivity and soil fertility in grazing lands.";"Akhzari, Davoud

"AGRIS:US201301107502";"coherent set of future land use change scenarios for Europe";"";"This paper presents a range of future, spatially explicit, land use change scenarios for the EU15, Norway and Switzerland based on an interpretation of the global storylines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that are presented in the special report on emissions scenarios (SRES). The methodology is based on a qualitative interpretation of the SRES storylines for the European region, an estimation of the aggregate totals of land use change using various land use change models and the allocation of these aggregate quantities in space using spatially explicit rules. The spatial patterns are further downscaled from a resolution of 10 min to 250 m using statistical downscaling procedures. The scenarios include the major land use/land cover classes urban, cropland, grassland and forest land as well as introducing new land use classes such as bioenergy crops. The scenario changes are most striking for the agricultural land uses, with large area declines resulting from assumptions about future crop yield development with respect to changes in the demand for agricultural commodities. Abandoned agricultural land is a consequence of these assumptions. Increases in urban areas (arising from population and economic change) are similar for each scenario, but the spatial patterns are very different. This reflects alternative assumptions about urban development processes. Forest land areas increase in all scenarios, although such changes will occur slowly and largely reflect assumed policy objectives. The scenarios also consider changes in protected areas (for conservation or recreation goals) and how these might provide a break on future land use change. The approach to estimate new protected areas is based in part on the use of models of species distribution and richness. All scenarios assume some increases in the area of bioenergy crops with some scenarios assuming a major development of this new land use. Several technical and conceptual difficulties in developing future land use change scenarios are discussed. These include the problems of the subjective nature of qualitative interpretations, the land use change models used in scenario development, the problem of validating future change scenarios, the quality of the observed baseline, and statistical downscaling techniques.";"Rounsevell, M.D.A.

Household level fixed-effect estimates from about 8,500 plots operated by households who own and sharecrop land in the Ethiopian highlands provide support for the hypothesis of Marshallian inefficiency. At the same time, a factor adjustment model suggests that the extent to which rental markets allow households to attain their desired operational holding size is extremely limited. Our analysis points towards factor market imperfections (no rental for oxen), lack of alternative employment opportunities, and tenure insecurity as possible reasons underlying such behavior, suggesting that, rather than worrying almost exclusively about Marshallian inefficiency, it is equally warranted to give due attention to the policy framework within which land rental markets operate.";"Deininger, Klaus W.

Although single TEA concentrations and fluxes have been intensively studied, the factors regulating the simultaneous fluxes and molar ratios of TEAs are poorly elucidated. We studied the mean concentrations, exports, and molar ratios of TEAs from 27 boreal catchments differing in land cover (percentage of agricultural land, peatland, forest, and built-up area) during the years 2000–2011. TEA exports and molar ratios were strongly controlled by land cover and only a little by atmospheric deposition. Fields produced the highest export of TEAs, particularly NO₃. Peatland was linked to low NO₃and SO₄, but high Fe exports. NO₃, Mn, and Fe exports from forests were low, SO₄having proportionally the highest export. Together, the percentages of field and peatland predicted 93, 80, 75, and 67% of the variation in the export of NO₃, Mn, Fe, and SO₄, respectively. The variable export of TEAs having different availability and physical behavior may create different premises for anaerobic mineralization in downstream systems, which adds a new dimension to the link between terrestrial system, land use, and environmental problems, such as eutrophication and climate change.";"Palviainen, Marjo

"AGRIS:US201500083415";"ecosystem services perspective on brush management: research priorities for competing land‐use objectives";"";"The vegetation of semi‐arid and arid landscapes is often comprised of mixtures of herbaceous and woody vegetation. Since the early 1900s, shifts from herbaceous to woody plant dominance, termed woody plant encroachment and widely regarded as a state change, have occurred world‐wide. This shift presents challenges to the conservation of grassland and savanna ecosystems and to animal production in commercial ranching systems and pastoral societies. Dryland management focused on cattle and sheep grazing has historically attempted to reduce the abundance of encroaching woody vegetation (hereafter, ‘brush management’) with the intent of reversing declines in forage production, stream flow or groundwater recharge. Here, we assess the known and potential consequences of brush management actions, both positive and negative, on a broader suite of ecosystem services, the scientific challenges to quantifying these services and the trade‐offs among them. Our synthesis suggests that despite considerable investments accompanying the application of brush management practices, the recovery of key ecosystem services may be short‐lived or absent. However, in the absence of such interventions, those and other ecosystem services may be compromised, and the persistence of grassland and savanna ecosystem types and their endemic plants and animals threatened. Addressing the challenges posed by woody plant encroachment will require integrated management systems using diverse theoretical principles to design the type, timing and spatial arrangement of initial management actions and follow‐up treatments. These management activities will need to balance cultural traditions and preferences, socio‐economic constraints and potentially competing land‐use objectives. Synthesis. Our ability to predict ecosystem responses to management aimed at recovering ecosystem services where grasslands and savannas have been invaded by native or exotic woody plants is limited for many attributes (e.g. primary production, land surface–atmosphere interactions, biodiversity conservation) and inconsistent for others (e.g. forage production, herbaceous diversity, water quality/quantity, soil erosion, carbon sequestration). The ecological community is challenged with generating robust information about the response of ecosystem services and their interactions if we are to position land managers and policymakers to make objective, science‐based decisions regarding the many trade‐offs and competing objectives for the conservation and dynamic management of grasslands and savannas.";"Archer, Steven R.

"AGRIS:US201300761521";"Discriminating the effects of agricultural land management practices on soil fungal communities";"";"The structure of fungal communities was examined in soil subjected to 5 years of different agricultural land management and tomato production practices. Length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) of fungal rDNA internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) regions was used to create genomic fingerprints of the soil fungal communities. Three years after initiation of land management practices, univariate analysis of genetic diversity failed to detect differences among soil fungal communities in plots managed organically, conventionally or maintained free of vegetation by continuous tillage (disk fallow). Genetic diversity was significantly higher in plots maintained as a perennial pasture grass (Paspalum notatum var Argentine bahiagrass) or as an undisturbed weed fallow. The composition of soil fungal communities within organic, pasture grass or disk fallow plots were separated into unique clusters by non-parametric multivariate analysis of their Bray-Curtis similarity matrices, computed from the relative abundance of ITS-1 amplicons, while the composition of communities within disk fallow and conventional plots could not be distinguished from each other. Diversity of soil fungal communities was significantly reduced following the cultivation of tomato in year four when compared to the diversity in plots where tomato was not cultivated. Divergence in the composition of soil fungal communities was observed following the cultivation of tomato under all land management regimes except organic, where communities continued to remained clustered based upon similarities among their ITS-1 amplicons. Divergence in the composition of fungal communities became more pronounced following two major hurricanes (Francis and Jeanne, September 2004) except for communities in the organic and pasture grass plots. Following the completion of a second tomato crop in year 5, genetic diversity and richness was similar under all land management regimes except the pasture grass, where it remained significantly higher. By contrast, following two consecutive years of tomato production, unique but mutually similar compositions of fungal communities were detected only in plots subjected to the organic land management regime. This was supported by observations that fungal communities were dominated by a 341 bp rDNA amplicon fragment in all land management regimes except the organic. Cloning and sequencing indicated that the 341 bp fragment generated by LH-PCR had a sequencing size of 343 bp, which was most closely related to Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, land management practices that disturb or disrupt soil fungal communities will significantly reduce their diversity. However, the composition of soil fungal communities is more strongly influenced by land management practices and communities within an organically management system were more resistant to anthropogenic and meteorological disturbances.";"Wu, T.

A case in point is Amazonia, a large, data-poor region where most whole-basin data sets are limited to understanding land cover interpreted through a variety of remote sensing techniques and sensors. A growing body of work, however, indicates that the future state of much of Amazonia depends on the land use to which converted areas are put, but land use in the tropics is difficult to assess from remotely sensed data alone. An earlier paper developed new snapshots of agricultural land use in this region using a statistical fusion of satellite data and agricultural census data, an underutilized ancillary data source available across Amazonia. The creation of these land-use maps, which have the spatial detail of a satellite image and the attribute information of an agricultural census, required the development of a new statistical technique for merging data sets at different scales and of fundamentally different data types. Here we describe and assess this nonlinear technique, which reinterprets existing land cover classifications by determining what categories are most highly related to the polygon land-use data across the study area. Although developed for this region, the technique appears to hold broad promise for the systematic fusion of multiple data sets that are closely related but of different origins.";"Cardille, Jeffrey A.

First it takes the point of view of the pastoralist, which introduces unnecessary bias. Second, it assumes that all changes in land tenure are situations in which the state, or another powerful agent, takes land away from the less powerful pastoralists. Third, it assumes a single immutable power relation between the state (or other external actor initiating land tenure reform) and the pastoralist in which the state is more powerful and is only too happy to exercise its power whilst expropriating the pastoralists of the land they use.

The relative importance of lithological and structural control on channel alignment and character in comparison with the role of hydraulic erosion of the substratum is unclear. In addition, bedrock rivers often have a variable sediment fill and can be described as mixed bedrock–alluvial systems. The Mekong River in northern Cambodia is an anastomosed mixed bedrock–alluvial channel, but little and poorly researched. In this paper information has been gathered from diverse literature sources; digital data sets showing topography, hydrology, geology and land cover; past aerial photographs; and maps. Such data, together with field survey, provide a clear picture of the Mekong River in this region. The channels may be classified into three types: primary, secondary, cross channels. The varying characteristics of these three help towards understanding the evolution of the modern Mekong. Similarly the two-fold classification of the islands reveals the relationship between island inundation characteristics and the annual monsoon flood cycle. The associated riparian vegetation ecotones include a rare and unusual seasonally-inundated forest. Spatial variations in lithology and structure, when combined with maps of river networks, reveals that the channel alignments locally reflect the geological factors that cause the regional topographical gradient. Fault-line constraints on the local slopes of the channel may induce backwater effects and consequent sedimentation patterns (alluvial overprints) or alternatively, steepening of the channels with concomitant reduction in sedimentation. These structural constraints, taken together, lead to the identification of a mixed bedrock–alluvial five-fold geomorphological zonation within the study area. The general absence of paleochannels, and terraces close to the modern river, indicates that the Mekong is laterally stable with a dominating channel that downcuts. Consequently, a flood surface of limited lateral extent constrains entire floods.";"Meshkova, Liubov V.

"AGRIS:US2016213301";"Did local government structure kill small town America?";"";"This article examines the provision of public goods in an urban area and the effect voting has on the level and location of amenities throughout a city. It is particularly appropriate for small communities that must finance economic development projects with limited funds. The work presented is a result of working with rural communities throughout America that have seen their historic downtowns deteriorate as big box retail grows on the urban fringe. I find this shift in community development may be a result of the way local economic development is financed and projects are decided upon. Specifically, I find significant welfare losses associated with voting for a public good in space. Small public projects that would lead to community-wide welfare improvements are always under-provided, amenities from any public good provided exceed the social optimum, and amenities throughout the city are inappropriately located. Urban amenities refer to city parks, libraries, recreation and cultural centers, museums, landscaping, and other goods that are publicly provided for the enjoyment of residents. Parks and recreation centers serve as extended backyards, community gathering places, and wildlife habitat. Cultural centers and landscaping enhance local neighborhoods and are used as a gauge of a community's quality of life. Often these amenities are created by public referendum or by public servants acting on behalf of the community, presumably as if there was a referendum, and, once created, are financed through property taxes spread evenly across the community. The benefits of urban amenities, however, do not accrue evenly across a community. They create a spatial externality in the sense that residents living nearer the public good benefit more than a resident living across town. This introduces two opposing forces in the decision of public good location. There is pressure for amenities to be created where access is highest and spillovers are largest; however, such land is typically more expensive, leading to a higher tax burden.";"Warziniack, Travis";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016213301";"http://purl.umn.edu/60956";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:DJ2012061048";"Rights to Land, Forests and Carbon in REDD+: Insights from Mexico, Brazil and Costa Rica";"";"Land tenure and carbon rights constitute critical issues to take into account in achieving emission reductions, ensuring transparent benefit sharing and determining non-permanence (or non-compliance) liabilities in the context of REDD+ strategies and projects. This is so because tenure systems influence who becomes involved in efforts to avoid deforestation and improve forest management, and that land tenure, carbon rights and liabilities may be linked or divorced with implications for rural development. This paper explores these issues by looking at tenure regimes and carbon rights issues in Mexico, Brazil and Costa Rica. It is effectively shown that complex bundles of rights over forest resources have distinct implications for REDD+ design and implementation, and that REDD+ strategies in selected countries have to date failed in procedurally addressing land-use conflicts and carbon rights entitlements and liabilities.";"Esteve Corbera

We hypothesize that, similar to soil organic matter, Arctic soils store large amounts of ASi which may be affected by projected climate changes and associated changes in permafrost regimes. Average soil ASi storage (top 1 m) ranged between 9600 and 83,500 kg SiO₂ ha⁻¹among different land-cover types. Lichen tundra contained the lowest amounts of ASi while no significant differences were found in ASi storage among other land-cover types. Clear differences were observed between ASi storage allocated into the top organic versus the mineral horizon of soils. Bog peatlands, fen peatlands and wet shrub tundra stored between 7090 and 45,400 kg SiO₂ ha⁻¹in the top organic horizon, while the corresponding storage in lichen tundra, moist shrub- and dry shrub tundra only amounted to 1500–1760 kg SiO₂ ha⁻¹. Diatoms and phytoliths are important components of ASi storage in the top organic horizon of peatlands and shrub tundra systems, while it appears to be a negligible component of ASi storage in the mineral horizon of shrub tundra classes. ASi concentrations decrease with depth in the soil profile for fen peatlands and all shrub tundra classes, suggesting recycling of ASi, whereas bog peatlands appeared to act as sinks retaining stored ASi on millennial time scales. Our results provide a conceptual framework to assess the potential effects of climate change impacts on terrestrial Si cycling in the Arctic. We believe that ASi stored in peatlands are particularly sensitive to climate change, because a larger fraction of the ASi pool is stored in perennially frozen ground compared to shrub tundra systems. A likely outcome of climate warming and permafrost thaw could be mobilization of previously frozen ASi, altered soil storage of biogenically derived ASi and an increased Si flux to the Arctic Ocean.";"Alfredsson, Hanna

This study focused on two objectives: (1) selecting the best predictor variables for the classification of semi-arid Zagros forests given the characteristics of the study area and available data sets and (2) evaluating the application of the random forest (RF) algorithm as a unified technique for the classification of data sets acquired from different sensors. Three images of the same study area were acquired from the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor in 2009, the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor with Scan Line Corrector (SLC) in 1999 and the Landsat-2 Multispectral Scanner (MSS) sensor in 1975. Following image preprocessing, the RF algorithm was applied for variable selection and classification. A test of equivalence was used to compare the overall accuracy of the classified maps from the three sensors. Slope, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation were determined to be the most important predictor variables for all three images. High overall classification accuracies were achieved for all three images (97.90% for MSS, 95.43% for TM and 95.29% for ETM). The ETM- and TM-derived maps had equivalent overall accuracy and even significantly higher overall accuracy was obtained for the MSS-derived map. The post-classification comparison showed an increase in agriculture and a decrease in forest cover. The selected predictor variables were consistent with ecological reality and showed more details on the changes of the land-cover classes across biophysical variables of the study area through time.";"Henareh Khalyani, Azad

Because the global validation database should expand over time as new validation data are contributed, the sampling design must be constructed so that it is simple to increase the sample size from a specific region (e.g. a continent or country) or from targeted land-cover classes to improve standard errors of the accuracy estimates. Stratified random sampling provides the desired adaptability to augment a sample to address regional or class-specific accuracy objectives. The proposed global validation database will be initiated from a baseline global stratified sample and then this baseline sample will be augmented to address accuracy objectives related to a specific map or region. The strata are constructed from a modified Köppen climate classification and population density. The theory and formulas for estimating accuracy from the combined baseline and augmented stratified samples are presented, and an example application is provided in which the regional accuracy of a land-cover map is assessed. The stratification used for the baseline global sample is retained when the augmented sample is subsequently selected. Alternatively, it is possible to ‘restratify’ the design so that the land-cover classes of a particular map are used as strata when selecting an augmented sample. The protocol for restratifying the design is presented, but the complexity of this option makes it less practical than retaining the initial strata when selecting an augmented sample.";"Stehman, Stephen V.

"AGRIS:US2012202731";"LAND REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND MARKETS IN RUSSIA";"";"Russia has experienced dramatic changes in land ownership and land tenure since the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991: agricultural land has been largely privatized, individual landowners now have legal rights to most agricultural land in the country, and previous prohibitions on buying and selling of land have been removed by recent laws.  The necessary preconditions for the development of agricultural land markets have been met and we are beginning to witness transactions that involve individual landowners, and not only the state.  However, further development of the embryonic land market is severely circumscribed by the inadequacy of the administrative and technical infrastructure.  In this paper we discuss the dynamically evolving legal framework for land reform, consider the impacts of land reform on privatization and ownership structure of agricultural land, and analyze the development of land market transactions.  The analysis is based on official statistical sources and the results of a questionnaire-based survey conducted by the authors in 2003 in three regions.  The paper concludes with a review of the existing constraints on land transactions and some policy recommendations.";"Lerman, Zvi

"AGRIS:US201500220943";"Accessibility as a determinant of landscape transformation in western Honduras: linking pattern and process";"";"This study evaluates the relationship between landscape accessibility and land cover change in Western Honduras, and demonstrates how these relationships are influenced by social and economic processes of land use change in the region. The study area presents a complex mosaic of land cover change processes that involve approximately equal amounts of reforestation and deforestation. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery of 1987, 1991 and 1996 was used to create three single date classifications and a land cover change image depicting the sequence of changes in land cover between 1987–1991–1996. An accessibility analysis examined land cover change and landscape fragmentation relative to elevation and distance from roads. Between 1987 and 1991, results follow ‘expected’ trends, with more accessible areas experiencing greater deforestation and fragmentation. Between 1991 and 1996 this trend reverses. Increased deforestation is found in areas distant from roads, and at higher elevations; a result of government policies promoting expansion of mountain coffee production for export. A ban on logging, and abandonment of marginally productive agricultural fields due to agricultural intensification in other parts of the landscape, has led to increased regrowth in accessible regions of the landscape. Roads and elevation also present different obstacles in terms of their accessibility, with the smallest patches of cyclical clearing and regrowth, relating mostly to the agricultural fallow cycle, found at the highest elevations but located close to roads. This research highlights the need to locate analyses of land cover change within the context of local socio-economic policies and land use processes.";"Nagendra, Harini

"AGRIS:US201500220945";"Upstream-to-downstream changes in nutrient export risk";"";"Nutrient export coefficients are estimates of the mass of nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) normalized by area and time (e.g., kg/ha/yr). They have been estimated most often for watersheds ranging in size from 10² to 10⁴ hectares, and have been recommended as measurements to inform management decisions. At this scale, watersheds are often nested upstream and downstream components of larger drainage basins, suggesting nutrient export coefficients will change from one subwatershed to the next. Nutrient export can be modeled as risk where lack of monitoring data prevents empirical estimation. We modeled N and P export risk for subwatersheds of larger drainage basins, and examined spatial changes in risk from upstream to downstream watersheds. Spatial (subwatershed) changes in N and P risk were a function of in-stream decay, subwatershed land-cover composition, and subwatershed streamlength. Risk tended to increase in a downstream direction under low rates of in-stream decay, whereas high rates of in-stream decay often reduced risk to zero (0) toward downstream subwatersheds. On average, increases in the modeled rate of in-stream decay reduced risk by 0.44 for N and 0.39 for P. Interactions between in-stream decay, land-cover composition and streamlength produced dramatic changes in risk across subwatersheds in some cases. Comparison of the null cases of no in-stream decay and homogeneously forested subwatersheds with extant conditions indicated that complete forest cover produced greater reductions in nutrient export risk than a high in-stream decay rate, especially for P. High rates of in-stream decay and complete forest cover produced approximately equivalent reductions in N export risk for downstream subwatersheds.";"Wickham, James D.

Supervised classifications of a Landsat series (1973–1997) and the coefficients Kappa (K) and Tau (τ), were used to assess the area and verify the accuracy of the classification of six informational classes (urban area, aquatic systems, mangrove, agriculture, natural vegetation, and aquaculture). Pixel-by-pixel change detection among dates was evaluated using the Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA). Besides the overall estimation of the aquatic systems class, variations in the three lagoons present in the study area were analyzed individually. Measures of agreement between the classification and reference data indicate that the accuracy for the classification ranked from moderate to high (K = 0.76 ± 0.07; τ = 0.77 ± 0.06). From 1973 to 1997 urban area has doubled, growing to the north and the northeast, extending mainly over natural vegetation and agricultural land. La Escopama and El Sabalo, two of the lagoons studied, reduced their size to less than half that estimated in 1973, but the main estuarine system in the study area, Estero de Urias - El Infiernillo, has maintained its area without noticeable changes. However, the surrounding landscape in Estero de Urias - Infiernillo is changing from natural vegetation and agriculture to urban land use. Consequently, to limit as much as possible changes in the area to natural causes, some management measures must be considered to design urban development plans and to recover and preserve the natural areas, on a broad scale rather than a local spatial scale.";"Ruiz-Luna, Arturo

"AGRIS:US201500220949";"264 years of change and persistence in an agrarian landscape: a case study from the Swiss lowlands";"";"CONTEXT: Century-long interaction between societies and their environment has shaped the cultural landscapes across Europe. Specific farming systems have persisted for long periods, and their abandonment has led to far-reaching and rapid changes in patterns of land use and land cover. OBJECTIVE: Taking the example of the municipality of Limpach, located in the Swiss lowlands, we studied the dynamics of cultural landscape and related driving forces in a long-term perspective. METHODS: Using various data types, we reconstruct 264 years of change and persistence and evaluated the processes involved. The sources permit not only the examination of land use and land cover change, but also linear elements (paths, waterways) and the study of changes in parcel structure. RESULTS: For centuries, efforts to increase the intensity and productivity of agriculture, such as the so-called “melioration projects”, which included extensive drainage of wetlands and the establishment of an efficient network of roads and paths, greatly influenced landscape changes. In the last few decades, driving forces not directly aiming at an intensification of agricultural production, but rather promoting ecologically valuable landscape elements, have left traces in the open landscape of Limpach. CONCLUSIONS: Changes are an inherent characteristic of cultural landscapes. However, the rates of changes are highly variable over time. While comparatively stable periods might be used as a reference/baseline and the region itself may be referred to as a traditional cultural landscape, such long periods should not be misinterpreted as being stable from a long term historical perspective.";"Bürgi, Matthias

An analysis of aerial photographs from three time steps (1949, 1985 and 2004) was used to document changes in woody plant density in different vegetation types on commonage and an adjacent commercial farm in Fort Beaufort, South Africa. Rangeland condition was assessed in different vegetation units of the area and woody plant density was related to distance from urban settlement. Results showed that there has been an increase in woody plant cover in both commonage and commercial farming areas, particularly between 1949 and 1985. However, since 1985, increased rates of urbanisation have stabilised, and in some areas reduced, woody plant thickening, especially at locations closest to urban settlements. Bush encroachment is being controlled to some extent by fuelwood harvesting and goat browsing, resulting in a reduction in height of favoured woody species such as Acacia karroo (Vachellia karroo). There has been a shift to less palatable browse species on the commonage areas and the condition of the grass sward is poor. Change in woody plant cover is significantly influenced by changing patterns of land use and land tenure over time which, in turn, affect rangeland condition.";"Puttick, James R

A case study in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (NE Spain)";"";"This paper extends the debate on corridor effectiveness at regional planning scale, by exploring the contribution to landscape connectivity of a proposed ecological network and the remaining non-urbanized matrix in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). Using the Ecological Connectivity Index, we evaluated the expected connectivity loss after the development of the approved urban plans in the region. Thus, we compared the baseline (present-day) and the projected (after planned urban development) connectivity scenarios for total, forest and agricultural habitats. Then, we estimated the mitigation in connectivity loss when successively removing from plans those development sectors included in protected sites, first order corridors, and second-order corridors of the ecological network, and in the rest of land matrix. Estimations were done for all the BMR and for inside versus outside the set of sites currently protected. The ecological network and the rest of matrix contributed equally to mitigating the expected connectivity loss, but while the former was more effective for forest habitats, the latter was especially constructive for croplands. This was due to a heterogeneous distribution of habitats, protected reserves and urban development areas. Still, connectivity preservation within protected sites appeared to be highly dependent on what is going on outside the ecological network, as we observed in particular for agricultural habitats. This result extends at regional scale the statement that no park is an island, but is highly affected by the land use and land cover dynamics of its surroundings.";"Pino, Joan

Surface water samples were collected from five sites, throughout the agriculturally-influenced Nathan Creek watershed, British Columbia, Canada and a nearby control site between October 2005 and March 2006. From a total of 48 samples, Canadian Water Quality Guidelines were exceeded nineteen times for nitrate (NO₃ ⁻; guideline value: 2.94 mg/L N) and four times for un-ionized ammonia (NH₃; guideline value 0.019 mg/L N). Gas chromatography mass spectrometry single ion monitoring (GC-MS SIM) analysis of 18 sterols showed that five fecal sterols (coprostanol, episoprostanol, cholesterol, cholestanol, desmosterol) were detected at all sites except the control site (where only cholesterol, cholestanol and desmosterol were detected). Three phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol) were also detected at all sites while the hormone estrone was present at one site on two occasions at concentrations of 0.01 and 0.04 μg/L. Chemometric analysis (principal component analysis and cluster analysis) grouped sites based on their similarities in sterol composition. Analysis of ten sterol ratios (seven for identifying human fecal contamination and four for differentiating sources of fecal contamination) showed multiple instances of human and animal contamination for every site but the control site. Application of a Bacteroides-BST method confirmed contamination from ruminant animals, pigs and dogs in varying combinations at all impact sites. Together, these results confirmed the impact of agricultural activities on the Nathan Creek watershed and support a need for better land management practices to protect water quality and aquatic life.";"Furtula, Vesna

The typical properties of the soils studied are: the absence of salinity and carbonate contents, the low amounts of organic matter, the deficiency in P and K which most probably is due to the leaching under acid conditions, the dominantly loamy textures and the pH varying from weakly to strong acid. The priority in the management of these soils should therefore be the application of an appropriate fertilization programme along with soil liming. In addition, some soils may need deep ripping and tillage.

Yıldız dağında Poyralı, Yeniceköy, Demirköy, İğneada ve İğneada'nın kuzeybatı yöresinde yer alan kireçli kum çökelleri, klorit şist, değişik nitelikteki pliosen çökeller ile alüviyal çökeller üzerinde oluşmuş Entisol, Mollisol, İnceptisol, Ultisol ve Spodosol Ordolarına giren topraklar incelenmiştir. Ayrıca Kırklareli'nin kuzeyinde yer alan orman arazilerindeki Kırklareli- Koruköy- Dereköy- Bulgaristan sınır kapısı hattı boyunca metagranit, kuars- kuarsit çökelleri, klorit şist, talk şist, dolomit, siyenit ve arduaz üzerinde oluşmuş Entisol ve Mollisol Ordolarındaki topraklar topluca ve orman arazileri arasında ki topraklar da tarımsal potansiyelleri açısından irdelenmiştir. Yıldız dağlarının batı kesimindeki toprakların kil mineralojileri de saptanmıştır ve farklı oranlarda belirlenen illit, vermikulit, smektit, klorit ve kaolinit kil mineralleri toprakların verimliliklerini de yönlendirmektedir. Yöre topraklarının çok dikkatle uygulanması gereken amenajmanlara gereksinimleri vardır. İncelenen toprakların tipik özellikleri: Tuzsuz olmaları; tamamına yakınının kireç içermemesi; genellikle organik madde düzeylerinin yetersiz olması; asidik yıkanma nedeniyle bir kısmının faydalı fosfor ve potasyum oranlarının kültür bitkilerine yetmeyecek düzeyde olması; tekstür sınıflarının ağırlıklı olarak hafif ve orta bünyede olması; zayıf asitten son derece kuvvetli asit arasında toprak reaksiyonlarına sahip olmasıdır. Bu toprakların dikkatli gübreleme programı uygulamasının yanında; kireçlemenin de özenle yapılması ön koşuldur. Ayrıca bazı toprakların dip patlatma denilen, dip kazan veya riper ile derin sürüm işlemine de gereksinimleri vardır.";"Boyraz, D., Namık Kemal Univ., Faculty of Agriculture, Tekirdağ (Turkey).

"AGRIS:US2016212785";"Risk Management Instruments for Water Reallocations";"";"Federal and state governments are searching for programs and/or policies to deal with the risks linked with uncertainty in water supplies and demands. Within the United States, competition among agricultural, urban, and environmental concerns for water is increasing. Drought conditions and water use restrictions have, at times, limited water supplies for these varied uses. The federal government stands in a unique position as both a major supplier and demander of water. As such, the federal government has put forward several programs for water conservation, information, and usage. One area in which the federal government has not made significant progress is the issue of risk management and compensation for water reallocations. When natural forces or government policies trigger water use restrictions, the restricted water users may or may not be compensated by current programs. This paper explores how current policies may or may not cover agricultural losses due to water use restrictions and outlines several government policy proposals and market-based methods to mitigate the risks from water restrictions. Given the diversity of the agents involved and the watersheds covered, it is likely that no one program will be the ""best"" program to address the issue. The ""best"" program for a given combination of agents in a watershed will depend upon the types of agents and the possible uses of the water.";"Hart, Chad E.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2005-12-31";"en";"water rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"USA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212785";"http://purl.umn.edu/18298";"";"";"";""

Energy balance is expressed by surface temperature while hydrochemical balance is illustrated by electric conductivity and selected hydrochemical parameters. Six model sub-watersheds with different land use situated in southern Bohemia were chosen to show the influence of landscape management on landscape functioning. The watersheds with higher humankind activity were shown to have both higher and more fluctuating average surface temperature as well as higher electrical conductivity in the runoff surface water. Watersheds with the predominance of forests and meadows showed opposite trends in the monitored parameters. Our results show that sustainable landscape management leads to lower temperature extremes and consequently to low matter and water losses. Large improvements of energy and matter balance can be achieved by restoration of permanent vegetation and/or effective water retention and accumulation.";"Hesslerová, P.

It involves the partitioning of the terrain into conceptual spatial entities based upon criteria that include morphology (form), genetics (process), composition and structure, chronology, environmental system associations (land cover, soils, ecology), as well as spatial topological relationships of surface features (landforms). Historically, the power of human visualization was primarily relied upon for analysis, introducing subjectivity and biases with respect to selection of criteria for terrain segmentation and placement of boundaries. This paper reviews new spatio-temporal data and geocomputational approaches that now permit Earth scientists to go far beyond traditional mapping, permitting quantitative characterization of landscape morphology and the integration of varied landscape thematic information. Numerous conceptual, theoretical, and information-technology issues are at the heart of digital geomorphological mapping (DGM), and scientific progress has not kept pace with new and rapidly evolving geospatial technologies. Consequently, new capabilities exist but numerous issues have not been adequately addressed. Therefore, this paper discusses conceptual foundations and illustrates how geomorphometry and mapping approaches can be used to produce geomorphological information related to the land surface and landforms, process rates, process–form relationships, and geomorphic systems.";"Bishop, Michael P.

Factors affecting their decision to use biological control programmes as a disease control strategy, were also investigated. Results indicate that educational level, age and land owner status reflect the farmer's decision making ability and the level of commitment to adopt the new technology. Generations of family farming and farm management systems that have adopted food safety management systems also had an influence on their willingness to explore biological control. Although most farmers were aware of biological control, most could not define it. Farmers did not blame biological control for the previous poor results, but rather on environmental factors and a lack of perseverance on their side with the use of the product. Land reform aims to redistribute 30 percent of the country's agricultural land from white commercial farmers to previously disadvantaged communities by 2014. Farmers on farms with completed or invalid land claims were more willing to utilise biological control than growers without claims or with land claims that are pending. Companies distributing and selling biocontrol products indicated that the lack of technical knowledge by sales personnel is one of the main problems experienced with marketing biocontrol products. Manufacturing companies also experienced difficulty with the registration of new products in South Africa.";"van Eeden, M.

To realise this potential requires investment in crops appropriate to climatic and agronomic conditions in developing countries. Protection of intellectual property rights is a necessary condition for the private sector to invest in appropriate biotechnologies. This paper develops a game theoretic model of a bioscience firm that adapts a new technology to a range of agronomic conditions in response to the enforcement of intellectual property rights in a developed and a developing country. Over a range of potential penalties, low levels of enforcement by the developing country remain endemic despite the desire to have the bioscience firm adapt the biotechnology to its local conditions. In particular, the trade penalties contained in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights are likely to be ineffective. The developing country might increase enforcement if the developed country was more aggressive in liberalising agriculture trade because there would be greater symmetry in the benefits of the technology.";"Gaisford, James D.

Protected areas may even encourage growth by providing economic benefits that attract migrants. Consequently, understanding the relationships between human demographics and biodiversity is important for conservation. We studied a community-governed Wildlife Management Area bordering the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, set up to benefit local people and the subsistence rural economy. Annual population growth in this area is 5%. We used a combination of ecological and socio-economic surveys to determine the causes of this growth and its effect on wildlife in the Wildlife Management Area. One-third of local people interviewed were immigrants to the area. Population growth appeared to be unrelated to the protected area; instead an increasing proportion of immigrants cited readily available land as their reason for moving. Pastoralism was associated with fewer signs of large grazing mammals and elephants Loxodonta africana and agriculture was associated with fewer signs of elephant and buffalo Syncerus caffer but more signs of other ungulates. Few residents were aware of the Wildlife Management Area and few received any benefits from wildlife and therefore had little reason to conserve it. This situation is attributable to poor management of the Wildlife Management Area. Detrimental effects of human activity could spread to the Selous Game Reserve if population growth continues. However, natural resources could benefit residents if properly managed. Interactions between human demographics and protected areas are complex and may be best managed on a case-by-case basis.";"Bamford, Andrew J.

"AGRIS:FR2014007309";"Landscape economics: the road ahead";"Economie du paysage : la feuille de route";"The aims of this paper are to delineate some important topics in landscape economics, and also to put landscape policy in the perspective of the sustainable development. The research issue is about the relationships between the development paths and landscape changes, paved with examples of consensus, controversies, and conflicts. Landscape is a polysemic term, many approaches and definitions exist for it, and as a consequence, economists should adopt or elaborate their own landscape definition or concept (the most suitable to their general methodology, and related to their most familiar concepts ). Landscape appears to be a local public good. That definition correspond to the property rights market failure arising from the co-visibility. Co-visibility makes it difficult in general to identify precisely the link between each owner action and the agregate landscape outcome. As a consequence, landscape ownership appears to be scattered into a multiplicity of actors of various nature (individual, communal, statal…). How to exploit that analogy with non point source pollution is a challenge for landscape economics research. Each actor has his own objective and management criteria, either for agricultural, forestry, industrial or residential activities. Moreover, there are multiple public policies aimed at sustaining each activity. Inevitably, public policies failures arise, and so the need for coordination actions aimed at landscape maintenance and preservation. Because the local public good nature of the landscape, it’s worth to look at the models of public good joint production. How to agregate actions from different land owners into a resulting landscape, or how to coordinate actions scattered among multiple landowners in order to get a specific desired outcome is a real challenge ? In some case, the responsability of changes is concentrated in the hand of few decision makers, in some others, the responsability is more diffuse, and the non point production function of the landscape could be approximated by an additive function. The issue of the agregation of actions is closely related to the one of preferences heterogeneity and agregation. Because a specific landscape project could be appreciated as beneficial or detrimental by different people, it’s necessary to separate the stage of evaluation, the stage of decision making and the stage of implementation. Issues of coordination of actions arising at the implementation stage should take for granted the landscape objectives and the social value of the project. Eventually, the design of Institutional arrangements to manage landscape should take onto account his nature of common pool resource. The paper is organized so as to take stock from the contributions of the research community in Landscape economics, and also to signal some missing links and promising paths. Naturally, our paper does not exhaust all the topics, we will concentrate on three topics : preferences definition and evaluation, joint production, and governance.";"Lifran , Robert

"AGRIS:US201600186272";"Incorporating Risk of Reinvasion to Prioritize Sites for Invasive Species Management";"";"The relationship between landscape pattern and the distribution and spread of exotic species is an important determinant of where and when management actions are best applied. We have developed an interdisciplinary approach for prioritizing treatment of harmful, nonnative, invasive plants in National Park landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic USA. The approach relies upon a detailed model of reinvasion risk that combines information on: (1) global factors representing park-level infestation from seed and sprout, (2) landscape factors including disturbance-based spread vectors and neighborhood seed density, and (3) local factors determining establishment probability based on habitat suitability. Global seed rain estimates are derived empirically from park inventory data and modified by information on species reproductive strategies. Landscape-level propagule pressure is modeled spatially using species life history characteristics including dispersal attributes, connectivity to nearby plant populations, and increased propagule pressure through disturbance. The local-scale habitat suitability model uses a Mahalanobis distance approach, parameterized from plant inventory plot data and GIS-based data on plot wetness, land cover, slope, radiation, and soil characteristics. We illustrate the model for Ailanthus altissima (tree-of-heaven) in Antietam National Battlefield Park. The results of the A. altissima modeling highlight regions of the park where eradication would be most prudent and feasible based on current infestation patterns and landscape heterogeneity. Although the success of different treatment modalities is often considered in invasive species management, a spatially explicit assessment of likely treatment success is rarely undertaken. Our approach provides a valuable tool to assist natural resource practitioners to prioritize management options in confronting biological invasions.";"Lookingbill, Todd R.

Mwanza had significantly higher ammonia concentration compared to Kayenze and Magu. At the shoreline stations, significantly higher nitrate concentration was observed at Mwanza compared to Kayenze and Magu. Similarly, Mwanza had significantly higher concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorous in the shoreline stations compared to Magu and Kayenze, but not in the open waters stations. Shoreline stations also showed significant differences in phytoplankton diversity among sites. The shoreline station at Mwanza also showed significantly higher levels of Chl. a compared to those at Magu and Kayenze. However, in the open water stations Chl. a concentrations did not differ significantly among sites. The results suggested that urban pollution in Mwanza and agricultural activities in River Simiyu catchment strongly influence the limnology of Lake Victoria and that the nearshore waters, which are the receiving points, were highly impacted compared to the waters outside bays. Thus, proper urban waste management and sustainable land management practices are critical for reducing point and non-point sources of pollution into Lake Victoria.";"Shayo, Salome D.

Grazing effects, however, are likely to vary among different response variables, types, and intensity of grazing, and across abiotic conditions. We aimed to examine how grazing affects ecosystem structure, function, and composition. We compiled a database of 7615 records reporting an effect of grazing by sheep and cattle on 278 biotic and abiotic response variables for published studies across Australia. Using these data, we derived three ecosystem measures based on structure, function, and composition, which were compared against six contrasts of grazing pressure, ranging from low to heavy, two different herbivores (sheep, cattle), and across three different climatic zones. Grazing reduced structure (by 35%), function (24%), and composition (10%). Structure and function (but not composition) declined more when grazed by sheep and cattle together than sheep alone. Grazing reduced plant biomass (40%), animal richness (15%), and plant and animal abundance, and plant and litter cover (25%), but had no effect on plant richness nor soil function. The negative effects of grazing on plant biomass, plant cover, and soil function were more pronounced in drier environments. Grazing effects on plant and animal richness and composition were constant, or even declined, with increasing aridity. Our study represents a comprehensive continental assessment of the implications of grazing for managing Australian rangelands. Grazing effects were largely negative, even at very low levels of grazing. Overall, our results suggest that livestock grazing in Australia is unlikely to produce positive outcomes for ecosystem structure, function, and composition or even as a blanket conservation tool unless reduction in specific response variables is an explicit management objective.";"Eldridge, David J.

To evaluate the model’s predictions, it was used to replicate, with great accuracy, a time series of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in a controlled experiment where a fabricated cylindrical cavity was exposed to combustion products. The time constant for cavity filling is proportional to the ratio of cavity volume to entrance area. Hot gases lead to significant stratification within the cavity during exposures. To demonstrate the model’s potential use in predicting faunal exposures in the context of land management, we show that the model can be used to estimate dosage within red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis Vieillot, 1809) cavities without requiring temporally detailed, local measurements of wind speed and combustion product concentrations.";"Bova, A.S.

"AGRIS:US2016216834";"Land Dispute Resolution in Mozambique: institutions and evidence of agroforestry technology adoption";"";"Successful adoption of natural resource management technologies requires thatimportant fundamentals of property rights be established. Because disputes over propertyrights occur universally, the ability to successfully defend one’s rights to property exercises acentral influence on the tenure security necessary for technology adoption. However,defending rights to property rests upon the possession of evidence that is readily available andwidely regarded as legitimate. This paper presents work carried out in postwar Mozambiqueon the availability and legitimacy of evidence pertaining to land tenure dispute resolution.What is unusual about the Mozambique case is that the physical presence of a natural resourcemanagement technology—agroforestry trees in this case—also serves as one of the mostwidely available and legitimate forms of evidence in the postwar period. Such an arrangementreveals important aspects about the reverse relationship between property rights andtechnology adoption. While such an evidence role for a technology may at first appear toencourage further adoption of agroforestry, important influences on property rights in thepostwar setting serve to discourage full adoption and jeopardize the long-term presence ofexisting agroforestry trees. It remains to be seen if recent legislative changes regardingproperty rights will successfully engage customary forms of evidence and encourage fulladoption of agroforestry in Mozambique.";"Unruh, Jon D.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2001-02-31";"en";"";"";"";"MOZ";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016216834";"http://purl.umn.edu/50052";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201600180301";"Interaction of drought and 5-aminolevulinic acid on growth and drought resistance of Leymus chinensis seedlings";"";"Leymus chinensis is a dominant grass species in the Inner Mongolia steppes owing to its high vegetative productivity, good palatability for cattle, and abundant horizontally creeping rhizomes. Drought is generally regarded as one of the main environmental issues that is becoming a daunting challenge to the growth of plants, and ultimately results in land degradation. Drought stress influences plant growth and development by modulating physiological and biochemical events; however, some growth substances such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) show potential to ameliorate the damaging effects of drought. The objective of this study was to evaluate the response and mechanism of L. chinensis seedlings under drought stress, the effects of 5-ALA application, and the interaction of drought stress and 5-ALA application. Healthy and uniform-size seeds of L. chinensis were collected in a natural community of the Ecological Experimental Station in the Xilingole grassland. A potting experiment was carried out to determine the influence of exogenously applied 5-ALA at various concentrations (10mg/L, 50mg/L, and 100mg/L) under different soil water regimes (50% and 80% soil relative water content) on the morphological and physiological attributes of L. chinensis plants from June to November 2014. The seeds were grown in a biochemical incubator, and then the seedlings were transferred to pots. Water and Hoagland nutrient solution was applied to ensure an adequate nutrient supply at 5-day intervals. When seedlings attained a height of 18â21cm, 5-ALA was applied at different concentrations. Water spray was applied to L. chinensis plants as a control treatment. A second and third spray of 5-ALA was applied at 1-day intervals to exploit the full potential of 5-ALA application. Simultaneously, drought stress treatment was imposed using 50% soil relative water content; 80% soil relative water content was treated as the control. Therefore, there were eight treatments with three replications established in a random complete block design. The sampling for morphological, physiological, and biochemical attributes was conducted after 15days of drought stress, respectively. The results showed that 5-ALA could promote the growth of L. chinensis seedlings, including plant height, leaf area, plant water content, biomass, root activity, and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid), under a soil relative water content of 80%. Among all concentrations, 10mg/L 5-ALA proved to have the best effect on growth. Drought stress (50% soil relative water content) hampered plant growth. However, treatments of 5-ALA ameliorated the damaging effect of drought stress on seedlings, and improved the morphological index, biomass, plant water content, root activity, photosynthetic pigments, osmotic adjustments, and antioxidase activities viz. peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and ascorbate (APX), but reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrical conductivity. Among all concentrations, 50mg/L 5-ALA proved to have the best effect under drought stress. In summary, 5-ALA application improved the performance of L. chinensis by modulating growth and other morphological and physiological traits. However, the effect of 5-ALA on L. chinensis was concentration-dependent. Furthermore, significant interactions between drought stress and 5âALA treatment (at a given spraying concentration) were observed with respect to leaf area, leaf width, fresh weight, root activity, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, MDA, proline, soluble protein, SOD, APX, and GR.";"Liu, Meiru

"AGRIS:US201400019612";"Spatial dependence of predictions from image segmentation: A variogram-based method to determine appropriate scales for producing land-management information";"";"A significant challenge in ecological studies has been defining scales of observation that correspond to the relevant ecological scales for organisms or processes of interest. Remote sensing has become commonplace in ecological studies and management, but the default resolution of imagery often used in studies is an arbitrary scale of observation. Segmentation of images into objects has been proposed as an alternative method for scaling remotely-sensed data into units having ecological meaning. However, to date, the selection of image object sets to represent landscape patterns has been largely subjective. Changes in observation scale affect the variance and spatial dependence of measured variables, and may be useful in determining which levels of image segmentation are most appropriate for a given purpose. We used observations of percent bare ground cover from 346 field sites in a semi-arid shrub-steppe ecosystem of southern Idaho to look at the changes in spatial dependence of regression predictions and residuals for 10 different levels of image segmentation. We found that the segmentation level whose regression predictions had spatial dependence that most closely matched the spatial dependence of the field samples also had the strongest predicted-to-observed correlations. This suggested that for percent bare ground cover in our study area an appropriate scale could be defined. With the incorporation of a geostatistical interpolator to predict the value of regression residuals at unsampled locations, however, we achieved consistently strong correlations across many segmentation levels. This suggests that if spatial dependence in percent bare ground is accounted for, a range of appropriate scales could be defined. Because the best analysis scale may vary for different ecosystem attributes and many inquiries consider more than one attribute, methods that can perform well across a range of scales and perhaps not at a single, ideal scale are important. More work is needed to develop methods that consider a wider range of ways to segment images into different scales and select sets of scales that perform best for answering specific management questions. The robustness of ecological landscape analyses will increase as methods are devised that remove the subjectivity with which observational scales are defined and selected.";"Karl, Jason W.

Feature extracted data acquired from remotely sensed imagery can help managers rapidly and accurately assess this land cover change in order to manage rangeland ecosystems at a landscape-scale. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop an effective and efficient method for accurately quantifying P-J tree canopy cover and density directly from high resolution photographs and (2) compare feature-extracted data to typical in-situ datasets used by land managers. Tree cover was extracted from aerial-photography using Feature Analyst®. Tree density was calculated as the sum of the total number of individual polygons (trees) within the tree cover output file after isolation using a negative buffer post-processing technique. Feature-extracted data were compared to ground reference measurements from Utah's Division of Wildlife Resources Range Trend Project (DWR-RTP). We found that the proposed feature-extraction techniques used for measuring cover and density were highly correlated to ground reference and DWR-RTP datasets. Feature-extracted measurements of cover generally showed a near 1:1 relationship to these data, while tree density was underestimated; however, after calibration for juvenile trees, a near 1:1 relationship was realized. Feature-extraction techniques used in this study provide an efficient method for assessing important rangeland indicators, including: density, cover, and extent of P-J tree encroachment. Correlations found between field and feature-extracted data provide evidence to support extrapolation between the two approaches when assessing woodland encroachment.";"Madsen, Matthew D.

In Costa Rica a national scheme of Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) rewards landowners for the services provided by different forest land-uses. We evaluated the impacts of reforestation under the PSA on local development in the North of the country. We applied a fuzzy multi-criteria analysis including socioeconomic, institutional, and cultural dimensions and based on the individual perceptions of landowners. The impacts of the PSA applied to reforestation are positive; negative economic impacts are balanced by positive institutional and cultural impacts. In most dimensions, the impacts on the poorest landowners are notably positive and generally higher than for upper class landowners. However, the short-term incomes of the poorest landowners decrease as a consequence of reforestation. This problem may engender negative outcomes and reduce the participation of the poorest landowners in the PSA.

We assessed badger multi-scale resource selection and space use in intensive agricultural areas in Illinois and Ohio. We predicted that badgers would select for pasture and prairie, and higher elevations, and riparian areas because these habitats likely favor burrowing and foraging. Conversely, badgers should avoid cropland, roads, and forest at both spatial scales because these habitats may limit burrowing and foraging and potentially increase mortality risk. We also predicted annual male space use would increase with age and be greater than females because of age-related dominance and polygynous mating. We used radiolocations from 18 (11 females, seven males) and five (two females, three males) badgers in Illinois and Ohio, respectively, to estimate space use and multi-spatial scale resource selection. Within study areas, badgers strongly selected for cropland and higher elevations, and a lesser extent upland forest and pasture, but avoided roads and riparian areas. Landcover selection within home ranges varied by study area, but generally, badgers strongly selected for pasture, cropland, prairie, or higher elevation. Median annual 95% fixed kernel areas of Illinois badgers were greater (W₈ = 16.00, P = 0.007) for males than females, and most males appeared to overlap two to three females during the breeding season. We suggest, although our study areas were highly fragmented agricultural landscapes, badgers appeared to select land cover types similar to native prairie, which provided burrowing and foraging opportunities. However, because prairie and pasture were relatively limited, badgers used expansive (x̄ = 20.0 ± 34.4 km²) home ranges to meet life requirements. Therefore, degradation and fragmentation of limiting resources may limit badger population growth in our study areas and should be considered for future management.";"Duquette, Jared F.

To improve our understanding of the role of soil water repellency in causing fire-induced land degradation, a long-term monitoring study was performed in which the temporal variation of topsoil water repellency (0–2.5-cm depth) was captured in a Portuguese shrubland before and after fire between November 2007 and March 2010. In addition, similarities and dissimilarities between changes following burning and clipping were assessed in a plot experiment. Soil water repellency appeared to be the rule rather than the exception, both before and after fire, and was strongly related to soil moisture and organic matter content. Surprisingly, despite the low soil temperatures during the fire (60°C) and the lack of direct soil moisture changes, fire significantly increased the persistence of soil water repellency (the water drop penetration time). Vegetation removal by burning and clipping played a key role in determining post-fire water repellency in litter and at the soil surface and considerably reduced the time needed to both develop and eliminate water repellency of the litter and surface soil. Where pre-fire (or “natural”) soil water repellency is abundant, an increase in erosion after fire cannot be solely caused by soil water repellency. Nevertheless, fire-induced removal of the protective canopy cover may increase the hydrologic significance of soil water repellency in burned landscapes.";"Stoof, Cathelijne R.

An important aspect of REDD implementation is the baseline against which reductions are measured. The baseline estimates the business-as-usual emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. We solve a dynamic model of land conversion from forest to agriculture in the presence of REDD, and assess the performance of four baselines. We show that none of the analysed baselines dominates in all performance aspects, and that the final baseline choice needs to maximise the trade-off between the effectiveness to reduce deforestation, cost-efficiency, and changes in income. The frequently used historical average baseline could be improved by using a forward-looking one, which is shown to better account for the opportunity costs faced by landowners. This result hinges on the ability of the baseline to predict deforestation rates without significant underestimations. We advocate the switch from a single-threshold baseline to a corridor methodology, which would provide continued incentives to reduce deforestation, even during periods of high opportunity costs. We finally show how the selection of certain baseline attributes, such as corridor bandwidth and symmetry, can enhance performance.";"Pana, Anca Claudia

In Australia, this type of salinity is most pronounced in the valley of the River Murray in South Australia. Location of irrigation enterprises has been identified as a key factor that needs to be taken into account by policies aimed at mitigating salinity. This article compares and contrasts two such policies: an irrigation zoning policy, where new irrigation enterprises are only allowed in low salinity impact zones, and an offsetting with salinity credits policy, where new irrigation enterprises can locate in high salinity impact zones, provided they offset their salinity impact with salinity credits. Key findings are that the offsetting policy will be both less costly and more effective in reducing salinity than a standalone irrigation zoning policy. This is due to the presence of incentives for choosing ""optimal"" location of irrigation enterprises when costs of salinity credits are taken into account.";"Spencer, Thomas

In such highly fragmented landscapes, agroforests have already been recognized as refuges for biodiversity but few studies have investigated the potential of non-forested land-use types to contribute to overall biodiversity of functionally important taxa in the tropics. This study experimentally investigated species richness, abundance, and community similarity of arthropods on Yellow Passion fruit plants, planted in standardized patches in 30 sites along a land-use intensity gradient. The gradient comprised all major land-use types of the area: forest fragments, abandoned coffee agroforests, coffee agroforests managed under shade trees, pastures, and rice fields in Coastal Ecuador. We found a total of 2123 individuals belonging to 242 species. Overall arthropod species richness increased with light intensity and leaf-surface area and decreased with land-use intensity: forest fragments and abandoned coffee agroforests harboured significantly more species than rice or pastures. Overall diversity in managed coffee agroforests was intermediate between the intensively managed and more natural habitats. However, the three most abundant taxa of arthropods (ants, spiders, and beetles) had the highest number of species in managed coffee agroforests, while ant abundance was highest in abandoned coffee agroforests and spider abundance highest in managed coffee agroforests. Analyses of community similarity revealed that open (pasture, and rice) and shaded (forest, abandoned and managed coffee agroforests) land-use types had distinct arthropod communities. In conclusion, although open agricultural land-use types tend to have fewer species in lower numbers, all land-use types contribute to overall biodiversity of the agricultural matrix because of distinct communities in shaded vs. non-shaded land-use types.";"Teodoro, Adenir V.

The study was based on a survey of representative farm households with and without access to irrigation. The total sample size for the study was 222 (107 households with access to irrigation and 115 without). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, the Foster, Greer and Thobeck poverty indices, and Heckman's selectivity model. Results indicate that the incidence, depth, and severity of poverty are significantly lower among those farm households with access to irrigation. In addition to irrigation, other variables such as farm size, livestock holding size, land productivity, and family size significantly influence the level of household consumption expenditure. However, the proportion of poor people in the overall sample, notwithstanding access to irrigation, is alarmingly high, indicating the deep-rooted and critical situation of poverty in rural Ethiopia.

The scheme of experiment: 1) moldboard tillage to the depth of 20-22 cm (control); 2) moldboard tillage to the depth of 20-22 cm + 10 t/ha of phosphogypsum (10 t/ha +PG); 3) moldboard tillage to the depth of 20-22 cm + 40 t/ha of phosphogypsum (40 t/ha PG); 4) imitation of soil milling to the depth of 20-40 cm + 10 t/ha of phosphogypsum (ISM + 10 t/ha PG). In the first year after applying phosphogypsum at a dose of 40 t/ha, soil density decreased in a layer 0-20 cm by 9.0%, in 2012 - by 10.3%. Results of applying 10 t/ha phosphorgypsum had intermediate position between the results of control variant and the variant with applying 40 t/ha phosphogypsum. Decreasing of soil density was also marked in a soil layer 20-40 cm but for less extent. In the variant of imitation of soil milling, positive results were obtained in the whole soil layer 0-40 cm preserving the obtained result for a long period. Soil layers 0-20 and 20-40 cm in this variant had uniform density which average values in 2012 equaled to 1.27 and 1.29 t/m3 respectively. Phosphogypsum application facilitated to silt content reduction and improving the structure of soil horizons. The imitation of soil milling showed the best results. Soil got homogeneous crumbly structure, which preserved during the whole period of the research. In a soil layer 0-20 cm the content of humus increased by 5.4-6.3% in the variants with surface application of phosphogypsum against control. The variant ISM + 10 t/ha PG showed the best results: the content of humus increased by 7.2% comparing to control variant.

Цель работы - изучение влияния применения в качестве химического мелиоранта фосфогипса в различных дозах на физические и физико-химические свойства орошаемых темно-каштановых почв рисовых оросительных систем при постоянном затоплении. Схема опыта: 1) отвальная обработка почвы на глубину 20-22 см (контроль); 2) отвальная обработка почвы на глубину 20-22 см + 10 т/га фосфогипса (10 т/га Ф); 3) отвальная обработка почвы на глубину 20-22 см + 40 т/га фосфогипса (40 т/га Ф); 4) имитация фрезерной обработки почвы на глубину 20-40 см + 10 т/га фосфогипса (ИФО + 10 т/га Ф). Внесение фосфогипса в дозе 40 т/га привело к снижению плотности почвы в слое 0-20 см в первый год последействия на 9,0%, в 2012 году - на 10,3%. Результаты внесения 10 т/га фосфогипса занимали промежуточное положение между результатами в контрольном варианте и варианте с внесением 40 т/га фосфогипса. В слое почвы 20-40 см также отмечено снижение плотности, но в меньшей степени. В варианте имитации фрезерной обработки почвы получены положительные результаты по всему слою 0-40 см с долговременным сохранением полученного результата. Слои почвы 0-20 и 20-40 см в данном варианте имели равномерную плотность, в среднем за 2012 год равную соответственно 1,27 и 1,29 т/м3. Внесение фосфогипса способствовало уменьшению содержания пылеватых частиц и оструктуриванию почвенных горизонтов. Вариант имитации фрезерной обработки показал наилучшие результаты. Почва приобрела гомогенную мелкокомковатую структуру, которая сохранилась на протяжении всего периода исследований. В вариантах с поверхностным внесением фосфогипса наблюдалось увеличение содержания гумуса в слое 0-20 см на 5,4-6,3% в сравнении с контролем. Вариант ИФО + 10 т/га Ф показал наилучшие результаты: содержание гумуса увеличилось на 7,2% в сравнении с контрольным вариантом.";"Radevich, E.V.

"AGRIS:US201600055147";"Grazing intensity is a poor indicator of waterborne Escherichia coli O157 activity";"";"Contamination of watercourses with fecal matter represents a significant risk to public health due to the associated risk from human pathogens (e.g. Escherichia coli O157, norovirus). In addition, water contamination may also perpetuate the re-infection cycle of human pathogens within domesticated and wild animal populations. While diffuse pollution from agricultural fields has been identified as a major source of these pathogens, the relationship between livestock grazing intensity and subsequent pathogen persistence in water is not well established. Our aim was to critically evaluate the importance of land use management on the activity of E. coli O157 in freshwaters collected from a livestock dominated catchment in the UK. We inoculated replicate batches of both filter-sterilised and non-sterile freshwaters with a chromosomally lux-marked E. coli O157 and monitored pathogen survival and activity over a 5 d period. Our results indicate that the greatest risk for pathogens entering freshwater is probably associated with high intensity livestock areas, although their subsequent survival is greatest in waters from low intensity livestock areas. We ascribe this enhanced persistence in the latter to reduced competition and predation within these aquatic environments. These results have serious implications for the reliability of pathogen risk exposure maps which are based on grazing intensity alone.";"Thorn, C.E.

"AGRIS:US201400163525";"Spatially constrained forest cover dynamics using Markovian random processes";"";"Essential to analyses of forest-cover change is application of geospatial empirical or semi-empirical models of transition potentials based on the likelihood that forest land would change to non-forested land or vice versa depending on prevailing conditions of land-use change. Modeling land-cover as a function of land-use aids in understanding pertinent land-cover dynamics. This can enable forecasting of ramifications of current conversion processes on land designated for agriculture or development. National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) grid data published by USDA for years 1997–2002 were used as preliminary inputs. Two prevalent transition probabilities were derived: probability of a pixel changing (a) from forested to non-forested, Pfₙf and (b) from non-forested to forested, Pₙff. These probabilities were determined for the years (i) 1999–2000, (ii) 2000–2001, (iii) 1999–2001, and (iv) 1999–2009 using decade stratification. The maximal transition probability ranges for forest to non-forest transition were higher for 1999–2000 and 1999–2001 transiting periods compared to 2000–2001. The maximal transition probability ranges for non-forest to forest transition were lower for 1999–2000 transiting period compared to 2000–2001, and 1999–2001 transiting periods. The analysis provided a glimpse on areas deemed prone to forest conversion and those that would immensely benefit from federally funded programs.";"Oduor, Peter G.

This linkage is possible because both studies share land-use and land-cover data. Landsat Thematic Mapper data are utilized to detect urban land-cover changes. GIS analyses are then conducted to examine the changing spatial patterns of urban growth. The integration of remote sensing and GIS is applied to automate the estimation of surface runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service model. Impacts of urban growth on surface runoff and the rainfall–runoff relationship are examined by linking the two modeling results with spatial analysis techniques. This methodology is applied to the Zhujiang Delta of southern China, where dramatic urban growth has occurred over the past two decades, and the rampant urban growth has created severe problems in water resources management. The results revealed a notably uneven spatial pattern of urban growth and an increase of 8.10 mm in annual runoff depth during the 1989–1997 period. An area that experienced more urban growth had a greater potential for increasing annual surface runoff. Highly urbanized areas were more prone to flooding. Urbanization lowered potential maximum storage, and thus increased runoff coefficient values.";"WENG, QIHAO";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"en";"urbanization;land cover;land use;water management";"Urban Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400057336";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002670010258";"";"";"";"737-748"
"AGRIS:US201400057443";"Modelling atmospheric and hydrologic processes for assessment of meadow restoration impact on flow and sediment in a sparsely gauged California watershed";"";"The restoration of meadowland using the pond and plug technique of gully elimination was performed in a 9‐mile segment along Last Chance Creek, Feather River Basin, California, in order to rehabilitate floodplain functions such as mitigating floods, retaining groundwater, and reducing sediment yield associated with bank erosion and to significantly alter the hydrologic regime. However, because the atmospheric and hydrological conditions have evolved over the restoration period, it was difficult to obtain a comprehensible evaluation of the impact of restoration activities by means of field measurements. In this paper, a new use of physically based models for environmental assessment is described. The atmospheric conditions over the sparsely gauged Last Chance Creek watershed (which does not have any precipitation or weather stations) during the combined historical critical dry and wet period (1982–1993) were reconstructed over the whole watershed using the atmospheric fifth‐generation mesoscale model driven with the US National Center for Atmospheric Research and US National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data. Using the downscaled atmospheric data as its input, the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model was applied to this watershed. All physical parameters of the WEHY model were derived from the existing geographic information system and satellite‐driven data sets. By comparing the prerestoration and postrestoration simulation results under the identical atmospheric conditions, a more complete environmental assessment of the restoration project was made. Model results indicate that the flood peak may be reduced by 10–20% during the wet year and the baseflow may be enhanced by 10–20% during the following dry seasons (summer to fall) in the postrestoration condition. The model results also showed that the hydrologic impact of the land management associated with the restoration mitigates bank erosion and sediment discharge during winter storm events.

Birds, in particular, rely heavily on vocal communication and have recently been shown to change the structure of their signals in response to environmental noise. Our objective was to determine the impact of traffic noise on Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) song structure and song timing. We recorded bird songs using a directional microphone and installed permanent recording devices to monitor daily song patterns at both high traffic noise sites and low traffic noise sites throughout southern Ontario, Canada. Our results indicate that at sites with high traffic noise, Red-winged Blackbirds sing songs with fewer introductory syllables, which are an important component of individual recognition and repertoire formation. In addition, the typical diurnal singing pattern of birds associated with noisy urban sites is more homogeneous than that of birds associated with quiet rural marshes. In the early morning and evening, singing effort was higher at rural sites than at urban sites, while in the midday singing effort at urban sites was higher than at rural sites. Birds at our noisy urban sites appear to be avoiding acoustic masking by increasing song production during the quiet part of the day and decreasing song production during the noisy rush hour periods. Based on our results, urban noise is impacting communication structure and the daily pattern of song production in a marsh-nesting species. These results have important implications for avian conservation and land use planning for urban development.";"Cartwright, Lyndsay A.

This study identifies potential Aquatic Warbler habitats within that area and gives an estimate of the size of the local wintering population. A land-cover map was generated by classifying high-resolution satellite images. Overlaying it with presence–absence data from field surveys and using logistic regression models (GLMM), we derived the presence probability of the Aquatic Warbler in the study area. Using presence probability as a proxy of habitat suitability we identified 4 729 ha of potential habitat. We calculated the population density of the Aquatic Warbler by applying a Poisson mixed model to our land-cover raster data and estimate a total population size of 776 individuals (range 260–4 057), i.e. 0.37–19.8% of the world population. However, this estimate is complicated by uncertainties including the unknown efficiency of the bird-catching method, clumped presence of individuals, the variability of water levels and other seasonal changes. An effective management of Aquatic Warbler habitats in the Djoudj area should include extensive grazing, the control of litter accumulation and shrub growth, and the removal of plant material from the channels to improve water circulation.";"Tegetmeyer, Cosima

"AGRIS:US201400148731";"Songbird Relationships to Shrub‐Steppe Ecological Site Characteristics";"";"Rangeland managers are often faced with the complex challenge of managing sites for multiple uses and for the diverse interests of stakeholders. Standardized monitoring methods that can be used and understood by different agencies and stakeholders would aid management for long‐term sustainability of rangelands. In the United States, federal land management agencies have recently based their assessments of rangeland health and integrity on state‐and‐transition models to consider management trajectories. Ecological sites provide a foundation for these efforts but have not been used to address wildlife habitat. Habitat preferences are documented for North American shrub‐steppe songbirds but have yet to be related to ecological sites and site characteristics. We characterized ecological sites at Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado, using established rangeland monitoring methods to test whether 1) songbird species density and diversity differ among adjacent shrub‐steppe ecological sites and 2) quantifiable ecological site characteristics could be identified that account for significant variation in songbird density and diversity. Vegetation structure (represented as basal and canopy gaps, cover, height, and shrub density) differentiated the four ecological sites and was related to songbird density and diversity. Sage sparrows (Amphispiza belli) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineu) selected habitat based on horizontal characteristics of vegetation structure, such as basal and canopy gap and plant species cover. Brewer's sparrow (Spizella breweri), lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), and songbird diversity were more strongly related to vegetation structure of the plant communities than to plant composition. Our results support use of ecological sites as management units to characterize songbird habitat given that songbird density and diversity were related to site vegetation characteristics. By incorporating basal and canopy gap, height, plant cover, and shrub density monitoring methods into ecological site descriptions, managers would be provided with additional tools to assist in differentiating songbird habitat.";"Williams, Mary I.

"AGRIS:US201600126813";"Multitemporal Monitoring of Land Degradation Risk Due to Soil Loss in a Fire-Prone Mediterranean Landscape Using Multi-decadal Landsat Imagery";"";"Natural, as well as human-induced, landscape changes may have profound effects on soil-loss rates in Mediterranean countries. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of the erosion processes from 1984 to 2013 across the fire-prone island of Thassos was gained on the basis of a joint analysis of imagery received from three generations of Landsat satellites. Soil loss was modeled using the revised universal soil loss equation. With the exception of the crop management factor, which was estimated through the NDVI image series, rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, and topographic factor, were compiled within a GIS environment and used for the production of the spatio-temporal erosion maps. We found some constant patterns regarding the spatial distribution of soil susceptibility to erosion, similar to the findings of plot scale studies in the Mediterranean, as well as major changes related to the temporal intensity of the process. With regard to the aspect, we found that the most erosion-prone areas diachronically were the south-facing slopes. The highest altitudinal zone was most at soil-loss risk, but this elevation zone occupies the smallest spatial extent compared to the others. We observed a major increase for all the elevation and aspect zones, as well for every watershed of the island, during 1984–1991, when Thassos experienced some catastrophic fires. Between 1984 and 2013, all but one the watersheds of the island experienced a severe increase in soil erosion, suggesting the need for prevention measures and restoration plans that specifically target the areas most vulnerable to degradation. Quantification of the soil loss over large areas and large time extents, can contribute to an understanding of the process, highlight drivers of change and assist in the implementation of erosion control measures and decision making.";"Mallinis, Giorgos

"AGRIS:US2012205616";"POSTPRODUCTIVISM AND RURAL LAND VALUES";"";"There are a multitude of interdisciplinary values that people derive from rural land.  Productivism focuses on the commodity values of rural land, such as the use of land as a commercial input into agricultural production, timber harvesting and mineral extraction.  Productivistic uses and values of rural land have been the traditional focus of rural land policy and management in the United States.  Many rural areas in the United States are moving into a postproductivism era.  Postproductivism focuses on both commodity and amenity values of rural land.  Amenity values of rural land include recreational, aesthetic and ecological service values.  When a rural area moves from productivism to postproductivism, value conflicts may arise between individuals and groups who have different preferences with respect to commodity and amenity values.  Traditional rural institutions may not be set up to effectively handle such conflicts.  There is a need to explore what types of institutions may be most effective in resolving rural land use problems related to the different and often competing values people place on rural land and landscapes.";"Bergstrom, John C.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"USA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012205616";"http://purl.umn.edu/16689";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201301581421";"Profitable Swedish lamb production by economies of scale";"";"Economic sustainability assumes profitability (revenues>=costs including annual cash expenses as well as family labor and investments). Calculations suggest that sheep flocks of more than 500 ewes can be profitable under Swedish conditions whereas smaller flocks are unprofitable unless they are managed by cheap existing resources including buildings, fences, machinery and family labor with low or no opportunity costs. Despite these economies of scale less than 1% of the Swedish sheep flocks have 500 or more ewes. Possible reasons are, according to interviews with lamb producers which have built up for Swedish conditions large sheep flocks of 90-900 ewes (average 380), growth sacrifices when developing large flocks and lack of accessible cheap land for providing large flocks with pasture and winter forage. The growth sacrifices reducing revenues or increasing costs during or immediately after the growth period include low production of primiparous ewes, reclamation of additional land and capital costs of new buildings before the flock has been expanded to the intended number. The cash-flow is another problem for expanding sheep operations. Profitable lamb production presupposes large areas of land with zero or low opportunity costs. In fertile flatlands the opportunity costs are too high and in forest-dominated regions it is difficult to get hold of large enough areas near the farm centre for pasture and winter feed production. The latter problem can be solved by leasing cheap land further away and transporting feed and grazing animals, and by extending present pastures by incorporating adjacent overgrown pastures, marginal arable land and forest land. Another requirement for long-term profitable lamb production is to reduce the costs of new sheep sheds below what is a common cost level in Sweden.";"Kumm, Karl-Ivar";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"farmers";"";"";"SWE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301581421";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2008.11.006";"";"";"";"63-69"

The pastoral zone of NSW is characterised by wide variations in climatic conditions, soil type and vegetation species. Hence representative faming system analysis was conducted for three sub-regions - the Upper Darling, the Murray-Darling and Far West. The regions were defined and described in terms of their resources, climate and the nature of agriculture. The main enterprises that farmers choose between were described and whole farm budgets and statements of assets and liabilities for the representative farms were developed. The representative farm models were used to compare traditional Merino based sheep enterprises with alternative sheep enterprises where meat was an important source of income. We found that the farming systems that have evolved in these areas are well suited to their respective environments and that the economic incentives to switch to more meat focussed sheep enterprises were not strong.";"Khairo, Salahadin A.

The “Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)” method, commonly used in land use suitability analysis, was utilized in this study. In application, the parameters of great soil group, land use capability class, land use capability sub-class, soil depth, slope, aspect, elevation, erosion degree and other soil properties were used. In determining the weights of the parameters, experts’ opinions were consulted, and the agricultural land suitability map generated was divided into 5 categories according to the land suitability classification of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). After deducting the forests, pastures and reservoir areas from the reclassified suitability map, it was estimated that 0.08% of the study area (177.87ha) is highly suitable for agricultural production, while 1.55% (3578.33ha) is moderately suitable and 6.3% (14575.91ha) is marginally suitable for agricultural production. In addition, it was found that the proportion of land that is currently unsuitable for agricultural production is 2.24% (5183.63ha), while the amount of land that is permanently unsuitable is 3.42% (7923.39ha). It was also determined that the following facts were all effective factors in reaching these results: a substantial portion (approximately 85%) of the study area is covered with forests and pastures, the soil depth is inadequate for agricultural production, the slope in the study area is quite high and, accordingly, the erosion degree is high.";"Akıncı, Halil

The question may be answered by using the method of multifunctional rural resource analysis (NAGY, 2007). Thepaper is investigating the potential for Hungarian grasslands by using this methodology. It is concluded that our grasslands, as land usesystems in their present conditions can participate in integrated rural development in the most balanced way compared to other land usesystems in the county.

The formula is adjusted annually using indices of private land grazing lease rates (Forage Value Index, FVI), prices received for beef cattle (Beef Cattle Price Index, BCPI), and costs of beef production (Prices Paid Index, PPI). The FVI tracks price movement in the private forage market and was the only index originally proposed to be included in the fee formula. Public land ranchers and an Interdepartmental Grazing Fee Technical Committee assigned to study grazing fee alternatives in the 1960s questioned the ability of the FVI to account for short-term demand, supply, and price equilibrium, and, for this reason, the BCPI and PPI were added to the fee formula. Over 30 years of data are now available to evaluate whether adding the BCPI and PPI did, in fact, help explain short-term market fluctuations. This analysis shows, as earlier studies did, that, if tracking the private forage market is the primary objective, then the fee formula should have included only the FVI. Including the BCPI and, especially, the PPI has caused calculated grazing fees to fall further and further behind private land lease rates. Had the $1.23 base fee in the PRIA formula been indexed by only the FVI, the federal grazing fee would have been $3.84/AUM instead of $1.35/AUM in 2000. It is time to consider the feasibility of a competitive bid system for public lands, or, at the very least, adopt a new fee formula that generates more equitable grazing fees.";"Torell, L. Allen

Yet, these alternatives to conventional subdivisions rarely are used. We used logistic regression models to identify variables that predict county level success at adopting an ordinance and having a conservation subdivision built. Important predictors for adopting ordinances were median income, percent urban population, and a negative interaction between the two variables; important predictors for successfully completing a conservation subdivision were the adoption of an ordinance allowing conservation subdivisions and percent of residents with at least a four year college degree. Urban counties and the rural counties with higher median income were most successful adopting ordinances. Urban counties with higher education levels and an ordinance in place were most likely to have a conservation subdivision built within them. In poor rural counties, implementation may be more difficult because of limited resources to develop ordinances; these counties could collaborate with land trusts, other planning departments, or a regional council of governments to help lessen the financial burden associated with rewriting ordinances and implementing new land use practices.";"Allen, Stephen

This form of land use system, which has adapted to the harsh environment in which herders raise their livestock, enables efficient utilization of scattered pastoral resources since it accommodates constant mobility of livestock. In contrast to the mobile way of life, which characterizes pastoralism, farming as a sedentary activity is only marginally present in the lowlands of the Afar region. However, the traditional land-use system in Afar is changing nowadays if favor farming because of various reasons. This paper explains such changes mainly based the data collected through a household survey of 180 pastoral households inhabiting three districts of Afar region in Ethiopia. While drought is the major natural challenge that induced changes of the traditional land-use system in Afar, statistical analysis shows that there exists significant variation across sites and among pastoral households in regards to changes in the traditional land-use system. The variation is explained by factors such as suitability of the area for farming, wealth of households, external support for farming, and access to wage employment.";"Kotu, Bekele Hundie";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land use;pastoralists";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism;Land Stakeholders & Institutions";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ETH";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016206421";"http://purl.umn.edu/51276";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500015873";"integrated representation of the services provided by global water resources";"";"Water is essential not only to maintain the livelihoods of human beings but also to sustain ecosystems. Over the last few decades several global assessments have reviewed current and future uses of water, and have offered potential solutions to a possible water crisis. However, these have tended to focus on water supply rather than on the range of demands for all water services (including those of ecosystems). In this paper, a holistic global view of water resources and the services they provide is presented, using Sankey diagrams as a visualisation tool. These diagrams provide a valuable addition to the spatial maps of other global assessments, as they track the sources, uses, services and sinks of water resources. They facilitate comparison of different water services, and highlight trade-offs amongst them. For example, they reveal how increasing the supply of water resources to one service (crop production) can generate a reduction in provision of other water services (e.g., to ecosystem maintenance). The potential impacts of efficiency improvements in the use of water are also highlighted; for example, reduction in soil evaporation from crop production through better farming practices, or the results of improved treatment and re-use of return flows leading to reduction of delivery to final sinks. This paper also outlines the measures needed to ensure sustainable water resource use and supply for multiple competing services in the future, and emphasises that integrated management of land and water resources is essential to achieve this goal.";"Curmi, Elizabeth

These systems were studied at three different levels: whole-farm (dairy system and cropping system), dairy-system (dairy herd and forage land), and herd (animals only). Dairy farms in SM used the lowest total emergy at all levels and was the highest user of renewable resources. Despite the low quality of resources consumed (crop residues and natural pasture), efficiency of their use was similar to that of industrialised inputs by intensive systems in RI, PC and BR. In addition, among the systems studied, SM dairy farms lay closest to environmental sustainability, contradicting the usual image of high environmental impact of cattle production in developing countries. EmA also revealed characteristics of the three intensive systems. Systems from RI and PC had lower resource transformation efficiency and higher environmental impacts than those from BR, due mainly to feeding strategies that differed due to differing socio-climatic constraints. Application of EmA at multiple levels revealed the importance of a multi-level analysis. While the whole-farm level assesses the overall contribution of the system to its environment, the dairy-system level is suitable for comparison of multi-product systems. In contrast, the herd level focuses on herd management and bypasses debates about definition of system boundaries by excluding land management. Combining all levels highlights the contribution of livestock to the global agricultural system and identifies inefficiencies and influences of system components on the environment.";"Vigne, Mathieu

However, the challenges to biofuel development are its effects on the environment, especially water quality. This study evaluates the long-term impacts of biofuel production alternatives (e.g., elevated corn stover removal rates and the potential land cover change) on an ecosystem with a focus on biomass production, soil erosion, water quantity and quality, and soil nitrate nitrogen concentration at the watershed scale. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was modified for setting land cover change scenarios and applied to the Iowa River Basin (a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River Basin). Results show that biomass production can be sustained with an increased stover removal rate as long as the crop demand for nutrients is met with appropriate fertilization. Although a drastic increase (4.7–70.6%) in sediment yield due to erosion and a slight decrease (1.2–3.2%) in water yield were estimated with the stover removal rate ranging between 40% and 100%, the nitrate nitrogen load declined about 6–10.1%. In comparison to growing corn, growing either switchgrass or miscanthus can reduce sediment erosion greatly. However, land cover changes from native grass to switchgrass or miscanthus would lead to a decrease in water yield and an increase in nitrate nitrogen load. In contrast to growing switchgrass, growing miscanthus is more productive in generating biomass, but its higher water demand may reduce water availability in the study area.";"Wu, Yiping

The Sanjiang Plain is one of the largest grain production bases in China, and has experienced rapid land cover change, making it a critical area in which to assess the environmental impact of LUCC and propose strategies for minimizing its impact on net primary productivity (NPP). In this study, land cover was estimated from remote sensing images to quantify LUCC on the Sanjiang Plain from 2000 to 2010. A moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer dataset of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation canopy, a land cover map, meteorological data and other field data were used to develop a CASA productivity model and obtain NPP for the study area. The spatial and temporal changes of NPP from 2000 to 2010 were then analyzed. Finally, the effect of LUCC on regional NPP was estimated. The land cover maps indicated that farmland expansion and wetland reduction were the most significant landscape changes on the Sanjiang Plain from 2000 to 2010. NPP loss totaled 2900 Gg (1 Gg = 10⁹ g) of carbon from 2000 to 2005. By 2010, NPP had increased by at least 731 Gg of carbon, corresponding to 1184 Gg of net dioxide carbon sequestration.

"AGRIS:US2016205886";"MEASURING INTERACTIONS AMONG URBAN DEVELOPMENT, LAND USE REGULATIONS, AND PUBLIC FINANCE";"";"In this paper, a theoretical model is developed to analyze the interactions among residential development, land use regulations, and public financial impacts (public expenditure and property tax).  A simultaneous equations system with self-selection and discrete dependent variables is estimated to determine the interactions for counties in the five western states (California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington).  The results show that county governments are more likely to impose land use regulations when facing rapid land development, high public expenditure and property tax.  The land use regulations, in turn, decrease land development, long-run public expenditure, and property tax at the cost of higher housing prices and property tax.  During the period of 1982-1992, land use regulations reduced developed areas by 612,800 acres or 8.8 % of the developed area of five western states in 1992, but increased housing price by $5,741 per unit under ""stringent"" regulations and $1,319 per unit under ""low"" regulations. Because it costs money to develop and implement land use regulations, land use regulations increased public expenditure and property tax in the short run, during the period of 1982-1987.  However, in the long-run (1982-1992), land use regulations actually reduce public expenditure and property taxes because the regulations reduce developed areas.  The results also show that land use regulations, land development, public expenditure, and property tax all are significantly affected by population, geographic location, land quality, housing prices, and the risks and costs of development.";"Cho, Seong-Hoon

The conservation status of crop genetic resources, either ex situ or in situ, cultivated or wild, has been assessed for species of the Central American and Mexican centre, demonstrating that that region is indeed one of the important centres of crop diversity for human kind. Furthermore, biotechnological developments with regard to the creation and spread of genetically modified crops have been analyzed. The likelihood of unintentional introgression of genetically modified traits into conventional seed lots, crops as well as into germplasm collections have been assessed. Related biosafety measures as well as the possible implications of intellectual property rights on transgenic crops and/or genes are being discussed vis-a-vis the possible implications they might have for germplasm management. The Central American crop genetic resources situation has been used as a “case study” to illustrate the potential impact of the spreading of GM varieties on the genetic diversity in genebanks and farmers' fields and the need for effective and efficient conservation efforts. Conservation management strategies and practices are being proposed of mitigate the potential negative impact of GM crops on the conservation efforts.";"Engels, J. M. M.

We extend the empirical measurement of co-benefits from the previous focus on environmental benefits to include economic transfers. These transfers have often been mentioned as a co-benefit, but little empirical work measuring the potential magnitude of these transfers has previously been undertaken. We compare and contrast five targeting schemes, each based on maximizing different physical environmental measures, including carbon sequestration, soil erosion, nitrogen runoff, nitrogen leaching, as well as the area enrolled in the program. In each case, the other environmental benefits and economic transfers are computed. We find that the geographic distribution of co-benefits (including economic transfers) varies significantly with the benefit targeted, implying that policy design related to targeting can have very important implications for both environmental conditions and income distributions in sub-regions.";"Feng, Hongli

"AGRIS:US201400063594";"Status of native fishes in the western United States and issues for fire and fuels management";"";"Conservation of native fishes and changing patterns in wildfire and fuels are defining challenges for managers of forested landscapes in the western United States. Many species and populations of native fishes have declined in recorded history and some now occur as isolated remnants of what once were larger more complex systems. Land management activities have been viewed as one cause of this problem. Fires also can have substantial effects on streams and riparian systems and may threaten the persistence of some populations of fish, particularly those that are small and isolated. Despite that, major new efforts to actively manage fires and fuels in forests throughout the region may be perceived as a threat rather than a benefit to conservation of native fishes and their habitats. The management of terrestrial and aquatic resources has often been contentious, divided among a variety of agencies with different goals and mandates. Management of forests, for example, has generally been viewed as an impact on aquatic systems. Implementation of the management-regulatory process has reinforced a uniform approach to mitigate the threats to aquatic species and habitats that may be influenced by management activities. The problems and opportunities, however, are not the same across the landscapes of interest. Attempts to streamline the regulatory process often search for generalized solutions that may oversimplify the complexity of natural systems. Significant questions regarding the influence of fire on aquatic ecosystems, changing fire regimes, and the effects of fire-related management remain unresolved and contribute to the uncertainty. We argue that management of forests and fishes can be viewed as part of the same problem, that of conservation and restoration of the natural processes that create diverse and productive ecosystems. We suggest that progress toward more integrated management of forests and native fishes will require at least three steps: (1) better integration and development of a common conceptual foundation and ecological goals; (2) attention to landscape and ecological context; and (3) recognition of uncertainty.";"Rieman, Bruce

Using principles of rate design and irrigation district  administration as a framework, measures of irrigation district rate structure objectives and physical and economic conditions were developed. The factors investigated characterize the constraints under which districts operate, value and cost of water, quantity of water delivered and revenue risk for districts. Rate structure adoption was predicted with over 75% accuracy. Both significant and non-significant factors are key to understanding rate choice. Districts were more likely to adopt conservation rate pricing when the cost of water to farmers was greater, higher value crops were grown and in areas with warmer and longer growing seasons. These conditions may be interpreted as reflecting the presence of greater opportunity costs in allocating water between low and higher valued uses. Conservation rate pricing was less likely to be adopted by districts where the proportion of alfalfa to total acreage was higher and with higher per acre deliveries of water. Somewhat surprisingly, annual variation in water deliveries (which should increase the risk of revenue shortfalls) and size of the district (larger districts being more sophisticated) have little bearing on the type of rate structure adopted.";"Michelsen, Ari M.

Ground subsidence represents the most important characteristic of a subsidence basin. However, ground subsidence itself does not carry information on geohazards by means of the impacts on the built-up area. Based on long-term experience and studies carried out, three basic subsidence intervals of varying influence were proposed. The lowest degree of undermining influence is connected with subsidence up to 12 cm; the second category is for subsidence from 12 to 100 cm, where constructions are considered possible under certain conditions but special technological procedures must be adhered to; and the third category of hazard is for subsidence over 100 cm. The study was implemented in the largest mining region (black coal deep mining) of the Czech Republic, in the locality of Orlova, Petrvald and Karvina. The study also involved an overall evaluation of subsidence influence, its variation with time, its relation to the current built-up area and to the future built-up area according to the land use plan, and its relation to engineering-geological zones and landslides.";"Marschalko, Marian

Az EB által ehhez fűzött jogértelmezés megvilágítja a tőke kivételes korlátozhatóságát, tehát azt is, amivel a közösségi jog a földügyben lehetővé teszi a tagállami érdeknek a közösségi értékrenddel egyeztethető érvényesíthetőségét. Történetileg és tulajdoni rendjüket tekintve, az EU15 tagállama az RSZ 295. (ma 345.) cikkével kizárja, hogy az EU beavatkozzék az államterületüket érintő földtulajdoni önrendelkezésükbe. E jogintézmény a keleti belépőknél – így esetünkben is – az RSZ 56. cikkének kötelező érvénye és tartalma miatt elesik. Nem cáfolható, hogy az EU-15, másfelől az EU-12 tagjainak földjogi státusát ma két, lényegesen eltérő közösségi jogalap szabályozza, amely az előbbieknek korlátozott szuverenitást enged, míg az utóbbiaktól a szuverenitást egészében elvonja.Az EKB (Európai Közösségek Bírósága) – a CsSz-től eltérően – nem ad(hat) más jogalapot a földre fennálló tagállami önrendelkezésre, mint ahogy a tőke kivételesen megengedett korlátozhatóságát sem rendel(het)i a CsSz megkötésekor, a szerződés keretében meghatározott feltételrendszertől eltérő jogi támpontok alá. Ezért – és a miatt, mert az EKB birtokpolitikai döntései mindmáig csak a Tizenötök földviszonyaiból eredő jogvitákra vonatkoznak – a Korom Ágoston által hivatkozott gyakorlat a hazai földügyben irreleváns. Az EKB ítélkezését jól hasznosíthatjuk a mezőgazdasági üzemszabályozásról szóló törvény megalkotásakor. ----------------------------------------- The mandatory Community legal basis applicable to the land market is specified by the Treaty of Accession (ToA) and Article 56 of the Treaty of Rome (ToR). The ECJ’s interpreting comment reveals the exceptional possibility to restrict the flow of capital, including the fact that Community law makes it possible to enforce the interests of Member States with respect to land issues as long as it is carried out in line with the values of the Community. Historically, with respect to ownership, the EU-15 prevent the EU by way of Article 295 (now 345) of the ToR from intervening in their autonomy with respect to the disposal and ownership of land comprising the territory of the state. This legal institution does not apply to the Eastern entrants due to the compulsory nature and content of Article 56 of the ToR. It cannot be denied that the status of the EU-15 and the EU-12 states, respectively, is regulated by two very different Community legal bases with respect to land ownership – the former being granted limited sovereignty, with the latter having no sovereignty at all.Unlike the ToA, the CJEC (Court of Justice of the European Communities) cannot grant a different legal basis concerning Member States’ sovereignty with respect to the disposal and ownership of land, just like it cannot introduce legal rules different from the conditions set forth in the ToA at the time of accession to govern the exceptional restriction of the flow of capital. Consequently – and because the land estate policy decisions of the CJEC still only apply to disputes arising from land ownership issues of the EU-15 – the practice referred to by Ágoston Korom is irrelevant to Hungary’s land regime. The practice of the CJEC will be very useful to us when drawing up the act regulating agricultural businesses.";"Tanka, Endre";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016206286";"http://purl.umn.edu/99137";"";"";"";""

The first Canadian cultivar of this crop (ACE-1), tested as LRC 96-1, will have the distinction of being the first North American cultivar of PC rye and the only perennial cereal crop specifically developed for forage production. PC rye was originally developed in Germany by crossing rye (Secale cereale L.) with a perennial wild rye (Secale montanum L.) and then backcrossing the F1 with Secale cereale L. while selecting for a perennial nature. In field trials, ACE-1 PC rye has produced economically viable biomass yields for 3 yr under southern Alberta growing conditions. It has similar yield and quality to barley, which is grown extensively for silage in the Canadian prairies. For proper land management and adequate forage production, ACE-1 PC rye should be seeded from mid-September to mid-October in narrow (17.5 cm) rows at a seeding rate of 80 kg ha-1. When harvested at the soft dough stage for silage it contained less crude protein (CP) and more fibre than barley; however, in vitro gas production indicates that its dry matter (DM) digestibility will be similar to that of barley. PC rye is a valuable forage crop, but it needs to be harvested earlier than the soft dough stage to obtain comparable silage quality to barley.";"Acharya, S.N.

Under aboriginal management, fires probably occurred under a broad range of conditions, but under pastoral management, burning is avoided when soil moisture is low. This experiment subjected E. melanophloia and E. populnea seedlings to burning and moisture stress, to examine whether this change in burning regime could affect seedling survivorship. The findings suggest survivorship rates are 87-93% for unstressed seedlings with relatively large lignotubers (>12mm² plan area) and 56-66% for unstressed seedlings with small lignotubers. There was no substantial interactive effect between moisture stress and burning for E. melanophloia, but such an interaction was apparent for E. populnea, such that moisture stress multiplied the effect of burning. The timing of burning in relation to soil-moisture conditions may have an enduring effect on woodland structure where E. populnea is dominant. E. melanophloia seedlings are more resistant to burning, especially with moisture stress, and fire may not be limiting structural development in woodlands where this species dominates. However, a more detailed understanding of species demography is required, including the conditions required for germination, causes of seedling mortality and the time taken for seedlings to develop fire resistance in the field.";"Fensham, R.J.

Recent neotropical rainforest studies with local tower flux measurements have revealed strong seasonal carbon fluxes that follow the availability of sunlight in intact forests, while in areas of forest disturbance, carbon fluxes more closely tracked seasonal water availability. These studies also showed a strong seasonal correspondence of satellite measures of greenness, using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (E VI) with ecosystem carbon fluxes in both intact and disturbed forests, which may enable larger scale extension of tower flux measurements. In this study, we investigated the seasonal patterns and relationships of local site tower flux measures of gross primary productivity (P g) with independent Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite greenness measures across three Monsoon Asia tropical forest types, encompassing drought-deciduous, dry evergreen, and humid evergreen secondary tropical forests. In contrast to neotropical forests, the tropical forests of Monsoon Asia are more extensively degraded and heterogeneous due to intense land use pressures, and therefore, may exhibit unique seasonal patterns of ecosystem fluxes that are more likely water-limited and drought-susceptible. Our results show significant phenologic variability and response to moisture and light controls across the three tropical forest sites and at the regional scale. The drier tropical forests were primarily water-limited, while the wet evergreen secondary forest showed a slight positive trend with light availability. Satellite E VI greenness observations were generally synchronized and linearly related with seasonal and inter-annual tower flux P g measurements at the multiple sites and provided better opportunities for tower extension of carbon fluxes than other satellite products, such as the MODIS P g product. Satellite E VI-derived P g images revealed strong seasonal variations in photosynthetic activity throughout the Monsoon Asia tropical region.";"Huete, A.R.

A Survey of Exurban Landowners";"";"Rapid conversion of rural land to exurban development and the ensuing impacts on natural resources have been well-documented, but information about exurban landowners is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we surveyed exurban landowners in six Wyoming counties and documented demographic characteristics, motivations, knowledge, and attitudes about natural resources and land management. The overall response rate was 55.6%. Generally, respondents were of retirement age, had lived in Wyoming for about 13 yr, and were raised in areas with a population < 10 000. Wyoming respondents lived in exurbia for the lifestyle and aesthetic values and did not expect economic gains from their property. Most respondents had knowledge about, and interest in, invasive species, water quality, landscaping, and gardening. More than half of respondents (54%) had never looked for information regarding land management. Information from this study can be used to strengthen the development and delivery of educational programs. Programs that focus on water quality or weed control likely will appeal to more exurban landowners than those that focus solely on grazing management. Our findings provide an accurate characterization of this audience and their motivations and attitudes regarding land management, and suggest that using a multipronged approach for outreach efforts, which includes both cost- and time-efficient ways to conduct important land management practices, might increase participation in educational programs.";"Mealor, Rachel D.

"AGRIS:US201301709323";"Transatlantic Similarities and Contrasts in Rural Development Policies";"";"The United States (US) and European Union (EU) share many general policy aims for rural areas, but they differ in the ways in which they try to achieve these aims. The principal difference lies in the role envisioned by agriculture in overall rural development. EU policies treat agriculture as a provider of public goods, and many of its 'rural' programmes target agriculture. In the US, very few Federal rural development programs are focused solely on agriculture. Differences of approach may be linked to different farm distributions, population densities, historical settlement patterns, and the historical policy process per se. In particular, in the US rural development policy does not cover the environment or income support to farmers; these are addressed through other programmes.

"AGRIS:US201400139210";"Economic and Social Impacts of Wildfires and Invasive Plants in American Deserts: Lessons From the Great Basin";"";"Research on the impacts of wildfire and invasive plants in rangelands has focused on biophysical rather than human dimensions of these environmental processes. We offer a synthetic perspective on economic and social aspects of wildfire and invasive plants in American deserts, focusing on the Great Basin because greater research attention has been given to the effects of cheatgrass expansion than to other desert wildfire/invasion cycles. We focus first on impacts at the level of the individual decision-maker, then on impacts experienced at the human community or larger socio-political scales. Economic impacts of wildfire differ from those of invasive grasses because although fire typically reduces forage availability and thus ranch profit opportunities, invasive grasses can also be used as a forage source and ranchers have adapted their grazing systems to take advantage of that circumstance. To reduce the threat of increased ranch bankruptcies, strategies are needed that can increase access to alternative early-season forage sources and/or promote diversification of ranch income streams by capturing value from ranch ecosystem services other than forage. The growth of low-density, exurban subdivisions in Western deserts influences not only the pattern and frequency of wildfire and plant invasions but also affects prevailing public opinion toward potential management options, and thereby the capacity of land management agencies to use those options. Outreach efforts can influence public opinion, but must be rooted in new knowledge about multiple impacts of invasion and increased wildfire in American deserts.";"Brunson, Mark W.

Paisang trees are conserved both by individuals and through community governance, because their leaves play a crucial role in sustaining 11 traditional cropping systems of the Monpa peoples. An Indigenous institution, Chhopa, regulates access to paisang leaves, ensuring that the relationship between paisang and traditional field crop species within Monpa agroecosystems is sustainable. The Monpa farmers also exchange leaves and agricultural products for yak-based foods produced by the transhumant Brokpa, who are primarily yak herders. Yak herds also graze in paisang groves during winter. These practices have enabled the conservation of about 33 landraces, yak breeds, and a number of wild plants. Paisang thus emerged as a culturally important keystone species in the cultures and livelihoods of both Monpa and Brokpa. Ecological and conservation knowledge and ethics about paisang vary with gender, social systems, and altitudes. Labor shortages, however, have already caused some changes to the ways in which paisang leaves are used and yak grazing patterns are also changing in the face of changes in attitude among local landowners. Given new competing interests, incentives schemes are now needed to conserve the ecologically sustainable traditional livelihoods.";"Singh, Ranjay K.

This work developed an object-based remote sensing approach to map land cover and seagrass distribution in an Australian coastal environment for a 38year Landsat image time-series archive (1972–2010). Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery were used without in situ field data input (but still using field knowledge) to produce land and seagrass cover maps every year data were available, resulting in over 60 map products over the 38year archive. Land cover was mapped annually using vegetation, bare ground, urban and agricultural classes. Seagrass distribution was also mapped annually, and in some years monthly, via horizontal projected foliage cover classes, sand and deep water. Land cover products were validated using aerial photography and seagrass maps were validated with field survey data, producing several measures of accuracy. An average overall accuracy of 65% and 80% was reported for seagrass and land cover products respectively, which is consistent with other studies in the area. This study is the first to show moderate spatial resolution, long term annual changes in land cover and seagrass in an Australian environment, created without the use of in situ data; and only one of a few similar studies globally. The land cover products identify several long term trends; such as significant increases in South East Queensland’s urban density and extent, vegetation clearing in rural and rural-residential areas, and inter-annual variation in dry vegetation types in western South East Queensland. The seagrass cover products show that there has been a minimal overall change in seagrass extent, but that seagrass cover level distribution is extremely dynamic; evidenced by large scale migrations of higher seagrass cover levels and several sudden and significant changes in cover level. These mapping products will allow management agencies to build a baseline assessment of their resources, understand past changes and help inform implementation and planning of management policy to address potential future changes.";"Lyons, Mitchell B.

The general aim of the study was to find out whether learning and collaborative decision making could be adequately supported by using the voting methods in the regional stakeholder group. Approval voting (AV) was used to select the evaluation criteria of the alternative strategies, Borda count method and cumulative voting were used to rank the stakeholders' decision criteria and the multi-criteria approval (MA) voting was used to multi-criteria evaluation of the alternatives. Plurality voting was used in public meetings to point out the best plan candidate. In general, the voting methods used were found to be easy to understand and their results transparent, which makes them user-friendly in the participation context. The applied voting methods also promoted learning and decision making in the planning process. Other lessons of the study stresses the key role of the plan alternatives in taking over the planning situation and in learning the trade-offs between different goals. Participants' preference elicitation should not be carried out before the trade-offs have been learned. Furthermore, instead of using criteria averages as approval borders in the MA voting, the approval borders should be specified by the participants of the working group.";"Hiltunen, Veikko

"AGRIS:US201300864024";"Applying portfolio optimisation to the harvesting decisions of non-industrial private forest owners";"";"The non-industrial private forest owner's optimal harvesting and investment strategies are studied at forest holding level by including individual forest stands in an asset class portfolio. The forest owner can either clearcut mature stands and invest the capital in financial or real asset classes (bank deposits, government bonds, stocks, apartments) or postpone clearcutting and retain capital in standing trees. Forest inventory data from actual forest holdings in Southwest Finland, the simulation-optimisation software MELA, and statistics on timber prices are utilised to compute the return series for forest stands. The numerical results show that the optimal level of clearcutting decreases markedly with initial non-forest wealth, especially at low risk-free rates of interest. It may therefore be rational for non-industrial private forest owners to consider shorter rotation periods than those of investors with diversified portfolios. The correlations between returns from forest stands are high, implying that increasing the variety of stand structures achieved by planting different species is not likely to bring substantial diversification benefits. The favoured investment outlet for harvesting revenues (apartments, government bonds or stocks) is sensitive to the period of historical data used to compute the return series and risk-free rate of interest. The value growth of forest stand can be used to estimate annual returns only for those stands that are readily mature. An alternative method of computing returns on stands in any development phase is proposed, based on net present value of stand adjusted for fluctuations in forest land prices. This method applies if selling forest land is considered an option. If selling is not an option, the ratio of maximised net present value to value at immediate harvest can be used as a 'maturity index' for ranking the stands for portfolio optimisation.";"Hyytiäinen, Kari

It is aimed at providing the knowledge required to support proactive action for plant conservation. On the basis of a literature-derived catalogue and of an extensive survey campaign, the flora was investigated in terms of conservation interest; habitat types and locations that require protection measures were identified according to the occurrence of valuable native plants. Valuable species exclusive of the urban sector are threatened by the compaction trend affecting the urban fabric. Such species occur mainly in ruderal environments and fallows of archaeological sites and urban parks, near river courses and in remnants of natural forests. Valuable species exclusive of the suburban sector are threatened by urban sprawl. They occur prevalently in wet environments of the subcoastal strip and in coastal sands, Mediterranean maquis, tuffaceous gorges, sulphur springs and archaeological sites. The results highlight the need to preserve the complexity of the land mosaic, especially within the urban matrix, and to strengthen the existing environmental protection tools in the suburban area against foreseeable land cover changes.";"Capotorti, G.

Australia is already experiencing climate change as evidenced by higher temperatures and more frequent and severe droughts. These impacts are compounded by increasing land use pressures on natural resources and native ecosystems. This paper provides a synthesis of the interactions, feedbacks and risks of natural climate variability, climate change and land use/land cover change (LUCC) impacting on the Australian continent and how they vary regionally. We review evidence of climate change and underlying processes resulting from interactions between global warming caused by increased concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases and modification of the land surface. The consequences of ignoring the effect of LUCC on current and future droughts in Australia could have catastrophic consequences for the nation's environment, economy and communities. We highlight the need for more integrated, long-term and adaptive policies and regional natural resource management strategies that restore the beneficial feedbacks between native vegetation cover and local-regional climate, to help ameliorate the impact of global warming.";"MCALPINE, C.A.

However, few studies have been conducted on the analysis of time-series LCFs. Although multi-scale comparisons of spectral index, hard classification, and land surface temperature images have received attention, rarely have these approaches been applied to LCFs. This study compared the LCFs derived through Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) using the time-series Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired in the Poyang Lake area, China between 2004 and 2005. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) propose an approach for optimal endmember (EM) selection in time-series MESMA; (2) understand the trends in time-series LCFs derived from the TM and MODIS data; and (3) examine the trends in the correlation between the bi-scale LCFs derived from the time-series TM and MODIS data. Our results indicated: (1) the EM spectra chosen according to the proposed hierarchical three-step approach (overall, seasonal, and individual) accurately modeled the both the TM and MODIS images; (2) green vegetation (GV) and NPV/soil/impervious surface (N/S/I) classes followed sine curve trends in the overall area, while the two water classes displayed the water level change pattern in the areas primarily covered with wetland vegetation; and (3) GV, N/S/I, and bright water classes indicated a moderately high agreement between the TM and MODIS LCFs in the whole area (adjusted R²⩾0.6).

We fit three historical climate suitability models for large wildfires (i.e. ≥ 400 ha) in Colorado and Wyoming using topography and decadal climate averages corresponding to wildfire occurrence at the same temporal scale. The historical models classified points of known large wildfire occurrence with high accuracies. Using a novel approach in wildfire modeling, we applied the historical models to independent climate and wildfire datasets, and the resulting sensitivities were 0.75, 0.81, and 0.83 for Maxent, Generalized Linear, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, respectively. We projected the historic models into future climate space using data from 15 global circulation models and two representative concentration pathway scenarios. Maps from these geospatial analyses can be used to evaluate the changing spatial distribution of climate suitability of large wildfires in these states. April relative humidity was the most important covariate in all models, providing insight to the climate space of large wildfires in this region. These methods incorporate monthly and seasonal climate averages at a spatial resolution relevant to land management (i.e. 1 km²) and provide a tool that can be modified for other regions of North America, or adapted for other parts of the world.";"West, Amanda M.

The monitoring network comprised 23 sampling points sampled every 3 months during a 2-year period. Forty-two pesticides belonging to varied chemical families, including current pesticides, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and degradation products, were analyzed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography with electron-capture detection-thermoionic specific detection (GC-ECD-TSD) or mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistical treatment was performed by descriptive analysis followed by chemometric multivariate analysis. The latter included cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and factor analysis. Twenty-two pesticides were quantitated, 20 pesticides were not detected, and metalaxyl, benalaxyl, quinalphos, pirimicarb, and prometryn were only qualitatively detected. The most frequently detected pesticides (% of samples analyzed) were lindane (53%), pendimethalin (49%), endosulfan sulfate (44%), and endosulfan (38%) while those that most frequently exceeded the 0.1 microgram L-1 European Union (EU) limit were pendimethalin (13%), endosulfan (12%), endosulfan sulfate (11%), and atrazine (9%). 45% of the samples exceeded the EU limit for individual pesticides while 27% exceeded the limit set to the sum of pesticides (0.5 microgram L-1). Principal component analysis revealed five principal components that were attributed to environmental/agrochemical managing factors. The broad range of pesticides investigated combined with the intensive character of the local agriculture contributed to the diversity of pesticides that were detected.

"AGRIS:US201500183441";"Water quality, potential conflicts and solutions—an upstream–downstream analysis of the transnational Zarafshan River (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan)";"";"The Central Asian countries are particularly affected by the global climate change. The cultural and economic centers in this mostly arid region have to rely solely on the water resources provided by the rapidly melting glaciers in the Pamir, Tien-Shan and Alay mountains. By 2030, the available water resources will be 30 % lower than today while the water demand will increase by 30 %. The unsustainable land and water use leads to a water deficit and a deterioration of the water quality. Documenting the status quo of the water resources needs to be the first steps towards an integrated water resource management. The research presented here provides a detailed overview of the transboundary Zarafshan River, the lifeline for more than six million people. The findings are based on field measurements, existing data from the national hydrometeorological services and an extensive literature analysis and cover the status quo of the meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the Zarafshan as well as the most important water quality parameters (pH, conductivity, nitrate, phosphate, arsenic, chromate, copper, zinc, fluoride, petroleum products, phenols and the aquatic invertebrate fauna). The discharge of the Zarafshan is characterized by a high natural discharge dynamic in the mountainous upper parts of the catchment and by sizeable anthropogenic water extractions in the lower parts of the catchment, where on average 60.6 % of the available water is diverted for irrigation purposes in the Samarkand and Navoi provinces. The water quality is heavily affected by the unsustainable land use and inadequate/missing water purification techniques. The reduced discharge and the return flow of untreated agricultural drainage water lead to a critical pollution of the river in the lower parts of the catchment. Additional sources of pollutants were identified in the Navoi special economic area and the mining industry in the Tajik part of the catchment. The impact of the global climate change and the socio-economic growth on the water availability and the water demand will aggravate the detected problems and might lead to severe local and transboundary upstream–downstream water conflicts within the next decades.";"Groll, M.

Understanding the fate of this residual fertilizer N in soil is important for evaluating its overall use efficiency and environmental effect. Nitrogen-15 (¹⁵N)-labeled urea (165 kg N ha ⁻¹) was applied to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing in three different fertilized soils (no fertilizer, No-F; inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization, NPK; and manure plus inorganic NPK fertilization, MNPK) from a long-term trial (19 years) on the south of the Loess Plateau, China. The fate of residual fertilizer N in soils over summer fallow and the second winter wheat growing season was examined. The amount of the residual fertilizer N was highest in the No-F soil (116 kg ha ⁻¹), and next was NPK soil (60 kg ha ⁻¹), then the MNPK soil (43 kg ha ⁻¹) after the first winter wheat harvest. The residual fertilizer N in the No-F soil was mainly in mineral form (43% of the residual ¹⁵N), and for the NPK and MNPK soils, it was mainly in organic form. The loss rate of residual ¹⁵N in No-F soil over summer fallow was as high as 48%, and significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in the NPK soil (22%) and MNPK soil (19%). The residual ¹⁵N use efficiency (RNUE) by the second winter wheat was 13% in the No-F soil, 6% in the NPK soil and 8% in the MNPK soil. These were equivalent to 9.0, 2.0 and 2.2% of applied ¹⁵N. The total ¹⁵N recovery (¹⁵N uptake by crops and residual in 0–100 cm soil layer) in the MNPK and NPK soils (84.5% and 86.6%, respectively) were both significantly higher than that in the No-F soil (59%) after two growing seasons. The ¹⁵N uptake by wheat in two growing seasons was higher in the MNPK soil than in NPK soil. Therefore, we conclude that a high proportion of the residual ¹⁵N was lost during the summer fallow under different land management in dryland farming, and that long-term combined application of manure with inorganic fertilizer could increase the fertilizer N uptake and decrease N loss.";"Zhao, Wei

"AGRIS:US201400164332";"China–Africa development cooperation in the rural sector: an exploration of land tenure and investments linkages for sustainable resource use";"";"China-Africa development cooperation in the rural sector has received an increased attention by researchers and policy-makers given the advantages and disadvantages of China’s contribution to the local economy. However, there is a lack of more reliable and nuanced findings to provide greater insights into the major issues concerning rural development and resource use. This paper aims to position land tenure and foreign investments linkages as a new research angle for understanding the role of land in sustainable resource use and investments. The paper provides a brief overview of China-Africa cooperation in rural development especially concerning agriculture to illustrate the neglect of critical land and resource use issues in policy and practice. The paper briefly discusses the ongoing land tenure reforms in Africa and the policy gaps to be filled through further research. It also discusses how China’s own development model, especially concerning land tenure reform, shares similar trajectories with Africa, which has important implications for the effectiveness of Chinese investments in African land. The paper concludes that there is an urgent need for lesson learning among Chinese and African policy-makers and investors towards tailoring development cooperation to more appropriate land tenure systems for sustainable resource use to the mutual benefit of Chinese and African stakeholders.";"Zhao, Yongjun";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"rural development;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400164332";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-012-9408-y";"";"";"";"355-366"

The analysis of soil moisture variability is challenging because soil moisture is dependent on physical factors such as: antecedent precipitation, soil texture, land cover, and topography. This study investigated soil moisture variability, validated the utility of temporal stability analysis for measuring areal mean soil moisture, and identified factors that were strongly related to temporal stability characteristics at small mountainous sites in Northeast Asia. Soil moisture contents were measured at different depths using time domain reflectometers at two fields in the center of Korea. Time series analyses showed that slope played a substantial role on soil moisture distribution. The Chi-square test identified Gumbel distribution as an optimal soil moisture distribution. The mean and the standard deviation of soil moisture showed an upper convex shape and the variability of soil moisture was highest at moderate mean soil moisture conditions (~15–20%) at 10, 30, and 60cm in the study sites. Temporal stability analysis revealed the representativeness of the average volumetric soil moisture contents with errors of ±4.91% and ±2.35% for the fields of Sulma and Chongmi river basins, respectively. Analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference tests showed that the slope and soil texture, particularly clay, had an impact on the temporal stability characteristics of soil moisture for the study sites, the land cover had no significant impact. Temporally stable locations for soil moisture were determined with the milder slope and higher clay contents at the study sites.";"Sur, Chanyang

However, there is little guidance on how it should be done. The indices adopted by existing programs have often been linear, using weighted averages of environmental parameters without explicit consideration of whether they represent a reliable preference ordering on environmental states. Our article investigates society's weights for addressing multiple resource concerns and how functional forms of EIs can influence program outcomes. We propose a means by which preference weights are observed from policymaker actions. Weights for multiple resource concerns are determined and combined with biophysical crop simulation data to create an environmental index (EI) for crop rotations. This index is developed using alternative function forms to score conservation efforts on working cropland and to measure their effect on program outcomes.";"Johansson, Robert C.

"AGRIS:US201500013959";"hidden nature of parent material in soils of Italian mountain ecosystems";"";"Soils with andic features are known to be very important as regards both ecosystem fertility and susceptibility to land degradation. In recent years there has been an increasing number of finds of these soils in non-volcanic mountain ecosystems (NVME) in different parts of the world under different environmental settings. In Italian NVME there has been extensive investigation proving that these soils have a much wider distribution than previously thought. But despite these important findings, very little is known about their genesis or properties. Against this background, our investigation aims to question the nature of parent material in andic soils in Italian NVME; we consider this question fundamental for proper understanding of such soils. We address the question of the parent material by highlighting similarities/dissimilarities between soils and their underlying bedrocks and ascertaining whether soils developed as a result of in situ weathering or because of eolian inputs. The study was conducted on 41 soil profiles distributed throughout Italian NVME, performing an integrated analysis of (i) grain-size distribution (GSD) by laser granulometry, (ii) end-member modelling of obtained GSD, (iii) soil–bedrock differences in magnetic susceptibility, and (iv) soil–bedrock differences based on the geochemistry of 38 elements. The final results from these investigations show that the investigated soils are mainly derived from eolian sediments and that weathering of the underlying bedrock plays a minor role. Two main types of eolian parent materials seem to coexist in different proportions according to the soil type: eolian sediments with a similar composition of the underlying bedrock (termed autochthonous loess) and eolian sediments of volcanic type (pyroclasts). Autochthonous loess represents the main component of the parent material in the following studied soils: Aluandic Andosols, Cambisols, Phaeozems and Podzol (67%, 63%, 44% and 73%, respectively). All these soils exhibit low to moderate andic features. Volcanic-type eolian sediments constitute about 90% of the parent material in most andic soils that are Silandic Andosols, but occur in different proportions in most of the investigated soils. The nature of soil parent materials surprisingly follows a clear trend with latitude, with autochthonous loess characterizing most parent materials in northern Italy whilst volcanic sediments form most parent materials in the south. In accordance with their latitude, other soils exhibit an intermediate behaviour.";"Mileti, Florindo A.

"AGRIS:DJ2012041876";"Qualitative, Quantitative and Economic Evaluation of Land Suitability for Barley, Wheat and Chickpea in Rainfed Area of Talandasht District (Kermanshah Province)";"";"In Iran, the development of cultivated areas becomes gradually impossible due to ever-increasing population growth and urban area development. Therefore, it is very important to use the existing cultivated lands more efficiently. Land suitability evaluation makes the sustainable use of the lands feasible. The objective of this study was qualitative, quantitative and economic assessment of land suitability in Talandahst area for rainfed wheat, barley and chickpea. Talandasht plain with a surface area of 4500 ha is located southwest of Kermanshah city. The climate is semi-arid with cold winter and moderate summer. The successive stages of this research included soil survey in the field, soil analysis, qualitative and quantitative and economic evaluations of land suitability. In qualitative evaluation of land, climatic, topographic and soil suitability classes were determined according to the degree of the matching. Limitation and parametric methods were used in qualitative evaluation. Quantitative and economic evaluations made based on the observed yield and gross benefit, respectively. Based on qualitative evaluation, the studied area is marginally suitable for rainfed farming of wheat, barley and chickpea. This is due to water deficiency occurring during some stages of the growing cycle. The solution for this problem is supplementary irrigation. In addition to climate limitation, there are also topographic and soil restriction for the growth of the studied crops. On the basis of observed yield, the land units are moderately to highly suitable for rainfed wheat and barley production. Among the three named crops, the most and least profitable ones are chickpea and barley, respectively, and wheat ranks between them.";"A. Jalalian

Fine resolution satellite imagery provides opportunities for land cover monitoring and assessment.  The multiple satellite images after typhoon events collected from 2001 to 2010 covering land areas and land cover conditions are evaluated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relationship between land cover and observed water quality, such as suspended solids (SS) and nitrate-nitrogens (NO3-N), are explored in the study area. Results show that the long-term variations in water quality are explained by NDVI data in the reservoir buffer zones. Suspended solid and nitrate concentrations are related to average NDVI values on multiple spatial scales. Annual NO3-N concentrations are positively correlated with an average NDVI with a 1 km reservoir buffer area, and the SS after typhoon events associated with landslides are negatively correlated with the average NDVI in the entire watershed. This study provides an approach for assessing the influences of land cover on variations in water quality.";"Hone-Jay Chu

"AGRIS:US2016208844";"The current situation of the Hungarian agricultural economy";"A magyar agrárgazdaság napjainkban";"Áchim L. András parasztpolitikus a nagybirtok elleni harc jelentős vezetője a XIX–XX. század fordulóján. A cikk a halálának centenáriuma alkalmából tartott emlékkonferencián elhangzott előadás alapján készült azzal az igénnyel, hogy bemutassa napjaink magyar agrárgazdaságát, és megkíséreljen párhuzamot vonni a 100 évvel ezelőtti kor, illetve a mai agrárgazdasággal szemben álló kihívások között.A 100 évvel ezelőtti viszonyok és a maiak között meglepő párhuzamok rajzolódtak ki: földosztás, a nagybirtokok parcellázása; a kisparasztok (családi gazdaságok) preferálása a nagybirtokkal szemben; szegény emberek (munkanélküliek) állami munkába történő bevonása; igazságos adó- (támogatási) rendszer igénye; törekvés hatásos érdekképviseletek létrehozására. Mindezek mellett a kornak is voltak hasonlóságai: akkor is, ma is válsághatások érték az ágazatot; mind a két korszakot hasonló megosztottság, békétlenség jellemezte; Áchim korában az élelmiszer még stratégiai termék volt, napjainkban pedig újra egyre inkább azzá kezd válni.Ugyanakkor óvatosan szükséges bánni azokkal a – Áchim korában még igencsak helytálló – politikai véleményekkel, amelyek az ágazatnak „húzó” szerepet szánnak a magyar nemzetgazdaságban. Indokolt tudomásul venni, hogy a mezőgazdaság a fejlett – vagy közepesen fejlett – gazdaságú társadalomban már soha nem lehet „húzóágazat”, de lehet sikerágazat! A magyar mezőgazdaságnak célszerű erre törekednie, okos, kiegyensúlyozott agrárirányítással és politikával, ennek elérését ajánlatos célként kitűzni.A történelem során és napjainkban is éles vita folyt (folyik) arról, hogy egyes mezőgazdasági tevékenységeknél mekkora az az ágazati méret, amely a szerény megélhetést biztosítja. Az ágazati költség-jövedelem adatok alapján számításokat végezve megállapítható, hogy szántóföldi gabonatermelésben 70-100 hektár, kézimunka-igényes zöldségfajoknál 7-11 hektár, gyümölcsültetvényeknél 15-20 hektár szükséges a megélhetéshez. Tejelő tehénből a megélhetéshez 30-35 egyed és hozzá kapcsolódó 30-35 hektár takarmánytermő terület, vágósertésből 800-900 egyed évi kibocsátás és hozzá kapcsolódó 90-100 hektár szántó szükséges. Az okszerű ágazati struktúra és megfelelő méret mellett elkerülhető az a helyzet, hogy egyes családi gazdaságok adnak ugyan munkát, de megélhetést nem, míg mások adnak megélhetést, de munkát nem.A XIX–XX. század fordulóján a mezőgazdaság meghatározó szerepet játszott az országok, így hazánk nemzetgazdaságában is. Stratégiai jelentőségű volt a helyi élelmiszer-ellátás, mivel az élelmiszerek széles rádiuszú szállítási lehetősége – az élelmiszer-tartósítás hagyományos módszerei, valamint a fejletlen logisztika mellett – korlátozott volt. Az élelmiszeripar és az élelmiszer-logisztika rohamos fejlődése csak Áchim kora után kezdődött, ami jelentősen bővítette az élelmiszerek világkereskedelmét. Ennek következtében az agrárgazdaság vesztett stratégiai jelentőségéből, a népesség élelmiszer-ellátása külpiacokról is megoldható, s egyre inkább az ipar és a szolgáltatás vált a fejlődés motorjává. Fokozatosan kialakult az a napjainkra is jellemző szemlélet: „gyárts olcsón élelmiszert, azután jól – és drágán – csomagold be, mert a termék sokat fog utazni”.Az elmúlt fél évtized folyamatai azonban arra utalnak: az elkövetkező években keresleti piac jellemzi majd az élelmiszerek világkereskedelmét, az élelmezés és élelmiszer-biztonság kérdései egyre inkább újra stratégiai ágazattá teszik az élelmiszer-gazdaságot. ----------------------------------------------- András L. Áchim was a peasant-politician at the turn of the 19th to 20th century, a leader of the fight against large estates. This article is based on a presentation at the conference held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death. The aim of the article is to describe agricultural economy as it exists today and to try to find the similarities between the challenges faced 100 years ago and those of the current times.The similarities between the circumstances present 100 years ago and those present today are surprising: distribution of land, the division of large estates; preference for small farmers (family-run farms) over large estates; the employment of poor people (the unemployed) on governmental projects; a demand for a fair tax (support) system; efforts for the establishment of effective labour organisations. There are similarities between the two ages as well, such as the sector being affected by a crisis, the era being characterised by strife and the lack of peace; also, food was of strategic importance in Áchim’s era and is starting to assume strategic importance again.On the other hand, one needs to be careful with the political opinions - which were very appropriate in Áchim’s era - which attribute a pivotal role to the sector in the development of the Hungarian national economy. One should acknowledge that in advanced – or fairly advanced – economies, agriculture may never be a “leading” sector - but it can be a successful one! This is where the Hungarian agriculture should be heading, and this is what smart and balanced agricultural regime and policy should aim for.In historic times, as well as today, there has been strong debate concerning the farm size required for a modest livelihood while pursuing various agricultural activities. Calculations based on sector-specific costs and revenues indicate that the requirement for earning a living is 70-100 hectares for field-based cereal production, 7-11 hectares for vegetables requiring a lot of manual labour, and 15-20 hectares for orchards. The corresponding requirement is 30-35 dairy cows plus 30-35 hectares for growing fodder, or an annual output of 800-900 swine for slaughter plus 90-100 hectares of ploughland. By structuring and sizing farms appropriately, one can avoid the situation that certain family-run farms provide work but not a livelihood, while others provide a livelihood but no work.At the turn of the 19th to 20th century, agriculture had a definitive role in national economies and in the Hungarian national economy as well. Local food supply was of strategic importance because the possibilities for transporting food over long distances were limited due to the traditional methods of food conservation and the underdeveloped state of logistical services. The fast development of the food industry and food logistics only began after Áchim’s era an gave a significant boost to the global trading of food. As a result, agricultural lost its strategic significance, as the food supply of the population could be provided from external markets. Industry and the services sector became the motor of development. The attitude applied today – i.e. that one should produce cheap food products, then package them well – and expensively – because the product will travel a great distance – has developed gradually.The trends seen over the last five years, however, indicate that the global food trade will be characterised by a demand-driven market in the upcoming years and the issues of food supply and food safety will cause food economy to regain its strategic status.";"Kapronczai, Istvan";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016208844";"http://purl.umn.edu/119939";"";"";"";""

More importantly, in the case of K'gari-Fraser Island and the dingo, shape the perceptions of iconicity in that landscape. Iconic species are used to represent diverse human valuing such as commercial, recreational, national, conservation and cultural. The dingo is contested as an introduced species in social evolution, is identified as a pest animal in contemporary land management, raises ancient human fears of predation and is, at the same time, the iconic representative of a World Heritage Listed landscape, due partly to the alleged genetic purity of K'gari-Fraser Island dingoes. Iconic species are viewed differently depending on epistemological biases and disciplinary frameworks, but these multiple constructions are rarely acknowledged or articulated. This paper searches for commonalities in constructions of the dingo across three literatures: scientific, anthropological/cultural analyses and tourism geographies. We find that each of these disciplinary literatures is divided. Within this contestation the dingo remains a liminal being in human perception defined by a predominantly anthropocentric vision. But there are two participants in any gaze, and future research might seek to understand how the dingo looks back at humans.";"Archer-Lean, Clare

CBNRM entails collaborative efforts, typically involving local, state and federal agencies, private firms and landowners, non-governmental organisations such as environmental and economic development groups, and watershed councils. There are no agreed-upon metrics or even broadly accepted approaches for assessing the effectiveness of these new institutions. A good deal of work has been done on evaluating collaborative processes and some on environmental outcomes, but almost none on the socio-economic effects of their activities. To help fill the gap we have been conducting a long-term action research project in Oregon, an analysis of the most effective approaches to the design and implementation of measures of the socio-economic health of communities in which watershed stewardship organisations are active. In this paper we present one case, a participatory process developing socio-economic measures for monitoring CBNRM. We describe the process and the resulting measures. It is expected that the measures will be systematically updated and tracked by the community over the next decade or more. The case study illustrates the necessity and challenges of developing measures for CBNRM that are locally meaningful.";"Hibbard, Michael

Like a one-tiered model, the two-tiered model engages stakeholders in face-to-face negotiations to develop a consensus plan. However, to finalize an agreement, recommendations from the first tier are then sent to a second tier of negotiations that includes only two parties – First Nations and the provincial government. This innovative two-tiered collaborative process was designed to meet the unique position of First Nations and address the problem of low First Nations participation in previous single-tiered collaborative planning processes. Results based on 26 evaluative criteria indicate the two-tiered process was successful in increasing First Nations engagement while still meeting the interests of non-aboriginal stakeholders who did not participate at the second tier of negotiations. However, results also indicate a need to revise the two-tiered process to improve buy-in from non-aboriginal stakeholders while continuing to respect First Nations' constitutional rights. With these revisions, results suggest that a two-tiered collaborative planning model is a viable option worthy of consideration for cases in which one or more participants, such as aboriginal populations, have unique rights and interests that need to be accommodated in the process design.";"Morton, Cedar

Numerous small-scale studies have documented changes in indigenous land use in individual communities in the context of expanding frontier settlements and markets, but few studies have included larger populations or multiple ethnic groups. In this paper we use data from a regional-scale survey of five indigenous populations in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon to describe their agricultural land use practices and investigate the factors that affect those practices. We find the areas cultivated by indigenous households to be small compared to those of nearby mestizo colonists, but a large proportion of indigenous cultivated area is in commercial land uses. We also construct multilevel statistical models to investigate the household and community-level factors that affect indigenous land use. The results reveal significant influences on cultivated area from contextual factors such as access to markets, oil company activities, and the land tenure regime, as well as from household characteristics such as demographic composition, participation in alternative livelihood activities, and human, social and physical capitals. Overall the results are most consistent with market integration as an underlying driver of land use change in indigenous territories of the study area.";"Gray, Clark L.

On the levee, 77 of the 114 individuals that had had their floral stalks removed by the first mowing produced new rosettes at the basal part of the stem during the same growing season. The plants that were mowed four times per year had a significantly greater survival rate than the plants that were mowed twice per year. The levee population that was mowed without tillage was largely maintained by vegetative reproduction. These results suggest that mowing the levees promotes the vegetative reproduction of B. vulgaris and helps it to compete with tall-growing plants, thus facilitating its survival as a perennial. In spite of the high sprouting ability of the plant's root fragments, most of the root fragments did not regenerate when buried or when exposed to high soil moisture conditions in tilled wheat fields. The population of B. vulgaris in tilled wheat fields was maintained almost entirely by sexual reproduction. Barbarea vulgaris can survive under two different management regimes by altering its mode of reproduction.";"TACHIBANA, MASAAKI

"AGRIS:US201600202715";"Reconciling Flexibility and Tenure Security for Pastoral Resources: the Geography of Transhumance Networks in Eastern Senegal";"";"The need to maintain or increase livestock mobility in arid Africa has been widely embraced by ecologists, social scientists, and more recently regional governments. These movements are seen to sustain livestock production under a highly variable and changing climate. At the same time, livestock mobility is threatened by the expansion of agriculture onto rangelands. A major conundrum raised in the pastoral development literature is the potential contradiction of the need for spatially-fixed, exclusionary forms of tenure to protect key pastoral resources with the need for socially-porous open systems of resource tenure that ensure flexible access. This has been called the âparadox of pastoral land tenure.â By adopting a transhumance corridor network approach, this paper demonstrates that there is a middle ground where flexible access can be maintained within a fixed network of corridors. A transhumance network includes not only the physical paths or corridors followed by livestock herds but also the encampment sites where livestock pass the night while moving along corridors and the water sources linked to encampment site. This study mapped and characterized 5000Â km of corridors, 744 encampments, and 1010 water points in eastern Senegal. These pastoral features form a network of interconnected resources providing alternative options for travel, water, and forage as herds move along a northâsouth trajectory. The research analyzes spatial variation in the networkâs ability to provide these services (water, quality forage, and travel) as influenced by rainfall variability, cropping pressure, and social institutions. Four distinct zones within the study area were compared with analyses showing variation among them in the importance of different factors shaping access. More broadly, the study demonstrates that extant transhumance networks accommodate the competing needs of pastoral tenure security by facilitating herd movements in response to changing resource availabilities through a series of spatially-fixed components (encampment sites, water points, and corridors) that can be recognized and protected through legislation. Thus, the demands for tenure security and flexible patterns of resource use can both be potentially accommodated.";"Turner, Matthew D.

An outlook on future perspectives of SFHs asks for reliable information onthe phenomenon of SFHs and the impact of policy measures on their development options:(1) intensifying farming, (2) diversifying income creating activities, or (3) exiting farming for waged employment. This article focuses on SFHs and rural non-farm employment (RNFE).On the basis of a comparative 2007-survey of 489 SFHs in Bulgaria, Poland and Romania,three countries with particularly many SFHs, four major types of SFHs (rural pensioners,farmers, rural diversifiers, rural newcomers) were identified. For policy analysis, a multiobjective linear programming household model was developed. In the model, labour can be devoted to (1) farming, (2) self-employment and (3) waged employment. The policy scenarios reflect different development options for SFHs: (1) farm development, (2) start selfemployment,(3) farm development and start self-employment, and (4) stop agriculture.Policy can foster the structural change but the modeling results show that fine targeting to the various types of semi-subsistence farms and country specificities is a strong precondition forsuccess.";"Buchenrieder, Gertrud

Various regional greenhouse gas initiatives and new Federal legislation are providing financial incentives for forest owners to manage for carbon in addition to other forest products. These incentives are intended for landowners who engage in activities that go beyond business as usual practices. Managing for carbon will likely involve foregoing other investment alternatives and increasing rotation lengths. The analysis approach demonstrated here provides a relatively simple method for an owner to compare traditional forest management and regular harvests with letting the trees grow to accumulate more carbon in the forest. Several financial decision statistics are considered and demonstrated with examples. A derivative of land expectation value, called rotation equivalent value, is shown to be a useful decision tool for comparing carbon storage with other management options having different rotation lengths.";"Van Deusen, Paul C.";"";"NRC Research Press";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"landowners";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500051024";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X10-142";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US2016213673";"FOUNDATIONS OF THE NEW AGRICULTURAL STRATEGY";"Új agrárstratégia alapjai";"Az agrártermelés helyzetének romló tendenciája és a vidék kilátástalansága egyre határozottabban követeli egy egységes agrár- és vidékstratégia kialakítását. Erre azonban nemcsak külső okok, de az ágazatban érdekeltek mély belső ellentétei miatt ma sincsen sok remény. Ehhez le kellene számolni sok, a rendszerváltás óta létező, a rendszerváltás törvényei által védett tabuval, amihez az agrárágazat és a vidék sorsa iránt nagyobb felelősségre, alázatra és együttműködésre lenne szükség. Ehhez kíván a rövid tanulmány az alábbiakkal hozzájárulni.Látható, hogy a mezőgazdasági termelés értéke lényegében két évtizede stagnál, miközben a nagyobb hozzáadott értéket és a gazdaság belső vertikumát képező ágaza¬tok, mint a kertészet, az állattenyésztés fokozatosan veszítenek a súlyukból. Amező¬gazdaság szerepe gabona- és olajosmag-termelésre szűkül le. A feldolgozóipar fokozatosan leépül, számottevő termékfejlesztés már hosszú ideje nem folyik. Alacsony hozzáadott értékű élelmiszer-ipari tömegcikkeket gyártanak. Az ipar Nyugat-Európába húzódik vissza, amelyhez szükséges nyersanyagot Kelet-Európa, köztük a magyar mezőgazdaság szolgáltatja, ami egyértelműen kiszolgáltatott, gyarmati helyzetbe juttatja a magyar mezőgazdaságot. A magyar piac megszerzését követő gyárbezárásokkal a nyugati tőke kivonása is megkezdődött a magyar élelmiszer-gazdaságból. A végbement folyamatért az eladósodottságból adódó, fél évszázada tartó gazdasági kiszolgáltatottság és a nemzeti érdekeket háttérbe szorító liberális gazdaságpolitika is felelőssé tehető, de döntő szerepe van ebben a szocialista nagybirtokok romjai felett a rendszerváltás óta tartó osztozkodásnak és gátlástalan marakodásnak, amely a kisüzem vagy nagyüzem fedővita hátterében húzódik meg. Közben egyre elmélyülő válságba kerül a magyar vidék. A helyzet csak a koncentrációs folyamat felgyorsításával, a gazdasági belső vertikumok fejlesztésével, a műszaki fejlődésnek és támogatásoknak az arra alkalmas gazdaságokba való koncentrálásával és a termelői érdekeltségű feldolgozás és forgalmazás fejlesztésével, valamint nemzeti érdekeltségű feldolgozókkal való vertikális kooperációkkal oldható meg. Erre nemcsak törekedni kell, de el kell hárítani mindazokat a fejlődést gátló akadályokat is, amelyek megbénítják az ágazatot és lehetetlenné teszik fejlődését. A legfontosabb a föld(birtok)-politikában a szükséges változások végrehajtása, érintve az öröklési rendszert is. Nem kevésbé fontos volna a birtokok tudatos felaprózását kiváltó adópolitika megváltoz¬tatása is. Ez azt jelentené, hogy a mezőgazdasági üzemek adóalapját a földtulajdon jelentené. Ez fékezné a földspekulációt és fokozná az intenzívebb kultúrák és a gazdasági belső vertikumok (állattenyésztés, feldolgozás) fejlesztését. Nem beszélve arról, hogy jól látható jövedelmi viszonyokat teremtene.     ----------------------------------   Downhill trends in agricultural production and lack of hope for rural communities mean that demand for a single agricultural and rural strategy is steadily growing. External reasons as well as the deep-running antagonism existing among the interested parties leave little hope that such a strategy will actually come into existence. It will never come into being unless numerous taboos – in existence since the change of political system in Hungary and protected by the laws born out the same change – are eliminated. This would require a feeling of greater responsibility for the fate of agriculture and rural areas, as well as humility and stronger cooperation. The paper is intended to contribute to these changes.The value of agricultural production has obviously been stagnating for two decades. Meanwhile, fields which generate greater added value and comprise the vertical structure of economy – such as horticulture and animal husbandry – are gradually losing eight. Agriculture has been limited to the production of grain and oilseeds. The processing industry is declining, and it has been a long time since any significant product development took place. Food industry products with low-added value are being produced for the mass market. Industry is withdrawing into Western Europe, with the necessary raw materials being supplied from Eastern Europe, including the Hungarian agriculture, the latter clearly being forced into a vulnerable, colony-like state. Having acquired the Hungarian market, factories are being closed down and Western capital is being withdrawn from Hungarian food economy. The guilt lies with the country’s economic vulnerability brought about by its indebtedness of half a century; with the liberal economic policy which disregarded national interests; however, the main cause is the unscrupulous fight for the bits and pieces of the former socialist holdings, which has been going on since the change of the political system in Hungary, also known as the debate of small holdings vs. large ones. Meanwhile, the crisis of Hungarian rural areas has deepened. It can only be reversed by speeding up the process of consolidation, developing product paths and supply chains, concentrating technical development and grants to suitable holdings, promoting producers’ interest in processing and distribution operations, and implementing vertical cooperation with processing businesses of national interest. Efforts must be made to reach these goals, and any obstacles which paralyse the industry and inhibit its development should be eliminated. The most important aspect is making the necessary changes to land policy, including the inheritance system. Another major component is changing the current tax policy, which leads to the deliberate fragmentation of holdings. This would mean that the tax base of agricultural facilities would be based on the land they own. This would moderate land speculation and contribute to the development of more intensive cultures and product paths (animal husbandry, processing). What’s more, it would make revenues transparent.";"Buday-Santha, Attila";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"hu";"land consolidation;rural development";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"151;HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016213673";"http://purl.umn.edu/92426";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400061351";"effectiveness of market-based conservation in the tropics: Forest certification in Ecuador and Bolivia";"";"During the last decade, forest certification has gained momentum as a market-based conservation strategy in tropical forest countries. Certification has been promoted to enhance forest management in countries where governance capacities are insufficient to adequately manage natural resources and enforce pertinent regulations, given that certification relies largely on non-governmental organisations and private businesses. However, at present there are few tropical countries with large areas of certified forests. In this study, we conducted semi-structured stakeholder interviews in Ecuador and Bolivia to identify key framework conditions that influence the costs and benefits for companies to switch from conventional to certified forestry operations. Bolivia has a much greater relative area under certified forest management than Ecuador and also significantly more certified producers. The difference in the success of certification between both countries is particularly notable because Bolivia is a poorer country with more widespread corruption, and is landlocked with less access to export routes. Despite these factors, several characteristics of the Bolivian forest industry contribute to lower additional costs of certified forest management compared to Ecuador. Bolivia has stronger government enforcement of forestry regulations a fact that increases the cost of illegal logging, management units are larger, and vertical integration in the process chain from timber extraction to markets is higher. Moreover, forestry laws in Bolivia are highly compatible with certification requirements, and the government provides significant tax benefits to certified producers. Results from this study suggest that certification can be successful in countries where governments have limited governance capacity. However, the economic incentives for certification do not only arise from favourable market conditions. Certification is likely to be more successful where governments enforce forestry laws, provide financial incentives for certified forestry, and provide land tenure security, and where large-scale and vertically integrated forestry operations are commercially feasible. For this reason, at present, there are few developing countries where forest certification is likely to achieve widespread success.";"Ebeling, Johannes

The errors are classified into predicted errors before rasterization and actual errors after that. Accurate prediction of the errors is beneficial to developing reasonable rasterization technical schemes and to making products of high quality. Analyzing and establishing a quantitative relationship between the error and its affecting factors is the key to error prediction. In this study, land cover data of China at a scale of 1:250 000 were taken as an example for analyzing the relationship between rasterization errors and the density of arc length (DA), the density of polygon (DP) and the size of grid cells (SG). Significant correlations were found between the errors and DA, DP and SG. The correlation coefficient (R ²) of a model established based on samples collected in a small region (Beijing) reaches 0.95, and the value of R ² is equal to 0.91 while the model was validated with samples from the whole nation. On the other hand, the R ² of a model established based on nationwide samples reaches 0.96, and R ² is equal to 0.91 while it was validated with the samples in Beijing. These models depict well the relationships between rasterization errors and their affecting factors (DA, DP and SG). The analyzing method established in this study can be applied to effectively predicting rasterization errors in other cases as well.";"Liao, Shunbao

"AGRIS:US201400140410";"Managing biogeochemical cycles to reduce greenhouse gases";"";"This special issue focuses on terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and their roles in determining current continental-scale budgets and future trends in biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) for North America. Understanding the current magnitude and forecasting future trajectories of atmospheric GHG concentrations requires investigation of their biogeochemical origins as well as their responses to (i) environmental changes, including potential feedback effects of climate change, and (ii) changes in human activities, including potential reductions in GHG emissions resulting from improved land management practices. This special issue provides a group of articles describing the current state of continental-scale sources and sinks of biogenic GHGs and potential strategies for managing them in the future. Human activity over the past two centuries, including fossil fuel combustion, clearing of forests, and intensification of agriculture, has led to a dramatic increase in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and other important long-lived GHGs, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). In North America today, fossil fuel combustion is the single most dominant source of GHGs. However, both managed and unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems are significant as both sources and sinks of GHGs resulting from complex biogeochemical processes occurring within these systems. The collection of articles in this special issue indicates that North America is currently a net source of CO2, CH4, and N2O to the atmosphere. For CO2 this source is dominated by fossil fuel burning. Approximately 35% of this fossil fuel CO2 is taken up by North America’s terrestrial ecosystems, largely by forest regrowth from logging earlier in the 20th century. Elevated atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen onto terrestrial ecosystems also contributes to an increase in CO2 uptake. Biogenic CH4 and N2O emissions are significant and offset at least half, in units of CO2 equivalent, of the current terrestrial CO2 uptake. As a result of climate change, these emissions are expected to substantially increase by the end of the 21st century. In addition, increases in fertilizer nitrogen use in agriculture will contribute to rising atmospheric N2O concentrations. There are substantial opportunities, however, to reverse these trends. Leaving aside the issue of reducing fossil fuel combustion, changes in agricultural and forestry management practices for carbon sequestration can result in important reductions in atmospheric CO2. Additionally, there may be effective strategies to mitigate agricultural N2O emissions that reduce agricultural losses of other reactive N forms, thereby improving the outlook for soil, water and air quality.";"Venterea, Rodney T.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"climate change;land management";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"021";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400140410";"http://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59586";"";"";"";""

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area. Considering the above background, this study was conducted with the objectives of developing a land degradation assessment model using a GIS based approach.";"Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed, South Eastern University of Sri Lanka";"";"";"AGRIS";"2013-10-07";"";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"LKA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=CH2016315984";"http://www.scipress.com/ILNS.53.80.pdf";"";"";"";"80-86"

Yet, who benefits from agricultural subsidies is an open question. Economic theory predicts the entire subsidy incidence should be on the farmland owners. Since non-farmers own nearly half of all farmland, this implies that a substantial portion of all subsidies accrue to non-farmers while a significant share of all farmers receive no benefits. Using a complementary set of policy quasiexperiments, I find that farmers who rent the land they cultivate capture 75 percent of the subsidy, leaving just 25 percent for landowners. This finding contradicts the prediction from neoclassical models. The standard prediction may not hold due to less than perfect competition in the farmland rental market; the share captured by landowners increases with local measures of competitiveness in the farm land rental market.";"Kirwan, Barrett E.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204274";"http://purl.umn.edu/42714";"";"";"";""

The survey data are supplemented where feasible with time series from official national-level statistics. We calculate partial land and labor productivity, total factor productivity, and technical efficiency scores (using Stochastic Frontier and Data Envelopment Analysis algorithms) for the two categories of small individual farms and large corporate farms. Our results demonstrate with considerable confidence that small individual farms in Moldova are more productive and more efficient than large corporate farms. This finding is not restricted to Moldova, as a similar result has been obtained by other authors in Russia (2005) and in the U.S. (2002), where a recent study has found that an increase of farm size reduces, rather than increases, agricultural productivity. Policies encouraging a shift from large corporate farms to smaller individual farms, rather than the reverse, can be expected to produce beneficial results for Moldovan agriculture and the economy in general. The government of Moldova should abandon its inherited preference for large-scale corporate farms and concentrate on policies to improve the operating conditions for small individual farms. At the very least, the government should ensure a level playing field for farms of all sizes and organizational forms, and desist from biasing its policies in favor of large farms.";"Lerman, Zvi

Field investigations were undertaken in late 2006 - early 2007 and again in 2008. One commune in each zone had good road infrastructure and associated market access, while the other had poor road access and was more distant from the market. Two rural households were selected from poor, medium and high wealth categories in each commune, providing 36 case households. Sixteen of the 36 case households were undertaking some form of value adding through processing or marketing of crops or livestock. Improved production technologies for basic food crops that underpin food security led to the release of production resources which were then allocated to commercial crops. Entrepreneurial households typically reached out towards markets to first sell their own produce and then began trading the outputs of, and in some cases selling inputs to, fellow households, while still retaining their own production activities. These households often gained first mover status through a special skill set, but then had to provide either lower cost or additional services such as credit to protect their competitive advantage. Successful traders typically required access to working capital, some form of transport, access to market information and trading networks. Input supply chains tended to develop in parallel to, but more slowly than output supply chains. Factors influencing supply chain development included road access and telecommunications, plus commodity-specific factors. Rice supply chains were impacted by non-market institutional factors. In the mountain communes, there were particular issues relating to poverty, ethnic minorities, environmental sustainability, land tenure and physical distance from markets.";"Quan, T.T.

An evaluation of enhancing income and employment generation and environmental externalities due to plantations on wastelands through cooperatives and self-help groups was done. The development process was set up in leased degraded lands in three north Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The capacity building processes like savings and micro-enterprise skills empowered resource-poor farmers. An internal rate of return of 11.5 to 17.0 % in the phase I of the project imply tangible economic benefits at the end of 17 years, which improved to 13.9 to 20.4 % by including environmental benefits like carbon sequestration, soil conservation, soil salinity reclamation, etc. By extrapolating the trend till the end of 30 years, the estimated IRR increased further. The incremental net return due to afforestation of wastelands ranged between Rs. 2283 and 9514 (US $51 -211) ha-1 yr -1 over the pre-developed status. The organization of stakeholders through cooperative societies for developing plantations on degraded lands and managing them for deriving benefits has demonstrated the viability of these models.

A government-based database covering the period 2000–2011 was used to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of the factors influencing forest fire size in the state of Durango, Mexico. Ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models were fit to identify the main factors as well as their spatial influence on fire size. Results indicate that fire size is greatly affected by distance to roads, distance to towns, precipitation, temperature, and a population gravity index. The geographically weighted model was better than the ordinary least squares model. The improvement of the former is due to the influence of factors that were found to be non-stationary. These results suggest that geographic location determines the influence of a factor on fire size. While the models can be greatly improved with additional information, the study suggests the need to adopt fire management policies to more efficiently reduce the effect of anthropogenic factors. These policies may include more training for landowners who use fire for clearing, closure of roads, application of thinning, prescribed burning, and fire breaks in perimeters adjacent to roads.";"Perez-Verdin, Gustavo

Improved decision making about rural lands requires careful consideration of how ecological information and analyses can inform specific planning and policy needs. We provide a brief overview of rural land-use planning, including recently developed approaches to conservation. Effective participation in land-use planning requires ecologists to understand trade-offs---for example, the need to balance a land owner's desire for a fair and predictable process with the ""learn as you go"" approach of adaptive management---and the importance of integrating local knowledge with landscape-level information. Four primary challenges require attention from ecologists to improve rural land-use planning. First is the mismatch between the spatial and temporal scales in which ecological processes occur and the scales and tempos of land-use planning. Second, ecologists must engage in interdisciplinary research to critically evaluate and determine how, if, and when ecological information influences rural land-use outcomes. Third, a comprehensive land-use framework is needed to better place ecological studies within a broader landscape context. Finally, ecologists have a key role in developing environmental indicators that directly inform local, rural land-use planning efforts.";"Theobald, D.M.

It investigates whether female-headed households are more likely to report experiencing a food price shock, and whether female-headed households experiencing a shock are more (or less) likely to adopt certain coping strategies, controlling for individual, household, and community characteristics. Our findings suggest that female-headed households are more vulnerable to food price changes and are more likely to have experienced a food price shock in 2007–2008. Because female-headed households are also resource poor and have a larger food gap compared with male-headed households, they cope by cutting back on the number of meals they provide their households during good months and eating less preferred foods in general. A combination of short-term measures to protect diet diversity and micronutrient consumption of vulnerable groups and longer-term measures to promote investment in sustainable agriculture, such as strengthening women’s property rights, may increase the ability of poor and vulnerable households to cope better with food price increases.";"Kumar, Neha

Areas supporting groundwater fauna were established by modelling the persistence of seven copepod species using a geographical information system (GIS). Environmental drivers were found to influence subterranean copepod distribution in the caves of the Romanian Carpathians. Habitat-based modelling, using ordinary least squares regression and geographically-weighted regression to identify the significant predictors explaining copepod habitat suitability, predicted suitable areas for the selected taxa. The most constant predictor was land cover, a measure of human impact and climate change, followed by precipitation and altitude. The model performed well for the majority of analysed taxa, and the areas predicted as suitable for narrowly distributed taxa overlapped with observed distributions. GIS facilitated the prediction of suitable habitat, and also enabled spatial autocorrelation to be tested. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of sustainable management of the terrestrial surface in limestone areas in conserving copepod biodiversity.";"MELEG, IOANA NICOLETA

"AGRIS:US201301957053";"Saving the sagebrush sea: an ecosystem conservation plan for big sagebrush plant communities";"";"Vegetation change and anthropogenic development are altering ecosystems and decreasing biodiversity. Successful management of ecosystems threatened by multiple stressors requires development of ecosystem conservation plans rather than single species plans. We selected the big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) ecosystem to demonstrate this approach. The area occupied by the sagebrush ecosystem is declining and becoming increasingly fragmented at an alarming rate because of conifer encroachment, exotic annual grass invasion, and anthropogenic development. This is causing range-wide declines and localized extirpations of sagebrush associated fauna and flora. To develop an ecosystem conservation plan, a synthesis of existing knowledge is needed to prioritize and direct management and research. Based on the synthesis, we concluded that efforts to restore higher elevation conifer-encroached, sagebrush communities were frequently successful, while restoration of exotic annual grass-invaded, lower elevation, sagebrush communities often failed. Overcoming exotic annual grass invasion is challenging and needs additional research to improve the probability of restoration and identify areas where success would be more probable. Management of fire regimes will be paramount to conserving sagebrush communities, as infrequent fires facilitate conifer encroachment and too frequent fires promote exotic annual grasses. Anthropogenic development needs to be mitigated and reduced to protect sagebrush communities and this probably includes more conservation easements and other incentives to landowners to not develop their properties. Threats to the sustainability of sagebrush ecosystem are daunting, but a coordinated ecosystem conservation plan that focuses on applying successful practices and research to overcome limitations to conservation is most likely to yield success.";"Davies, Kirk W.

We compared cropland and forest surface temperatures across the continental United States in 16 cells that were approximately 1°×2° using 1km² MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data and land cover from the 0.0009km² National Land Cover Database (NLCD). We found that forest surface temperatures tended to be cooler than cropland surface temperatures. This relationship held for spring, summer, fall, and annually. In winter, cropland surface temperatures were cooler than forest surface temperatures except in the southeastern United States, where forest surface temperatures were also cooler in winter. The difference between cropland and forest surface temperatures was driven by daytime maxima, which tended to be twice as large as differences in nighttime minima. The dominance of daytime maxima was influenced by the degree of continentality. For cells on coastal margins or with a high proportion of inland lakes, differences between cropland and forest nighttime minima tended to be very small. In more continental locations croplands were noticeably cooler at night which often led to insignificant differences between cropland and forest average surface temperatures.";"Wickham, James D.

"AGRIS:US201301855844";"Land use regulates carbon budgets in eastern Germany: From NEE to NBP";"";"The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is influenced by land use and management. Here, the carbon (CO₂-C) budgets of a managed forest (spruce), a grass site and a crop site (crop rotation) have been compared to examine the effects of different management practices on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome productivity (NBP). This approach enables a more comprehensive carbon budgeting as it takes into account carbon exports and imports for particular land uses. Based on NEE measured with the eddy covariance (EC) method, we quantified NBP by also considering the carbon exports due to thinning or harvest and the carbon imports due to organic fertilisation. The sites are part of the Tharandt cluster in eastern Germany, characterised as having only slight differences in weather and climate. As a result, the management effects on the C budgets can be distinguished from other drivers. For the forest site, continuous CO₂ flux measurements are available from 1997 to today, and the common study period of the grassland and cropland sites is 2005-2008 (one crop rotation). Only when considering the forest's annual NEE was there a variability in the net sink from −698gCm⁻² (1999) to −444gCm⁻² (2003), whereas the grassland and cropland sites exhibited small sinks between −177gCm⁻² (2004) and −62gCm⁻² (2005) and between −115gCm⁻² (2005) and −32gCm⁻² (2007 and 2008), respectively. The forest site is a carbon source with an NBP +221gCm⁻² in 2002 because ∼43m³ ha⁻¹ solid wood was removed. The grassland alternated between carbon sources and sinks, with NBP ranging from +25gCm⁻² (2008) to −28gCm⁻² (2006) due to carbon export through several cuts per year. The cropland site was mainly influenced by the cultivated crop species and the application of organic fertiliser (manure), resulting in NBP values between +484gCm⁻² (2007) and −89gCm⁻² (2006). The different timing and length of the growing season for winter and spring crops result in different intra-annual patterns of NEE as well as lower annual net CO₂ sinks for the spring crops. Alternative accounting periods have been defined for all sites starting immediately after the harvest date at the crop site. Based on the full crop rotation period (around 4 years), the NBP showed a C sink for the spruce site and a C source for the crop rotation. The grass site was C neutral according to the calculated NBP.";"Prescher, Anne-Katrin

Because of this, conservation programs have been established to encourage landowners to enroll lands near surface waters to improve water quality. Former cropland enrolled in a conservation program was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in reducing nitrate-nitrogen (NO₃ ⁻-N) in shallow groundwater. This conservation buffer (CB) was up to 80m wide and was planted with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). It was situated upslope of an existing 30–60m wide riparian hardwood forest buffer (EHB) located within the floodplain of an intermittent stream. Shallow groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N, groundwater hydrology, total organic carbon, and soil redox potential were measured throughout both the CB and the EHB for 18 months. Groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N concentrations, often 5–15mgL⁻¹ within the CB, were not significantly reduced from concentrations that entered from the agricultural field edge. However, a decrease in NO₃ ⁻-N concentration was observed within the EHB (17–83%). The hydrology of the CB coupled with relatively low organic carbon contributed to a low denitrification potential and lack of NO₃ ⁻-N reduction compared with the EHB. While the CB enrollment likely provided additional habitat benefits it did not appear to provide treatment of groundwater NO₃ ⁻-N. It is our conclusion that landscape position is a more important defining variable for buffer site selection than buffer width if NO₃ ⁻-N reduction is a primary goal.";"Johnson, Sara R.

This study attempts to present a space-borne satellite-based approach to demonstrate the urban change and its relation with land surface temperature (LST) variation in urban areas of Klang valley, Malaysia. For this purpose an object-based nearest neighbour classifier (S-NN) approach was first applied on SPOT 5 data acquired on 2003 and 2010 and subsequently five land cover categories were extracted. The overall accuracies of the classified maps of 2003 and 2010 were 90.5 % and 91 % respectively. The classified maps were then used as inputs to perform the post classification change detection. The results revealed that the post-classification object-based change detection analysis performed reasonably well with an overall accuracy of 87.5 %, with Kappa statistic of 0.81 %. The changes represented that the urban expanded by 10 % over the period, whereas the urban expansion had caused reduction in soil (1.4 %) and vegetation (11.4 %), and growth in oil palm (2 %), and water (0.7 %). Additionally decision tree method was used to derive the surface heat fluxes from thermal infrared Landsat TM and ETM+bands.

The latter comprise work content, terms of employment, holiday per year and income per year. Using a probit model, the willingness to pay/accept is calculated. The results indicate that there is a strong preference to stay in dairy production. In order to achieve both, maintaining the level of utility and moving away from dairy production, an additional income (willingness to accept) per year of at least CHF 25’000.- would be necessary. The pre-ferences of dairy farmers show that differences between the alternative work contents like suckler cows husbandry, farming without livestock and work outside of agriculture are minor.";"Lips, Markus

Equally important are determining factors that influence such distribution (e.g. land use, land management, topography, etc.). In this research, soil nutrient distribution and its influencing factors were studied in a small-scaled watershed in the purple soil region of Sichuan Province, China. The watershed is 1.3km² with a complex land management system including agriculture and forestry. Surface soil samples (0-20cm) from 48 sites within the watershed were collected in the spring of 1999 and analysed for chemical properties. When spatial distribution patterns of soil organic matter and soil nutrients were considered, several patterns were evident. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen coincided with high soil nutrients in the center of the watershed. Total phosphorus was linked to low soil nutrient contents on hilltops, while total potassium was characterized by low variability and high soil nutrient content throughout the watershed. Water-soluble nutrients in soils were highly variable throughout the watershed. Results of this study indicate that land use, topography and other variables play important roles in controlling the spatial distribution of most soil nutrients. However, the relative roles of these indices were nutrient specific. The relationship was therefore complex. Land use, silt, and sand content contributed to a high level of heterogeneity for soil organic matter and total nitrogen with the former being the dominant factor. Land use, particle size distribution (silt and sand) and topographic factors (slope and elevation) contributed to the variability of total phosphorus. However, particle size distribution and topographic factors were the dominant factors affecting total phosphorus. Elevation influenced the concentration of total potassium and land use controlled the concentration of dissolved phosphorous. No significant relationship was found between the studied characteristics and nitrate nitrogen.";"Wang, H.J.

Our approach was to reconcile measured loads of nutrients exported from the catchment with those estimated based on characterisation of farming practices within the catchment. The latter was based upon detailed surveys of farm practices and soil quality. Monthly stream monitoring showed that median nutrient (N and P), sediment and faecal bacteria concentrations exceeded guidelines recommended for surface waters. Measured specific yields for suspended sediment (SS), total N (TN) and phosphorus (P) discharged from the catchment were 58, 8.2 and 0.43 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively, for the 2001-2005 monitoring period. In comparison, model estimates of N and P losses in drainage and overland flow from farms in the catchment were 10.1 and 0.59 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively. Field measurements, farm management surveys and farm systems modeling have identified some land management practices that appear to be key sources of many of these pollutants. These sources include subsurface drainage systems (including the preferential flow of irrigated effluent through these soils), overland flow from the heavy soils used for dairy farming in the catchment and the practice of intensively wintering cows on forage crops. Modeling suggests that a significant improvement in catchment water quality could be achieved through the implementation of targeted best management practices (BMPs) on dairy farms in the catchment. These include (i) covered feedpad wintering systems for controlling N losses, (ii) nitrification inhibitor use on milking platforms, (iii) deferred irrigation and low rate application of farm dairy effluent and (iv) limiting soil Olsen P to economically optimum levels. The adoption of these BMPs will, in part, depend on their economic viability. This paper therefore presents a double-bottom-line analysis (i.e. environmental and economic) of some of these BMPs and discusses their potential to cost-effectively deliver improved water quality in the Bog Burn catchment.";"Monaghan, R.M.

"AGRIS:US201500041884";"Definition of the potential treeline in the European Alps and its benefit for sustainability monitoring";"";"Sustainability indicator systems often use administrative entities as a reference, which may cause over- or underestimations of results within topographically different regions. Within the European Alps the highest impacts due to human activities are concentrated below the potential treeline, making these zones comparable to the potentially highly impacted surroundings of the European Alps. An application of the area below the potential treeline as a reference unit for sustainability indicators allows for a more equitable comparison of the European Alps and their surroundings. Therefore, we first developed a method for the identification of the potential treeline in the European Alps. In a second step we tested the zones below the potential treeline as a reference unit for landscape indicators. In order to obtain the position of the potential treeline, initially the highest forest areas within 7 transects throughout the Alps were identified using Corine land cover and a DEM. The correlation among the highest 10% of forest occurring within each transect was then represented by means of a polynomial regression. The resulting 7 polynomial functions were applied to the European Alps within 5×5km raster-cells, thus ascertaining the potential treeline. For testing the zones below the potential treeline as a reference unit for landscape indicators we selected a set of 9 landscape indicators, calculating them for 5936 Alpine municipalities. The potential treeline ascertained is able to represent the real potential treeline at a regional scale. The mean altitudes of the defined potential treeline are 2000m at the Alpine margin, and 2200–2350m in the central regions of the European Alps. While in the inner-Alpine regions the actual treeline is on average situated about 350–400m below the potential treeline, the difference is much smaller in the Alpine fringe. Identifying the difference between the potential and the actual treeline allows for the first time an assessment of the intensity of human impact in formerly forested mountain areas. The statistical analysis of the indicator results revealed strong differences among the results, with the difference increasing from the Alpine margin to inner-Alpine regions. We conclude that indicators referring to municipal areas below the potential treeline allow for a more equitable comparison of topographically different regions. Furthermore, such indicators provide detailed information of those zones within the European Alps that are subject to the highest impact due to human activities, which is of prime importance for local decision-making processes.";"Pecher, Caroline

A myriad of indices have been developed to characterize landscape patterns, but not all of them are equally suited to evaluate temporal changes in landscape connectivity as is increasingly needed for biodiversity monitoring and operational indicator delivery. Relevant advancements in this direction have been recently proposed based on graph theoretical methods to analyze landscape network connectivity and on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale. Building from these developments, we modify a recent index and present the equivalent connected area (ECA) index, defined as the size of a single patch (maximally connected) that would provide the same probability of connectivity than the actual habitat pattern in the landscape. The temporal changes in ECA can be directly compared with the changes in total habitat area. This allows for additional and straightforward insights on the degree to which the gains or losses in habitat amount can be beneficial or deleterious by affecting landscape elements that uphold connectivity in a wider landscape context. We provide a demonstrative example of application and interpretation of this index and approach to monitor changes in functional landscape connectivity. We focus on the trends in European forests at the province level in the period 1990–2000 from Corine land cover data, considering both changes in the forest spatial pattern and in the average permeability of the landscape matrix. The degree of connectivity was rather stable over most of the study area, with a slight overall increase in forest connectivity in Europe. However, a few countries and regions concentrated remarkably high changes in the analyzed period, particularly those with a low forest cover. The species traits also affected the responses to landscape pattern changes, which were more prominent for those species with limited dispersal abilities. We conclude discussing the potential of this approach for consistent indicator delivery, as well as the limitations and possibilities of application to a variety of situations, for which the required quantitative tools are freely available as open source projects.";"Saura, Santiago

Therefore, through a comparative statistical analysis applied on Italian FADNregional data, this paper aims at evaluating whether the HC reform had positive impacts on theaggregate expenditure on fertilizers and crop production inputs. From the results, it is observedthat the expansion of profitable crops like vegetables, flowers and vineyards, along with thereceipt of SFP increased the expenditure of fertilizers and crop protection inputs. Such findingssuggest that the HC reform has been so far effective in terms of aligning agricultural productionto markets’ signals, but with the unintended consequence of higher intensification.

As a result, this study has developed an integrated modeling framework called MOPSD (Multi-Objective Programming and System Dynamic) that can be used for spatial land use planning in coastal areas. The case study is Cijin Island, located next to the Kaohsiung harbor, Taiwan; this location demonstrates that the proposed MOPSD modeling approach generates superior results when compared to each of the two traditional methods.

"AGRIS:US201400049150";"Grazing as a post-mining land use: A conceptual model of the risk factors";"";"Driven principally by government regulation and societal expectations, mining companies around the world are seeking to mitigate the environmental impacts of mining through mined land rehabilitation programs. The ultimate goal of rehabilitation is to establish an acceptable and sustainable post-mining land use. Mining companies worldwide face the challenge of specifying just what a sustainable post-mining land use will be. The problem is that while regulations require mining companies to assess post-mining land use sustainability, the mechanism for doing so and the factors that should be considered are not specified. We propose a risk-based approach to post-mining land use assessment with the aim of reducing the uncertainty of mine closure and the potential cost of repair of land degradation caused by inappropriate post-mining land use. Grazing is a commonly suggested post-mining land use, particularly in Australia where most mining activities occur on land previously used for cattle grazing. Grazing is also seen as a use suited to rehabilitated mined land because of the lower land productivity required compared to cropping. In this paper we develop a conceptual model of the factors influencing the land degradation risk posed by grazing on rehabilitated mined land. This was done through a literature review to identify potentially important risk factors, followed by a survey of graziers surrounding six open cut mines within the Bowen Basin Region of Queensland, Australia. The survey results were used to develop a profile of the risk factors likely to influence the land management behaviour of graziers within the Bowen Basin. The results of the research highlight that there are three main sets of factors that affect grazing risk on rehabilitated mined land. These are site biophysical characteristics that influence land productivity and commercial grazing viability, factors that influence the land management style of a grazier (principally stocking rate decisions), and factors that influence the commitment of a grazier to comply with any caveats placed on the management of the land. The profile of risk factors obtained for Bowen Basin graziers showed that grazing is likely to be a low risk post-mining land use where land productivity is high enough to support commercial cattle grazing and where land is managed by local graziers. Both the conceptual model and the profile of risk factors described in this paper are precursors to the development of a predictive risk assessment model.";"Maczkowiack, R.I.

"AGRIS:US201400036352";"myth of encroachment";"";"Scholars of pastoralism often refer to changes of pastoral land tenure as ‘encroachment.’ The New Zealand case of pastoral land tenure reform suggests that this is incorrect for several reasons. First it takes the point of view of the pastoralist, which introduces unnecessary bias. Second, it assumes that all changes in land tenure are situations in which the state, or another powerful agent, takes land away from the less powerful pastoralists. Third, it assumes a single immutable power relation between the state (or other external actor initiating land tenure reform) and the pastoralist in which the state is more powerful and is only too happy to exercise its power whilst expropriating the pastoralists of the land they use. The term ‘encroachment’ implies that there is just one pattern of land tenure change. I suggest that land tenure reform is a more apt, less biased, descriptor.";"Brower, Ann";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land use;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"NZL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400036352";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-7136-2-3";"";"";"";"31"
"AGRIS:US201500209527";"Impact of terrain attributes, parent material and soil types on gully erosion";"";"Gully erosion is a worldwide matter of concern because of the irreversible losses of fertile land, which often have severe environmental, economic and social consequences. While most of the studies on the gullying process have investigated the involved mechanisms (either overland flow incision, seepage or piping erosion), only few have been conducted on the controlling factors of gully wall retreat, an important, if not the dominant, land degradation process and sediment source in river systems. In a representative 4.4km² degraded area of the Drakensberg foothills (South Africa) the main objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the rate of gully bank retreat (GBR) and parent material, soil types and selected terrain attributes (elevation, specific drainage area, mean slope gradient, slope length factor, stream power index, compound topographic index and slope curvatures). The survey of gully bank retreat was performed during an entire hydrological year, from September 2007 to September 2008, using a network of pins (n=440 from 110 pits). Both the gully contours and pin coordinates were determined, using a GPS with a 0.5m horizontal accuracy (n=20,120). The information on the parent material and the soil types was obtained from field observations complemented by laboratory analysis, while terrain attributes were extracted from a 20m DEM generated from 5m interval contour lines. The average GBR value for the 6512m of gully banks found in the area was 0.049±0.0013my⁻¹, which, considering bank height and soil bulk density, corresponded to an erosion rate of 2.30tonha⁻¹y⁻¹. There was no significant difference in GBR between sandstone and dolerite and between Acrisols and Luvisols. Despite a weak one-to-one correlation with the selected terrain attributes (r<0.2), a principal component analysis (PCA), the first two axes of which explained 68% of the data variability, pointed out that GBR was the highest at hillslope inflexion points (profile and plan slope curvatures close to zero), in the vicinity of the head cuts and for drainage areas up to 500m², as both situations experience a high removal rate of the soil material produced from the gully bank collapse and protecting gullies from laterally retreating. These results could be used to digitally map the more active gully banks for the improved implementation of preventive measures of gully growth, if high resolution DEMs are available. There remained, however, a certain amount of unexplained variability in the data, that further research studies on the mechanisms and associated factors of control of GBR could help to address.";"Chaplot, Vincent";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500209527";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.10.031";"";"";"";"1-11"
"AGRIS:US201500209524";"Differentiating the relative importance of land cover change and geomorphic processes on fine sediment sequestration in a logged watershed";"";"Timber harvest often results in accelerated soil erosion and subsequent elevated fine (<2mm) sediment delivery to channels causing deleterious effects to numerous aquatic species, particularly salmonid fishes. Here we determine, through sediment physical analyses (pebble counts, embeddedness surveys, and interstitial shelter space counts) and geochemical analyses (⁷Be and ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ activities), the amount and timing of delivery of fine sediment currently found on streambeds of the Narraguagus River watershed in coastal Maine. The role of recent timber harvest, documented via aerial photo spatial analysis, on fine sediment delivery is contrasted with the ability of the glacially influenced topography and surficial geology to deliver fine sediment to streams and to influence channel substrate. Results show that of the land use and geomorphic variables examined, only ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ activities were significantly correlated with the amount of upstream harvest (r²=0.49). Concurrently, we find that unit stream power (particularly the slope component) explains much of the variability in channel substrate and that slope and stream power are largely influenced by the legacy of Pleistocene glaciation on channel form. Results suggest a conceptual model whereby fine sediment delivery as a result of late twentieth century timber harvest is likely dampened because of the low gradient landscape of coastal Maine. While geochemical tracers indicate recent fine sediment delivery in harvested areas, channels are likely capable of quickly winnowing these fines from the channel bed. These results further suggest that under contemporary land use conditions, the geomorphic and geologic setting represents a first-order control on channel substrate and habitat suitability for salmonid fishes, including federally endangered Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), in coastal drainages of northeastern Maine.";"Kasprak, Alan

"AGRIS:US201600004105";"Invasion of an Exotic Shrub into Forested Stands in an Agricultural Matrix";"";"We investigated the relative importance of stand and landscape characteristics in the invasion of a nonnative shrub, Amur honeysuckle, in 40 woodlots in an agricultural matrix in southwest Ohio. We quantified stand characteristics that could influence invasibility, the intrinsic susceptibility of an area to invasion, including woodlot size, perimeter-to-area ratio, tree basal area, and stand age. At the landscape scale we included factors that potentially influence propagule rain (the contribution of seeds from individuals established outside the focal area), including the land cover and road density in a 1,500-m buffer around each woodlot, as well as the extent to which the perimeter was forested at two points in the past, and latitude (based on an apparent south-to-north invasion in this region). Based on stepwise regression, we determined that honeysuckle cover was determined primarily by landscape parameters, particularly the percent of the buffer comprised of cropland. Woodlots surrounded by more cropland had less honeysuckle cover, which we attribute to paucity of nearby seed sources and/or minimal movement of seed-dispersing animals. From these findings, we argue that impediments to propagule rain are more important in shaping the invasion of this exotic shrub than are characteristics of the woodlots themselves, i.e., community invasibility.Nomenclature: Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder.Management Implications: Understanding the factors that make forests susceptible to invasion can inform management strategies, including identifying forest stands at greatest risk of invasion and formulating steps that can be taken to minimize invasion risk. We investigated what stand and landscape characteristics best explained the cover of the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii (Amur honeysuckle), in a landscape it recently invaded, consisting of woodlots in an agricultural matrix in southwest Ohio. We found that cover of this shrub was best explained by landscape characteristics, rather than by stand characteristics, such as age or basal area. Specifically, the percentage of the 1,500-m buffer around the woodlot that was comprised of cropland, as opposed to pasture, forest, and other land-cover types, was the best predictor of honeysuckle cover. Woodlots surrounded by more cropland had lower cover, which we think indicates more recent colonization. Thus cropland impedes honeysuckle invasion, either by providing a buffer free of seed sources (fruiting shrubs), or a land cover that is unlikely to be crossed by animals dispersing seeds from more distant sources. These findings suggest that woodlots surrounded by cropland, and perhaps by other shrub-free land covers, are at lower risk of invasion by animal-dispersed nonnative plants, and that active management of buffers around forest stands will reduce invasion risk.";"Gorchov, David L.

"AGRIS:US201301656083";"Swidden Transformations and Rural Livelihoods in Southeast Asia";"";"This paper explores the major interactions between the transformation of swidden farming and the pursuit of rural livelihoods in the uplands of Southeast Asia. The paper draws on selected literature, workshop reflections, and six case studies to describe the causal processes and livelihood consequences of swidden change. Household-level livelihood responses have included both the intensification and 'dis-intensification' of swidden land-use, the insertion of cash crops, the redeployment of household labour, and the taking on of broader (often non-rural) livelihood aspirations and strategies. At the community level there have been emerging institutional arrangements for management of land and forests, and varying degrees of participation in or resistance to government schemes and programs. Swidden change has led to the loss and also the reassertion, realignment, and redefinition of cultures and identities, with important implications for access to resources. The impacts of these changes have been varied. Cash crops have often improved livelihoods but complete specialisation for the market increases vulnerability. Thus swidden can still provide an important safety net in the face of market fluctuations. Improved access to markets and social provision of education and health care have mostly improved the welfare of previously isolated groups. However, growing differences within and between communities in the course of swidden transformations can leave some groups marginalized and worse off. These processes of differentiation can be accentuated by heavy-handed state interventions based on swidden stereotypes. Nevertheless, communities have not passively accepted these pressures and have mobilized to protect their livelihood assets and strategies. Thus swidden farmers are not resisting appropriate and supportive forms of development. They are adopting new practices and engaging with markets, but in many situations swidden is still important to their livelihood strategies, providing resilience in the face of turbulent change. Active involvement of local people is essential in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating development and conservation programs in swidden lands. Positive market incentives and supportive government policies are better than standardised, top-down directives.";"Cramb, R. A.

"AGRIS:US201400094747";"Spatial Analysis to Site Satellite Storage Locations for Herbaceous Biomass in the Piedmont of the Southeast";"";"Herbaceous biomass, harvested and handled as hay, has potential for bioenergy production. In the Upper Southeast, fields that cannot be competitively managed to produce another crop can produce an acceptable yield of switchgrass. Using a delayed harvest (crop is allowed to dry standing in the field), switchgrass can be harvested from production fields over a 6-month period. This gives a significant advantage over a crop residue, like corn stover, which is collected over a 5-week harvest season in the Midwest. The Southeast has the potential to be a major bioenergy production region. A land cover database, classified with 2006 aerial photography, was used to identify potential switchgrass fields within 48-km radii of Gretna and Keysville, two small towns in South Central Virginia. The total potential switchgrass production was then calculated for each area. A possible set of satellite storage locations (SSLs) for the temporary storage of round bales was generated using a raster-based approach. Transportation analysis was used to determine the travel distance from the SSLs to a hypothetical bioenergy plant. Within a 48-km radius of Gretna, it was determined that about 6.4% of the total land area could be attracted into production using a conservative assumption for change in existing land use. Using a more optimistic assumption, as much as 10.5% of the total land area could be attracted into production. For the 48-km radius around Keysville, the percentage ranged from 5.6% to 9.5%. Assuming an average yield of 11.2 Mg/ha, the area around Gretna could supply a bioenergy plant consuming from 61 up to 98 Mg/h (continuous operation, 47 wk/y). For Keysville, the size of plant that could be supplied ranged from 48 to 80 Mg/h. The mass-distance parameters for the Gretna and Keysville production areas were almost equal, 42.7 and 41.9 km, respectively, indicating that both study areas had a similar feedstock production distribution.";"Resop, J.P.

"AGRIS:US2016217414";"THE MARGINAL COST OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES";"";"We provide a new approach for assessing the cost of marginal ecosystem changes and the effectiveness of agri-environmentalschemes. The approach is based on a theoretical and empirical analysis of the bio-economic production interactions betweenmarketed outputs and non-marketed ecosystem services at the micro level. To frame the economic nature of the problem, weemploy a generalized joint production model in combination with cost minimization. The generalized joint production frameworkallows for the consideration of complementary, substitutive and competitive relationships between agricultural production andnon-marketed ecosystem services generation and avoids double counting. From this theoretical model we distinguish threetheoretical cases depending on the imposed minimum acceptable level of the non-marketed ecosystem services. We employ farmlevel panel data for the UK to empirically investigate these cases. More specifically, to represent and evaluate the productionstructure, we estimate first- and second-order elasticities derived from a flexible transformation function. Results show that themajority of farms produce agricultural output and ecosystem services in a complementary relationship. Generation of multipleecosystem services on the same farm showed either a substitutive or competitive relationship. A change in the composition of theecosystem services output would have very different implications for individual farms.

"AGRIS:DJ2012066760";"Land Tenure and Land Productivity: A Case of Maize Production in Swaziland";"";"Food production in Swaziland follows a dualistic pattern of the land tenure system, namely; the Traditional Tenure System (TCT) and the Title Deed Tenure system (TDT). Land tenure plays a major role in the development and performance of the agricultural sector by influencing land ownership and its use. The Ministry of Agriculture has observed the differential in maize production among the TCT and TDT farmers. The purpose of this study was to empirically establish whether land tenure as an institution contributes to the observed maize productivity differentials among Swazi farmers. Maize as a staple food for the Swazi Nation and used as a measure of food security, was used in the study to present the impacts of land tenure on maize productivity. The study used a purposive sampling technique to obtain a sample of 63 farmers from both TCT and TDT. Data were collected in 2008 from the Manzini region. Data were analyzed using descriptive and recursive regression models. The results confirmed the existence of differentials in maize yields and the size of land holdings between TDT and TCT farming households. Tenure security was found to influence land improvements through access and use of credit, while the level of education influenced the use of credit. Maize productivity was positively influenced by the amount of capital used, while TCT farmers are constrained by finance and land availability. The results further indicated that TDT farmers were highly mechanized, while TCT farmers mainly used livestock to cultivate their land. Therefore, there is a need for the review of the land tenure system in order to clearly and sufficiently define tenure rights on TCT so, as to promote land productivity.";"D.D. Dlamini

"AGRIS:US201500058294";"Urban land use types contribute to grassland conservation: The example of Berlin";"";"Urbanisation is an important driver of biodiversity loss, also contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation of grasslands at the urban-rural interface. While urban green spaces are known to include many grassland habitats, it is uncertain to what extent urban land use types harbour grasslands of special conservation interest and whether patch characteristics and connectivity of these differ from grasslands on agricultural land. By relating the city-wide biotope mapping to the land use mapping of Berlin, Germany, we assessed (1) to which specific urban land use types the major grassland biotope types belong, (2) differences in patch characteristics and connectivity, and (3) the conservation value of grassland patches at a typological level by means of their legal protection status. Grasslands cover 5% of Berlin's surface, and 43% of that area is assigned to legally protected grassland types. The majority of legally protected grassland (71%) lies on urban land opposed to 29% on agricultural land. Airports and historic parks, which only cover 2% of land in Berlin, contain one-third of all protected dry grasslands. Wet grassland is more confined to agricultural land. In airports and agricultural areas, grassland patches are larger but of a more complex shape than those in historic parks. In airports, grassland patches show greater connectivity as they are situated in grassland-dominated surroundings. Grassland in historic parks appears to be more vulnerable due to smaller patch sizes and higher fragmentation. The example of Berlin demonstrates that the urban green infrastructure can clearly contribute to grassland conservation and may thus partially compensate for the decline of traditional grasslands in cultural landscapes. It will be important to involve residents and landowners in urban grassland conservation and management because most grassland of special conservation interest (57%) was found outside of conservation areas.";"Fischer, Leonie K.

"AGRIS:US201301107497";"Scenario development to explore the future of Europe's rural areas";"";"Changes in rural areas, such as depopulation and land abandonment, but also intensification and loss of biodiversity, usually proceed very slowly yet are often irreversible. A scenario study (called EURURALIS) was carried out by Wageningen University and Research Centre in combination with the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) to stimulate the strategic discussion among both national policy makers and policy makers at the European Union level on the future of Europe's rural areas and the role of policy instruments. After a review of previous scenario studies, the choice was made to elaborate strategic scenarios, built on a 2 x 2 matrix, where the axes represent the most critical uncertainties. The four scenarios were structured along two axes: (1) ranging from increasing globalisation to a world of regional economic and cultural blocks and (2) ranging from a future of lean governments to a future with ambitious government regulation. The storylines were inspired by earlier work such as the emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (SRES), the GEO-3 scenarios and scenarios of the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). The current scenario study includes the 25 EU member states and had a time horizon up to 2030. The scenarios were quantified with a chain of models, ranging from global models to a spatially explicit model, which simulated land use on a 1 km x 1 km grid for the whole EU. The scenarios and their outcomes are presented by means of a CD. This paper describes the steps taken, proceeding from the general aim of the study on to the scenario set-up and then to the actual storylines and quantification of the scenarios. The outcomes of the scenarios are presented in three other articles in this issue.";"Westhoek, H.J.

Soil erosion was estimated by integrating the universal soil loss equation (USLE) model with GIS. The main factors affecting soil erosion including rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, cover and management factor, and conservation supporting practice factor were determined from precipitation data, soil sample analysis, digital elevation model, land use and land cover, and empirical assessment, respectively. The results showed that the average annual soil erosion was 31.18 t hm⁻²year⁻¹, far above the soil loss tolerance maximum of 5.0 t hm⁻²year⁻¹in the region. Regional soil erosion risk (SER) was estimated and categorized into five classes in terms of intensity (minimal, low, moderate, high, and intense), and 70.3 % of the total area was classified as minimal or low erosion risk. The soil erosion map was linked to land use and soil depth maps to explore the relationship between soil erosion and environmental factors and identify the areas of SER. The results can be used to advise the local people to prioritize critical areas for soil erosion prevention measures. The study also indicated that the USLE-GIS methodology allowed for relatively easy and cost-effective evaluation of SER with explicit spatial input.";"Zhu, Mingyong";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500184739";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3947-5";"";"";"";"7899-7908"

"AGRIS:US2016210507";"Sources of Agricultural Productivity Growth in Central Asia";"";"The paper examines agricultural production and productivity growth in two Central Asian countries – Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Both countries are characterized by a significant shift of resources from the traditional Soviet model of collective agriculture to more market-compliant individual and family farming. In both countries, the beginning of the policy-driven switch to family farming around 1997 coincided with the beginning of recovery in agriculture, namely resumption of agricultural growth after a phase of transition decline since 1991. In addition to growth in total agricultural production, we also observe significant increases in productivity of both land and labor since 1997. These observations suggest that productivity growth may be attributable to the changes in farming structure in Central Asia. To check this conjecture we assess the sources of growth by applying the standard Solow growth accounting methodology. Using time series of country statistics for farms of different organizational forms, we decompose the growth in output into growth in the resource base (extensive growth) and growth in productivity (intensive growth). Solow growth accounting clearly shows that, first, much of the growth at the country level is attributable to increases in productivity rather than increases in resources and, second, the increases in productivity in family farms (especially household plots) outstrip the increases in productivity in former collective and state farms. These findings confirm that the recovery of agricultural production in Central Asia has been driven largely by productivity increases, and it is the individual farms that are the main source of agricultural productivity increases.";"Lerman, Zvi

"AGRIS:US201400146243";"Migrants, land markets and carbon emissions in Jambi, Indonesia: Land tenure change and the prospect of emission reduction";"";"Policies designed to reduce land-based carbon emissions require a good understanding of the complex connections between state-sanctioned concessions, forest conversion, informal land markets and migrants. Our case study in the peat forests of the Tanjung Jabung Barat (TanJaBar) regency of Jambi, Indonesia aimed to explore relations between four key stakeholder groups: the state, local communities, migrants, and state-sanctioned concessions. We hypothesized that current land use patterns are shaped by insecurity in formal forest tenure alongside informal land tenure arrangements with migrants. In analyzing the six two-way relationships between the four stakeholder groups, we found that interactions between the stakeholders have changed local norms and practice, causing land conflicts and contested claims that need to be explicitly addressed in efforts to reduce carbon emissions in TanJaBar. Relational concepts of land rights between migrants and local community leaders are informed by social identity, expectations of investment opportunities, insecure customary forest tenure and competing land use policies. Migrants act as intermediaries in shaping the land tenure system and shift the balance of power between local communities, the state, and business concessions. We conclude that effective and equitable implementation of national Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation+ (REDD+) programs will need to recognize underlying land ownership dynamics, power struggles and strategic positioning among stakeholders across scales. Obtaining free and prior informed consent (FPIC) from all relevant stakeholders is a major challenge given this complexity. Low emission development strategies will require recognition of a reality beyond large-scale concessions and traditional local communities.";"Galudra, Gamma

"AGRIS:US201400146240";"Implications of uncertainty and scale in carbon emission estimates on locally appropriate designs to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+)";"";"This study combined uncertainty analysis of carbon emissions with local stakeholders' perspectives to develop an effective Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) scheme at the district level. Uncertainty of carbon emission estimates depends on scale while local stakeholders' views on plausible REDD+ schemes influence and limit transaction costs. The uncertainty analysis formed the basis for determining an appropriate scale for monitoring carbon emission estimates as performance measures for REDD+ incentives. Our analysis of stakeholder’ perspectives explored (i) potential location and activities for lower emission development pathways, and (ii) perceived fair allocation of REDD+incentives. Our case study focused on frontier forest in Tanjung Jabung Barat District, Jambi, Indonesia. The uncertainty analysis used Monte Carlo simulation techniques using known inaccuracy of land cover classification and variation in carbon stocks assessment per land cover type. With decreasing spatial resolution of carbon emission maps, uncertainty in carbon estimates decreased. At 1� km² resolution uncertainty dropped below 5� %, retaining most of the coarser spatial variation in the district. Fairness, efficiency and transaction cost issues in the design of REDD+ mechanisms were readily recognized by local stakeholders, who converged on an equal allocation to short-term efficiency (emission reduction activities) and long-term fairness (alternative livelihood development). A striking difference occurred in desirable transaction costs (which include monitoring, reporting and verification), with Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) aiming for 8� %, while government and researchers accepted transaction costs of 40� %. Feasible measures for emission reduction in the district, derived from a participatory planning process, are compatible with the 1� km² spatial resolution of performance measures.";"Lusiana, Betha

"AGRIS:US201400106804";"Estimating impervious surfaces from medium spatial resolution imagery: a comparison between fuzzy classification and LSMA";"";"Impervious surfaces are important environmental indicators and are related to many environmental issues, such as water quality, stream health and the urban heat island effect. Therefore, detailed impervious surface information is crucial for urban planning and environment management. To extract impervious surfaces from remote sensing imagery, many algorithms and techniques have been developed. However, there are still debates over the strengths and limitations of linear versus nonlinear algorithms in handling mixed pixels in the urban landscapes. In the meantime, although many previous studies have compared various techniques, few comparisons were made between linear and nonlinear techniques. The objective of this study is to compare the performance between nonlinear and linear methods for impervious surface extraction from medium spatial resolution imagery. A linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) and a fuzzy classifier were applied to three Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images acquired on 5 April 2004, 16 June 2001 and 3 October 2000, which covered Marion County, Indiana, United States. An aerial photo of Marion County with a spatial resolution of 0.14 m was used for validation of estimation results. Six impervious surface maps were yielded, and an accuracy assessment was performed. The root mean square error (RMSE), the mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R²) were calculated to indicate the accuracy of impervious surface maps. The results show that the fuzzy classification outperformed LSMA in impervious surface estimation in all seasons. For the June image, LSMA yielded a result with an RMSE of 13.2%, while the fuzzy classifier yielded an RMSE of 12.4%. For the April image, LSMA yielded an accuracy of 21.1% and the fuzzy classifier yielded 17.0%. For the October image, LSMA yielded a result with an RMSE of 19.8%, but the fuzzy classifier yielded an RMSE of 17.5%. Moreover, a subset image of the commercial, high-density and low-density residential areas was selected in order to compare the effectiveness of the developed algorithms for estimating impervious surfaces of different land use types. The result shows that the fuzzy classification was more effective than LSMA in both high-density and low-density residential areas. These areas prevailed with mixed pixels in the medium resolution imagery, such as ASTER. The results from the tested commercial area had a very high RMSE value due to the prevalence of shade in the area. It is suggested that the fuzzy classifier based on the nonlinear assumption can handle mixed pixels more effectively than LSMA.";"Hu, Xuefei

Estimating ET in the Great Plains is a prerequisite for effective regional water resource management of the Ogallala (High Plains) Aquifer, which supplies vital water resources in the form of irrigation for extensive agricultural production. The Sand Hills region of Nebraska is one of the largest grass-stabilized eolian (windblown) sand dune formations in the world, with an area of roughly 50,000–60,000 km2 that supports a system of five major land cover types: (1) lakes, (2) wetlands (with lakes, ~5%), (3) subirrigated meadows (water table is within ~1 m of surface; ~10%), (4) dry valleys (water table is 1–10 m below surface; ~20%), and (5) upland dunes (water table is more than 10 m below surface; ~65%). Fully understanding the hydrologic regime of these different ecosystems is a fundamental challenge in regional water resource assessment. The surface energy and water balances were analyzed using Bowen Ratio Energy Balance Systems (BREBS) at three locations: (1) a meadow, (2) a valley, and (3) an upland dune. Measurement of the energy budget by BREBS, in concert with Landsat remote sensing image processing for 2004 reveals strong spatial gradients between sites in latent heat flux that are associated with undulating topographic relief. We find that daily estimates of ET from BREBS measurements and remote sensing agree well, with an uncertainty within 1 mm, which is encouraging when applying remote sensing results across such a broad spatial scale and undulating topography.";"Healey, Nathan C.

In this approach, quantification of the factors was executed on priority basis by pair-wise comparison of the factors. Couple comparing matrix of the factors were being made with reasonable consistency for understanding relative dominance of the factors as well as for assigning weighted mean/prioritized factor rating value for each landslide triggering factors through arithmetic mean method using MATLAB Software. The factor maps/thematic data layers were generated with the help of SOI Topo-sheet, LIIS-III Satellite Image (IRS P6/Sensor-LISS-III, Path-107, Row-052, date-18/03/2010) by using Erdas Imagine 8.5, PCI Geomatica, Arc View and ARC GIS Software. Landslide frequency (%) for each class of all the thematic data layers was calculated to assign the class weight value/rank value. Then, weighted linear combination (WLC) model was implied to determine the landslide susceptibility coefficient value (LSCV or ‘M’) integrating factors weight and assigned class weight on GIS platform. Greater the value of M, higher is the propensity of landslide susceptibility over the space. Then Shivkhola watershed was classified into seven landslide susceptibility zones and the result was verified by ground truth assessment of existing landslide location where the classification accuracy was 92.86 and overall Kappa statistics was 0.8919.";"Mondal, Sujit

"AGRIS:US201600023506";"Image interpreter tool: An ArcGIS tool for estimating vegetation cover from high-resolution imagery";"";"Land managers need increased temporal and spatial resolution of rangeland assessment and monitoring data. However, with flat or declining land management and monitoring agency budgets, such increases in sampling intensity are unlikely unless new methods can be developed that capture data of key rangeland indicators at a lower cost. Remote sensing techniques have shown promise for collecting plant community composition and ground cover data efficiently. However, many image analysis techniques require software and expertise not always available to field offices. This article describes Image Interpreter Tool (IIT): a series of ArcGIS 9.3 tools and workflow procedures that have been developed to meet this need. The tool and procedures were designed to streamline: 1) the calibration of image interpretation users, and 2) the collection of vegetation and ground-cover types for a study site or project. IIT is distributed as a customized ArcMap document or template with nothing to install, and is compact enough to be used on portable storage devices such as USB thumb drives. IIT can be used by people with little or no GIS experience and reduces recording errors by providing an automated system for attributing data files. IIT mimics point-intercept field-sampling methods using remotely sensed data, “virtual” points along transects, and a simple and intuitive interface-to-estimate cover. Three main cover categories are used: noncanopy (rock, litter, soil, and lichens), herbaceous cover (grass and forbs), and woody canopy (subshrub, shrub, tree, and succulent). Additionally, users can toggle between true color and color-infrared versions of the imagery (assuming four-band imagery is used as a source) with a simple click of a button on the interface. IIT is easy to learn and is designed to facilitate multiple users producing consistent results. IIT is divided into two modules: 1) an observer training and calibration module that includes quality assurance and quality control procedures, and 2) a data collection module.";"Schrader, T. Scott

"AGRIS:US201300755702";"Biodiversity of the ground-dwelling spider fauna of afforestation habitats";"";"The aim of this study was to assess spider diversity among habitats that are typically used for afforestation in Ireland, and to identify habitat parameters which could potentially be used as indicators of their biodiversity value. Ground-dwelling spiders were surveyed in 24 sites across Ireland, with eight sites of each of the following habitat types: improved grassland, wet grassland and peatland. The spiders were sampled using pitfall traps which were located within the major vegetation types present in each site as well as within supplementary habitat features which may add to biodiversity value of the whole site such as hedgerows, flushes and the edges of ditches and streams. Each habitat supported distinct spider assemblages that reflect major differences in both environmental conditions and management regime. The improved grasslands had low spider species richness and low variation in assemblage structure which is probably related to the intensive management of this habitat. In this case hedgerows maybe an important aspect of the spider diversity within agricultural landscapes. The peatlands, and to a lesser extent wet grasslands, supported a diverse and specialist spider fauna, including a number of rare species; this may be due to differences in soil moisture and plant architecture. Indicators of biodiversity value identified included wet flushes in the peatlands and low grazing pressure in the wet grasslands. This study suggests that in terms of biodiversity value improved grassland is the preferable habitat for afforestation, because of the poor baseline spider diversity. However, it may be unrealistic to expect land owners to afforest their most productive agricultural land, so the management and habitat indicators identified in this study may be of use for assessing habitat quality among the wet grassland and peatlands to allow sites with lower biodiversity value to be identified.";"Oxbrough, A.G.

We studied the response of Eryngium alpinum, a vulnerable species, to this extreme climatic event and different agricultural practices. A demographic study was conducted in seven field sites between 2001 and 2010. Stage-specific vital rates were used to parameterize matrix population models and perform stochastic projections to calculate population growth rates and estimate extinction probabilities. Among management regimes, spring grazing and land abandonment decreased vital rates and population growth, while autumn grazing and late mowing had positive effects on population viability. The 2003 heatwave reduced fecundity rates and survival rates. Only spring grazed sites presented considerable extinction risk. Stochastic projections showed that an increased frequency of 2003-like events may exacerbate extinction risk, but extinction probability depends mainly on land management regimes. To better conserve E. alpinum populations, we recommend conversion of presently spring grazed and abandoned sites to late mowing or autumn grazing.";"Andrello, Marco

Budgeted at USD 40 billion, GGP has converted over 20 million hectares of cropland and barren land into primarily tree-based plantations. Although GGP includes energy forests, only a negligible part (0.6%) is planted as such, most of the land (78%) being converted for protection. Future use of these plantations is unclear and an energy substitution hypothesis is valid. We estimate the overall carbon sequestration via GGP using official statistics and three approaches, based on i) net primary production, ii) IPCC's greenhouse gas inventory guidelines, and iii) mean annual increment. We highlight uncertainties associated with GGP and the estimates. Results indicate that crop- and barren-land conversion sequestered 222–468 Mt of carbon over GGP's first ten years, the IPCC approach yielding the highest estimate and the other two approaches yielding similar but lower estimates (approximately 250 Mt of carbon). The carbon stock in these plantation systems yields a mean of 12.3 t of carbon per hectare. Assessment uncertainties concern the use of growth curves not designed for particular species and locations, actual plantation survival rates, and discrepancies in GGP figures (e.g., area, type, and survival rate) at different authority levels (from national to local). The carbon sequestered in above- and below-ground biomass from GGP represents 14% (based on the median of the three approaches) of China's yearly (2009) carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use and cement production.";"Persson, Martin

Given the importance of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP; i.e. the scale dependency of area-based information), a comprehensive understanding of how the changes of biocapacity across scales (i.e. the resolution of data) is pivotal for regional sustainable development. Here, we present case studies on the effect of spatial scales on the biocapacity estimated for two typical river basin and watershed in Northwest China. The analysis demonstrated that the area sizes of major land covers and subsequently biocapacity showed strong signals of scale dependency, with minor land covers in the region shrinking while major land covers expanding when using large-grain (low resolution) data. The relationship between land cover sizes and their change ratio across scales was shown to follow a logarithm function. The biocapacity estimated at 10 × 10 km resolution is 10% lower than the one estimated at 1 × 1 km resolution, casting doubts on many regional and global studies which often rely on coarse scale datasets. Our results not only suggest that fine-scale biocapacity estimates can be extrapolated from coarse-scale ones according to the specific scale-dependent patterns of land covers, but also serve as a reminder that conclusions of regional and global un-sustainability derived from low-resolution datasets could be a fallacy due to the MAUP.";"Yue, Dongxia

Using a survey, effectiveness of three kinds of tools were assessed: (a) basic needs, (b) learning, and (c) social. Across all types and typologies, learning tools were most likely to influence landowner behavior, whereas social tools (e.g., recognition) were least likely. Continuing adopters were the only type of landowners that reported basic needs tools would influence them at the same level as learning tools. In each typology, landowner types with higher behavioral intention were more likely to be influenced by all of the tools. Thus, tools may reinforce behaviors, rather than engage the unengaged.

"AGRIS:US201301616737";"Land use vs. fragment size and isolation as determinants of small mammal composition and richness in Atlantic Forest remnants";"";"The remaining Atlantic Forest fragments are structurally isolated by a matrix of pastures, plantations, or urban areas, and most remnants are small (<100ha). Island biogeography theory has been used to predict the effects of such fragmentation in the remaining fragments, but human activities and land use around fragments may be equally important. A related question is which aspects of land use have a strong effect on biodiversity. We compare the relative importance of fragment size and isolation vs. land use around fragments as determinants of composition and richness of small mammals in Atlantic Forest fragments. We also compare two aspects of land use around fragments, economic activity (peri-urban, agriculture, cattle), and property ownership (peri-urban, low income rural producers, affluent rural producers). Small mammals were surveyed in 21 fragments varying from 12 to 250ha, and in two sites of continuous forest in the Macacu River watershed, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1999 to 2007. The effects of land use, fragment size and isolation were formulated as eleven candidate models, compared by Akaike Information Criteria. In the models selected, species composition was associated more strongly with fragment size, followed by isolation, with a smaller effect of property ownership. Species richness was determined mostly by fragment isolation, but also by a negative effect of agriculture when it was the dominant economic activity. Regardless of the critics to island biogeography theory, fragment isolation and size were by far the most important determinants of species composition. Economic activity and property ownership allowed the detection of subtle but important effects of land use on species composition and richness.";"Vieira, Marcus V.

"AGRIS:US201400067045";"Analysing decadal land use/cover dynamics of the Lake Basaka catchment (Main Ethiopian Rift) using LANDSAT imagery and GIS";"";"Development of accurate classification methods for rapidly changing catchments like that of Lake Basaka is fundamental to better understanding the catchment dynamics, which were not addressed in previous studies. Thus, the aim of this study was to map the decadal land use/cover (LUC) regimes of the Lake Basaka catchment, utilizing time series of LANDSAT images and to analyse the changes that occurred at different time periods. Both unsupervised and supervised image classification systems were utilized in Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS) Imagine (9.1). Appropriate pre‐ and postprocessing also was utilized. Seven major LUC classes were identified in the final land cover maps produced after the supervised (maximum likelihood) classification exercise. The analysis results indicated the Lake Basaka catchment had experienced a drastic change in its LUC conditions over the last 4–5 decades because of rapid increases in human settlement, deforestation, establishment of irrigation schemes and Awash National Park (ANP). Approximately 18 924 ha of forest and 4730 ha of grazing lands were devastated between 1973 and 2008. At the same time, there was a shift in land cover from forests/woodlands to open woodlands, shrub and grazing lands. The land cover classifications generally were achieved at a very high overall accuracy (84.34%) and overall kappa statistics (0.802), substantiating the value of using the classified LUC in this study as an input to hydrological models. This study results provide an opportunity to better understand and quantify the hydrological response regimes of the lake catchment from the perspective of changing LUC conditions during different hydrological periods and the resulting dynamics of the lake water balance.";"Dinka, Megersa Olumana";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use;grazing lands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400067045";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1770.2012.00493.x";"";"";"";"11-24"
"AGRIS:QY2016600125";"Adoption and use of improved maize by small-scale farmers in Southeast Guatemala";"";"This report is based on a study of the adoption and use of improved open-pollinated varieties and hybrids by small-scale farmers in the Department of Jutiapa, Guatemala. The majority of maize producers in Guatemala are small-scale subsistence farmers. Approximately 60% of the basic grains produced in the country are grown on farmers that are too small to satisfy the basic nutritional needs of a typical family (5-6 persons). Increasing yields through the use of new technologies is seen as a critical step to ensuring adequate nutrition and increasing farmer income in the area. The study, conducted in June and July 1991, randomly surveyed 208 farmers in 18 municipalities of Jutiapa, apportioned according to the number of farms in each municipality. There was particular interest in assessing the impact of the Project of Generation and Transfer of Agricultural Technology and Seed Production (PROGETTAPS), which was launched in 1986 by the Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología Agrícolas (ICTA) and the General Directorate of Agricultural Services (DIGESA) with the goal of increasing small-scale farmer access to improved seeds. Study findings reveal a complex pattern of seed use in Jutiapa. Although the farmers there use several types of local and improved maize seed, they seem to prefer and use the local variety known as Arriquin, as well as two improved materials: an open-pollinated variety (B-1) and a hybrid (H-5). The reported forms of acquisition and preferences indicate that most of the farmers use the same material from 1 to 3 sowing seasons. Yield gains and relative prices, two important factors determining the profitability of adoption of new varieties, are adequate. By changing from their local varieties to OPVs and hybrids, farmers most likely can expect yield increases ranging from 35% to 70%. The decision to use improved materials in part of all of the area cropped with maize is associated with a change in the maize cropping system. Results suggest that farmers that sow a plot of maize in monoculture tend to plant the entire area with improved seed, particularly with hybrids. Results also show that the size of the family, taken together with the cropping system, is and important factor influencing the probability of full adoption, particularly of hybrid materials. The finding indicate that the probability of using hybrid material, either in part of all of a cropped area, increases with farm size. Importantly, results from the estimating model confirmed the trend observed at the aggregate level. PROGETTAPS had a significant impact on the adoption of OPVs in Jutiapa. Farmers that have experience with PROGETTAPS are more li to adopt OPVs than those who do not have contact with it. Furthermore, the probability of adoption increases with the years of association farmers have had with the program.";"Sain, G.

"AGRIS:US201400105782";"Causes and Effects of Gully Erosion on Agricultural Lands and the Environment";"";"This study was aimed at assessing the causes of the gully erosion and its effects on the agricultural lands in the arid region of southeastern Iran. In this study, we have used geologic maps in scales of 1:50,000 and 1:250,000, aerial photographs on a scale of 1:20,000, field observation, and GPS (global positioning system). Three soil samples were taken from 25, 50, and 75% of the gully length at each location and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), cation exchange capacity (CEC), calcium (Ca), and soil texture. The causes of gully erosion, its effects on agricultural lands, characteristics of the gullies, soil depth, and vegetation of each area were evaluated. The results show that several parameters, including poor rangeland vegetation cover, overgrazing, human activities, intensive and short-period rainfall, improper land use, improper irrigation design, improper discharge of water in the channels, and soil characteristics influence the gully erosion. Gully erosion causes severe damage to agricultural lands, including soil loss, increase in surface runoff, lower soil water-holding capacity, lower quality and quantity of water, lower groundwater table, and lower agricultural production. It increased migration from villages to cities and increased socioeconomic problems and poverty. It also caused substantial damages to construction sites such as bridges, roads, and settlements as well as rivers and reservoirs and increased sediment concentration in rivers.";"Jahantigh, Mansour

However, as physical surfaces of land-cover types are not necessarily related to their use and economic function, differentiating among thematically detailed urban land uses (single-family residential, multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, etc.) using remotely sensed imagery is a challenging task, particularly over large areas. Few thematically detailed urban land-use mapping products have successfully been created via automated means at regional scales, and no such product currently exists for the entire United States. This study demonstrates an approach that uses US census block groups (BGs) as the basic unit of geography and predicts the percentages of 10 urban land uses for each BG. Predictors are based on a number of national-scale and publicly available data sources, including census data, point locations of land-use features, and historical land cover. Results indicate the importance of accounting for contextual/proximity effects when identifying land uses. The method, demonstrated over a four-county area surrounding the city of Boston, provides a potential model for broad-scale urban land-use mapping.";"Falcone, James A.

"AGRIS:US201400105031";"Modeling hydrological ecosystem services and tradeoffs: a case study in Baiyangdian watershed, China";"";"Policy makers and scientists consider that land use strategies are designed to provide direct benefits to people by protecting vital ecosystem services. However, due to lack of information and evaluation methods, there is no effective and systematic tool for assessing tradeoffs between direct human benefits and ecosystem services. Land use changes influence ecosystem properties, processes and components, which are the basis for providing services. Five alternative land use scenarios (no conversion of agricultural lands, no urban expansion, agricultural expansion, forestry expansion, and riparian reforestation) were modeled for the Baiyangdian watershed, China, a densely populated, highly modified watershed with serious water shortage and pollution problems. The model InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is designed to inform decisions about natural resource management, with an aim to align economic forces with conservation. Three ecosystem services (agricultural production, hydropower production, and water quality) were modeled to balance direct benefits and hydrological ecosystem services using InVEST. The results showed that: hydropower production was the greatest in the forestry expansion, but the lowest in agricultural expansion; agricultural production was reduced the most in forestry expansion, while retained the most in riparian reforestation. Riparian reforestation also provided the highest N and P retention and lowest N and P exportation. Riparian reforestation was the optimal land use strategy, since it protected and enhanced the vital ecosystem services without undermining direct human benefits. This research presents an initial analytical framework for integrating direct human benefits and ecosystem services in policy planning and illustrates its application. Although there are important potential tradeoffs between ecosystem services, this systematic planning framework offers a means for identifying valuable synergies between conservation and development.";"Bai, Yang

"AGRIS:US201600044300";"Use of GIS to predict potential distribution areas for wild boar (Sus scrofa Linnaeus 1758) in Mediterranean regions (SE Spain)";"";"The wild boar is the target species selected for developing a GIS model of potential habitat for big game species, mainly using many GIS layers and kilometric abundance indices (KAI). We identify and weight environmental factors that determine the suitability for wild boar populations in a Mediterranean region, highly influenced by urban and agro-forestry activities. Marina Baja region (Spain) is selected to make a regional analysis. In the GIS modelling process, a suitability value is assigned to each pixel, which represents the habitat preference of the species. In the potential habitat model some variables were considered, the most important being land use. Voronoi polygons are generated by calculating the centroid of census transects located with GPS. These polygons are combined with the ‘suitability’ layer to obtain potentiality values, involving the displacement of the wild boar impedances within each Voronoi polygon. Finally, it performs the cartographic generalization process to obtain the resulting potential areas. We have obtained six potential areas that represent 39% of the region and they are best for the species. Natural vegetation is the most important landcover type in these areas. The cost-distance model is an efficient tool that gives good results in line with existing knowledge of species distribution. The model is constructed in order to explain, understand and predict the relations of analysed species using a determinate number of environmental variables. Thus, the use of GIS has allowed the information coming from different sources to be integrated in a simple way, allowing wild boar observations (KAI) to be combined with the cost-distance analysis result.";"Belda, A.

"AGRIS:US201500216653";"Reconstruction of Holocene environmental changes in two archaeological sites of Calabria (Southern Italy) using an integrated pedological and anthracological approach";"";"This paper focuses on the reconstruction of Holocene climatic and environmental changes in two archaeological sites of southwestern and north-central Calabria (southern Italy). It is based on a comparison of geoarchaeological, pedological and pedoanthracological data from soil profiles in the coastal hilly and inland mountainous surroundings of Palmi and Cecita Lake, respectively. At the Palmi site, the representative soil profile includes settlements and artefacts ranging from late Neolithic to late early Bronze Age and undifferentiated historical epochs. The archaeological record of soils at Cecita spans from late Neolithic/early Eneolithic to Roman ages. At both sites, surface A horizons are affected by repeated plough marks. All soils display some Andisol-like features, related to some volcanic input during soil formation originating from late Pleistocene to Holocene explosive eruptions of the Aeolian Islands. The occurrence of clay coatings, their relict nature and overall dominant phyllosilicate clay minerals in the Neolithic soil horizons of both sites, suggest warm climate conditions with high moisture availability and some seasonal contrast, during the late early-middle Holocene climatic optimum. The post-Neolithic soils show comparable or more abundant amounts of short-range order minerals than phyllosilicates, and no to scarce clay coatings. These features indicate a transition towards (probably cooler) prolonged humid conditions, intercalated by one or more drought episodes. Severe land degradation is recorded between these major climatic phases, indicated by human impact (deforestation and agriculture) and soil erosion. Soil charcoal analysis from Cecita soils provide evidence of these anthropogenic environmental changes, as indicated by the dominance of deciduous oak forest in Neolithic soils, followed by a transition to a mountain pine forest recorded in the Roman soils. A deciduous oak forest characterizes the vegetation at Palmi from the Neolithic onward.";"Pelle, Teresa

"AGRIS:US201500199272";"Lignin signature as a function of land abandonment and erosion in dry luvisols of SE Spain";"";"This study addressed long-term land degradation and regeneration effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) composition. This was done in a context of secondary succession following land abandonment in the Mediterranean region of SE Spain. The effects of land use change and soil erosion on SOC composition were studied by using lignin as a biomarker. To get insight into the evolution of SOC composition along a land use and topographical gradient, differences in lignin contribution to SOC were determined at different soil depths (0–0.1m, 0.1–0.2m, 0.2–0.3m). Three deposition locations, three positions on the hillslope and three zones on top of the hillslope (shoulder) were selected on croplands and fields that were abandoned since 10 and 50years, respectively. Land use change was identified as a driver for the observed gradients in lignin, SOC and N in these semi-arid ecosystems. Abandoned sites were highest in soil lignin, which could be related to the higher lignin input. For deposition and shoulder positions lignin was less degraded at abandoned sites compared to cultivated sites. On croplands lignin was more degraded at hillslope locations compared to deposition zones. Observed differences in soil lignin quantity were highest for the topsoil (0–0.1m). For deeper soil, differences are less pronounced. However, no differences were evident for lignin contribution to SOC (mg lignin phenols/g SOC). As modern soil erosion rates are very low in the study area, SOC composition on abandoned fields may be more influenced by present day vegetation and its degradation than by soil erosion. Surprisingly, lignin contribution to SOC was not favored by vegetation recovery either. The higher soil N contents for abandoned fields compared to croplands might explain why lignin is not preferentially preserved on recovered sites.";"De Baets, S.

"AGRIS:US201600195340";"Rural transitions in the Nambucca Valley: Socio-demographic change in a disadvantaged rural locale";"";"Within current rural research, an ongoing challenge has been to conceptualise the overarching dynamics driving rural transitions in affluent societies, while also recognising diversity and complexity in driving forces and trajectories over time and place. While amenity migration may continue to be influential, more recent research has revealed that there are multiple driving forces leading towards diverse multifunctional rural occupance modes and trajectories. With its oversupply of desirable rural destinations, transitions along the subtropical New South Wales coast have been marked by increasingly divergent socioeconomic trajectories, tied to perceived gradients in amenity and sequential gradients in affordability related to inherent and constructed place imagery. We explore early- and late-phase transitions in the Nambucca Valley, one region within this zone. Initially available at exceptionally low entry costs, a plentiful supply of former dairyfarms attracted undercapitalised migrants seeking a rural lifestyle and possibly a livelihood from on-farm or non-farm sources. With limited finances, near-zero borrowing capacity and an ill-informed, opportunistic approach towards initiating their prospective cropping and/or livestock ventures, newcomers were destined to fail. Notwithstanding its high natural landscape and liveability values, the Nambucca Valley has been bypassed during the later-phase, locationally selective commodification of rural hinterlands. With its now-entrenched image of disadvantage, Nambucca lacks the market-oriented positional values accruing to prime destinations elsewhere along the subtropical coast. Given the continuing inability of Nambuccaâs rural landholdings to support cropping and livestock livelihoods, and the compatibility between consumption and protection outcomes, there is a high probability of entrenching a complex multifunctional mode of rural occupance for the foreseeable future. In this mode, âconsumption of the countrysideâ by residents with modest incomes will be most influential in shaping rural socioeconomic futures, but with desultory production and protection activity together with reduced inputs into property management shaping rural landscapes.";"Holmes, John

In the next step, 15 effective factors such as slope degree, slope aspect, elevation, plan curvature, Topographic Position Index, Topographic Wetness Index, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, distance to villages, distance to roads, distance to rivers, wind effect, soil texture, annual temperature, and rainfall were extracted from the spatial database. Subsequently, FFSM were prepared using EBF and BLR models, and the results were plotted in ArcGIS. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curves (AUCs) were constructed for verification purposes. The validation of results showed that the AUC for EBF and BLR models are 0.8193 (81.93%) and 0.7430 (74.30%), respectively. In general, the mentioned results can be applied for land use planning, management and prevention of future fire hazards.";"Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land use planning";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IRN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600101705";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.1052750";"";"";"";"80-98"

This study was conducted to determine if the presence and development of biological soil crusts on dune surfaces stabilized by revegetation facilitates ant establishment and survival. We measured topsoil properties and crustal features during different successional stages, which were characterized by cyanobacteria and algae, lichens, and mosses, respectively. The species richness and abundance (nest density) of ants were closely associated with silt content, soil organic matter, nitrogen and soil moisture, as well as topsoil temperature. However, ant nest distribution was largely dependent on the biomass and thickness of crusts and topsoil. These findings provide evidence that the recovery or development of biological soil crusts on dune surfaces in the Tengger Desert could favor and maintain higher ant species diversity. Therefore, the disturbance of crusts would result in a reduction of ant species richness and abundance in desert systems.";"Li, X.R.

On the one hand, some scholars take Jefferson at his word when he mentions that agrarianism is a moral vision. For these individuals, Jefferson’s agrarianism is a moral vision and an indispensible part of the good life. On the other hand, other scholars maintain that Jefferson’s moral agrarianism is merely a bit of propaganda that insidiously sheaths a political or economic ideal. For them, Jefferson is through and throughout a politician, and expressions of agrarianism as a moral ideal amount to mere cant. In this paper, I examine arguments for and against Jefferson’s moral agrarianism. I defend the position that Jefferson was an aboveboard moral agrarianist and that the ideal of agrarianism was not just one that was suited for Americans, given their surfeit of land and want of laborers, but an ideal that also applied universally. I end with thoughts on Jefferson’s recognition of the rise of manufacturing in American cities throughout his life.";"Holowchak, M.

Responses to this approach were sought from a sample of farmers in the areas affected by human elephant conflict in the northwestern province of Sri Lanka. Results from a contingent valuation survey of their willingness to pay for a scheme to conserve elephants are also reported. Two separate logit regression analyses were undertaken to examine the factors that influence the farmers’ responses for the payment principle question and their opinions on the integrated economic approach. Although found that the majority of the respondents expressed their willingness to pay for the proposed scheme and supported for the implementation of the integrated approach, we have insufficient data yet to determine if their support and financial contribution would be sufficient to set up this programme and also to predict its economic viability. Nevertheless, the overall finding of this study provides an improved economic assessment of the farmers’ attitudes towards the wild elephant in Sri Lanka. At the same time the study shows that, contrary to commonly held assumptions, farmers in this developing country, do support wildlife conservation.";"Bandara, Ranjith

Documentation of past changes in the distribution and structure of fire-dependent ecosystems is necessary to assess the success of land management in maintaining historic vegetation types. In our study system—longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Aristida stricta) savannas and embedded wetlands (i.e., pocosins)—wiregrass is dependent on frequent burning. We used soil carbon (C) isotopes to test for past changes in the abundance of wiregrass and for shifts in the ecotone between savanna and pocosin in four sites at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Wiregrass has a C₄ photosynthetic pathway and therefore produces organic matter enriched in ¹³C compared to other dominant species in the community that have a C₃ photosynthetic pathway. At each of the four sites, we measured profiles of soil δ¹³C to a depth of 1 m at four locations along the vegetation gradient from upland savannas to lowland pocosins. Surface soil δ¹³C, which reflects C inputs from current vegetation, did not differ along the gradient despite a decrease in wiregrass cover from savanna, where it is abundant, to pocosin, where it is absent. Enrichment of soil δ¹³C with depth was indistinguishable from effects of decomposition, indicating that past variation in the abundance and distribution of wiregrass was not detectable in our study sites. Our results suggest that wiregrass currently does not produce, and historically has not produced, enough biomass to influence soil δ¹³C values along the savanna-pocosin gradient.";"Schafer, Jennifer L.

"AGRIS:US201600100252";"stochastic movement simulator improves estimates of landscape connectivity";"";"Conservation actions often focus on restoration or creation of natural areas designed to facilitate the movements of organisms among populations. To be efficient, these actions need to be based on reliable estimates or predictions of landscape connectivity. While circuit theory and least‐cost paths (LCPs) are increasingly being used to estimate connectivity, these methods also have proven limitations. We compared their performance in predicting genetic connectivity with that of an alternative approach based on a simple, individual‐based “stochastic movement simulator” (SMS). SMS predicts dispersal of organisms using the same landscape representation as LCPs and circuit theory‐based estimates (i.e., a cost surface), while relaxing key LCP assumptions, namely individual omniscience of the landscape (by incorporating perceptual range) and the optimality of individual movements (by including stochasticity in simulated movements). The performance of the three estimators was assessed by the degree to which they correlated with genetic estimates of connectivity in two species with contrasting movement abilities (Cabanis's Greenbul, an Afrotropical forest bird species, and natterjack toad, an amphibian restricted to European sandy and heathland areas). For both species, the correlation between dispersal model and genetic data was substantially higher when SMS was used. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that the improvement gained by using SMS is robust both to variation in spatial resolution of the landscape and to uncertainty in the perceptual range model parameter. Integration of this individual‐based approach with other developing methods in the field of connectivity research, such as graph theory, can yield rapid progress towards more robust connectivity indices and more effective recommendations for land management.";"Coulon, A.

The paper tries to analyze these problems from two complementary economic perspectives: the first one, based on a Cost-Benefit Analysis approach, highlight the gap between public interest and local private profitability in ordinary watershed management activities through three case studies in Tunisia. Once we have demonstrated that market mechanisms are unable to allocate eff iciently watershed resources, we assume a more normative perspective focusing on the implementation of voluntary instruments related to payments for environmental services. Due to the lack of experiences in the Mediterranean basin, we discus the results of a comparison among six case-studies of payments for water provision services in some developing countries underlying the role of transaction costs and social capital in the successful implementation of these new economic instruments for the sustainable management of Mediterranean watershed resources.

Los problemas del uso insostenible de cuencas en la zona mediterránea (sobrepastoreo, degradación del bosque, erosión, incendios, etc.) son a menudo el resultado de la reducida rentabilidad de los sistemas tradicionales de uso del terreno, la falta de derechos sobre la propiedad claramente definidos, la aplicación insuficiente de reglas existentes, y de la falta de instrumentos económicos adecuados. El artículo trata de analizar estos problemas desde dos perspectivas económicas complementarias: la primera, basada en un enfoque del análisis coste-beneficio, destaca el vacío entre el interés público y la rentabilidad privada local en actividades ordinarias de gestión de las cuencas en tres casos de estudio en Túnez. Una vez que hemos demostrado que esos mecanismos de mercado no pueden asignar eficientemente los recursos de la cuenca, asumimos una perspectiva más normativa que se centra en la implementación de instrumentos voluntarios relacionados con el pago por servicios ambientales. Debido a la falta de experiencias en la cuenca mediterránea, discutimos los resultados de una comparación entre seis casos de estudio de pago por servicios de provisión de agua en algunos países en desarrollo resaltando el papel de los costes de transacción y el capital social en la implementación exitosa de estos nuevos instrumentos económicos para la gestión sostenible de los recursos de las cuencas Mediterráneas.";"Daly-Hassen, H., National Institute for Research in Rural Engineering, Water and Forests, Tunis (Tunisia)

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the effect of grazing land (GL) conversion into Grevillea robusta plantation and exclosure (EX) on soil nutrients and soil organic carbon (SOC) and (2) to examine the impact of soil organic matter (SOM) on soil nutrients. To achieve these objectives, soil samples were taken from a soil depth of 20� cm (n = 4) in each of the studied land areas. Each soil sample was analysed in a soil laboratory following a standard procedure. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used for the data analysis. The result indicated that conversion of GL into EX improved the soil electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable K, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total N and available P (p < 0.05), while the exchangeable Mg, SOC, available K and SOM were decreased (p < 0.05). Conversion of GL into G. robusta improved the soil EC, exchangeable (K, Ca, Mg), CEC, SOC, total N, available K and SOM (p < 0.05). There was a significant relationship between SOM and available P, total N, SOC and EC. There were no significant relationships between SOM and pH, available K and CEC. Finally, the results indicate that both land uses, established in acidic Nitosols, have variable impacts on soil chemical properties and that G. robusta plantation improved most of the soil nutrients and SOC much better than the EX land use.";"Alem, Shiferaw

Based on a translog production frontier framework the technical and scale efficiency on farm level is analyzed by considering also curvature consistency.  The total change in productivity for the reference period is measured by using the Malmquist total factor productivity index approach based on a time trends as well as a general index model specification.  Input specific bias in technical change as well as a general index model specification.  Input specific bias in technical change as well elasticities of input substitution are analyzed.  Factors for the development of technical change and the change in efficiency over time are investigated by applying a bootstrapped ITSUR techniques. Finally we try to conclude on the significance of subsidies for promoting long term growth in organic production by estimating a bootstrapped bivariate probit model with respect to factors influencing the probability of organic market exit.  The results revealed significant difference in the organic farms' technical efficiency, no significant total factor productivity growth and even a slightly negative rate of technical change in the period investigated.  We found evidence for a positive relationship between subsidy payments and an increase in farm efficiency, technology improvements and a decreasing probability of organic market exit which was also confirmed for off farm income.  Finally the general index mode specification was found to deliver a more accurate mapping of total factor productivity growth.";"Sauer, Johannes

The purpose the paper is to provide a regional view of this result, namely whether the same trend can be observed if the analysis is done by Scottish regions. For this purpose, we assembled a panel dataset for 11 Scottish regions for the period 1959 until 2008. We specialised the analysis on beef cattle. We use simple regression techniques to verify whether there have been changes in the regional shares of beef cattle and whether beef cattle numbers in the different regions tend to converge to a steady state value. The results indicate that the data can be broken down into two major periods: before and after the accession to the European Community (EC). Furthermore, in most of the regions, accession implied changes in the regional shares (although shares are very stable over time). In terms of the convergence analysis, it is clear that accession to the EC affected the regional beef cattle steady state values.";"Renwick, Alan W.

"AGRIS:US201500204805";"carbon balance of Norway: terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes";"";"Northern landscapes accumulate carbon in vegetation and soils while rivers transport significant amounts of land-derived carbon to coastal areas. Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990–2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway’s four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 ± 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m⁻²) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m⁻²year⁻¹): tree biomass (40 ± 3) > peatlands (19 ± 15) > forest soils (9 ± 1) ≫ lakes (2 ± 1) > mountains (0.5 ± 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (−36 ± 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 ± 0.1 Tg C year⁻¹(3.0 g C m⁻²year⁻¹), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m⁻²year⁻¹) and lowest (1.7 g C m⁻²year⁻¹) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.";"de Wit, Heleen A.

Such expansion is perceived as a local (stand-level) process that is reflected at a larger, regional scale. The objective of this study was to characterize the increase in aspen cover following clearcutting in the clay belt of Abitibi, in northwestern Quebec. Regional data from 3 province-wide forest inventories (1970, 1980, and 1990) conducted by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife were analyzed for 2 ecological regions, the Abitibi Plain (western balsam fir-white birch bioclimatic subdomain) and the Matagami Lake Plain (western black spruce-feathermoss bioclimatic subdomain). An assessment was done of forest cover transformations following clearcutting over 3 decades based on time since harvesting, surface deposit/drainage, and ecological region. Results show that mesic clay sites are particularly susceptible to aspen encroachment and that the overall rate of encroachment from the 1970s to the 1990s in the black spruce and balsam fir regions has been about 30%. Moreover, despite the greater abundance of poorly drained and organic sites, less favourable to hardwood establishment, in the more northerly black spruce region, the 2 regions appear to present the same sensitivity (or propensity) to intolerant hardwood expansion. On sensitive sites, management of black spruce forests should include adaptive practices to limit increases of the hardwood component. Nomenclature: Marie-Victorin, 1995.";"Laquerre, Simon

"AGRIS:US201301840256";"Landscape and Vegetation Effects on Avian Reproduction on Bottomland Forest Restorations";"";"Forest restoration has been undertaken on >200,000 ha of agricultural land in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, USA, during the past few decades. Decisions on where and how to restore bottomland forests are complex and dependent upon landowner objectives, but for conservation of silvicolous (forest-dwelling) birds, ecologists have espoused restoration through planting a diverse mix of densely spaced seedlings that includes fast-growing species. Application of this planting strategy on agricultural tracts that are adjacent to extant forest or within landscapes that are predominately forested has been advocated to increase forest area and enhance forested landscapes, thereby benefiting area-sensitive, silvicolous birds. We measured support for these hypothesized benefits through assessments of densities of breeding birds and reproductive success of 9 species on 36 bottomland forest restoration sites. Densities of thamnic (shrub–scrub dwelling) and silvicolous birds, such as yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), and white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) were positively associated with 1) taller trees, 2) greater stem densities, and 3) a greater proportion of forest within the landscape, whereas densities of birds associated with grasslands, such as dickcissel (Spiza americana) and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), were negatively associated with these variables. Vegetation structure, habitat edge, and temporal effects had greater influence on nest success than did landscape effects. Taller trees, increased density of woody stems, greater vegetation density, and more forest within the landscape were often associated with greater nest success. Nest success of grassland birds was positively related to distance from forest edge but, for thamnic birds, success was greater near edges. Moreover, nest success and estimated fecundity of thamnic species suggested their populations are self-sustaining on forest restoration sites, whereas these sites are likely population sinks for grassland and open-woodland species. We recommend restoration strategies that promote rapid development of dense forest stands within largely forested landscapes to recruit breeding populations of thamnic and silvicolous birds that have reproductive success sufficient to sustain their populations.";"Twedt, Daniel J.

Economic model is a normative dynamic programming model with known parameters for the one period returns and transition equations. The optimal decision rules for liming are solved numerically, conditional on alternative scenarios on the likelihood that the lease contract and, thus, farmer access to land is either renewed or expired. The model parameters represent Finnish soil quality and production conditions. The results suggest that irreversible liming decreases quickly and the yields decline gradually, when the farmer is confronted with land tenure insecurity caused by uncertain renewal of the lease contract.

Land use and land cover classification is a preprocessing procedure to provide the required parameters for CRHM. Per-pixel-based and object-oriented classifications are the two major classification approaches currently in practice. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the more complex object-oriented classification method can significantly improve the performance of the CRHM model in a prairie landscape. The study was conducted in the Smith Creek watershed in eastern Saskatchewan. Two Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) multispectral images were used to classify the area into seven classes: cropland, fallow, grassland, wetland, water, woodland and town/road. Both pixel-based maximum likelihood supervised classification method and nearest neighbour object-oriented classification approach were applied to the satellite images for the study area. The parameters derived from both classification methods were input into the CRHM to derive the hydrological response unit (HRU), snow water equivalent (SWE) and basin stream flow. Results indicated that classification results influence the model performance slightly. However, no significant improvement from the object-oriented classification was observed for this specific study.";"Guo, Xulin

Nearly 500 daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images (acquired 2 January–3 July 2010) were used in the production of the map. Additionally, peatland maps, elevation information and Daichi-Advanced Land Observing Satellite mosaic data were utilized in the mapping process. The map covers the Malaysian Peninsula and the major islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi and Mindanao, in addition to the western part of New Guinea and numerous smaller islands. The classification scheme of 13 classes reflects the special characteristics of land cover of insular Southeast Asia, including, for example, peatswamp forests and large-scale palm plantations. The map was assessed to have 85% overall accuracy using high-resolution (10–30 m) satellite data as reference material. It can therefore be considered to provide reliable information on the current status of land cover in this region experiencing rapid land cover changes.";"Miettinen, Jukka

The health of a forest ecosystem is closely tied to the evapotranspiration (ET) of water through forests. This study focused on estimating the ET of old-growth cypress in the Chilan Mountain area and investigated its spatial variability in different watershed divisions using remote sensing. Our methods included applying hybrid image classification to generate land cover maps using Landsat-5 images, calculating habitat characteristics of old-growth using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), investigating spatial variability of ET in relation to environmental parameters, and examining the gap-snag effect on old-growth cypress ET. The results indicated that the study area was classified into three land cover types (i.e., old-growth, non-old growth, and others). Old-growth had lower values in net radiance, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and daily ET than did non-old-growth. Watershed divisions at various scales did cause the variation on old-growth ET characteristics according to the selected parameters and the number of parameters for predicting the value of ET. Finally, ET between gap-snag and non-gap-snag habitats was statistically different. A higher proportion in gap-snag composition would lead to a lower value in daily ET and the NDVI.";"Wu, Chih-Da

"AGRIS:US201500219636";"Occurrence of native and exotic invasive trees in burned pine and eucalypt plantations: Implications for post-fire forest conversion";"";"Post-fire management objectives for monospecific forest plantations may include conversion to native broadleaved or mixed forests for purposes of diversification of forestry production, enhancing biodiversity and cultural value, or reducing biotic and abiotic hazards. Thus, the potential for post-fire conversion needs to be assessed as a first step in planning such conversion. On the other hand, fire occurrence may foster invasion by exotic species and this equally needs to be assessed when planning post-fire management. We have surveyed 284 plots of the more common plantation types in Portugal (maritime pine and eucalypt) five years after they were burned. We describe the occurrence patterns of native and exotic tree species, and relate these to plantation type, ecological region, previous fire disturbance frequency, and type of post-fire management actions. We have identified 19 native tree species in ca. 50% of the burned plantations, showing that there is potential for post-fire conversion. Ecological region and post-fire management actions involving soil or understory disturbance were the more important drivers of native species occurrence. Four alien woody species occurred in 10% of the plots, indicating that they now constitute a factual risk in post-fire land management in the country. Unlike native species, where post-fire management negatively impacted on their occurrence, alien species were more prevalent in burned plantations where post-fire operations disturbing vegetation or soil had occurred. The fact that the typical post-fire management practices in these planted forests (salvage logging, understory removal and soil tilling) hindered native species recovery but enhanced invasive exotics creates a conundrum that needs careful consideration when planning post-fire interventions.";"Moreira, F.

The investigations were conducted in one of the most promising areas of potential shale gas extraction, in which the Frampol 1 test wellbore was drilled in 2012 (SE Poland, Roztocze Region). In the area of the wellbore, hydrochemical analyses of the waters of the river drainage zone were performed. Water was sampled from six objects representing soil water, porous groundwater, fissure-layer groundwater, and river water. The hydrological regime of groundwater and surface water was analysed based on data obtained from automatic recorders of water levels and results of periodic measurements of water flow. In 2013, water was sampled on a monthly basis for determination of the levels of Ba, Sr, Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, As, V, Rb, Pb, Th, and U. The analysis results showed that the concentration of Sr was usually in the range of 100–400 µg/L, Fe 10–100 µg/L, Ba 10–40 µg/L, and Mn, Al, and Zn 1–10 µg/L. The concentration of the other metals generally did not exceed 1 µg/L. The concentrations of the elements analysed in the zone of drinking water intake were within the range specified by Polish and WHO standards. Significant differences were found in the metal content in the analysed waters; they were related to the water intake site, form of land management, and hydrometeorological conditions. The highest metal content was recorded in soil and river waters and the lowest in the spring waters of the main water-bearing horizon. At the current stage of the research, no impact of the Frampol 1 shale gas exploration wellbore on the metal content in the upper Sanna River catchment was found.";"Chabudziński, Łukasz

"AGRIS:US201400155207";"Multi-month memory effects on early summer vegetative activity in semi-arid South Africa and their spatial heterogeneity";"";"In semi-arid African regions (annual rainfall between 200 and 600 mm), variability of vegetative activity is mainly due to the rainfall of the current rainy season. In most of South Africa, the rainy season occurs from October to March. On average, vegetative activity lags rainfall by 1 to 2 months. The interannual variability in early summer (December to September) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) depends primarily on precipitation at the beginning (October to November) of the rainy season. However, once this primary control is removed, the residual interannual variability in NDVI highlights a double memory effect: a 1-year effect, referred to as Mem₁, and a 7- to 10-month effect, referred to as Mem₂. This article aims at better describing the influence of soil and vegetation characteristics on these two memory effects. The data sets used in this study are as follows: (1) a 19-year NDVI time series from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, (2) rainfall records from a network of 1160 rain-gauge stations compiled by the Water Research Commission (WRC), (3) vegetation types from Global Land Cover (GLC) 2000 and (4) soil characteristics from the soil and terrain database for Southern Africa (SOTERSAF). Results indicate that among 20–30% of NDVI variance that is not explained by the concurrent rainfall, one-third is explained by the two memory effects. Mem₁ is found to have maximum effect in the northwest of our study domain, near the Botswana boundary, in the South Kalahari. Associated conditions are open grasslands growing on Arenosols. Mem₁ is less important in the southeast, particularly in open grassland with shrubs growing on Cambisols. Thus, Mem₁ mainly depends on soil texture. Mem₂ is more widespread and its influence is the greatest in the centre, the south and the east of our domain. It is related to rainfall from January to April, which controls, beyond the intervening dry season, the interannual variations of NDVI (December to September) at the beginning of the next rainy season. Through these new findings, this article emphasizes again the high potential of remote-sensing techniques to monitor and understand the dynamics of semi-arid environments.";"Richard, Yves

"AGRIS:US201500013545";"Current European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, injury levels in the northeastern United States and the value of Bt field corn";"";"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that some populations of European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), have declined to historic lows owing to widespread adoption of Bt corn hybrids. To understand current ECB populations in Pennsylvania field corn, the authors assessed larval damage in Bt and non‐Bt corn hybrids at 29 sites over 3 years. The influence of Bt adoption rates, land cover types and moth activity on levels of ECB damage was also considered. RESULTS: Bt hybrids reduced ECB damage when compared with non‐Bt, but these differences inconsistently translated to higher yields and, because of higher seed costs, rarely improved profits. No relationships were detected between land use or Bt adoption and ECB damage rates, but positive relationships were found between plant damage and captures of Z‐race ECB moths in pheromone traps in the PestWatch network. CONCLUSIONS: ECB damage levels were generally low and appear to be declining across Pennsylvania. In many locations, farmers may gain greater profits by planting competitive non‐Bt hybrids; however, Bt hybrids remain valuable control options, particularly in the parts of Pennsylvania where ECB populations persist. Moth captures from PestWatch appear to provide insight into where Bt hybrids are most valuable. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry";"Bohnenblust, Eric W

But the radar-specific imaging geometry causes specific spatial distortions in radar images (as e.g. the layover and shadowing effect), which have a negative impact on the suitability of these images for D-InSAR applications. To address this issue, we present a geographical information system (GIS) procedure to accurately predict the areas in which layover and shadowing will occur, before the area of interest is recorded by radar. Additionally, the percentage of measurability of movement of a potential landslide can be ascertained. In the third part of the GIS procedure, the main types of land cover are classified in regard to their influence on applicability of the D-InSAR technique, depending on the characteristics of the sensor used. The results of the analyses are objective pre-survey estimation of the potential applicability of the D-InSAR technique for landslide monitoring prior to the costly investment of a radar survey.";"Plank, Simon

This has been achieved without increases in livestock numbers or in the quantity of manure available. The organic matter contents have increased in all of five time series of on-farm topsoil monitoring over periods of one to three years, at rates varying from 2% to 27%. Overall, the increase from 3.3% organic matter to almost 3.8% was highly significant. Systematic full-profile comparisons of forest soils against arable soils with and without SSM showed that the benefits are not confined to the topsoils, and that there were some lesser increases in the subsoils. Sustainable land management and improved FYM quality significantly improved total nitrogen levels. The effects on available P and K were inconsistent and only occasionally significant, with some indication of K decline in topsoils. The enhanced organic matter status of the soils was also reported to improve structure, workability, and moisture characteristics. The increase in soil organic matter can partially offset some of the substantial losses of carbon storage incurred when the forests were originally cleared, and contributes to the sequestration of atmospheric CO ₂.";"Bishwakarma, B.K.

"AGRIS:US201500211998";"Effects of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle: concepts, processes and potential future impacts";"";"Extreme droughts, heat waves, frosts, precipitation, wind storms and other climate extremes may impact the structure, composition and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and thus carbon cycling and its feedbacks to the climate system. Yet, the interconnected avenues through which climate extremes drive ecological and physiological processes and alter the carbon balance are poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on carbon cycle relevant responses of ecosystems to extreme climatic events. Given that impacts of climate extremes are considered disturbances, we assume the respective general disturbance‐induced mechanisms and processes to also operate in an extreme context. The paucity of well‐defined studies currently renders a quantitative meta‐analysis impossible, but permits us to develop a deductive framework for identifying the main mechanisms (and coupling thereof) through which climate extremes may act on the carbon cycle. We find that ecosystem responses can exceed the duration of the climate impacts via lagged effects on the carbon cycle. The expected regional impacts of future climate extremes will depend on changes in the probability and severity of their occurrence, on the compound effects and timing of different climate extremes, and on the vulnerability of each land‐cover type modulated by management. Although processes and sensitivities differ among biomes, based on expert opinion, we expect forests to exhibit the largest net effect of extremes due to their large carbon pools and fluxes, potentially large indirect and lagged impacts, and long recovery time to regain previous stocks. At the global scale, we presume that droughts have the strongest and most widespread effects on terrestrial carbon cycling. Comparing impacts of climate extremes identified via remote sensing vs. ground‐based observational case studies reveals that many regions in the (sub‐)tropics are understudied. Hence, regional investigations are needed to allow a global upscaling of the impacts of climate extremes on global carbon–climate feedbacks.";"Frank, Dorothea

Under parameter values that match the empirical flow-profit depreciation rate of patents and other key features of the US economy, extending the patent length beyond 20 years leads to a negligible increase in R&D despite equilibrium R&D underinvestment. In contrast, shortening the patent length leads to a significant reduction in R&D and consumption. Finally, this paper also analytically derives and quantifies a dynamic distortionary effect of patent length on capital investment.";"Chu, Angus C.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301806198";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00712-010-0110-y";"";"";"";"117-140"
"AGRIS:US201400171644";"Cost sharing for pre-commercial thinning in southern pine plantations: Willingness to participate in Virginia's pine bark beetle prevention program";"";"Forest management that reduces southern pine beetle (SPB) risk benefits not only the landowners, but all who draw benefits from southern pine forests, including other owners whose risk is reduced by landscape-wide efforts. One such practice is pre-commercial thinning (PCT) of pine stands, which may be unattractive to landowners due to substantial upfront costs and delayed or uncertain financial return. Because societal benefits are not fully realized by those who implement PCT, there may be a market externality whereby it is underprovided. Virginia's Pine Bark Beetle Prevention Program attempts to correct this externality by reimbursing a portion of PCT costs. To examine the efficacy of cost sharing in promoting participation, a survey was sent to 1200 NIPF landowners in Virginia, where southern pine is prevalent and SPB is a concern. Willingness to participate is measured using a referendum-style question for PCT on a hypothetical, qualifying property over a cost-share range of 20% to 90%. Results of discrete choice models indicate that cost sharing has a significant, positive effect on willingness to participate overall, though results indicate that increasing reimbursement above the 50% level is unlikely to increase participation substantively. Education and ownership preferences are also significant predictors of willingness to participate, with potential implications for program targeting and marketing.";"Watson, Adam C.

Evidence from Uganda";"";"While the need for land-related investment for sustainable land management and increased productivity is well recognized, quantitative evidence on agricultural productivity effects of secure property rights in Africa is scant. Within-household analysis of investments by owner-cum-occupants in Uganda points toward significant and quantitatively large investment effects of full ownership. Registration is estimated to have no investment effects, whereas measures to strengthen occupancy rights attenuate investment disincentives. While this supports the importance of secure tenure as a precondition for growth, it also suggests that interventions aiming to increase tenure security need to be context-specific for it to be fully effective.";"Deininger, Klaus

"AGRIS:US201500217299";"Land contamination risk management in Cameroon: A critical review of the existing policy framework";"";"Land affected by contamination from human activities has been identified as a major environmental problem in developed countries and there are established mechanisms for identifying, prioritising, characterising, assessing and remediating the land so that risks to human health and environmental receptors are minimised. However, comparative mechanisms and approaches for sustainable land management are often lacking in developing countries such as Cameroon. This paper presents a critical review of the existing policy framework in Cameroon in relation to environmental management, particularly land contamination. It is established that in Cameroon, there is an acute lack of comprehensive information on land contamination from economic development and industrialisation, inadequate legal and institutional framework, weak enforcement capacity and unsatisfactory coordination between various stakeholders towards sustainable land management practices. The coastal town of Douala, which has the highest level of industrial activity in the sub region is used to demonstrate how dealing with land contamination is a public health priority and requires attention in the context of sustainable development. The United Kingdom (UK) regulatory policy framework on land contamination risk management is used to show how land contamination issues and risk management approaches, including conceptual site models, could be introduced into the sustainability discourse in Cameroon. A number of recommendations including proposals for a radical overhaul of the current regulatory policy framework are formulated and presented. Specifically, the creation of an independent Cameroon Environment Protection Agency (CEPA) that will be the main regulatory body responsible for developing and implementing the policy proposals in this paper is advocated.";"Forton, Osric Tening

"AGRIS:US201400171645";"Impact of property rights reform on household forest management investment: An empirical study of southern China";"";"Since the early 1980s, China has initiated a series of property rights reforms in the collectively owned forest area to motivate farmers in forest management. Assessment of farmers' behaviors in response to the reforms would be useful when policy adjustments are considered. This paper investigated farmers' participation and investment using labor and money input in forest management as indicators. The data were collected in Tonggu County in southern China. Results indicate that positive attitudes toward the reforms and higher income from forest product sales encourage participation in forest management. In contrast, higher off-farm income would hold back their participation and investment. It was also found that farmers who owned more land and are more confident to get logging quota would manage their forests more intensively. Households having elder and more educated household heads appear less interested in investment in forest management. Some policy implications are presented in this paper.";"Xie, Yi

"AGRIS:US201600191318";"Detection of long-term landscape changes and trajectories in a Pannonian sand region: comparing land-cover and habitat-based approaches at two spatial scales";"";"A key driver of biodiversity loss is human landscape transformation. Change detection and trajectory analysis are frequently applied methods for studying landscape change. We studied to what degree habitat-specific change detection and trajectory analysis provide different information on landscape change compared to the analysis with land-cover statistics. Our research was carried out at two spatial scales (regional, 1800 km2, 360 random points; local, 23 km2, polygon-based maps) in the KiskunsÃ¡g, Hungary. Spatio-temporal databases were prepared using historical maps, aerial photos and satellite images from 1783, 1883, 1954, and 2009. Local expert knowledge of landscape history and recent vegetation was used during the historical reconstructions. We found large differences at both scales between land-cover based and habitat-specific analyses. Habitat-specific change detection revealed that grassland loss was not continuous in the different habitats, as land-cover based analysis implied. Ploughing affected open sand grasslands and sand steppes differently in the periods studied. It was only apparent from the habitat-specific analyses that from the grasslands only mesotrophic and Molinia meadows were relatively constant, up until the 1950s. The gradual increase in forest area revealed by land-cover CHD analyses was split into natural and anthropogenic processes by habitat-specific analyses. Habitat specific trajectory analysis also revealed ecologically important historical differences between habitats. Afforestation affected especially the open sand grasslands, whereas wetland habitats were relatively stable. The most important trajectory was the one in which closed sand steppes were ploughed during the 19th century, and remained arable fields until present. Fifty percent of the regional trajectories of 18th century open sand grasslands terminated in tree plantations at present, though 82% of the current open sand grasslands of the local site can be regarded as ancient. We concluded that dividing land-cover categories into finer habitat categories offered an opportunity for a more precise historical analysis of key habitats, and could reveal important ecological processes that cannot be reconstructed with land-cover based analyses. It also highlighted habitat-specific processes making natural and social drivers better interpretable. Information on the diversity of habitat-histories may serve as a basis for spatially more explicit conservation management.";"BirÃ³, M.

"AGRIS:US201500217294";"adaptive efficiency of land use planning measured by the control of urban sprawl. The cases of the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland";"";"The paper aims to position the concept of adaptive efficiency in planning theory, by providing insights on the conditions that explain why land use planning in some institutional contexts is able to adapt and improve more efficiently than in others. This is done by focusing on a specific planning goal: the control of residential sprawl. The paper presents a theoretical framework based on two models, one on the coordinating mechanisms regarding the use of land and one to explain institutional changes. This framework is exploited with empirical case studies where we compare the control of sprawl in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland. The analysis diagnoses a duality of planning practices. Even though planning failures occur in the Netherlands as well, we provide evidence that Dutch land use planning has been able to efficiently adapt regulatory instruments and collaborative practices to societal changes. By contrast, Belgian and Polish planners face huge difficulties to incorporate new initiatives to control urban sprawl or, in more general terms, to reinforce their influence on land uses.";"Halleux, Jean-Marie

"AGRIS:US201500210821";"Reform or reversal: the impact of REDD+ readiness on forest governance in Indonesia";"";"Indonesia has turned its alleged role as global leader of land-based carbon emissions into a role as a global trailblazer exploring modalities for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). REDD+ readiness is largely about improving forest governance, but this itself is a multilayered concept. This article analyses how the processes and practices of REDD+ readiness are leading to various forest governance reforms in Indonesia. We analysed six dimensions of REDD+ readiness progress over the past six years and the way these interact with land tenure reform and land-use planning. We found evidence that (1) tenure issues are taken more seriously, as evidenced by the development of social safeguard mechanisms and efforts to accelerate the gazettement of forest boundaries, although a constitutional court recognition in 2013 for customary forest management is, however, yet to be operationalized; (2) spatial planning relates forests more clearly to other parts of the landscape in terms of compliance with Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) commitments; and (3) the forest and peatland conversion moratorium initiative led to a revamping of forest management. Despite progress, there are still major obstacles to full REDD+ implementation in Indonesia. The discussion focuses on the weaker part of readiness and possible ways forward.";"Agung, Putra

"AGRIS:US201500217523";"Agricultural trade and virtual land use: The case of China's crop trade";"";"Trade liberalization has greatly accelerated the volume of traded agricultural products in past decades. As land resources become more limited in some countries, international trade plays an important role in compensating for land scarcity in these countries. This paper aims to measure and locate the virtual land use hidden in China's imports and exports, for both primary crops and processed products, from 1986 to 2009. The results show that as China's crop imports had grown greatly during the last decade, the net virtual land trade hidden in international trade had increased from −4.42Mha in 1986 to 28.90Mha in 2009. The main category of virtual land imports had changed from cereals to oil crops, which accounted for 82.2% of the total virtual land imports in 2009. Over the two decades the main source of virtual land imports had changed from North America to both South America and North America. International trade could also lower demand for land resources at the global level: our results showed that China's crop trade was contributing to global land savings by 3.27Mha on annual average during 1986–2009. Economic development, and associated dietary changes and policy shifts were linked to the change of China's virtual land trade pattern. To make land use more sustainable at the global level, both importing and exporting countries of virtual land should consider ecological and socio-economic impacts of these trade flows in their policies.";"Qiang, Wenli

Su conocimiento y valoración adquiere cada vez más relevancia. En el presente trabajo se han utilizado los métodos de Análisis Conjunto y Valoración Contingente para estudiar, por una parte, la importancia relativa de la componente agraria en la función de utilidad derivada del disfrute de los paisajes de Las Alpujarras (Granada-España) y, por otra, la disposición a pagar de los entrevistados por disfrutar de dichos paisajes. Se ha realizado un test a una muestra de potenciales visitantes a la zona, utilizando tres elementos básicos de los paisajes: cubierta vegetal, pendiente y nivel de edificación. Dentro de cada uno de estos componentes del paisaje, se han considerado distintos niveles, algunos relacionados con la actividad agraria. Posteriormente, se ha ajustado un modelo de regresión múltiple con el fin de identificar la relación entre la Disposición a Pagar por disfrutar de cada uno de los paisajes considerados y los atributos del mismo y las características sociodemográficas de los entrevistados. Los resultados de los análisis de preferencias y de la Disposición a Pagar han permitido identificar líneas estratégicas para potenciar la función paisajística de los sistemas agrarios de la zona con vistas a su desarrollo endógeno, integral y sostenible.PALABRAS CLAVE: Análisis Conjunto; Valoración Contingente; Paisaje Agrario; Desarrollo Rural Sostenible.SUMMARY: Among the externalities produced by agrarian activities one must consider its contribution to the shaping of the landscape, an aesthetic externality value of the agrosystems.  Recognizing and appraising this contribution is becoming more and more important every day. In this study a Conjoint Analysis and Contingent Valuation methods has been used to estimate, first the relative importance of the agrarian component level in the utility function achieved from enjoying landscapes, and secondly the Willingness To Pay of surveyed for these landscapes existing in the area of The Alpujarras (Granada-Spain). Data has been obtained by a questionnaire performed to a sample of a potential visitor of the area, using three main features of landscape, as follows: Vegetation layer, level of building, and mountain inclines, each of them with different levels. Subsequently, a multiple regression model has been fitted to identify the relationship between the Willingness to Pay for landscapes and its features and the socio-cultural traits of the individuals.According to results concerning both the preferences and the Willingness To Pay of visitors for landscapes, some conclusions have finally been drawn, allowing to derive strategies to maintain the most valued landscape in the area and to make use of it for the sustainable development of the region.";"Sayadi, Samir
