Spanning a range of rainfall regimes from the arid to the humid tropics, they present unique sustainability and environmental challenges to resource managers. Physical, chemical and biological characteristics of sandy soils often act as a severe limitation in crop production. Within the tropics, these soils are predominantly occupied by resource poor and often marginalized communities that have limited capacity to address the aforementioned biophysical challenges. By manipulating the constituent components of the soil through the addition and conservation of organic matter or through the physical application of organic waste and clay materials, the potential productivity of these soils can be realized. There are thus significant opportunities in developing innovative management strategies that enhance the productivity of these systems under the diverse range of climatic conditions in which these soils occur. This symposium brought together scientists, extension practitioners and policy-makers to exchange knowledge and experiences on land and water degradation of tropical sandy soils and their sustained management and remediation. This proceedings documents the 92 session papers presented at the symposium (58 oral and 34 poster papers).";"Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific

Políticas municipales de apoyo a los operadores";"Los sistemas modernos de distribución de alimentos tienen la tendencia  a desarrollarse en ciertas ciudades en desarrollo y en transición  económica, pero las formas tradicionales de abastecimiento y de  distribución, que en muchos casos son informales, todavía tienen un rol  importante porque responden de mejor manera a las necesidades de  las familias pobres. Además, desempeñan el papel de generadoras de  empleo y de ingresos, así como también de productos, bienes y servicios  alimentarios adaptados a las exigencias particulares de los  consumidores urbanos. Por lo tanto, es primordial que estas actividades  sean reconocidas y apoyadas por las autoridades locales. Esta guía  quiere insistir en la importancia y el rol del sector informal en la  seguridad alimentaria de las ciudades. La guía presenta algunas formas  de intervención, de políticas locales de apoyo al sector informal  alimentario. Para ello, propone que se identifiquen de manera confiable  y actualizada las actividades de este sector y de sus actores (mediante  un enfoque participativo), que se comprendan los problemas que  generan esas actividades y que se los enfrente contando con la  participación de los actores.";"Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division

The exercise of these powers is frequently contentious and problematic. The guide explains what compulsory acquisition and compensation are, and what constitutes good practice in this area, examining the consequences of poor legislation, procedures and implementation. It is likely to be of most use in countries that are seeking to understand good practice in this area and to improve their own legislation, procedures and implementation in compulsory purchase and compensation in the interests of society as a whole.";"Claudia

"FAODOCREP:0dccdfb2-15c9-50f4-a365-1f4416c6160c";"Participatory Policy Reform from a Sustainable Livelihoods Perspective";"Policies have considerable impact on people’s livelihoods. They influence the access  people have to livelihoods assets and the strategic possibilities for employing these  assets to reach favourable livelihoods outcomes. However, policies developed at  central level are often not responsive to the policy needs at local level and, therefore,  not conducive to local livelihood strategies. Local populations, especially poor and  marginalized groups, have often a very weak or only indirect influence on the policy  framework affecting their livelihoods. The development and application of tested  strategies and institutional mechanisms to support the participation of the rural poor in  policy making would facilitate the generation of policy frameworks to reduce poor  people’s vulnerability and enable their access to the assets and services they require to  pursue sustainable livelihoods.  There are few documented experiences of participatory policy making (PPM)  involving the rural poor, and still less analysis of those that have been documented.  Nevertheless, it is possible to draw some initial lessons from these that would aid in  the development of strategies and mechanisms to support the participation of poor  people in policy making.";"casalef

Il s'agit du premier rapport du genre à présenter des  estimations systématiques de l'utilisation des terres forestières  mondiales et de ses changements.  L'objectif ambitieux de l'Enquête par télédétection a été  d'utiliser des données de télédétection pour obtenir des  estimations mondiales cohérentes de la superficie forestière  et des changements de couvert forestier et d'utilisation des  terres forestières entre 1990 et 2005. Globalement, elle a  constaté qu'il y avait une diminution nette de superficie  forestière mondiale entre 1990 et 2005, l'Amérique du Sud  enregistrant la plus grande perte nette de forêt. Alors que la  superficie forestière a augmenté au cours de la période  d'évaluation dans les domaines climatiques boréal, tempéré  et subtropical, elle a diminué en moyenne de 6,8 millions  d'hectares par an dans les régions tropicales. L'enquête a  estimé la superficie totale des forêts mondiales en 2005 à  3,8 milliards d'hectares, soit 30 pour cent de la surface  émergée du globe.  Ce rapport est le résultat de nombreuses années de  planification et de trois années de travail détaillé du personnel  de la FAO et du Centre commun de recherche de la  Commission européenne, mais également d'experts techniques  provenant de plus de 100 pays qui constituent aujourd'hui un  réseau mondial d'expertise précieux en matière de  télédétection sur les forêts et l'utilisation des terres forestières.";"Forestry Department

With considerable determination, local communities have joined national and international organizations and governments to bring relief and start the recovery work. FAO has been involved in assisting the affected countries in numerous ways so that agricultural activities may be resumed. While short-term assistance is indispensable, strategic planning for medium and long-term rehabilitation in collaboration with partners and governments is required for appropriate intervention. To strengthen regional coordination and collaboration in support of rural development and food security, the above workshop was organized in Bangkok, Thailand from 31 March to 1 April 2005. The overall goal was to enhance rehabilitation efforts for the reclamation of salt-affected soils in tsunami-affected areas and to identify suitable management practices for sustainable crop production. A major outcome of the workshop was a regional strategic framework for coordinating the actions to be taken at the regional level for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the affected areas.";"Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific

Community-based forest management has emerged in the past decade as an effective approach for the management of tree and forest resources.  Experiences in various countries have shown that when  communities are empowered with responsibility and  rights for the management of these resources, and  receive the benefits from them, the rate of degradation is substantially reduced, and in many cases the forest cover improves visibly. The evidence of this workshop suggests that Africa may well take the global lead in the design of supportive policy  and laws and the implementation of communitybased  resource management. The focus of the workshop was on both the institutional framework (policy and legislation) and the implementation approaches needed to enable the development of participatory forestry for the sustainable use of forest resources in Africa. The workshop was attended by participants from 25 African countries, including policy-makers,  practitioners from government and non-governmental  organizations and community-based organizations from  African countries, as well as donor representatives and  international organizations involved in community  forestry.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

GAP Workshop Report";"The project “CP/INT/231/SWI: Strengthening Agricultural Water Efficiency and Productivity on the African and Global Level” aims at reducing hunger and poverty in three African countries (Burkina Faso, Morocco and Uganda) by focusing on the improvement of Agriculture Water Management (AWM) and mainstreaming AWM in national frameworks and processes. The objectives of this project are in line with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP), which provides a common framework for stimulating and guiding national, regional and continental initiatives for enhanced agriculture productivity in Africa. The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the small-scale and family farmers, but the overall approach of the project is a combination of bottom up and top down activities and different levels (micro, meso and macro levels). For this reason, the project will be working with extension agents and farmers’ representatives (micro level), research institutes and regional governance structures (meso level), and national governments (macro level). One of the main outputs of the project is to enhance capacity for increased water use efficiency in small-scale irrigation in Burkina Faso, Morocco and Uganda (Output 2). The workshop “Enhancing Water Use Efficiency in Small Scale Irrigation: The Application of FAO’s MASSCOTE Approach” was one of the activities of this output. The main objective of the workshop was to build capacities of water professionals from Burkina Faso, Morocco and Uganda (as well as the host country as a step towards south- south cooperation) on increasing water use efficiency of irrigation systems by stimulating critical senses of agricultural water management in diagnosing and evaluating obstacles, constraints and opportunities, and in developing consistent modernization plans/ strategies.";" Natural Resources and Environment Dept.

Numerous projects throughout  Africa have shown that they result in improved soils, better yields and higher incomes for farmers.  The document summarizes some of these experiences, points out successes, and – equally important  – shows constraints and gaps that need to be addressed. Particularly important is the list of policy  recommendations: committed support and funding from governments is vital if this promising  approach to agricultural development is to make the difficult jump from the donor-supported project  into an accepted mainstream approach applied by research and extension agencies throughout the  continent.";"

En effet, la plupart des quelques documents techniques sur l'aquaculture disponibles en Afrique et Madagascar sont, de nos jours, en langue anglaise.  C'est à cet effet que le projet PNUD/FAO-MAG/88/005 “Promotion de l'aquaculture et privatisation de la production d'alevins” a préparé ce document et en langue française et en langue malgache, traitant de l'élevage de la carpe commune et de la rizipisciculture en tenant compte des conditions qui prévalent sur les Hautes-Terres malgaches. Ces deux chapitres sont précédés d'un chapitre traitant de quelques notions de pisciculture générale.  Plus tard, en fonction de l'essort que prendra la pisciculture à Madagascar, d'autres chapitres pourraient voir le jour comme l'élevage des carpes chinoises, l'élevage de tilapia, la vulgarisation piscicole, la gestion d'une ferme piscicole, …  Ce manuel servira de document de base pour les exploitants agricoles producteurs d'alevins en milieu rural et pour les agents de vulgarisation des services étatiques et non-étatiques.  Ce document pourra également servir de base pour des cours de formation, en particulier les cours dans le cadre de tout projet régional de développement du Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD) et l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO).  La conception de ce manuel ainsi qu'une première série de fiches est de Monsieur Jean Pierre Marquet, expert-conseil auprès du projet. Par la suite, une équipe du projet composée d'experts nationaux et internationaux a adapté mais surtout complété cette première version du consultant.";"Jean Pierre Marquet

To assist countries in the implementation of the Gender Equality principle of the VGGT, FAO, with the support of the Department for International Development (DFID) and the Government of Germany, has designed a capacity development programme entitled “Governing land for women and men”, aimed to enhance participants’ knowledge and competencies so as to enable them to contribute to gender-equitable and socially inclusive governance of land tenure when they carry out their daily work.  The capacity development programme has two components: a self-paced e-learning course and a blended learning programme. Both are designed for a multi-stakeholder audience, including policy-makers, administrators, civil society organizations, producers’ organizations, academia, and private enterprises working in the land sector.  In 2015, the gender-learning programme was successfully implemented in Mongolia and South Africa.

Bujumbura (Burundi). 25-28 November 1992.";"This document contains the papers presented at the Symposium on Biology, Stock Assessment and Exploitation of Small Pelagic Fish Species in the African Great Lakes Region. The symposium, jointly organized by the FINNIDA/FAO/AGFUND project Research for the management of fisheries on Lake Tanganyika (LTR) and the FAO/UNDP project Inland Fisheries Planning, Development and Management in Eastern/Central/Southern Africa (IFIP), was held in Bujumbura, Burundi from 25 to 28 November 1992.  The Lakes and Reservoirs included in the 20 Symposium papers are Itezhi-Tezhi, Mweru-Luapula, Malawi, Kariba, Kibu, Tanganyika and Victoria. The small pelagic species treated are Limnothrissa miodon, Stolothrissa tanganicae, Rastrineobola argentea, Poecilothrissa moeruensis and Engraulicypris sardella. The topics covered include biology, life history, growth and mortality and various aspects of the fisheries.Small body size is a feature of Limnothrissa miodon in the man-made Lakes Kariba and Cahora Bassa. Recent reliable determinations of their growth confirm the earlier very high estimates of their mortality. These high mortality rates are consistent with the small body size of the fish. A similar allometric relationship applies to the production/biomass ratios. Because most fish die after a few months there is no relationship between fishing effort and catch. Regulating effort may therefore contribute little to the management of this stock. The greatest risk to the fishery is a collapse of recruitment and there is an urgent need to understand the factors that regulate reproduction.";"B.E. Marshall and R. Mubamba (editors)

There is a need to conduct multi-scale spatially-explicit analyses of woodfuel supply and demand that are able to articulate the local heterogeneity into the regional and national levels. Studies that provide full-country coverage and are based on a consistent integration of data at lower geographical scales are critically lacking. These studies should be based on a spatial representation of woodfuel use and production patterns in order to identify priority areas and hot spots for intervention.";"Forestry Department

Agriculture is both a cause and a casualty of water scarcity. It accounts for an estimated 70 percent of global water withdrawals, with freshwater resources heavily stressed by irrigation and food production.   While demand for water for agriculture and other uses are increasing rapidly, climate change also affects fresh water resources negatively both in terms of quantity and quality. More frequent and severe droughts are having an impact on agricultural production, while rising temperatures translate into increased crop water demand.  Water use is growing at more than twice the rate of population increase, and a 60 percent surge in food demand is expected by 2050. There is an urgent need, therefore, to address water scarcity.

It also includes guidance for quantification of baseline GHG emissions from dairy production in a defined geographical area within a country, for quantification of with-project GHG emissions, leakage, and net emission reductions due to project implementation. The general approach outlined in the methodology is based on the following key elements. A standardized baseline for the project region is set on the basis of a baseline survey, which establishes a statistically robust relationship between milk yields and the GHG intensity of milk production measured as kg CO2 eq. per kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM).";"Gabriel Kuettel";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-09";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/90d9b4d2-aa82-4e2b-bca3-80583a08bc3a";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6260e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/8e9548c3-649e-4a80-86f6-41d931986733_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

Despite these  benefits, our record of managing fisheries so that the benefits can be sustained has been  poor; at best, and most fisheries around the world are experiencing serious ecological,  social or economic problems and usually all three. Today there is global concern about  the state of fishery resources and aquatic ecosystems, their resilience to future stresses  such as climate change and their ability to continue to provide benefits.  Fisheries management Is the process that has evolved to try to ensure that fisheries  operate in a manner that provides the immediate benefits in a sustainable manner. The  widely accepted goal is that the full range of benefits should not only be available for  this generation but for generations to come. fisheries management has been successful  in some cases but there have also been many, many cases of failure.  This volume is intended to contribute to Improving this unsatisfactory state by  addressing the widespread need for Information and guidance on the broad and often complex task of  fisheries management. It is an updated and expanded edition of AFishery Manager’s Guidebook which was  published as a FAO Fisheries Technical Paper in 2002.  The major part of this new edition is divided into five parts intended to cover the range of concerns, tools  and techniques essential to the modem fisheries manager, whether that manager Is an Individual or a  formal or Informal group. following the Introduction:  Part I examines the primary dimensions of fisheries: biological, ecological. social and economic  Part Ii looks at the legal and Institutional characteristics of fisheries  Part III explores the tools that fishery managers have to achieve the objectives expected from a fishery  Part IV discusses the role of scientific Information of Indicators and reference points  Part V moves Into Implementation of fisheries management and Includes a chapter on special  considerations In small-scale fisheries  It concludes with a chapter that summarises the current state of knowledge and best practices and looks  ahead to possible futures for fisheries governance.  This landmark publication is intended to be a practical guide to those actively engaged In fisheries  management and will be of particular Interest to fishery managers and scientists. All libraries in research  establishment and universities where fisheries and aquatic sciences are studied and taught will need copies  of this Important volume.";"edited by Kevern L.

They process a large part of the raw materials from the forest       and supply some of the main markets for forest products, in particular in the rural areas of       developing countries. Our concern in the work reported on in this publication has been to       determine the main features, prospects and problems of such small-scale enterprises and what       support could enhance their developmental contribution, and therefore the developmental impact       of the forest sector. Many small enterprises are currently unstable, and offer little security or       prospect of self-reliance for those engaged in them. These problems need to be tackled by       promoting viable enterprises run by rural people through effective participatory organizations which       can increase peoples' control over their own economic destiny. External support to increase       production and efficiency needs to be compatible with those valuable elements of local culture       which still have a role to play in the modern context.";"Forestry Department";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"1987-12";"en";"decentralization;development agencies;rural areas;natural resources management;forestry;community forestry;rural development;urban areas";"Urban Tenure;Forest Tenure";"";"IND;TZA;ITA;PER;PHL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/48693684-62be-5020-98ec-342c80ca2f1c";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-s8380e.htm";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/df4bc9eb-fbd6-505e-9d23-550d98440576_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

The Expert Consultation was intended and designed to develop a set of general  recommendations to assist in addressing the difficult subject of overcapacity in  marine capture fisheries. The result is guidance about a general, flexible process for  assisting the transition of fisheries that are characterized by overcapacity into  fisheries that are characterized as fully utilized, economically efficient and that meet  the management objectives and goals of the agency or group that has fisheries  management responsibility. The experts recognized that different fisheries will likely  adopt different capacity reduction programmes to reflect particular social,  management, economic and other needs. Because there is no single solution,  capacity reduction programmes will likely be a combination of some of the issues and  approaches that are also described in the documentation.";"Ianiri

All representatives of the countries (except from Morocco) as well as the RCU URC and the project partners were able to participate. The meeting was organized under the theme ""CCLME Coastal and marine habitats: a major challenge for a Large Marine Ecosystem."" It aimed to contribute to the development of the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and initiate a process to lead to the preparation of a management and monitoring of critical habitats plan in the region. This activity of identification and location of the various coastal and marine habitats has allowed the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) to begin the mapping of habitats and biodiversity in the CCLME region. All the country representatives and partners attending the meeting produced communications related to the theme. This demonstrated the great diversity of habitats both coastal and marine that characterize this ecosystem and explain its high productivity, one of the largest in the LME world. Particular emphasis was placed on mangroves through the progress of the CCLME project of demonstration No. 5 where works on the rehabilitation of mangroves have been made in Guinea Bissau and The Gambia, the majority of field studies has also been implemented. The Mangrove charter developed in the framework of the West African Regional Marine and Coastal Conservation Partnership (PRCM) for the West African sub-region and its origins have also been the subject of a communication. The spatial tool developed for the region by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) and the scope of which is to show and to follow the spatial and temporal distribution was detailed with all the features and services that it could offer.

La base de datos está disponible mundialmente, detallada por países, para todas las subcategorías de agricultura, silvicultura y suelos disponibles en FAOSTAT y en la Evaluación de Recursos Forestales (FRA por sus siglas en inglés). Las emisiones de GEI se calculan de los datos de actividad oficial nacional y los análisis geoespaciales, aplicando metodologías estándares internacionales del Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (IPCC por sus siglas en inglés) para asegurar la coherencia con los procesos de Inventario de GEI establecidos bajo la convención climática. El análisis muestra aumentos de las emisiones en la agricultura (de 4.6 a 5.0 Gt CO2 eq año-1 en las décadas de 1990 y 2000; 5.3 Gt CO2 eq año-1 en 2011), disminuciones en las tasas de deforestación (de 4.6 a 3.8 Gt CO2 eq año-1 en las décadas de 1990 y 2000; 3.7 Gt CO2 eq año-1 en 2010), y disminuciones en sumideros forestales, si bien con una inversión desde mediados de la década de los 2000 (de -2.9 a -1.9 Gt CO2 eq año-1 en valores de las décadas de 1990 y 2000; -2.1 Gt CO2 eq año-1 en 2010). A su vez, los datos muestran que la intensidad de los productos de GEI (es decir, emisiones de GEI por unidad de materia prima producida) disminuyeron durante los años 1990 hasta 2010, pero si no se ponen en marcha medidas de mitigación y mejoras en la eficiencia técnica, en un futuro, las emisiones podrían aumentar hasta el 30% para 2050. Una mayor información sobre las emisiones AFOLU es de gran importancia en muchos países en desarrollo, dado el potencial para identificar y financiar acciones que puedan unir de manera provechosa la seguridad alimentaria nacional, la resiliencia y la mitigación con los objetivos de desarrollo en un conjunto coherente.

Fair and secure leasing arrangements that balance the interests of the tenant and the land owner can lead to improvements in access to land for farming, better agricultural production and improved access to food.    At the core of most land-leasing arrangements are three issues shared by tenant and land owner alike: risk, security and trust. The success of the land owner-tenant relationship depends on the level of trust that can be established between them. A proper agreement can lay the groundwork for such trust, through flexibility for the land owner and security for the tenant. In this way, many potential problems or disputes can be avoided. The guide provides information for tenants and land owners who are interested in benefiting from having a clear leasing agreement. It supports the preparation of mutually beneficial lease contracts by identifying key features that make such contracts effective for both the owner and the tenant.";"Economic and Social Development Department";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2004-12";"en";"land governance;tenant's rights;land use;land tenure;land access;leases;agrarian reform;land ownership";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"ITA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/3e25dd6e-7833-5247-818e-349b81aca16f";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-y5513e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/febbe2f0-2c7f-563a-a5d9-092a69aa012f_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

The task of identifying and protecting local rights in most African countries faces several major challenges like incorporating many different local land management systems within a single land management framework; devising a system that can adequately record dynamic and shifting patterns of land use that incorporate a range of de facto private, individualised customary rights and areas of common use and, finally, coming up with a technical approach that is cost effective yet still accurate enough to establish borders and other features on official maps.   In this context conventional western concepts of discrete, fixed land holding units – ‘the farm’ - are entirely inappropriate. They work for the relatively small number of private investor land holdings, but are of little use for registering customary rights rooted in shifting agriculture systems and the use of a wide range of resources through the year.   The community delimitation model which is the subject of this volume has grown out of the experience of Mozambique and its widely acclaimed 1997 Land Law.  The policy and legal development process has been supported by FAO from its inception in the pre-policy research stage, through to policy and legal development, and now implementation.  It offers an excellent example of how to create the policy and legal environment within which effective rights delimitation can take place.";"FAO-CFJJ

These Guidelines represent the greatest extent of “common ground” on governance of tenure that has been found to date in a global forum.

Elles génèrent des moyens de subsistance pour les populations, fournissent des produits ligneux et non ligneux, procurent de l’eau potable et abritent la moitié des espèces animales et végétales de la planète. Pourtant, 13 millions d’hectares de forêts sont convertis chaque année pour d’autres usages, produisant près de 17 pour cent des émissions annuelles de gaz à effet de serre d’origine humaine. Les négociations internationales relatives aux forêts requièrent des informations précises sur le couvert forestier et les ressources forestières. Depuis 1946, l’organisation des Nations Unies pour l’alimentation et l’agriculture (FAO) publie tous les 5 à 10 ans des informations détaillées sur l’état des forêts du monde, leur superficie et leurs usages. Pour l’édition 2010 de l’Evaluation des Ressources Forestières mondiales (FRA), une enquête systématique et exhaustive par télédétection a été mise en oeuvre.";"Forestry Department

An increasing number of countries are introducing policies to decentralize the provision of rural services but very often local levels of government have insufficient funds to carry out these newly  decentralized responsibilities. Raising revenues through property taxes on rural land represents one way to improve the capacity of local levels to deliver services. Rural livelihoods are inhibited without  sound rural infrastructure and property tax has an important role in helping to provide it.  The guide identifies issues that should be considered by those who are responsible for the technical design and implementation of rural property tax systems. It identifies the benefits and problems associated with the introduction of rural property taxes, the relationship to other taxes and organizational constraints, and provides a chronological checklist for introducing reforms. The guide demonstrates that introducing property tax in rural areas is technically  feasible and will benefit the rural economy.";"Murguia

The purpose of these papers is to explore issues related to livestock development in the context of poverty alleviation. In order to reduce poverty we must first describe, explain and predict its spatial distribution over large areas with as high a level of local accuracy as possible. Poverty maps are traditionally produced by exploiting links between census (wide area) and survey (smaller area coverage) data. The detailed relationships found within the survey data are extended to the census data that must share some predictor variables in common with the survey data. Both census and survey data tend to be socioeconomic in nature; the mapping thus exploits the internal correlations within potentially strongly correlated data sets   one  measure  of poverty is often correlated with another.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2006-12";"en";"poverty";"";"";"KEN;BFA;USA;ZAF;NIC;UGA;ITA;002;ECU;VNM";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/2bb605b3-0f45-4fe5-be2e-d7980031f151";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bp198e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/a2df893f-3e51-45d9-b11a-8e14546839f4_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

Estas herramientas proporcionan los medios para perfeccionar las capacidades de evaluación y manejo necesarias para: comparar los resultados de varios planes de asignación de agua, mejorar las prácticas de control de humedad del suelo bajo condiciones de secano, optimizar el calendario de riego (ya sea máximo, deficitario o suplementario), intensificar de forma sostenible la producción agrícola, cerrar las brechas en el rendimiento y en la productividad de agua, cuantificar el impacto de la variabilidad climática y el cambio en los sistemas de cultivo, mejorar las estrategias que buscan mayor productividad hídrica y ahorro de agua, y minimizar el impacto negativo sobre el medio ambiente causado por la agricultura. Estas herramientas tienen un valor incalculable para varios profesionales del sector agrario, entre ellos: gestores y planificadores del suministro hídrico, servicios de extensión, distritos de riego, ingenieros consultores, agencias gubernamentales, organizaciones no gubernamentales y asociaciones de agricultores, economistas agrarios y científicos investigadores.";"Steduto, P.

"FAODOCREP:4fc273c0-1c5f-5e70-939f-2f09cd0abbc0";"Review of fisheries and aquaculture development potentials in Armenia.";"The present document is an update and presentation of the natural, economic and social resources  for sustainable development and management of the fishery and aquaculture sector in Armenia. It  aims to call attention to, and provide evidence of, the fact that fisheries and aquaculture have  substantial development potentials in Armenia. The country is rich in inland water resources, but  the potentials of the fishery and aquaculture sector are far from being exploited. Better utilization of  water resources could be achieved through improved coordination and administration, including the  implementation of rules and regulations of inland fisheries together with the enlargement of national  and international markets.  The review recommends better fisheries utilization of natural and artificial water bodies, as well as  suggesting coordinated joint action of government authorities and fish producers, regarding the  certification of fish and fishery products to European Union markets.  The most obvious entry points for the development of inland fisheries and aquaculture are: planned  fisheries management of natural waters, better utilization of underground water resources, improved  governmental support through improved administration and more intensive backing of the fisheries  and aquaculture sector.  The review also presents a wide range of available data and information in order to facilitate the  identification and utilization of further areas of fisheries and aquaculture development in the  country. For this reason, detailed lists of actual and potential natural and social resources are  presented and discussed, together with important determining factors of sector administration,  management and business performance.";"Fisheries and Aquaculture Department

By setting out principles and internationally accepted standards for responsible practices, the Voluntary Guidelines will provide a framework and point of reference that stakeholders can use when developing their own policies and actions.    Regional consultations on the proposed Voluntary Guidelines are an important part of the process. They bring together regionally representative, multidisciplinary groups to assess regional priorities and issues that should be considered when the Voluntary Guidelines are drafted. The regional consultation for Southern Africa was hosted by the Ministry of Lands and Resettlement of Namibia and was opened by the Minister, the Hon. Alpheus !Naruseb. The consultation was co-sponsored by BMZ (Ministry for Economic Development, Germany) and FAO, with local organizational support provided by the Namibia Institute for Democracy. It was attended by 57 people from 11 countries (Angola,  Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) who brought a rich and extensive range of expertise derived from their experience in the public sector, private sector, civil society and academia.";"arial

It takes stock of where FAO and its partners are in terms of addressing property rights insecurity and provides a proposed framework through which future action can take place. It focuses on the following dimensions: understanding property rights in the era of AIDS (including key research findings); linkages between gender, property rights and livelihoods; legislation, training of the judiciary and traditional leaders, and para-legal training programmes; advocacy, mobilization of grassroots groups/networks; and political dialogue.     Drawing together experiences and expertise on these issues, and identifying research and programme gaps, this report concludes with some key recommendations for future work and priority areas of action.";"Carpano, F.

For many developing countries, remittances from overseas migrants exceed development aid and foreign direct investment volumes. Moreover, remittances from migrant relatives, either internal or international, are often the main component of rural households’ incomes. Unlike aid, remittances flow directly to individual households and unlike loans they incur no debt. Besides contributing to household livelihoods, remittances can foster longer-term development through investment in education, land and small businesses. In some places, migrants' associations channel part of the remittance inflows into community development projects, such as schools, health centres and wells. ";"Cotula, L.

It was initiated in drylands, but the methods and tools have been developed so as to be widely applicable in other ecosystems and diverse contexts with minimal required adaptation.  LADA?s products have been tested, adapted and validated by the six participating countries for the cost effective and scientifically robust assessment and monitoring of the status and trends of their land resources and ecosystems.    It provides a sound basis for the preparation of future planning and investment frameworks for land resources (soil, water, vegetation/ biodiversity, ecosystems) management and planning. Adopting the LADA approach can assist the development of national action plans, strategies and policies for combating desertification, improving food security and alleviating rural poverty, especially in response to climate change. LADA surveys forms reliable baselines for monitoring and evaluation of SLM programmes.";"Riccardo Biancalani, Freddy Nachtergaele, Monica Petri, Sally Bunning

"FAODOCREP:bee03701-10d1-40da-bcb8-633c94446922";"Building a Common Vision for Sustainable Food and Agriculture";"Over the coming 35 years, agriculture will face an unprecedented confluence of pressures, including a 30 percent increase in the global population, intensifying competition for increasingly scarce land, water and energy resources, and the existential threat of climate change. To provide for a population projected to reach 9.3 billion in 2050 and support changing dietary patterns, estimates are that food production will need to increase from the current 8.4 billion tonnes to almost 13.5 billion tonnes a year. Achieving that level of production from an already seriously depleted natural resource base will be impossible without profound changes in our food and agriculture systems. We need to expand and accelerate the transition to sustainable food and agriculture which ensures world food security, provides economic and social opportunities, and protects the ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. This report is aimed primarily at policy makers and others who make or influence national and institutional decisions and actions. It is the outcome of intensive consultations and discussions aimed at developing a common approach to FAO’s work on sustainability. That process was conducted in a climate of cross-sectoral collaboration that drew on the contributions of leading specialists in crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, and natural resources. It builds on the Organization’s long experience in developing sustainability concepts, approaches and tools, and offers a common vision of the agriculture sector and of the inter-sectoral synergies aiming at making agriculture more productive and sustainable.";"Animal Production and Health Division

"FAODOCREP:c4d9d4e1-ebd7-4a9b-aed0-05159fd223b5";"Poplars and Willows: Trees for Society and the Environment";"Taxonomy and classification of the Salicaceae are addressed in an authoritative manner, with descriptions of all important individual species, but recognizing the differences in philosophy that still exist in these topics. Natural ecosystems are described. Genetic resources of poplars and willows are covered comprehensively, including selection, tree improvement and conservation, as well as the latest developments in genomics. Cultivation of poplars in plantations for industrial uses was the core of previous volumes and continues to be given prominent treatment, with information also on willow cultivation. A major 21st century topic included is the environmental applications of poplars and willows in phytoremediation, rehabilitation of landscapes and for carbon sequestration, biodiversity and urban amenity, among other uses (McCutcheon and Schnoor, 2003). The most important diseases of poplars and willows are described, as well as strategies for their control. Insects and other animal pests of poplars and willows are treated similarly. Wood properties and utilization of poplars and willows for traditional, as well as emerging, new products are presented. Markets, trends and outlook for wood products worldwide are analysed, considering poplars in relation to tree species in general. The benefits of poplars and willows for sustainable land use and rural livelihoods, including agroforestry, food security, poverty alleviation and shelter, particularly in developing countries, are highlighted.";"FAO, CABI

These tools provide the means to sharpen assessment and management capacities required to: compare the result of several water allocations plans; improve soil-moisture control-practices under rainfed conditions; optimize irrigation scheduling (either full, deficit or supplementary); sustainably intensify crop production; close the yield and water-productivity gaps; quantify the impact of climate variability and change on cropping systems; enhance strategies for increased water productivity and water savings; minimize the negative impact on the environment caused by agriculture.     These tools are invaluable to various agricultural practitioners including, but not limited to: water managers and planners; extension services; irrigation districts; consulting engineers; governmental agencies; non-governmental organizations and farmers ́ associations; agricultural economists and research scientists.";"Steduto, P.

"FAODOCREP:c7db1ef3-0d77-4f9b-81f6-bc7825eed0d8";"Marine Spatial Planning for Enhanced Fisheries and Aquaculture Sustainability ";" This document provides a clear and comprehensive account for the application of marine spatial planning (MSP) within the Regional Commission for Fisheries (RECOFI) region. It builds on regional technical workshops, held under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), aimed principally at improving the prospects for fisheries and aquaculture in the Near East. Marine spatial planning provides a step-by-step process that allows for the cooperative integration of the major marine uses and users within a defined marine area. These ordered procedures allow all stakeholders to work towards ensuring the long-term sustainability of identified marine activities. The principles of the ecosystem approach to both fisheries and aquaculture can readily be incorporated into the process. The output of MSP is the development of a plan that addresses any potentially conflicting uses of the sea, thus enabling the strategic, forward-looking planning for the regulation, zoning, management, protection and sustainability of the marine environment. MSP can best function if it includes continuing reinforcement and adjustments of learned experiences over a long time period. The document includes three important annexes. The first includes the main recommendations concerning the adoption of marine spatial planning taken from the RECOFI (FAO) Cairo workshop in 2012. The second describes the types of marine activities that must be considered, their relative importance to the national economy and to the sustainability of the marine environment. The third annex provides a comprehensive listing of additional information about MSP, including worldwide examples where MSP has been applied under varied local conditions at highly variable geographic scales.

Given the dynamic nature of ICTs, some of the examples given here may be outdated in a short time, while new applications of ICTs that are currently beyond our imagination will be developed and accepted.

Municipal support policies for operators";"While modern food distribution systems are evolving in many cities,  more traditional and often informal forms of food supply continue to be  vitally important in the towns and cities of developing countries and  countries in transition. They are important because they can best cater to  the specific needs of poor urban households. They also provide  employment and income to low income households, and supply food  products and services that are tailored to the particular needs of urban  consumers. It is therefore essential that these activities be recognized  and supported by the local authorities. The overall aim of this guide is to  underline the important role played by the informal sector in urban food  security. It examines various forms of local policy support for the  informal food sector and, with this in mind, calls for an accurate and upto-  date representation of sectoral activities and players (using a  participatory approach) and an understanding of related problems  caused and encountered.";"Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division

"FAODOCREP:f8d7efed-e9b9-55fd-ada3-b806eacab16d";"Smallholders and sustainable wells";"With 16 percent of the world’s population, India has 2.45 percent of the world’s  land resources and 4 percent of its water resources. It is obvious that supply  will barely match future demand. Around 50 percent of irrigated agriculture  and 85 percent of rural drinking water comes from groundwater. Sustainable  management of groundwater plays a major role in the agriculture sector,  contributing to the economic development of a mainly agrarian country.  Half of farmer households in India are indebted and the average outstanding  loan increases with the size of the landholding. Smallholders, who have no  access to irrigation make up a major portion of the worlds’ poor. In relation  to operational area, the poor are well represented in groundwater irrigation.  Over 60 percent of India’s irrigated area is dependent on some form of  groundwater source.  The people nearest the groundwater can best manage this resource, not  agencies that visit every now and then. Therefore, the nature, occurrence  and behaviour of aquifer systems need to be understood by those most  affected by changes in the system. Local organizations, government, civil  society and the private sector all have important, and often unique, roles to  play in participatory groundwater management (PGM). This publication is an  attempt to describe these roles as they developed during the life of a set of  projects in Andhra Pradesh.  PGM is highly relevant for India’s rural development, given current  groundwater development practice and related institutional capacities and  policy initiatives. Without some method for putting management into the  hands of users, the long-term viability of many rural communities is at risk.";"Venkata, S.

Owing to ﬁ nancial constraints, it is difﬁ cult to have complete and comprehensive information on everything related to water. Techniques and methodologies are, therefore, used to affordably maximize control. To improve understanding of the different techniques and methodologies used to generate information, the AQUASTAT team sent thematic questionnaires to approximately 170 countries in April 2009. These questionnaires sought to investigate the methods used to generate information on water resources and water uses at the national level to facilitate reporting of internationally comparable data. The results of this exercise emphasized the need to discuss strategies to manage problems arising in the collection, interpretation and analysis of information related to water. These results could improve international comparisons based on information reported in the AQUASTAT database. To this end, an expert workshop on methods for assessing water resources and water uses in Latin America was held in Santiago, Chile, on 1 and 2 December 2009. The workshop brought together professionals from various technical disciplines, all representatives of government agencies. The workshop served as a preliminary step in deﬁ ning the challenges and corresponding solutions in the area of water information, and served as a platform to raise the awareness of Latin American countries on the range of techniques used in the region. This forum sought to share relevant technical knowledge to better face the challenges of water scarcity, climate change and competition for natural resources";"mac11

The latex is used for chewing gums, insulator, tube, and others. The wood is soft and bright colour, which can be used for pulp, plywood, pencil, wooden toy, and others. It naturally grows on peat swamp forests in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian part of Borneo). Along with fast deforestation, population of wild jelutung is decreasing. In the era of degraded peatland restoration, jelutung was promoted to be planted in reforestation and afforestation. Enrichment planting with jelutung in the existing tree crops would increase biomass and carbon sequestration. Farmers will get additional income from the latex of jelutung and cash crops (such as galangal dan ginger). Farmers would protect their land and farms from fir. To sum up, community collaboration is important on peatland management, as they are integral part of the landscape.

"FAODOCREP:c0d47166-f87c-5848-aa8f-1011ce593289";"Participatory Livelihoods Monitoring";"This Livelihood Support Programme (LSP) Working Paper is the result of a follow-up on an extensive research study undertaken in Cambodia. Results of the study were the development of a participatory and results-oriented monitoring methodology and suggestions to overcome basic communication gaps between the rural population and decision makers on different administrative levels. The aim of this LSP Working Paper is to provide a simple and hands-on insight into the developed methodology and the suggested strategies to overcome the identified communication gaps. It should therefore serve as a guideline for practitioners who wish to apply a participatory and results-oriented monitoring methodology in their various project contexts. The general framework and results described in this LSP Working Paper reflect the unique situation of coastal Cambodia. Nevertheless, the described methodology can easily be adapted to other circumstances. The specific focus of the Cambodian research study was on agricultural activities and on poverty and food security. Adaptations for other contexts will need some amendments of the methodology and procedure. Anybody with experience in participatory monitoring and evaluation will find it easy to adjust the process for other circumstances.";"Strele, M.

The area of the reserve is approximately 6 500 ha large and the range of altitudes (350 to 1 600 m) is responsible for a wide variety of habitats. A typical Mediterranean ecosystem is located within the reserve, where evergreen sclerophylic shrubs and forests are the most common type of vegetation spread on karstic landscapes and steep slopes. Jabal Moussa was designated as a Protected Forest by the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture in 2008. A year later, it was declared as a Biosphere Reserve under UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere Program, as well as an Important Bird Area by Bird Life International. Like all UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, Jabal Moussa is divided into three main management zones: core area, buffer zone, and development or transition zone (Figure";"Navarrete Poyatos, M.

"FAODOCREP:b7468a18-d930-4dfd-ac56-e17437e66aae";"Plan of Action for Pillar Five of the Global Soil Partnership   ";"The Global Soil Partnership (GSP) was formally established by members of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) during its Council in December 2012. The Council recognized soil as an essential natural resource, which is often overlooked and has not received adequate attention in recent years, despite the fact that production of food, fiber, fodder, and fuel critically depends on healthy soils. The Mandate of the GSP is to improve governance of the limited soil resources of the planet in order to guarantee agriculturally productive soils for a food secure world, and support other essential ecosystem services, in accordance with the sovereign right of each State over its natural resources. In order to achieve its mandate, the GSP addresses the following five pillars of action to be implemented in collaboration with its regional soil partnerships: 1. Promote sustainable management of soil resources for soil protection, conservation and sustainable productivity; 2. Encourage investment, technical cooperation, policy, education, awareness and extension in soil; 3. Promote targeted soil research and development focusing on identified gaps, priorities, and synergies with related productive, environmental, and social development actions; 4. Enhance the quantity and quality of soil data and information: data collection (generation), analysis, validation, reporting, monitoring and integration with other disciplines; 5. Harmonisation of methods, measurements and indicators for the sustainable management and protection of soil resources. Pillar Five provides the mechanisms for developing and exchanging globally consistent and comparable harmonized soil information, through soil profile observation and description data, laboratory and field analytical data, and derived products. Harmonization, which could be seen as a next step to standardization, provides the ability to describe, sample, classify, and analyze the soil in a way that allows the use of the results for later scientific use.";"Working Group: Rainer Baritz, Chair (Germany), Niels Batjes (The Netherlands), Bernd Bussian (Germany), Hakki Erdogan (Turkey), Kazumichi Fujii (Japan), Jon Hempel (USA), Marco Nocita (Italy), Yusuke Takata, (Japan) Peter Wilson (Australia), Ronald Vargas (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2013-12";"en";"research;land management;sustainable development";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"CHE;USA;JPN;LUX;TUR;DEU;ITA;AUS;CAN;KOR;HUN;NLD";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/b7468a18-d930-4dfd-ac56-e17437e66aae";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-az922e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/e19a0b2e-30b5-4348-a9f0-5271219f69be_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

La Situation des forêts du monde est publiée tous les  deux ans.  Dans toute l'histoire de l'humanité, le développement  économique a entraîné dans son sillage la déforestation.  C'est d'ailleurs en grande partie en raison de la  déforestation qu'a été mis au point le concept de  développement durable, qui a ensuite évolué au sein des  sciences forestières. On peut trouver une note de réconfort  dans le fait que la déforestation n'est plus un problème  grave dans la plupart des pays qui se sont développés sur  le plan économique et qui ont mis en place des pratiques  forestières rationnelles, appuyées par un engagement  politique ferme. Une chose est toutefois claire: faire des  forêts un élément central de toute stratégie pour un avenir  durable n'est pas un choix facultatif, c'est une obligation.    Les forestiers de profession devront s'efforcer de  communiquer une idée simple: la meilleure façon de  sauver une forêt est de la gérer de façon durable, en  profitant des produits et des services qu'elle fournit.  Si l'on applique les principes de la gestion durable des  forêts et que l'on réserve une place plus importante  aux produits forestiers et aux services écosystèmiques,  l'économie mondiale sera plus verte.  La présente édition du rapport sur la Situation des  forêts du monde 2012 servira, comme les neuf  éditions précédentes, de source de référence, à  l'appui  des politiques et de la recherche forestières. J'espère  aussi que certaines idées exposées ici alimenteront  le débat et susciteront des approches novatrices afin  d'orienter l'économie mondiale vers des objectifs  plus verts.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

The objective of the Voluntary Guidelines is to provide practical guidance to States in their implementation of the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security, in order to achieve the goals of the World Food Summit Plan of Action.

Analysis is provided on technical features in the early development of FREL/FRLs. The publication contains a list of country examples that is however not complete; not every country working on their FREL/FRL methodology is included in the analysis, which aims to be illustrative of the diversity of approaches taken rather than comprehensive. To date, one country has submitted a FREL under the UNFCCC which is why most examples are related to FREL/FRLs prepared for demonstration activities.   The document will be regularly updated with additional information, including UNFCCC submissions of FREL/FRLs as they become available.";"Forestry Department

Lorsque, dans les  années 80, de nombreuses ressources ont été exploitées complètement  ou à l’excès, les décideurs ont commencé à être attentifs à la gestion des  pêches, outre le développement de l’aquaculture.    L’aquaculture continue à progresser, tandis que la pêche – pour  l’ensemble du monde – semble plafonner. Compte tenu de l’importance  croissante de l’aquaculture, La situation mondiale des pêches et de  l'aquaculture 2006 se termine par un examen des défis que l’aquaculture  doit relever et des possibilités qui s’offrent à ce secteur.

Our main objective is to draw attention to the need for greater understanding of relationships between the hydraulics and productivity of lagoon fish and shellfish. The fishery yields from lagoons vary widely, and, probably, predictably, once such relationships are understood. Furthermore, the productivities of many lagoons could probably be enhanced by hydraulic manipulations, but the hydraulic manipulation is presently risky, except in dystrophic lagoons.   The document includes a description of lagoon physics, how hydraulics are likely linked to lagoon productivity, how lagoons might be expected to respond to hydraulic alterations, and a protocol for physical investigations. This latter is a necessary step to protect as well as enhance fisheries and aquaculture resources in lagoons, which are especially vulnerable to degradation and overexploitation.";"John M.

We nd that factor inputs are roughly evenly spread among farmers: operated land size and capital are essentially unrelated to farm TFP implying a strong negative eect on aggregate agricultural productivity. A reallocation of factors to their ecient use among existing farmers would increase agricultural productivity by a factor of 3.6-fold. We relate factor misallocation to severely restricted land markets as the vast majority of land is without a title and a very small portion of operated land is rented in. The gains from reallocation are 2.6 times larger for farms with no marketed land than for farms that operate marketed land. The ecient reallocation of factor inputs in the agricultural sector would trigger a profound process of structural change setting the farm size and the agricultural employment share of Malawi to industrialized levels.";"Santaeulalia-Llopis, R.";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-12";"en";"land management;agriculture";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA;BEL;PHL;CHN;MEX;002;CAN;IND;MWI;TCD;GHA";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/c8c3e3fc-9408-4642-94cf-7f2a7e63d022";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bp110e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/a502d252-970e-4dae-934e-10adfab4f0af_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

Dall’archivio storico della FAO sono state selezionate fotografie inedite, in bianco e nero, dei primi anni dell'Organizzazione, con le quali è stato possibile realizzare un’avvincente raccolta di immagini. Il libro illustra inoltre i maggiori successi della FAO, tra cui l'eliminazione della peste bovina; il Trattato sulle risorse fitogenetiche, un accordo di vitale importanza per la tutela della biodiversità del pianeta; il Codice di condotta per la pesca responsabile, essenziale per la conservazione dell'ecosistema marino. Le più grandi sfide che la FAO dovrà affrontare nei prossimi anni vengono discusse e sintetizzate in due temi principali: l’eliminazione della fame e della malnutrizione e le azioni intraprese per contrastare il cambiamento climatico. Questa pubblicazione conduce inoltre il lettore in un viaggio attraverso gli uffici regionali della FAO per presentare le iniziative regionali.  Con questa pubblicazione, la FAO coglie infine l’occasione per aprire le sue porte, narrare la storia dell’edificio e mostrare le sue sale più rappresentative dove, ogni anno, ospita molteplici conferenze e incontri.

In so doing, it joins the international community’s increasing mobilization in favour of the rights and concerns of indigenous peoples, most of whom suffer disproportionately from multiple adversities such as discrimination, poverty, ill health, political under-representation, and environmental and cultural degradation. Although much attention is focused on the challenges that indigenous peoples face, it is equally important to remember the specialized knowledge and ingenuity which often characterize indigenous livelihood practices.

The document consists of two main parts: i) presentation of background information on the programme activities and analysis of the available information on the regional level; and ii) presentation of data on NWFP on the national level (so-called ""country profiles"").    The country profiles were originally compiled to be made available on the FAO Web site. However, taking into consideration the limited access to the Internet in various countries, it has been decided to publish, in addition, a hardcopy version of the country profiles and to add a regional analysis of the data.    Most of the data presented in this report are indicative figures, which have been collected in published and unpublished reports, and therefore do not represent official statistics. The results presented show that qualitative and quantitative information on NWFP at the national level is still weak. It is hoped that this report will support the on-going process of data improvement on NWFP. Improved data is considered to be essential to ensure that the use and importance of NWFP is adequately taken into consideration by decision-makers, land-use planners, politicians, or other concerned experts. Additional information and comments from readers to improve data on NWFP in Near Eastern countries would be very much appreciated.

It is based on a study of legislation in over forty countries and a review of some of the few empirical studies of forest fund performance.  The overview may serve as checklist of issues and options for policymakers who are designing funds.  It also may illuminate ongoing discussions about appropriate international roles in forest financing. The paper presents some of the common arguments for and against the use of dedicated funds. Understanding these may help improve fund design. Finally, this paper describes some likely future roles for funds to promote sustainable forest management.";"Lindsay, J. M.

It begins by providing an overview discussion of the diversity of natural resources in developing countries, and rights of access, tenure and governance relevant to the rural poor, who are disproportionately dependent on natural resources. We then discuss four key challenges to enhancing assess and sustainable management of natural resources: (i) expanding access to natural resources to increase incomes and improve welfare; (ii) increasing security of access to natural resources, in the context of changing institutional and market conditions; (iii) improving sustainable management of natural resources, including improved resource quality; and (iv) enabling the poor to take advantage of evolving markets, including markets for environmental services. In each case, applications to agricultural land, water, forests and fisheries are elaborated. Finally, we examine five case studies that demonstrate successful approaches to sustainable natural resource management: expanding access to land (South Africa), increasing security of access and sustainable management of forests (Bolivia), supporting locally-driven sustainable management of watersheds (India), improving security of access and sustainable management of fisheries (Samoa), and enabling the poor to access the global carbon market (Mexico). We conclude with key lessons learned and their implications for management and policy.";"Lee, David (ESAC)

Following a brief discussion of the international legal protection of the right to food in Nepal, the review, in particular provides a critical assessment of constitutional as well as legislative provisions and offers a thorough analysis of Supreme Court jurisprudence pertaining to the right to food. In addition to judicial remedy, the review also covers non-judicial means of remedy against the violation of food rights. This review comes at an opportune moment in the sense that Nepal's constitution-making process is yet to be completed and there are also a number of ongoing legislative and policy initiatives towards protection and promotion of the right to food. This review provides detailed knowledge to concerned stakeholders on normative and implementation gaps in relation to the right to adequate food. With the view of assisting Nepal in this process, the review also offers a set of concrete recommendations, touching upon a wide range of aspects of the human right to adequate food. This work was undertaken under the global project entitled ""Integrating the Right to Adequate Food and Good Governance in National Policies, Legislation and Institutions” (GCP/GLO/324/NOR Right to Food at Country Level) run by the Right to Food Team of the FAO. The project aims to address country challenges by promoting human rights-based approach in efforts to achieve food security at all levels, in legislation, policy and programme design and formulation, decision and implementation. By producing this analysis, FAO aims to assist the Government of Nepal, the Constituent Assembly, the Judiciary, the National Human Rights Institutions, and civil society organizations in their initiatives towards advancing the human right to adequate food.";"Economic and Social Development Department

The purpose of these meetings was to provide input into the World Banks Policy Research Report: Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction, which was prepared under the authorship of Klaus Deininger of the World Banks Development Research Group. Building on the discussions at these workshops, this report (which can be accessed at http://econ.worldbank.org/prr/land_policy/) identifies general principles for policies to strengthen tenure security, improve the functioning of land markets and ensure socially desirable land use.";"casalef

Deforestation had stripped the country of half its forest cover, contributing to severe erosion, repetitive flood and drought damage and a decrease in agricultural production which threatened national food security. Recognizing the importance of forests’ watershed and soil protection functions in restoring agricultural productivity, the government undertook an intensive forest rehabilitation effort. The implementation of two Ten-Year Forest Rehabilitation Plans in the 1970s and 1980s not only fully restored the country’s forest cover, but also delivered food security benefits and contributed to national economic development. These goals were achieved by integrating forestry, rural development and community mobilization in the rehabilitation policy. This study demonstrates how the rehabilitation plans incorporated food and nutrition objectives and how forest rehabilitation contributed to satisfying the four dimensions of food security − food availability, food access, food utilization and stability of food security. This experience may provide inspiration for other developing countries desiring to incorporate forest rehabilitation and sustainable forest management in their food security goals and policies.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-02";"en";"sustainable land management;forest land;land access";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IND;KOR;142;USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/c80d82de-d346-4f11-9c58-7e018df78d10";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5444e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/8be53c30-d669-4cb5-847a-a4db8b8b7512_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

Chapter 2 discusses violations of children’s property and inheritance rights and discusses how the spread of HIV/AIDS has contributed to the violations. Chapter 3 assesses several norms of customary law that aim to protect children’s property and inheritance rights as well as the current practices of customary law that—in the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic—serve to complicate and limit children’s ability to maintain their rights. Chapter 4 reviews and assesses a selection of international laws and national laws from the countries in the region that influence children’s property and inheritance rights, emphasizing succession and land laws. Several gaps in national legislation and policy that need to be addressed are identified. ";"Rose, L. L.

It is said that 83% of the population in Botswana still depends on fuelwood for their energy needs. However, this valuable resource base is under threat from the rapidly expanding human population and its related sectoral agricultural and infrastructural developments, persistent annual veld fires, frequently recurring drought and the subsistence utilization of the forests. Various governmental and non-governmental sectors are making frantic efforts to combat these threats through various programmes. But these sectors are usually limited in their efforts by various administrative, technical and institutional weaknesses, such as shortage of manpower and resources. Nevertheless, the situation is slowly improving with the much needed assistance from various regional and international organisations. The government supports all these sectors in their endeavours by constantly reviewing legislation and ensuring its conformity to the notion of forest resources conservation, management and sustainable utilization.";"Forestry Department

Ожидается, что это сотрудничество обретет более стратегическое направление в контексте недавней договоренности о размещении в Казахстане Бюро по партнерству и связи и о выделении этой страной ежегодного взноса в размере 2 миллионов долларов на соответствующую Программу Партнерства для обеспечения страновых потребностей. Новый представитель ФАО в Казахстане был назначен в марте 2016 года.

The primary objective of the programme is to improve the quality of lives of orphans and other vulnerable children (OVC), the elderly and persons with disabilities as well as to enhance their access to essential social welfare services such as health care. At the time of the baseline household survey, beneficiary households received 155 Birr (equivalent to around US$8.50) plus additional amounts for children, disabled members, and dependent elderly above 60 years of age. Overall, the study has provided direct evidence that the SCT pilot programme influences the livelihood strategies of the poor in a differentiated fashion across household head gender and geographic area. The programme has helped families by increasing food security and bringing children out of working household activities, which fit with the objectives of the programme.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-04";"en";"farming systems;agricultural land management;farmers";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"KEN;GHA;MWI;002;ZMB;LSO;ETH;ZWE";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7e3dd536-d424-4664-8b7a-5a8b0d8d33d1";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5540e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/50b00bc7-37a6-4789-aca8-4f60ed1d14e6_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

These covered:  1- Cropping systems and crop residue management  2- Biological N-fixation  3- Research, training and extension.  A central theme much emphasized at the Workshop was the fact that agricultural policy makers, technicians and scientists need to study more closely the basic practices of the small farmers so that proposal for the introduction of new systems could be easily understood, integrated and accepted by these farmers.";"Land and Water Division

This manual is written for all those concerned with the maintenance and improvement of soil fertility, especially under tropical and subtropical conditions. It contains material for use in farmer training. The severe drought and famine in parts of Africa in 1985 have shown the necessity for adequate soil organic matter to prevent hillside erosion and to retain moisture in the soil for crop growth. The cost of mineral fertilizers and their relative scarcity in some areas has increased the need to recycle waste organic materials as sources of crop nutrients. This Bulletin explains the basic composting process, suitable organic wastes, practical composting methods, use of the product in a variety of situations  and a consideration of economic and social benefits.

"FAODOCREP:e3569ace-6d3f-4c0d-b1de-8a8dcb8b30e4";"Beyond ownership: tracking progress on women’s land rights in Sub-Saharan Africa. Infographic";"Ensuring equal rights in ownership and control over land for women and men is essential to achieve gender equality (SDG5) and eliminate poverty (SDG1). Yet capturing the true status of land rights and measuring progress in the SDGs targets related to land tenure is still a challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where: 1)land tenure is often governed by both customary and statutory laws; 2)large swaths of land remain unregistered and women’s plots are less likely than men’s plots to be documented;3)few surveys capture sex-disaggregated data and inquire about the owners and the managers of land separately; 4) landownership, management and other rights over land are often used interchangeably while they do not always overlap! To capture the real status of land rights in countries and monitor the progress in the SDGs, surveys need to consider the different rights and levels of decision-making over land of women and men. When surveys consider these different bundles of rights over land, evidence from 6 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa shows that: 1)women are disadvantaged not only in the ownership but also in the management of land;2) in most countries, female owners do not manage their lands alone, while female managers do not necessarily own the plot; 3) a significant share of reported owners do not have the rights to sell or use the land as collateral and women are particularly disadvantaged.

Four criteria were used to estimate potential for small-scale fish farming in ponds: water loss, potential for farm gate sales, soil and terrain suitability for ponds and availability of agriculture by-products as feed or fertilizer inputs. A fifth criterion was added in order to estimate potential for commercial fish farming: urban market potential. These criteria were weighted in different ways to make small-scale and commercial fish farming models on the basis of expert advice. Numbers of crops per year of Nile tilapia and common carp were predicted based on monthly climatic variables. By varying feeding levels and harvest sizes small-scale and commercial level outputs were simulated. Combining the small-scale and commercial models with the simulations of fish production provided overall suitability ratings for each 5 are minute grid (approximately 9 × 9 km). Field verifications were carried out in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.   The results suggest good potential for freshwater fish farming among many of the Caribbean Island States with relatively large areas rating very suitable or suitable for the combined criteria and with relatively high crops/year output of the species considered. The results of the field verifications indicated the importance of local knowledge for the interpretation of the predictions.";"James McDaid Kapetsky and/y Bisessar Chakalall

When managed sustainably, soils can play an important role in climate change mitigation by storing carbon (carbon sequestration) and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Conversely, if soils are managed poorly or cultivated through unsustainable agricultural practices, soil carbon can be released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), which can contribute to climate change. The steady conversion of grassland and forestland to cropland and grazing lands over the past several centuries has resulted in historic losses of soil carbon worldwide. However, by restoring degraded soils and adopting soil conservation practices, there is major potential to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases from agriculture, enhance carbon sequestration and build resilience to climate change.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2015-12";"en";"climate change;land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"TZA;KEN;002;142;TUN;JPN;CHN;ITA";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/39058c2c-991b-4a24-a0bd-ccd0544e8320";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4737e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/c3304ebf-10b4-4a59-95a8-3913d2eba292_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

Selected policy decisions were analysed following FAPDA’s classification, dividing policy decisions into three main categories: producer-oriented policies, consumer-oriented policies, as well as trade-oriented and macroeconomic policies. Policy decisions reviewed included those most debated and most frequently implemented since the 2007/08 food price crisis.    The report finds that the initial responses to the crisis tended to address immediate food security concerns with short-term, ad-hoc measures. Over the following years however, policy decisions reflected a more long-term and institutionalized approach.  Governments are gradually moving from universal subsidies for food and fuel towards more targeted interventions to reach vulnerable and food insecure households.  Moreover, a growing number of countries have shifted from short-term, ad-hoc cash or food-based interventions towards mainstreaming and institutionalizing social safety net programmes. The initial trade response was to ban or restrict exports and increase imports in efforts to achieve domestic food availability, measures which have since relaxed in support of producers. Also, Countries are increasingly establishing public food reserves to protect domestic supply in times of crisis. We also see a high degree of policy integration at the national level. However, protective trade policies at national levels have contradicted the efforts of regional food security and policy harmonization advocated by many regional economic communities.";"Agriculture and Economic Development Analysis Division

The report draws on a review of the literature and on field research conducted in 2011. Fieldwork mainly involved stakeholder interviews and focus groups discussions with investors, local farmers, outgrowers and wage workers involved with two private-sector companies – in horticulture and jatropha – and with group-based producer schemes organized with the assistance of a member-based organization. The study’s findings indicate clearly that land-related agricultural investments do have gender-differentiated implications for labour and income generation opportunities for rural women and men, and for their access, use and control of land. This means that the governments and international organizations that are encouraging investments in agriculture need to specifically address gender and social equity concerns, and not just concerns of agricultural and economic growth and productivity. The study identifies some good practices from a gender and equity perspective in the businesses examined and suggests some policy recommendations.";"Elizabeth Daley and Clara Mi-young Park

Most of the raw material for local processing and for supplying the rattan industry is still obtained by harvesting of unmanaged, wild rattan resources in natural tropical forests. Only a very small share is obtained from rattan plantations.

La demande  supplémentaire en produits alimentaires, associée à la demande générée par les  utilisations concurrentes, fera peser une pression sans précédent sur de nombreux  systèmes de production agricole tout autour de la planète. Ces «systèmes en danger»  sont confrontés à une compétition de plus en plus âpre pour les ressources en terres et  en eau tandis que leur potentiel productif est souvent affaibli par des pratiques agricoles  non durables. Il est donc impératif de leur accorder une attention particulière et de  prendre des mesures correctives spécifiques.  Le rapport sur l'état des ressources en terres et en eau pour l'alimentation et  l'agriculture dans le monde (SOLAW) analyse les diverses options qui permettraient de  surmonter les problèmes et d'améliorer la gestion des ressources dans ces zones à haut  risque. Dans chacune de ces zones, un ensemble de réformes des institutions et des  politiques devra être associé à un accès facilité aux technologies qui permettent de mieux  gérer les ressources en terres et en eau. L'accroissement des investissements, l'accès à  des mécanismes de financement novateurs, la coopération internationale et l'aide au  développement auront également un rôle d’appui à jouer.  Cette première édition du SOLAW, qui complète les autres rapports mondiaux publiés  régulièrement par la FAO, vise à fournir des éléments utiles au débat public et à  l'élaboration des politiques aux niveaux national et international.";"Land and Water Division

"FAODOCREP:d9387218-ffd4-436a-9acb-771ddf72de75";"Country Study on Status of Land Tenure, Planning and Management in Oriental Near East Countries";"The share of agriculture in the GDP declined from 16 percent in the 1990s to almost 14 percent in 2010. Meanwhile, those employed in agriculture as a percent of total labor force is declining since 1960 to 2006. Despite losing labor and share of the GDP, agriculture is, and will continue to be, among the major economic activities in Egypt, and a generator for economic growth. The balance between agriculture and other productive sectors of the economy require proper spatial and land use planning. Land tenure is central to this planning exercise. Land property right is the result of common factors, such as occupation and religion i.e. Islam, and agro-climatic conditions. Land property rights are multiple and complex. They are inherited from pre-Islamic rules (Orf), Islamic (Sharia) and colonial as well as post-colonial legislation. All these rules are co-existed. There are number of land status (regimes) such as private ownership (melk), collective land (waqf). Also there is a dichotomy (rural-urban).Land policy formulation and management in Egypt have been transforming in close association with institutional transformations. Since the Ottomans, to Mohamed Ali, to the Nasser‟s regime, and ending by the Mubarak administration, each period of time had its dogma and accordingly its land tenure systems. Today, Egypt has investment opportunities map till 2017 that defines land uses for the overall development. Today there are number of institutions responsible for planning the uses of this land and the mechanism to transfer the ownership of this land.The land question can be framed in the current status of dwarf and fragmented holdings. This is the result of complicated procedures to secure property right, inheritance, and increased prices and/or rents per unit of land used for agricultural or non-agricultural uses. Consequences include persisted rural poverty, violent disputes as a result of increased population densities and informality. The impacts are a multitude of economic inefficiency and idle land markets.Laws and regulations that govern land markets come in ten sets of groups. Islamic, customary and civic laws co-exist next to each other. The institutional framework that governs land markets need serious transformations including, but not limited to, redefining the mission and mandate of public bodies responsible for land distribution and sectoral development, and adopting principles of good governance.For perfectly competitive land markets, there is a need for updated cadastral and registry of land by which each parcel of land has a national identification number. The registry has to include specification of each parcel, information concerning the owner(s), sub-divisions, etc. Aside of these corrective and preventive measures, there is a need for a wide range of supportive measures. Educating and enlightening the public with their rights and means to access land is essential for perfectly competitive markets. Applying taxes on wind-fall gains is another measure to control freezing savings and money in the form of land and vacant dwellings. Also levying an annual tax on unused land and closed dwellings is prone to divert money needed for investment away and curb the tendency to speculative practices. This recommendation is in line with Islamic Shariya where the owners of utilized assets, in the form of land, gold, real estate, etc. have to pay 2.5 percent of its assessed value in the form of zakat. This recommendation will free frozen assets, and will avail money for investment that can generate employment opportunities.";"Ahmed El-Kholei

"FAODOCREP:eee6f2f0-98f3-590c-babf-f18ffd060f36";"Linking livelihoods and gender analysis for achieving gender transformative change";"Issues of transformative change in gender relations have been on the development agenda for four decades and no-one could say that there have not been significant policy initiatives taken to achieve this objective. The enthusiasm generated during the 1975 International Year for Women and throughout the UN international Women’s Decade from 1976-1985 is undeniable and the achievements are clear. Gender is now widely accepted as a necessary analytical category for development programmes and a mass of statistics has been assembled on women’s role and position in different, especially rural societies throughout the world. As a consequence, women’s position has become more visible, and the direct participation of women as well as men in programmes has been accepted as essential for capturing women’s special knowledge and concerns. Throughout this period, and partly because of the analysis of practical experiences gained, the understanding of how gender works increased amongst feminist scholars even if it was contested. Based on reported findings that women are more concerned about the welfare of other household members than men, and, therefore more likely to spend any increase in benefits on meeting household rather than personal needs and wants, agencies have adopted the assumption that where women are the lead actors (take decisions about resource use including income gained), not only are development interventions more likely to be effective and efficient but also, everyone will gain.";"Okali, C.

Les objectifs généraux étaient de promouvoir l’échange et la diffusion d’expériences dans la mise en œuvre de ces projets durant la décennie 1990–2000, et d’aider à identifier une vision pour une nouvelle génération de programmes et projets. Le présent ouvrage de référence offre une synthèse et une analyse critique des débats enrichissants et de l’abondante documentation produite durant l’évaluation; il présente également les conclusions et les recommandations de l’évaluation, fournit des conseils spécialisés sur les diverses approches en matière d’aménagement des bassins hydrographiques, décrit des cas concrets et propose de nouvelles idées et méthodes pour la réalisation de futurs projets et programmes. Cet ouvrage s’adresse plus particulièrement au personnel de terrain intervenant dans la gestion des bassins hydrographiques et aux autorités locales œuvrant dans ce domaine au niveau du district ou de la commune.

But first, it should be borne in mind that, usually, resources accorded to development programs are limited. For this reason it is crucial to analyze the affordability of such SP schemes according to country specificities and priorities.   The paper will also evaluate to which extent the gender-sensitive Transformative Social Protection framework has wide-ranging benefits for improving rural livelihoods. The Participatory and Negotiated Territorial Development (PNTD) and its updated version Improving Gender Equality in Territorial Issues (IGETI) approaches foster bottom-up participatory decision-making processes, enhances consensus building, addresses asymmetries of power and encourages social dialogue and partnerships among a wide range of actors within a territory towards promoting gender equality in land access and territorial development.

"FAODOCREP:47368e4c-fc39-4510-8765-514524e36e8e";"Country Study on Status of Land Tenure, Planning and Management in Oriental Near East Countries";"The share of agriculture in the GDP declined from 16 percent in the 1990s to almost 14 percent in 2010. Meanwhile, those employed in agriculture as a percent of total labor force is declining since 1960 to 2006. Despite losing labor and share of the GDP, agriculture is, and will continue to be, among the major economic activities in Egypt, and a generator for economic growth. The balance between agriculture and other productive sectors of the economy require proper spatial and land use planning. Land tenure is central to this planning exercise. Land property right is the result of common factors, such as occupation and religion i.e. Islam, and agro-climatic conditions. Land property rights are multiple and complex. They are inherited from pre-Islamic rules (Orf), Islamic (Sharia) and colonial as well as post-colonial legislation. All these rules are co-existed. There are number of land status (regimes) such as private ownership (melk), collective land (waqf). Also there is a dichotomy (rural-urban).Land policy formulation and management in Egypt have been transforming in close association with institutional transformations. Since the Ottomans, to Mohamed Ali, to the Nasser‟s regime, and ending by the Mubarak administration, each period of time had its dogma and accordingly its land tenure systems. Today, Egypt has investment opportunities map till 2017 that defines land uses for the overall development. Today there are number of institutions responsible for planning the uses of this land and the mechanism to transfer the ownership of this land.The land question can be framed in the current status of dwarf and fragmented holdings. This is the result of complicated procedures to secure property right, inheritance, and increased prices and/or rents per unit of land used for agricultural or non-agricultural uses. Consequences include persisted rural poverty, violent disputes as a result of increased population densities and informality. The impacts are a multitude of economic inefficiency and idle land markets.Laws and regulations that govern land markets come in ten sets of groups. Islamic, customary and civic laws co-exist next to each other. The institutional framework that governs land markets need serious transformations including, but not limited to, redefining the mission and mandate of public bodies responsible for land distribution and sectoral development, and adopting principles of good governance.For perfectly competitive land markets, there is a need for updated cadastral and registry of land by which each parcel of land has a national identification number. The registry has to include specification of each parcel, information concerning the owner(s), sub-divisions, etc. Aside of these corrective and preventive measures, there is a need for a wide range of supportive measures. Educating and enlightening the public with their rights and means to access land is essential for perfectly competitive markets. Applying taxes on wind-fall gains is another measure to control freezing savings and money in the form of land and vacant dwellings. Also levying an annual tax on unused land and closed dwellings is prone to divert money needed for investment away and curb the tendency to speculative practices. This recommendation is in line with Islamic Shariya where the owners of utilized assets, in the form of land, gold, real estate, etc. have to pay 2.5 percent of its assessed value in the form of zakat. This recommendation will free frozen assets, and will avail money for investment that can generate employment opportunities.";"Ahmed El-Kholei

Previous appraisals of the global extents of arable lands, to support present and future human populations, vary from 3 to 7 thousand million hectares. Estimates of the populations these lands can support, vary from 7.5 to 40 thousand million.

"FAODOCREP:c1c87709-d1e0-540d-8a4c-cb9d4fe3b4b6";"Forests and water";"The availability and quality of clean water in many  regions of the world is more and more threatened by  overuse, misuse and pollution. In this context, the  relationship between forests and water must be accorded  high priority. Forested catchments supply a high  proportion of the water for domestic, agricultural,  industrial and ecological needs in both upstream and  downstream areas. A key challenge faced by land, forest  and water managers is to maximize the benefits that  forests provide without detriment to water resources and  ecosystem function. There is an urgent need for a better  understanding of the interface of forests and trees with  water and for embedding this knowledge in policies. This  study, initiated in the context of the Global Forest  Resources Assessment 2005, highlights the need for  holistic management of complex watershed ecosystems  taking into account interactions among water, forest and  other land uses as well as socio-economic factors. It  explains the role of forests in the hydrological cycle, with  a particular focus on critical, “red flag” forest situations  such as mountainous or steep terrain, river and coastal  areas and swamp ecosystems, as well as the special case  of mountainous small islands. It addresses the protection  of municipal water supplies and emerging systems of  payment for watershed services. This state-of-knowledge  publication will be of interest to a broad range of  technical experts, scientists and decision-makers.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

Livestock are a crucial element in this balancing process. Demand for livestock products is growing fast, especially in the developing world. Livestock, through their multiple functions, are a cornerstone of the livelihood of most of the rural population in the developing world. On the other hand, livestock use around 60 percent of the world's land area, including one fifth of the world's crop lands, and therefore interact directly and indirectly with a large part of the world's natural resources. Positioning livestock in such a way that it can satisfy future demands, while preserving the natural resource base, is therefore a critical element of sustainable agricultural development.    With this challenge in mind, a group of bilateral and multilateral development agencies requested FAO, the World Bank and USAID to lead the preparation of a major study on livestock - environment interactions. With the help of the international scientific community a state - of - the - art review on livestock - environment interactions has been prepared. The International Conference on Livestock and the Environment was held to share this information with a much broader audience and to translate the information into concrete guidelines for regional and national policies. The International Conference further aimed at formulating follow - up actions and identifying pilot activities to test innovative approaches.    The proceedings of this conference contain the papers presented, and the conclusions and recommendations of the conference workshops. The recommendations will serve as a guideline for the Steering Committee of the Livestock - Environment Initiative to initiate follow - up action. A translation of the recommendations into Spanish and French is included in the proceedings.";"Animal Production and Health Division

It is made up of some 17 articles, a good number of which dwell on structures and processes. They describe and analyse how projects and programs were designed and how committees etc. were composed; how transparent the governance is, whether adequately decentralized or participatory etc. Evidences thus abound that authenticate that Africa has committees and structures in abundance even though it is not apparent whether the governance mechanisms have successfully triggered development. Do the governance systems in operation in Africa encourage action or simple auto-admiration of how well the processes comply with standard criteria of sound governance? Have these systems led to wise management of trees and forests, water and soil, livestock and fisheries in Africa?    Elaborating structures and processes is not free, and should be conducted up to the point where marginal cost is equal to marginal benefit. Is the elaborateness of governance procedures and structures commensurate with observed developmental returns to effort? Case studies in this edition show governance structures and processes that are perhaps too costly for the benefits they will yield.  The seventeen essays discuss these issues to varying degrees and from different perspectives.";"Regional Office for Africa";"Regional Office for Africa;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Regional Office for Africa;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2013-12";"en";"natural resources management;land governance;land rights";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"AGO;DZA;FRA;USA;ZMB;BFA;IDN;002;AUS;GBR;GHA;COG;MWI;CMR;KEN;LBR;JPN;ZAF;ITA;TZA;SEN;GAB";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/f610d4b4-b213-5e5e-a5a9-678a70c7ca93";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-ar301e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/d58890a5-5643-5d6b-931f-3cd27e8fc7b4_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

These studies are conducted to develop an appreciation of the situation in which the intended beneficiaries live, and their perceptions of their problems, needs and priorities. The main objective of the present study was to increase the understanding of the characteristics of the physical resources, the farming systems and the communities concerned by the project in Guyana, and to identify and describe the farmers' needs and priorities. This survey was undertaken with the view to determine mechanisms for the sustainable rehabilitation of the drainage and irrigation system involving farmer participation and to focus the project activities for poverty alleviation purposes.";"Technical Cooperation Department

This study has been commissioned by FAO to look at sustainable livelihoods approaches to access to natural resources in mountain areas. We concentrate on access by poorer and marginalized groups to policy processes whereby long-term sustainable access to resources is achieved. We have concentrated on the forestry sector for a number of reasons. First, it is the most important sector as regards access to natural resources in Nepal. Second, there is more written and analysed on this sector than on virtually any other. Third, in many ways and for reasons we shall explain in the report, the forestry sector is the most significant as regards ‘access’ issues in the contemporary democratic political context in Nepal.

As a complement to this thematic Urban and peri-urban forestry study, a livelihoods analysis of the contribution of forests and trees to urban poor livelihoods has been carried out the Sub-programme on access to natural resources of the Livelihood Support Programme (GCP/INT/803/UK). This paper presents the analysis. It represents part of an area of work on linkages between access to forest resources and poverty in West and Central Asia. ";"Knuth, L.

Vol. 1: Mini-course lectures and Core Conference presentations";"Part I of the proceedings consists of two major sections, the Mini-course lectures and the presentations presented during the Core Conference (Mini-course). The lectures presented during the two-day Mini-course were grouped in two sections. The first dealt with the concepts, theory and practice relating to the use of Property Rights in Fisheries Management. Subjects covered in the first past of the Mini-course included the historical development of the introduction of property in fishery management, property rights as a means of economic organization, selection of a property rights management system, resistance to changes in property rights or, whether to use Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs), current property rights systems in fisheries management and group and community-based fishing rights. Topics covered in the second part of the Mini-course included Management Infrastructure for Rights Based Fishing, Legal Planning for Management of Fisheries Using Property Rights, The Administration of Fisheries Managed by Property Rights, Administration of Enforcement Mechanisms for Rights-Based Fisheries Management Systems and Fisher Participation in Rights-based Fisheries Management: The New Zealand Experience  The second major section of Part I of the proceedings consists of the papers presented during the three-day Core Conference. These papers covered the perspectives of (a) governments in introducing and administering such methods of management and the political, conservation, social and economic consequences, (b) industry; and (c) the wider community and other involved stakeholders. The topics covered in the Core Conference were introduced by two major perspectives, Moving through the Narrows: from Open Access to ITQs and Self-government and Common Property Rights: An Alternative to ITQs.  Papers presented during the first day of the Core Sessions covered government perspectives and issues, institutional arrangements, administrative challenges and the politics of the Rights-based fisheries management process. Papers presented during the second day of the Core Sessions described the perspective of industry, strategic responses of industry and industry initiatives in advancing rights-based fisheries management. Papers presented on the final day of the Core Conference dealt with the issues of community perspectives, recreational fishing, community property rights, customary fisheries management, community-based fisheries management and the exclusivity of rights. The session was closed with papers that provided a prognosis on the future development of property rights in fisheries management.  Thus, the conference papers addressed the theory and application of property";"sola [ FIRI001 ]

It provides the best estimate of the global fire situation to date and gives a good indication of the scale of the impact of vegetation fires on society, on the economy and on the environment. This global assessment will be of interest not only to fire specialists, but also to policy-makers, forest managers and those involved in collecting reliable and current information on fire in different types of vegetation.

Over time, various forms of community-based forestry have evolved in different countries, but all have at their heart the notion of some level of participation by smallholders and community groups in planning and implementation. This publication is FAO’s first comprehensive look at the impact of community-based forestry since previous reviews in 1991 and 2001. It considers both collaborative regimes (forestry practised on land with formal communal tenure requiring collective action) and smallholder forestry (on land that is generally privately owned). The publication examines the extent of  community-based forestry globally and regionally and assesses its effectiveness in delivering on key biophysical and socioeconomic outcomes, i.e. moving towards sustainable forest management and improving local livelihoods. The report is targeted at policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, communities and civil society.";"Gilmour, D.

La coupe illicite et le commerce qui en découle sont un problème complexe qui a de profondes répercussions environnementales, sociales et économiques. Diverses parties prenantes – au niveau local, national et international – s’attaquent au problème. Plusieurs gouvernements sont en train de rationaliser leur cadre juridique et stratégique, en renforçant leurs capacités institutionnelles pour améliorer l’application des lois et la collecte de données additionnelles sur l’ampleur et la nature des opérations illégales. Des initiatives privées telles que la certification forestière, les codes de conduite volontaires des entreprises, la surveillance indépendante des opérations en forêt et la traçabilité des grumes contribuent également à la lutte contre le crime forestier. Cette publication offre un aperçu de ces expériences dans le but d’encourager une meilleure application des lois dans le secteur forestier. Elle analyse les connaissances disponibles dans une série de meilleures pratiques tirées de onze études de cas, que les décideurs sont invités à appliquer pour réduire les opérations illicites dans le secteur forestier.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

Los procesos nacionales de planificación de la mitigación tienen dimensiones políticas, técnicas e institucionales que deben ser abordadas de una forma integrada e iterativa. Para cada una de estas dimensiones se destacan cuatro elementos clave. Se aportan ejemplos de procesos de planificación de la mitigación en países en desarrollo para ilustrar el abanico de opciones con las que se pueden abordar estos elementos clave de forma específica en cada país.

There is no doubt that the Limpopo valley floods in 2000 were one of the worst flood disasters in Mozambique’s history. At least 700 people died, and some 500,000 to 650,000 were displaced and temporarily sheltered in over 100 camps set up by the government. It is estimated that the total cost of the 2000 floods was equal to almost 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, and slowed down the economic growth rate by 2.1 percent.";"Claudia

The greatest challenge for the coming decades lies in the fact that the production environments are unstable and degrading. Land degradation is proceeding so fast that unless policies and approaches change, many countries will not be able to achieve sustainable agriculture in the foreseeable future. Soil salinization has been identified as a major process of land degradation. The greatest technical causes of decreasing production on many irrigated projects particularly in arid-semi-arid areas, or failure of large areas in rainfed agriculture, are waterlogging, salinization and sodication.";"Im-Erb, R.; Mashali, A.M.; Anecksamphant, C.; Nabhan, H.; Sombatpanit, S.

Se formula un conjunto de diez  principios para guiar la reforma de la tenencia, y se  propone un proceso de adaptaci?n para diversificar la  tenencia de los bosques de una manera adecuada al  contexto.

"FAODOCREP:34559307-55db-53ad-ae1b-cec4bef37deb";"What do we really know about the number and distribution of farms and family farms worldwide?";"The agricultural economics literature provides various estimates of the number of farms and small farms in the world. This paper is an effort to provide a more complete and up to date as well as carefully documented estimate of the total number of farms in the world, as well as by region and level of income. It uses data from numerous rounds of the World Census of Agriculture, the only dataset available which allows the user to gain a complete picture of the total number of farms globally and at the country level.  The paper provides estimates of the number of family farms, the number of farms by size as well as the distibution of farmland by farm size. These estimates find that: there are at least 570 million farms worldwide, of which more than 500 million can be considered family farms. Most of the world’s farms are very small, with more than 475 million farms being less than 2 hectares in size.  Although the vast majority of the world’s farms are smaller than 2 hectares, they operate only a small share of the world’s farmland. Farmland distribution would seem quite unequal at the global level, but it is less so in low- and lower-middle-income countries as well as in some regional groups. These estimates have serious limitations and the collection of more up-to-date agricultural census data, including data on farmland distribution is essential to our having a more representative picture of the number of farms, the number of family farms and farm size as well as farmland distribution worldwide.";"Sarah K.

Les définitions constituent, par conséquent, les fondements de tout système d’informations et de connaissances. Les définitions établissent les limites conceptuelles et contextuelles autour des divers éléments d’un sous-ensemble ou d’un ensemble de données. L’efficacité d’une définition dans un contexte donné dépend de sa capacité à empêcher que le reste (sous-ensembles ou éléments) ne filtre au-delà des limites établies. La description des paramètres de ces limites constitue une définition. Au sein d’une évaluation des ressources forestières, les définitions établissent des limites autour de plusieurs ensembles ou sous-ensembles de données: l’étendue, la structure ou les caractéristiques, les réserves, les biens, les services et l’aménagement et l’utilisation des ressources forestières. En général, le contexte comprend une structure environnementale, écologique, du paysage, administrative, sylvicole et juridique au sein de laquelle se trouvent les forêts. Les rapports d’évaluation des ressources forestières mondiales ont toujours fourni un ensemble de définitions sur lesquelles sont fondées les informations présentées.

This is anticipated to rise to 40-44% by 2020. Planted forests reflect a higher social, environmental and economic importance than their area would suggest. Many countries have existing planted forest data that is not based upon forest inventory, is incomplete and often outdated. Thus it is difficult to measure and plan the quantity and quality of planted forest resources and the provision of goods and services that they supply. FAO through the kind assistance of all the member countries is concluding the Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FRA 2005), the exercise on data collection for the most important parameters useful to assess the status and trends of forests and their goods and services in the world. The Planted Forest Thematic Study will supplement and complement the work undertaken by FRA 2005 for selected countries, by providing more detail for the Planted Component of Semi-Natural Forests and Plantation Forests (Productive and Protective). This information and data will allow analyses on the regional and global status and trends for Planted Forest development, to assist in improving formulation of policies, outlook studies, planning, management, monitoring and reporting. This Working Paper contains background explanations and questionnaire guidelines to assist FRA National Correspondents and Planted Forest Specialists in the selected countries to complete the survey tables. This is the first time that the Planted Component of Semi-Natural Forests has been combined with Plantation Forests to make up the Planted Forest Sub-group. This is being done to provide a more realistic picture of the status and trends of wood, fibre, non-wood forest products and services from Planted Forests.";"Forestry Department

However, the law continues to face implementation challenges, including the realization of equal rights for women and institutional reform. Simply having a progressive law ‘is not enough’ to bring about transformative change in a country. Recognizing these challenges, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) developed a programme to support the legislation through the capacity development of both direct beneficiaries and those responsible for implementing it. This publication, presents an overview of how this programme developed and what it has achieved to date. It highlights the lessons learned from this core element of FAO’s long history of support to the land programme in Mozambique. In particular, the study discusses the challenges facing land and natural resources paralegals in Mozambique today and helps to define the parameters for programme assessment by looking at paralegals in different country contexts. It describes how the programme has included training and capacity-development, not just for NGO-sponsored paralegals, but also for district and local government level officials, justice system officers and staff from public sectors working with land and natural resources.";"Tanner, C.; Bicchieri, M.";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2014-12";"en";"land governance;land rights;land ownership;land tenure";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"AGO;USA;KEN;ZMB;ZWE;NAM;002;GBR;CAN;SLE;MWI;MOZ;LBR;ZAF;UGA;TZA;NLD;NOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/65d4e433-1e69-4b24-ab9b-951319092609";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3694e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/66301eea-61c7-45ea-b729-daa510b4623c_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

The update is based on information derived from a variety of sources, including country reports to the eighteenth Asia Pacific Forestry Commission meeting in Australia in May 2000. Major changes have emerged in forests and forestry policies in recent years. Different international initiatives have been launched in the effort to implement the UNCED Agenda 21 in forest and forest-related matters. In regard to sustainable forest management, several efforts have been launched, including certification, the code of practise for forest harvesting, criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, reduced impact logging, and logging bans in natural forests.";"Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations

Experience shows that approaches to reducing deforestation and forest degradation and strengthening forest governance – such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) – can be far more effective in countering forest loss if they are jointly implemented. To date, however, few countries have capitalized on the synergies between these processes. Widely acknowledged similarities between the objectives of REDD+ and FLEGT initiatives present obvious opportunities for common action to address deforestation and strengthen forest governance. Both REDD+ and FLEGT share a number of common goals and approaches and target the same actors – forest sector stakeholders from government entities, local communities and indigenous people, as well as the private sector. Both are incentive-based mechanisms to promote the sustainable management of forests, and both place strong emphasis on forest governance for their success.

The objective of the report is to provide additional thoughts to the ongoing debate on the future for OECS agriculture and to the broader issue of regional strategies. Substantial additional work at field level and discussions at policy level would obviously be needed to translate the proposals outlined in the report into concrete operational recommendations. &lt;/p&gt; The OECS countries share a number of common features including fragile ecosystems, historical dependence of agriculture on a few key export commodities and a domestic private sector that is very limited in human resources and financial capacity. Although diverse in terms of agricultural potential and prospects, the OECS countries are all suffering from a marked deterioration of the agricultural sector performance, problems in adjusting to trade liberalization, the severe competitive pressures from more efficient agricultural producers and a common search for appropriate agricultural sector policies that could provide an adequate response to overcome the current crisis.&lt;/p&gt;Banana and to a very minor extent sugar, both crops with preferential market access to European countries, have been for long time the mainstay of the OECS agricultural economy. The national institutional systems including extension and the marketing arrangements have all been geared to the management of export crops economies while little attention was paid to food crops or diversification crops.

It will explore more generally the role of farming and agriculture in the broader political economy of the region.  The paper establishes the distinctive features of the region, what might be generalised and what might not be so common between countries with contrasting patterns of development.  The paper explores the role and impact that farmers have had on the social relations of production in a range of countries and the position that agriculture has played in national and regional development. It will also draw on the responses of farmers to recent upheavals and set out a series of recommendations that might bolster rural development broadly defined including the  contributions made to national development by farmers in the region.

"FAODOCREP:6d2ceea7-0885-59a0-9c63-ebe1b47a7cce";"Assessing the Adoptability of Improved Crop Production Technologies by Small Farmers: the Case of Lesotho";"In Lesotho, some externally financed agricultural development projects have appeared particularly prone to failure. One reason may be that, when designed, projects have not been subjected to sufficiently rigorous analysis, particularly with regard to expected farmers' response to extension messages. The thesis of this paper is that the impact of high inter-annual fluctuations in crop yields (and of crop prices) on farmers' expectations plays an important role in producers' decision-making, and that this can be measured with sufficient approximation to assess the prospects for the successful introduction of ""improved"" cropping technologies in small farmers' communities. Stochastic Efficiency Analysis has been applied to the mountain areas of Lesotho, where natural conditions are particularly harsh, but it has wider applicability in project formulation. The paper is based on information gathered by an FAO Investment Centre mission, which visited the Districts of Thaba T'seka and Qacha's Nek in November 1995 on behalf of the Government of Lesotho and the International Fund for Agricultural Development to identify a Sustainable Mountain Agriculture Programme for possible IFAD financing.

Nous avons creusé dans les archives de la FAO afin de mettre en lumière des images en noir et blanc inédites, elles forment un portefeuille d'images évocatrices des premières années de l'Organisation. Le présent livre récite aussi les 10 histoires de succès de l'Organisation, par exemple, l'éradication de la peste bovine; le Traité sur les ressources phytogénétiques, un accord essentiel afin de garantir la biodiversité de notre planète, et le Code de conduite pour une pêche responsable, qui est indispensable en vue de préserver l’écosystème marin. Les défis les plus importants auxquels la FAO est confrontée dans les années à venir sont également traitées et résumées en deux thèmes principaux: l'éradication de la faim et la malnutrition, et les mesures à prendre pour lutter contre le changement climatique. Cette publication porte le lecteur dans un voyage à travers les bureaux régionaux de la FAO, et lui offre l’opportunité d’observer ses initiatives régionales. En sa qualité de tribune neutre hébergeant de nombreuses conférences et réunions chaque année, nous voulions ouvrir les portes du quartier général de la FAO à Rome pour une visite virtuelle afin que vous puissiez découvrir tous ses coins et ses différentes pièces. En bref, ceci est un livre pour tout le monde, conçu d'une manière attrayante et écrit dans un langage simple et intelligible.

Market reforms called for significant changes in the role of public and private sector agencies in food supply and distribution. Most public trading and marketing organizations previously responsible for marketing local and imported goods have been eliminated or privatized, while the private sector have now taken centre stage in food supply systems in many African cities. In Guinea, for instance, traders no longer need a licence or permit to import and/or distribute foodstuffs and are only required to submit import applications to banks. In Senegal and Burkina Faso, the role of the Ministry of Trade in food supplies is limited to drawing up and applying regulations for the whole trade sector. Major problems have arisen, however, as a result of these changes largely because of capacity constraints which limit the ability of the private sector to operate an efficient food supply chain. The public sector is similarly constrained in performing its facilitating role of supporting private initiative and coordinating an effective food supply policy for cities. Many actors face a variety of problems in performing their essential functions, including financing, purchasing, storage, transport, sales, coordination and planning.";"Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division

Most  of this is consumed in developing countries, where between two and three billion people rely on solid  biomass (wood, charcoal, agricultural residues and animal waste) for cooking and heating, often in open  fireplaces or traditional cook stoves. Biomass  refers to non-fossil material of biological origin, such as energy crops, agricultural and forestry wastes and by-products, manure or microbial biomass.  Biofuel is fuel produced directly or indirectly from biomass such as fuelwood, charcoal, bioethanol, biodiesel, biogas (methane) or biohydrogen. However, most people associate biofuel  with liquid biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel and straight vegetable oil). In this note the term ”biofuels” refers to liquid biofuels used for transport. Bioenergy is energy derived from biofuels.";"Deputy Directory-General Natural Resources

An FAO perspective";"World agriculture: towards 2015/2030 is FAO’s latest assessment of the long-term outlook for the world’s food supplies, nutrition and agriculture. It presents the projections and the main messages. The projections cover supply and demand for the major agricultural commodities and sectors,  including fisheries and forestry. This analysis forms the basis for a more detailed examination of other factors, such as nutrition and undernourishment, and the implications for international trade. The report also investigates the implications of future supply and demand for the natural resource base and discusses how technology can contribute to more sustainable development. One of the report’s main findings is that, if no corrective action is taken, the target set by the World Food Summit in 1996 – of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015 – is not going to be met. Nothing short of a  massive effort to improve overall development performance will free the developing world of its most pressing food insecurity problems. Making progress towards this target depends on many factors, not least of which are political will and the mobilization of additional resources. Past experience underlines the crucial role of agriculture in the development process, particularly where the majority of the population still depends on this sector for employment and income.";"Jelle Bruinsma (ed.)

Dans les pays africains, comme partout dans le monde, un système de commercialisation des produits vivriers comprend un circuit informel et un circuit formel. L’importance de chacun de ces deux circuits diffère généralement selon le niveau de développement économique du pays. Dans les pays industrialisés, il n’y a que le système formel qui subsiste. Dans des circonstances d’instabilité économique ou sociale, ou dans un pays dont le niveau de développement est très bas, le secteur informel domine largement le commerce des vivres, et le secteur formel se concentre sur quelques segments bien spécifiques. La croissance économique se reflète dans un glissement du commerce des vivres du secteur informel vers le secteur formel. D’une manière générale, le secteur formel se développe d’abord dans le marché des céréales et à un stade de développement plus avancé dans le secteur des tubercules, des légumes et des fruits. Cette étude analyse cette évolution.";"Rural Infrastructure and Agro-Industries Division

Resource managers must embrace an ecosystem approach to fisheries, in which biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services and the concerns of stakeholders are taken into account alongside of the productivity of stocks and the economic gains from fishing.  This document is an abridged version of FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 520 Managing Sea Cucumber Fisheries with an Ecosystem Approach. This booklet provides a “roadmap” for developing and implementing better management of sea cucumber fisheries. A set of management regulations and actions by the resource manager are needed in all fisheries and will depend on the way in which animals are fished, the status of stocks, and the technical and human resource capacity of management institutions. Also summarised here are the merits and limitations of potential management regulations and actions by the resource manager, and steps required for their implementation.";"Fisheries and Aquaculture Department

It includes 1 million ha of forests and 0.3 Million ha of shrubs and other woody area. The forest area has increased from 643,000 ha in 1990 to 1,041,000 ha in 2015 ((FAO 2015) that corresponds to an increase by 62% in the last twenty five years or an annual increase of 1.9%. The most important programs of forest and pastoral plantation were between 1990 and 2010, with a rhythm of plantation of 22,000 ha annually (FAO 2015), recently, during the period 2010-2014, forest and pastoral expansion concerned only 6,000 ha per year. In the other side, forest fires have affected about one thousand ha per year during the period 1996-2010, and 3167 ha per year on average during the 2011-2014. Similarly, annual deforestation has increased from 400 ha (1996-2010) to 800 ha for the period 2011-2014. It should be indicated that half of the plantation consists on pastoral plantation. Forest and pastoral plantation is usually conducted in forest area (replanting burned areas when natural regeneration is not possible, reforestation of harvested areas, replacing shrubs (1400 ha per year; FAO 2015)), in agricultural lands (planting the banks of ravines, for soil conservation purposes and for windbreaks), and in the pastoral lands (plantation of forage species). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read the full report of the &lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5588e.pdf ""&gt;&lt;i&gt;State of the World’s Forests (SOFO) 2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5850e.pdf ""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brochure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;i&gt;State of the World’s Forests (SOFO) 2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5852e.pdf ""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flyer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; See the &lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0176e.pdf ""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Infographic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/publications/sofo/2016/en/""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sofo 2016 webpage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the other six country case studies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0180e.pdf ""&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0184e.pdf ""&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0182e.pdf ""&gt;Gambia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0181e.pdf ""&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0183e.pdf ""&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.fao.org/3/a-C0186e.pdf ""&gt;Viet Nam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;";"Daly, H.";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-12";"en";"sustainable land management;land use;land tenure;forest land;forest monitoring and assessment;forestry policies;forest conservation;land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;GEO;BGD;GHA;TUN;GMB;CRI;CHL";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/e2969d4d-f250-418c-8605-b8424d6fbdea";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-c0185e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/383c01c0-2af8-4eb8-bf4e-21a06445ccfe_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

"FAODOCREP:9c2e30db-6628-5eb5-9088-ef3aaafff5f2";"Geographical information systems - Applications to marine fisheries";"The late 20th century has witnessed increasing crises in the world's marine fisheries. A causal analysis of these reveals that a common element are various manifestations of spatial inequity. This most frequently includes the inequity of access rights to the resource, but factors such as variations in resource depletion, spatio-temporal variations in stock recruitment, the imposition of regulatory zoning, destruction of marine ecosystems and the siting of mariculture facilities are other examples. To resolve some of these problems, management practices must be improved. As has been shown in other fields where spatially related problems occur, there is now a promising tool, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which, combined with other analytical tools and models, could allow for improved spatial management. GIS are basically integrated computer based systems which allow for the input of digital geo-referenced data to produce maps plus other textual, graphical and tabular output. The essential usefulness of GIS however, lies in its ability to manipulate data in a large number of ways and to perform various analytical functions so as to produce output which makes for more efficient decision making.As with many computer based systems, the key to GIS success lies in the acquisition of suitable data. The various means by which both primary and secondary data can be located, gathered, accessed and stored are described. Data acquisition methods vary from simple surveys, questionnaires and counts through to the access of secondary digital databases via on-line networking capabilities. Once data has been acquired it is only useful to a GIS when it has been formatted, processed or structured in a way which the system will understand. The various ways of doing this are introduced. GIS's can function in an almost limitless variety of configurations of hard and software. The basic elements of these are described, as are examples of some of the software packages. Before a GIS is implemented into a fisheries management programme, then there are two major areas of consideration. The first of these concerns the potential that GIS might have as a management aid. Seven potential database areas for management are described in some detail. The second area considered is that of how best to implement a marine fisheries resource GIS, along with how to ensure that sufficient guidance and support can be obtained to assure its continued success. The paper concludes with an examination of some case studies covering a range of marine fisheries related topics.";"Fisheries and Aquaculture Department

La explotación ilegal y el comercio asociado constituyen un problema complejo con graves consecuencias ambientales, sociales y económicas. Diferentes instancias locales, nacionales e internacionales han adoptado medidas para resolver este problema. Varios gobiernos han iniciado el proceso de racionalización de su marco jurídico y normativo, fortalecimiento de la capacidad institucional para promover una mejor observancia de la ley y obtención de más información sobre el alcance y la naturaleza de las operaciones ilegales. Iniciativas privadas como la adopción de códigos voluntarios de conducta por las empresas, la supervisión independiente de las operaciones forestales y el seguimiento de la madera también contribuyen a combatir los delitos forestales. Esta publicación presenta un cuadro general de estas experiencias para impulsar una mejor observancia de la legislación forestal. Analiza los conocimientos existentes en un conjunto de mejores prácticas extraídas de 11 estudios de casos por países, que los responsables de la adopción de decisiones tal vez desearán aplicar para reducir las operaciones ilegales en el sector forestal.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

Este es el primer  informe de su género en presentar estimaciones sistemáticas sobre el uso y cambio de las tierras forestales mundiales.  La ambiciosa meta de la Encuesta de teledetección consistía en utilizar datos de teledetección para obtener estimaciones coherentes a nivel mundial de la superficie del bosque y de los cambios en la cubierta de árboles y el uso de las tierras forestales entre 1990 y 2005. En términos generales, se encontró que  había una disminución neta de la superficie de bosques a nivel mundial entre 1990 y 2005, siendo la pérdida neta más alta en América del Sur. Mientras la superficie de bosques incrementó en las zonas climáticas boreal, templada y subtropical durante  el periodo evaluado, en la zona tropical se disminuyó con un promedio de 6.8 millones de hectáreas anuales. La encuesta estimó que la superficie total de los bosques del mundo en 2005 era de 3.8 mil millones de hectáreas, es decir el 30 por ciento de la superficie mundial de la tierra.  Este informe es el resultado de muchos años de planificación y de tres años de trabajo minucioso por parte del personal de la FAO, del Centro Común de Investigación de la Comisión Europea, así como de los insumos aportados por expertos técnicos de más de 100 países.

Draining had a dramatic impact on forest production on the nutrient-rich peaty soils downhill from the ditches. In 40 years, most of the meadows and fens had turned into dense forest. Because of the high nature conservation value (mainly birdlife) of the bog, the entire area (including surrounding forests) was later designated a Ramsar site, a nature reserve, and a Natura 2000 area.";"Klemedtsson, A.

Protracted crisis represent a signal of alert on the fact that approaches proposed so far where not enough to deal with such a complexity. This is why a renewed thinking is needed, based on the concrete observations of local dynamics, making an effort to understand the positions and interests of the many diverse parties involved and moving out from a sectorial vision, towards a more holistic one. In Protracted Crisis what is at stake is not just the evidence of degraded natural resources, but the weakening social cohesion that needs to be reshaped in new forms. The political economy of land and other natural resources should thus become structural part of the discussion, which means starting addressing governance issues.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-12";"en";"land;land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AGO;MOZ;LBR;KEN;ZAF;UGA;SSD;SDN;ETH";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/8d5aba9c-6b04-48ee-be19-bffe0f90a9a7";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6635e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/437969c8-5de5-46e6-9dae-c33b71eb554d_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

It represents the main objective of this report. The objectives of this study are to: describe the effects of contract farming schemes, characterize the factors limiting or promoting these various impacts, identify key findings to promote the emergence of positive synergies. The study’ considers a long-term time scale (10 to 50 years) and pays particular attention to changes in agricultural farming, production systems, access to markets and governance patterns of value chains. The study also analyzes how crops initially introduced thanks to contract farming schemes develop “off contract” and induce new value chain. The study focuses on seven countries - Ivory Coast, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Kenya, South-Africa, Laos and Indonesia – and major commodities such as: oil palm, rubber tree, fruits and vegetables, cereals, cotton and sugar cane. It is organized into 4 sections: i) the contract schemes, ii) the effects of these schemes, iii) the factors determining the nature and intensity of these effects and iv) key findings to promote positive synergies.

About 80 percent of Tigray’s population of 4.3 million live in rural areas and depend on rain-fed subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods. Farm families in Tigray tend to have small land holdings and limited productive inputs such as labour, oxen, seeds and fertilizers. Severe drought has repeatedly struck the northern Tigray region and has had a major effect on agricultural productivity. In 2011, BOLSA launched the Social Cash Transfer Pilot Programme (SCTPP) in Tigray with support from UNICEF. The programme particularly aimed to improve the lives of orphans and vulnerable children, the elderly and disabled people.

Protected areas are the mainstay for biodiversity conservation although other forest areas are also important. Habitat destruction and extraction of high-value species are major threats to biodiversity. Ecosystem stability is based on interdependence among constituent species and with biodiversity loss, resilience to change is reduced.

Rome, 5–8 July 2004.";"The Expert Consultation was convened by FAO in order to elaborate guidelines on the policies  and actions needed to increase the contribution of small-scale fisheries to poverty alleviation  and food security. The twenty-fifth session of the FAO Committee on Fisheries, held in Rome  from 24 to 28 February 2003, requested FAO to develop such guidelines as part of its series of  technical guidelines on the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.  The Expert Consultation had before it a comprehensive background document on the subject  matter and recommended that two products be published by FAO: (i) a FAO Fisheries  Technical Paper on small-scale fisheries in poverty alleviation and food security that would  include a full review of relevant background information; and (ii) FAO Technical Guidelines for  Responsible Fisheries on enhancing the contribution of small-scale fisheries to poverty  alleviation and food security that would be a much more concise document highlighting the  actions needed to increase the contribution of small-scale fisheries.  The Expert Consultation provided specific guidance for the finalization of the technical paper  based on a revision and elaboration of the background document and produced a detailed  outline for the preparation of the technical guidelines. It also provided recommendations on the  dissemination of both documents and on methods to assess the use and evaluate the impacts  of the technical guidelines.  The Expert Consultation noted that there is little reference to poverty alleviation and  insufficient coverage of small-scale fisheries in the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.  It therefore recommended the development of a new Article on “Small-scale Fisheries and  Poverty Alleviation”.";"mercado

It has been expanded to pay more attention to issues such as biological and water degradation, it also places more emphasis on direct and socio-economic causes of these phenomena, including their impacts on ecosystem services. It evaluates what type of land degradation is actually happening where and why and what is being done about it in terms of sustainable land management (SLM) in the form of a questionnaire. Linking the information obtained through the questionnaire to a geographical information system (GIS) allows the production of maps as well as area calculations on various aspects of land degradation and conservation. The map database and mapped outputs provide a powerful tool to obtain an overview of land degradation and conservation in a district, province, country, region, or world-wide.";"Land and Water Division

"FAODOCREP:f0674cb6-15fd-55cc-bbbd-8fcf06fe8c5d";"Land access in the 21st century";"The present paper seeks to cover the key issues, trends, constraints, challenges, knowledge gaps and policy options on a range of dimensions of land access. Land access is broadly defined as the processes by which people individually or collectively gain rights and opportunities to occupy and utilise land (primarily for productive purposes but also other economic and social purposes) on a temporary or permanent basis. These processes include participation in both formal and informal markets, land access through kinship and social networks, including the transmission of land rights through inheritance and within families, and land allocation by the state and other authorities with control over land and landowners. While understanding all of these processes and their operation for land users as a whole is of relevance to land policy, the concerns of this paper are: a) the opportunities to access and utilise land for the rural poor, considered as those who are landless or with limited, insufficient and insecure access to land, and for whom land access is important for a livelihood and/ or for food security; and b) to assess the place of policy and programmatic interventions in influencing processes and opportunities for land access for these groups.

This concern is based on the fact that water quality degradation is so severe in many Asian countries that it is placing serious constraints on economic growth; it continues to be a serious problem for human health and it is causing widespread negative environmental effects. The problem of future management of water quality in Asia is a complex one, and requires re-examination of a number of key areas – including technical, institutional, legal and governance issues. Within this context, FAO organized a Regional Workshop on Water Quality Management and Control of Water Pollution which took place in Bangkok, Thailand from 26 to 30 October 1999. This publication contains the report and recommendations of the Workshop and the edited versions of 18 papers presented and discussed during the meeting.

La plupart des pêches de capture sont basées sur les stocks côtiers, tandis que les autres exploitent les stocks de haute mer dont une partie de leur cycle s'effectue dans les eaux littorales, par exemple, dans les zones de reproduction ou d'alimentation. Les stocks de poisson sont également tributaires de la productivité primaire en milieu côtier pour une bonne part de la chaîne alimentaire. En outre, l'aquaculture côtière également est fortement dépendante de la zone littorale pour l'espace et les ressources.  Cette dépendance des pêches maritimes à l'égard de la zone côtière rend le secteur particulièrement vulnérable aux activités qui entraînent en milieu côtier des changements écologiques dont l'impact sur le secteur peut être important. De même, le secteur des pêches peut avoir des incidences sur les activités côtières, par exemple du fait de la concurrence pour l'espace. Cela ne fait que renforcer l'évidence que le développement et la gestion du secteur des pêches doivent être étudiés dans le contexte de l'aménagement des zones côtières et de la planification de leur développement, c'est-à-dire dans le contexte de la protection et de la gestion des ressources, de l'environnement et des activités de la zone côtière.";"Service de la planification du développement

"FAODOCREP:80ecfa26-682e-5ac6-b5a7-e75aad9894c7";"Putting Payments for Environmental Services in the Context of Economic Development";"Paying for the provision of environmental services is a recent policy innovation that is attracting much attention in both developed and developing countries. The innovation involves a move away from command and control environmental policies, harnessing market forces to obtain more efficient environmental outcomes. Linking payments for environmental services (PES) to economic development and poverty reduction is an issue of importance since they may represent a new source of finance to developing countries, and developing countries are potentially important suppliers of global environmental services. The objective of this paper is to apply economic concepts, particularly those from natural resource and environmental economics, to a wide range of issues associated with the introduction of ES programs in the context of economic development. We introduce a typology of ES based upon economic reasoning, showing that payments for ES provide a solution to externalities and public good problems within the bounds of political economic constraints. Secondly, we focus on the problem of who should pay for ES: to what extent are payments likely to be covered within a global framework rather within a national or regional framework? Third, we will turn to issues of program design. We present some answers to the questions of how to target payments to achieve their objectives efficiently, and what the implications of alternative design schemes are. In particular, we focus upon the equity implications of ES programs and how can they affect poverty alleviation. The final section addresses issues of monitoring and enforcement of ES contracts, and we summarize the key findings in the conclusion.";"Economic and Social Development Department

The action needed depends on the pattern of movement of the stocks. The                   different patterns of movement are discussed; they vary from small local dispersions in                   which only a small proportion of the stock cross boundaries between national EEZs to                   long migrations in which virtually all the stock may move from one EEZ to another.                   Collaboration between countries in research on shared stocks is always beneficial, and                   should not raise any serious problem. Collaboration in choosing and implementing                   management measures can be more difficult. The problems raised, and the nature of                   collaboration required to achieve effective management are discussed in relation to the                   different patterns of movement.";"Gulland, J.A.

In the face of growing challenges posed by climate change, as well as new economic and political realities, pastoralism offers a production system that prospers in landscapes where other livelihood systems are either at their limit or require large investments. The sector is highly relevant to the fundamental goals and strategic frameworks of both agencies. For example, resilience thinking has recently been adopted as core to both agencies’ development programmes and policies. There is also a growing awareness of the limits of representing the world in terms of closed and self-regulated systems, and of the need for an approach which integrates variability as the rule rather than the exception.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2016-02";"en";"pastoralists";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"";"KEN;MLI;SOM;ITA;BOL;IND;SEN;SDN;MNG";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/2ffe6b81-e34d-4718-94b0-f777b8a90f0e";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bd503e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/bd0a35c7-3316-46f2-8d28-b3832873e6bd_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

It presents information about the contribution of the forestry sector to national economies at the global, regional and country levels. The study presents the status and trends of the forestry sector’s contribution (total employment, value-added and export earnings) in the sector and analyses the driving forces behind these trends. It updates the data and analysis to the year 2011. The study gives a reasonable estimation of the general trends in the sector at the regional and global level. However, at the level of individual countries, the use of imputed values for some figures (i.e. FAO estimates rather than published statistics) should be noted and these estimates should be treated with caution.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

"FAODOCREP:53f1f8d7-9738-4924-8df7-75023dc6032b";"Food, Agriculture and Cities. Challenges of Food and Nutrition Security, Agriculture and Ecosystem Management in an Urbanizing World";"Urbanization is one of the key drivers of change in the world today. The world‟s urban population currently stands at around 3.5 billion. It will almost double to more than 6 billion by 2050. This is a challenge not only for urban areas but also for rural areas, because many people, especially the young, will migrate from rural areas to urban areas over this period. When addressing urbanization challenges, we are also addressing, directly or indirectly, rural and territorial development. What do we have to do to ensure people‟s access to good nutrition in cities? What do we have to do to produce enough food for urban dwellers? What infrastructures are needed and what kind of food production is possible in cities? How can cities preserve the services of the surrounding ecosystems? A very wide range of important issues links urbanization and food security. The “Food for the Cities” multidisciplinary initiative started in FAO in the year 2000. It has covered a great variety of areas such as food supply, nutrition education, school gardens, urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry; how to support small producers in urban and peri-urban areas, waste management and re-use of wastewater. The experience shows conclusively that we all need to work in partnership when addressing issues of urbanization and food security, from the public sector, the private sector and civil society. Local authorities are key players in this context, however, urban actors have often not considered the food system an important issue when designing, planning and managing cities. The perception has been because food is there and one can easily buy it in the supermarkets or along the streets, that food will always be there. This perception was altered for many in 2008, when the food prices peaked. More than 20 countries around the world experienced food riots in urban areas. Hunger, now in both rural and urban areas, has now become vocal, and this is changing the political scene. All stakeholders need to work together at global and local levels, for advocacy, for project implementation, but also for raising awareness on urbanization and food security as one of the key issues of our times. This position paper addresses a wide audience, from field workers to decision makers, to help understand the challenges that continuing urbanization brings to food, agriculture, and the management of natural resources. The approach proposed here is based on four dimensions that characterize, design and implement food systems for cities. The paper has been prepared as a support for all actors to help advocate for political support and to assist in developing operational strategies adapted to local realities. Food and nutrition security in cities can not be taken for granted. It is part of a complex system. Supporting the most vulnerable groups in an urbanizing world demands discussions on food, agriculture and cities in the context of rural-urban linkages.";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2011-12";"en";"natural resources management;urban areas;suburban agriculture";"Urban Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NPL;KEN;ZAF;ISR;UGA;ESP;CHL;HTI;ITA;CAN;NIC;IND;SLE;MEX;BRA";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/53f1f8d7-9738-4924-8df7-75023dc6032b";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-au725e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/579b828e-3045-4bfa-acd2-e956efd81be6_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

This internationally-recognized vision for Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) allows the promotion of synergies between the three Rio conventions and can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The main issue, which will be discussed during the 5th MFW, is therefore the following: how can efforts on restoration of forests and Mediterranean landscapes help reaching the global targets, such as the Bonn challenge, the 15th Aichi Target of the CBD, the UNCCD target on land degradation neutrality, the Paris Agreement on climate and the decisions that will be taken during the UNFCCC COP 22 in Marrakech and SDG  15, related to these issues? The 5th MFW will aim at promoting the topic of restoration on a Mediterranean scale, at federating around forests various ongoing initiatives related to the Rio conventions, and at concretizing those initiatives through an agenda of ambitious field actions and by collectively mobilizing technical and financial partners from countries surrounding the Mediterranean.

Они стабилизируют почву и климат, регулируют водосток, дают тень и укрытие, создают ареал обитания для опылителей и естественных врагов сельскохозяйственных вредителей. Они также вносят свой вклад в обеспечение продовольственной безопасности сотен миллионов людей и служат для них важным источником питания, энергии и дохода. При этом сельское хозяйство по-прежнему является основным фактором обезлесения в мире, а меры государственной политики в области сельского и лесного хозяйства и земельных отношений зачастую не согласуются друг с другом.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;В докладе ""Состояние лесов мира (СОФО) – 2016"" на примере успехов, достигнутых во Вьетнаме, Гане, Гамбии, Грузии, Коста-Рике, Тунисе и Чили, показано, что можно добиться повышения продуктивности сельского хозяйства и укрепления продовольственной безопасности и одновременно с этим остановить и даже обратить вспять процесс обезлесения.

As with any production-based intervention, the poorest groups face significant constraints to entry into aquaculture. However, aquaculture offers many opportunities for livelihood benefits that other sectors do not. Aquaculture technologies appropriate for poor people are now largely in place. Emphasis must therefore be given to more effective extension of low-cost technologies, appropriate management practices and securing rights of access and control, rather than technical research. This report provides a background to the issues of focusing aquaculture on poverty alleviation based on the conclusions of an expert consultation which was organized in order to provide field-level professionals in Asia with a unique opportunity to come together to share experiences on working in the field of poverty alleviation and aquaculture, and to prepare a platform for future networking.";"Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific

En estos estudios  se consideran los diversos aspectos de los esfuerzos por mejorar el  acceso a la tierra y a otros recursos naturales y conseguir una mayor  seguridad de la tenencia. Se analiza el papel de la tenencia de tierras  en relación con el desarrollo rural, el género y el acceso a la tierra,  el acceso mejorado a la tierra mediante acuerdos de arrendamiento,  los sistemas fiscales aplicados a la propiedad rural, la concentración  parcelaria y el acceso a la tierra y su administración después de  conflictos violentos, así como la buena gobernanza de la tenencia  y la administración de tierras.";"Claudia

El sistema de las Naciones Unidas, como un servicio público mundial, tiene que dar el ejemplo al suministrar información a sus Estados Miembros, órganos rectores, asociados y otras partes interesadas sobre sus recursos y principales logros, proponiéndola en un formato de fácil lectura. Sin embargo, muchas de las actividades llevadas a cabo por el sistema de las Naciones Unidas en general, y de la FAO en particular, no se conocen muy bien. Por esta razón, el Departamento Forestal de la FAO, a principios de 2010, decidió crear una publicación bienal interesante, que exhibiera sus principales logros y los recursos correspondientes. Esta publicación informa sobre los debates durante las sesiones plenarias del Comité Forestal (COFO), cuando se presentan los informes acerca de las actividades y, asimismo, es un recurso para el nuevo personal, los asociados y los medios de comunicación con el fin de que se comprenda mejor el Programa Forestal de la FAO. Durante el último bienio, por medio de su densa red de oficinas nacionales regionales y subregionales y de su Sede en Roma, Italia, la FAO ha puesto en marcha proyectos que ascienden a un total de 81 500 000 millones de dólares estadounidenses, y las actividades normativas del Programa Ordinario correspondiente a aproximadamente 40 millones de dólares estadounidenses.

The document has been long expected by many technicians involved in the management, conservation, and sustainable development of forests, on which depend many people of Africa, Asia and Latin America.  In its first part, the document reviews relevant issues, nature and diversity of these forest formations and the biological, socio-economic and human factors that affect their present evolution.  It introduces afterwards the concept of management, and fundamentals and principles under pinning it.  An assessment of the tools available is made in the second part, which ends with considerations on prospects, indications and guidelines that would help establish best practices.  The document also features case studies exploring promising breakthrough.";"Forestry Department

The Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) and the international community accepted the results in December 2010, but violence spiraled, including in the border region with Liberia. This region has seen repeated refugee flows over the decades, as well as border crossing - as a coping mechanism when livelihoods are threatened or simply for better economic and social opportunities. The border region straddles the Cavalla River and is rich in natural resources including gold, diamonds and timber. With numerous water points across the region and direct access to the ocean, the soil is fertile and fish thrive in its rivers and lakes. Despite its natural wealth and fertile lands, food security remains a major concern within the region. Evidence collected in 2012 shows how food and social insecurity are tied to land conflict and weak social cohesion, problems which persist throughout the region. The governments, United Nations agencies and NGOs of both countries have been working to address the needs of this vulnerable population. Until now, however, humanitarian actors on both sides of the border have tended to view their interventions primarily in a short-term perspective, and through a national lens, with little or no exchange between the two countries. The proposed interventions to be piloted for the coming three years reflect the cross-border realities of the situation, integrating root causes of conflict, namely weaknesses in food security, social cohesion and land tenure. Evidence-based programming aims to achieve two main objectives : 1) coordination, transparency and accountability throughout the implementation process, and 2) a rigorous impact assessment that can feed into future evidence-based policy-making";"";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2012-12";"en";"land tenure";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"SLE;002;LBR;CIV;GIN";"Reports & Research";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/19037e39-2a6d-4dd7-9e72-0b3ea99879e3";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-bl107e.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/46e71e5b-4b57-40d9-8f29-d60cfb26280d_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

No obstante lo anterior, nuestro interés ha sido colaborar en la respuesta a la pregunta: ¿Qué signifi ca aplicar las Directrices Voluntarias? No cabe duda que, luego del esfuerzo realizado por elaborar, consensuar y aprobarlas, se ha llegado a un punto donde se plantea: ¿Y ahora qué?, lo que plantea grandes desafíos para pasar a una fase de aplicación. Sin embargo, para responder a esta simple pregunta, es fundamental volver a mirar su génesis y retomar, entonces, los antecedentes, vale decir, en el contexto en el que se elaboran y no solo tomarlas como un dato, a partir del cual se buscan caminos para su aplicación.

La guía se centra en la justicia entre los sexos y en las formas en que el gobierno de la tenencia puede responder a las diferentes necesidades y prioridades de mujeres y de hombres. Una gobernanza de la tenencia de la tierra que es paritaria garantiza que mujeres y hombres puedan participar,tanto a través de las instituciones oficiales como de acuerdos de administración y gestión informales, en igualdad de condiciones en las actividades que los relacionan con la tierra.La guía ofrece consejos acerca de los mecanismos,estrategias y acciones que es posible poner  en marcha para reforzar la equidad de género enlos procesos, instituciones y actuaciones de la gobernanza de la tenencia de la tierra.";"Climate, Energy and Tenure Division

Thus, even though most have assets of some kind, they have no way to document their possessions because they lack formal access to legally recognized tools such as deeds, contracts and permits.   FAO, with donor funding from Norway, has undertaken a set of activities for “Improving tenure security of the rural poor” in order to meet the needs of FAO member countries and, in turn, support the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) – the first global anti-poverty initiative focusing on the link between exclusion, poverty and law, looking for practical solutions to the challenges of poverty, aiming to make legal protection and economic opportunity the right of all, not the privilege of the few.   This paper aims to suggest answers to this penetrating question about land tenure and the poor in Africa:   Why, when so much is known and so much seems to be done, does so little change?   For this purpose, a framework has been developed that can be used to prioritize and explore the issues within a coherent and recognizable context that provides a practical as well as theoretical perspective.";"McAuslan, P.

В различных регионах они выполняют различные функции, но повсеместно они имеют менее широкий по сравнению с мужчинами доступ к ресурсам и возможностям, которые им необходимы для того, чтобы их производственная деятельность была более эффективной. Расширение доступа женщин к земельным ресурсам, домашнему скоту, образованию, финансовым услугам, информационным услугам, технологии и занятости в сельских районах позволило бы повысить их производительность и обеспечить дополнительные выгоды в плане сельскохозяйственного производства, продовольственной безопасности, экономического роста и социального обеспечения. Преодоление гендерного разрыва только в части, касающейся сельскохозяйственных потребляемых факторов, дало бы возможность снизить число голодающих на 100-150 миллионов человек. Какого-либо единого плана ликвидации гендерного разрыва не существует, однако некоторые основные принципы носят универсальный характер: правительства, международное сообщество и гражданское общество должны совместно работать в целях ликвидации дискриминации, закрепленной законом, содействовать обеспечению равного доступа к ресурсам и возможностям, обеспечивать учет гендерных факторов в сельскохозяйственной политике и программах, а также обеспечивать, чтобы голоса женщин, как равных партнеров в деятельности в целях устойчивого развития, были услышаны. Достижение гендерного равенства и расширение возможностей женщин в сельском хозяйстве являются не только справедливыми целями, которые должны быть достигнуты.

"FAODOCREP:49c99cf8-9a81-5106-8876-3135c97b699b";"Guidelines: land evaluation for extensive grazing";"Extensive grazing is the predominant form of land use on at least a quarter of the world’s land surface, in which livestock are raised on food that comes mainly from rangelands. Extensive grazing differs from crop or forestry production, in which the produce remains in situ whilst growing. Evaluation for extensive grazing, unlike that for cropping or forestry, must take into account the production of both grazing forage, termed primary production, and the livestock that feed on this forage, termed secondary production.  Extensive grazing also differs from intensive grazing, in which the animal feed comes mainly from artificial, seeded pastures and not from unimproved rangeland. This relationship between livestock and arable farming must be considered when evaluating land for improved uses in which livestock play a major part. If one component of the overall land use is developed in isolation from the others, the balance between extensive grazing and arable farming may easily be disturbed. Land evaluation is used to identify alternative land uses or changes in management that will better meet national or local needs, and to estimate the consequences of each feasible change. In terms of extensive grazing, it encourages the promotion of sustainable land uses that integrate land, livestock and people for their mutual benefit.";"Land and Water Division

La meta fijada por el AIAF 2014 fue reposicionar la agricultura familiar en el centro de las políticas agrícolas, ambientales y sociales en las agendas nacionales, identificando lagunas y oportunidades para promover un cambio hacia un desarrollo más equitativo y equilibrado. Uno de los principales objetivos del AIAF consistió en establecer plataformas para el diálogo político con las organizaciones de agricultores con el fin de generar consenso y crear e implementar políticas eficaces en apoyo a la agricultura familiar. La plataforma de dialogo y sensibilización que se utilizó en la República Dominicana fue el Comité Nacional de Agricultura Familiar, un equipo integrado por representantes del sector gubernamental, no gubernamental, organismos internacionales y grupos comunitarios, que trabajó hombro con hombro para sentar las bases de una nueva política pública de agricultura familiar que se sostuviese en el tiempo y beneficie a este importante sector que tiene la encomiable tarea de suplir de alimentos al resto de la población.

"FAODOCREP:d2eeb67e-bc92-567e-b42d-80a0736b4400";"Planning in government forest agencies how to balance forest use and conservation: agenda for training workshop.";"The purpose of planning for forestry development is to establish a workable framework for forest use and conservation which incorporates the economic, social and environmental dimensions on a sustainable basis. The framework is about creating a shared vision of how forests will be used and protected. This can be summed up in a single central question: Trees and forests for whom and for what? The question is not new but what is new is the perception that so many different groups have an interest in the reply.   Forestry planning has traditionally been mainly concerned with the production of timber for industry and other wood products, and with forest industry development. Planning for environmental goals also has a long history but was largely restricted to designated areas for exclusive conservation. National forestry development agencies were essentially responsible for the sustained yield management on protected public forest lands and for reserved forests. The term ""sustained yield"" was mostly limited to wood production and therefore excluded the majority of other forest products and services. Although most forestry agencies have made progress towards multiple-use management, planning remains often biased towards timber in a wide range of countries. Many of the actions taken in order to stimulate forestry development in the immediate failed to sustain the momentum of growth in the longer term. Short term achievements sometimes resulted in degradation or destruction of the stock of natural capital needed in order to maintain growth in the future or reduced options for future end uses by degrading the forest capital.";"Forestry Economics and Policy Division

By setting out principles and internationally accepted standards for responsible practices, the Voluntary Guidelines will provide a framework and point of reference that stakeholders can use when developing their own policies and actions.      Regional consultations on the proposed Voluntary Guidelines are an important part of the process. They bring together regionally representative, multidisciplinary groups to assess regional priorities and issues that should be considered when the Voluntary Guidelines are drafted. The regional consultation for the Near East and North Africa was organized by Birzeit University, hosted by the University of Jordan under the patronage of H.E.

How to ensure that poor people have rights and opportunities to access natural resources, as well as responsibilities for the sustainable management of natural resources, has become a central question in debates over poverty alleviation. The overarching development issue at the macro-level is: what contribution can natural resources make to poverty alleviation given an increasingly complex reality of globalization, urbanization, rural diversification, technological innovation and livelihoods marked by insecurity and vulnerability to change.

These issues have been the subject of discussions and policy recommendations during many international forums, such as the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development (ICARRD) held in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in March 2006.    In this regard, FAO, together with other development organizations, is preparing Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land and other Natural Resources. The process towards the Voluntary Guidelines is carried out in collaboration with governments, civil society, private sector, and international organizations, and will be adopted by the FAO Member States.  The Voluntary Guidelines are intended to provide practical guidance on responsible governance of tenure as a means of responding to global challenges of our time. These guidelines will be consistent with the wide range of international instruments, and will adopt a human rights-based approach. They will be a further elaboration of the Right to Food Guidelines and will be a follow up to the recommendations from ICARRD.     The content of the Voluntary Guidelines will draw on multi-stakeholder regional consultation meetings, civil society consultations, private sector consultation and expert group meetings. Once drafted, the Voluntary Guidelines will be submitted for FAO member countries’ approval. Upon adoption of the Voluntary Guidelines, FAO and its partners will support their implementation through national action plans, through the Organization’s extensive partnership networks and through related project activities.";"arial

Information technology systems have become basic elements of these systems everywhere. Introduction of automation to land administration has improved systems’ efficiency, standardisation and accessibility, which in turn have contributed to responsible land governance. Developing country land administrations are, however, often inefficient and poorly structured. This results partly from the lack of adapted and flexible software tools to standardise, structure and maintain the cadastre and the land registration. Open-source software bears a promise of a way forward. This booklet, which has been jointly prepared by FAO and FIG, demonstrates through theory and country experiences that open-source software has become a credible alternative to commercial off-the-shelf software in the field of cadastre and land registration systems.";"Steudler, D.

Animals are a source of food, more specifically protein for human diets, income, employment and possibly foreign exchange. For low-income producers, livestock can serve as a store of wealth, provide draught power and organic fertiliser for crop production and a means of transport.

"FAODOCREP:bfc7a980-1d7d-556f-94df-a2b74865fb3e";"Planning and management for sustainable coastal aquaculture development";"The rationale for more integrated approaches to aquaculture development is powerful: coastal aquaculture has brought significant benefits to both national economies and coastal people; aquaculture is highly vulnerable to pollution caused by other resource users; if poorly designed or managed it may cause pollution or the spread of disease; its impacts are often limited but incremental and cumulative; and it often takes place in areas where resource ownership or use rights are ill defined and ambiguous.  Efforts to integrate aquaculture into coastal management can contribute to improvements in selection, protection and allocation of sites and other resources for existing and future aquaculture developments.    This report explores how more planned and integrated approaches can be applied to aquaculture development.  These approaches range from ""enhanced sectoral"" initiatives, to incorporation within comprehensive ICM programmes.  No simple, effective, and widely applicable models have been identified.  The most appropriate approach will depend upon a wide range of local factors, including available skills and resources, the urgency of the problems or opportunities, and the nature of existing planning and development frameworks.  The less comprehensive approaches may be the only realistic option in some situations, but should be seen as a starting point for, and stimulus to, more comprehensive ICM.  These approaches should contribute to more systematic planning and improved management of individual aquaculture operations, as well as to the coastal aquaculture sector as a whole.";"Mr José Aguilar-Manjarrez

They  shape policy, decision-making, and act as a proxy for development. Integrated Water  Resources Management plans around basic information on water resources and  use. Unfortunately, the nomenclature surrounding water information is often confusing and  gives rise to different interpretations and thus confusion. When discussing the way in which  renewable water resources are utilized, the terms water use, withdrawal, consumption,  abstraction, extraction, utilization, supply and demand are often used without clearly stating  what is meant.  This note attempts to shed light on how the AQUASTAT programme defines these terms,  although readers should be aware that these definitions are not globally standardized.  Harmonization efforts within the UN system are ongoing.";"Deputy Directory-General Natural Resources

Il met davantage l’accent sur les causes directes et  socio-économiques de ces phénomènes incluant leurs impacts sur les fonctionnements des  écosystèmes. Sous la forme d’un questionnaire, celui-ci évalue quel type de dégradation des terres  existe réellement, où et pourquoi cela se passe et ce qui est fait à ce sujet en matière de gestion  durable des terres (GDT). En reliant les informations obtenues dans ce questionnaire à un Système  d'Information Géographique (SIG), cela permet la production de cartes ainsi que des calculs de  superficies des différents aspects de la dégradation et de la conservation des terres. La base de  données et les produits cartographiques obtenus fournissent un puissant outil permettant d’obtenir un  panorama de la dégradation et de la conservation des terres aux niveaux national, régional ou mondial.";"CDE/WOCAT, FAO/LADA, ISRIC

"FAODOCREP:06b93212-e3b6-506a-8ac9-a3dea25fcc11";"Administration and conflict management in Japanese coastal fisheries";"Japanese coastal fishermen have legally-guaranteed equitable access to and “ownership” of the living aquatic resources of coastal waters, through an elaborate fisheries rights system. In Japan no conceptual distinction exists between land holdings and land tenure and sea holdings, or sea tenure, and fisheries enjoy a legal status equal to that of land ownership. Sea tenure in Japanese coastal fisheries is a complex subject that is little known in the West. It involves time-honoured customary procedures for management and conflict resolution which have been incorporated into modern legislation.   The Introduction reviews selected aspects of the general behavioural context within which the administration of Japanese fisheries and the resolution of conflicts should be viewed. Since the degree of continuity with traditional management practises is an outstanding characteristic, Chapter 1 describes and provides examples of the historical antecedents of the present situation. Present day formal administration is described in Chapter 2.   Systems of coastal sea tenure reflect an intimate interplay of formal government regulations and informal customary elements. The latter are commonly of greater day-to-day importance than the former. In Chapters 3 and 4 this is examined through the problems of conflict management and resolution, proceeding from the personal and small-scale level to the impersonal prefectural and national levels. In Japan the most frequent, effective and culturally legitimate methods employed to manage and resolve conflict are informal and personal. These are operationalized via small-group discussion, verbal communication and the use of gobetweens. Such mechanisms, which ensure that a conflict remains localized and centred directly on the contending parties, are employed not only to manage conflicts between fishermen but also in highly formal situations such as arise in the judicial process. Failure to adhere to such a process invariably means that conflict becomes entrenched and impossible to solve.";"Kenneth Ruddle

The document consists of two main parts: i) presentation of background information on the programme activities and analysis of the available information on the regional and sub-regional level (both in English and in French); and ii) presentation of data on NWFP on the national level (so-called “country profiles”, available in either English or French).    The country profiles were originally compiled to be made available on the FAO homepage. However, taking into consideration the limited access to the Internet in various countries, it has been decided to publish, in addition, a hardcopy version of the country profiles and to add a regional and sub-regional analysis of the data.    Most of the data presented in this report are indicative figures, which have been collected in published and unpublished reports, and therefore do not represent official statistics. The results presented show that qualitative and quantitative information on NWFP on the national level is still weak. It is hoped that this report will support the on-going process of data improvement on NWFP. Improved data is considered to be essential to ensure that the use and importance of NWFP is adequately taken into consideration by decision-makers, land-use planners, politicians, or other concerned experts. Additional information and comments from readers to improve data on NWFP in African countries would be very much appreciated.";"Forestry Department";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)";"2001-12";"en;fr";"forestry;natural resources management";"Forest Tenure";"";"DZA;AGO;EGY;GNQ;NGA;MUS;MRT;GHA;ZWE;NAM;GNB;SWZ;COD;COG;GIN;ETH;COM;MWI;CPV;LBR;LBY;LSO;UGA;RWA;SOM;MDG;CMR;TZA;BWA;ERI;SEN;TCD;GAB;BFA;MOZ;ZMB;GMB;MLI;BDI;002;001;STP;DJI;SLE;SYC;KEN;MAR;NER;ZAF;TGO;TUN;CAF;SDN;CIV";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/57d7dec8-6e8e-5559-b965-af817bf2b383";"http://www.fao.org/3/a-y1515b.pdf";"http://www.fao.org/documents/contents/ecd88166-3f7b-57fd-a693-25163a1fde8b_200.tn";"All rights reserved";"© FAO.

"FAODOCREP:9e927d64-366b-409c-80e0-60e7e7976368";"Forest Ecology and Management. Science to Sustain the World’s Forests ";"This paper introduces a Special Issue of Forest Ecology and Management that includes a collection of analytical results from the 2015 Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA 2015) covering 25 years of forest change (1990–2015). FRA 2015 builds on a series of global assessments that began in 1948 and covers change in forest area and type, volume, biomass and carbon stocking, measures of sustainable forest management, biodiversity and conservation, soil and water protective functions, wood production and a number of socio-economic variables. It covers 234 countries and territories with an emphasis on forest resource change over a twenty-five year period (1990–2015) and also looks forward to anticipated forest change – both as government targets for forest area and projected change (to 2030) to global production and conservation forest area (to the year 2050). This paper describes important contributions of global forest resource estimates to forest management, the methods used in the collection and analysis of FRA 2015 data and provides links to additional information resources. It discusses some of the limitations of this global dataset, some of the steps taken to improve quality and the characteristics that make this type of global data most useful. While forest area change dominates public use of the FRA, the state of the forest resource and management is critical to understanding the ecological and social values of the forest and forestry. Country level reporting not only provides insights that are only possible through national reporting but also provides greater national-level understanding and discussion of forest resource change. The papers that follow in this Special Issue provide analyses of FRA 2015 data covering a wide range of topics related to sustainable forest management and forest change.  ";"MacDicken, K.

Guangzhou, China, 7–11 March 2006.";"Aquaculture in the Southeast Asian region has been growing steadily over the last few decades, requiring more space to accommodate it. The search for additional areas to expand the aquaculture industry as a whole and the identification of new farming species of commercial value to satisfy the growing local and export markets are pushing the sector in some countries to broaden activities in the sea, including further offshore where more space is available and where, to a lesser extent, competition is currently not so intense. The Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA) organized the regional workshop entitled ""The Future of Mariculture: a Regional Approach for Responsible Development in the Asia-Pacific Region"" from 7 to 11 March 2006. The workshop was conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries of the People’s Republic of China and the Guangdong Ocean and Fisheries Administration. The workshop was convened in response to requests from FAO and NACA Member countries to identify key trends and issues affecting mariculture growth in the Asia-Pacific region and to strengthen regional collaboration for future responsible development of mariculture.";"Lovatelli, A.; Phillips, M.J.; Arthur, J.R.; Yamamoto, K.

Improving the methods and tools to work drectly with food-insecure households is critical. For decades, growth monitoring has been practised by community health workers in many developing countries. Authors show how techniques for assessing children's growth status can be made more effective. A report about a recent household food security project in Viet Nam demonstrates how monitoring can be combined with strategies to improve the nutritional knowledge of care givers and to raise the amount and variety of food available to rural households. Other authors challenge scientists working in agriculture and nutrition to apply their talents to improving food production in areas that are often neglected, so that local food supplies can increase and food intakes can provide greater health benefits.";"J.L.

The purpose of this document is to describe the elements in National Forest Monitoring Systems (NFMSs) as they relate to REDD+ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to describe the UN-REDD Programme approach to Monitoring and Measurement, Reporting and Verification (M &amp; MRV) requirements. This paper is presented in a series of sections discussing the various elements of relevant texts of the UNFCCC and the methodological recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This approach aims to allow the end-user to consider the implications of the implementation of REDD+ activities in distinct national contexts, and the various steps involved.";"FAO, Rome (Italy).

It covers a range of issues of which access to resources and assets, land, water, and the recommendation to protect ecological sustainability for sustainable management of natural resources are primary. The study reviews a range of international instruments and international developments related to natural resources governance in the ten years since the adoption of the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security (Right to Food Guidelines) in which human rights in general and the right to food in particular feature prominently.  The study then reviews progress and challenges at the national and global levels, with a specific focus on gender, vulnerable groups, community and family management, and participatory processes. . Examples are given that show national level successes in terms of a variety of approaches to handling key concerns with respect to land tenure rights, fishing rights of artisanal fishers, forest land allocation to smallholders. Challenges are mentioned and the wider involvement of the private sector is noted. The author points to global level issues such as climate change and large-scale land acquisitions that remain present in the context of development and public policy for promoting food security and the right to adequate food.";"Cruz, L.

It produces much less food than it requires due to many factors, such as limited arable land and shortage of water resources, and below world average agricultural productivity in many cases. In addition, the region suffers from excessive food losses and wastes. FAO estimated recently that food losses and waste in the world amounts to about 1.3 billion metric tons, and we estimate that our region’s share of these losses and wastes is very significant. Therefore, in addition to improving food productivity, it is vital to explore every possible means to reduce food losses and wastes throughout the distribution systems. Such efforts will increase food availability, wholesomeness and safety, reduce the food shortage, and achieve food security in our region. Therefore, the establishment of adequate cold chain infrastructure and adequate application and management is essential to assure food security. The costs of establishing an adequate cold chain industry, both economic and environmental, can be more than offset by the economic and environmental benefits of maintaining adequate quantities and quality of food.";"Kader, Adel A.

In the past several years however, governments have begun implementing strict conservation policies, which have curtailed the harvest levels from this fast depleting resource base. To meet their respective wood requirements and at the same time revegetate denuded areas, most tropical countries have started to embark in tree plantation programs. As in any endeavor, there is a felt need to improve on the various aspects, e.g., technical and implementing policies on the existing tree plantation programs in the Asia Pacific Region in order to ensure success.   It is within this context that the Philippine Government held the International Conference on Timber Plantation Development on 7 - 9 November 2000 in Manila, Philippines. The Conference was organized by the Forest Management Bureau of the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources with the assistance from the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.";"Forestry Department

The report finds that most of these issues are common across the three countries, both in terms of the challenges that the communities face and imperatives that inform policy interventions and responses. In all three countries, customary and statutory systems operate side by side and, in all three, there is a tendency for policy and legislative frameworks to privilege the modern systems of property relations over traditional ones, even as national rhetoric indicates recognition and support for the latter.   The paper concludes that formalization has not always benefited the rural poor. Instead, an elite minority has tended to benefit from reforms while the majority of the poor and vulnerable end up worse off as institutions and systems that supported their livelihoods and gave them a sense of security are marginalized and replaced by modern institutions.";"Odhiambo, M.O.
