"AGRIS:FR2016224867";"Place des prairies dans les territoires français : regard historique";"";"The place of grasslands in the French regions has undergone great changes presently as a consequence of the deep transformations of contemporary agriculture, with environmental and social effects. But the situation of grasslands was itself the outcome of the history of past ages, especially the deep changes that occurred during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The changes and the underlying responsible factors were analysed for four regions chiefly devoted to grasslands (Normandy, Charente, Limousin, Thiérache). The characteristics of each region's identity are also of interest. Lastly, the agricultural recommendations put forward for pasture seeding (choice of species, seeding rates, seed origin) are presented. Some of the mechanisms responsible for the changes are still to be seen at work presently. On the other hand, the large decrease in farm labour, the abundance of which was decisive for some of the past changes, will have heavy consequences for future changes.

La place actuelle des prairies dans les territoires français se modifie profondément en conséquence des évolutions profondes de l'agriculture contemporaine, et entraîne avec elle des conséquences environnementales et sociales. Mais la situation des prairies était l'héritage des siècles passés et notamment des profondes modifications qui se sont produites au cours du 19ème siècle et au début du 20ème. Les évolutions et moteurs sous-jacents sont analysés dans le cas de 4 régions à dominante herbagères (Normandie, Charente, Limousin et Thiérache). Il est également intéressant de voir quels ont été les éléments identitaires de ces régions. Enfin, les préconisations agronomiques mises en avant lors des semis de prairies sont présentés (choix des espèces, doses de semis et origine des semences). Certains mécanismes qui ont prévalu à ces changements peuvent encore être perçus aujourd'hui. En revanche, la forte diminution la main d'uvre agricole (dont l'abondance a été au cur de certains de ces changements passés) va peser lourdement sur les évolutions futures.";"Huyghe, Christian";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"fr";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=FR2016224867";"http://prodinra.inra.fr/ft/79CC2EB5-3CFA-4D89-B700-D91D73615D69";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:DJ2012048398";"Agricultural Land Degradation and Salinization in Shamsabad Region, Qom Province, Iran";"";"Salinization and alkalization are considered spatiotemporal dynamic soil degradation processes. In order to investigate the effects of agricultural activities on land degradation and soil salinity, Shamsabad area in Qom province was selected. Aerial photos (1955) and satellite images (1990-2002) were used to examine the changes in land use. Soil samples were collected from 25 locations in the study area from 0-50 cm and 51-100 cm depth at each location. For comparative purposes, sampling locations in this study were similar to locations used for salinity study in 1983. For each sample, pH, electrical conductivity (ECe), base saturation percentage, exchangeable sodium, lime and texture were measured. Land use and salinity maps were created by using geographic information system (GIS) softwares. Results revealed an increase of 9.5 times in cultivated lands in 47 years. Increase in agricultural activities in the study area has also intensified the pressure on water resource in the area, lowering ground water tables and degrading water quality. In the 0-50 cm soil depth, the average soil ECe was 6.5 dS/m in 1983, which increased to 10.7 dS/m in 2005. If soil salinity trend and pressure on water resources continue, large part of Shamsabad area is expected to change to desert in near future years.";"M Valipour

"AGRIS:US201600193633";"Maximizing water yield with indigenous nonâforest vegetation: a New Zealand perspective";"";"Provision of clean freshwater is an essential ecosystem service that is under increasing pressure worldwide from a variety of conflicting demands. Water yields differ in relation to landâcover type. Successful resource management therefore requires accurate information on yields from alternative vegetation types to adequately address concerns regarding water production. Of particular importance are upper watersheds/catchments, regardless of where water is extracted. Research in New Zealand has shown that, when in good condition, indigenous tall tussock grasslands can maximize water yield relative to other vegetation cover types. A longâterm hydrological pairedâcatchment study revealed reductions (up to 41% after 22 years) in water yielded annually from an afforested catchment relative to adjacent indigenous grassland. Furthermore, a stable isotope assessment showed that water from fog may substantially contribute to yield in upland tussock grasslands. The tall tussock lifeâform and its leaf anatomy and physiology, which minimize transpiration loss, appear to be the differentiating factors. Thus, maintaining dominance of such cover is important for water production, especially in upland catchments. Ecological analogues and integrated landâuse planning are discussed in the context of this essential ecosystem service. Water management programs in other countries are reviewed and that of South Africa is commended as a model.";"Mark, Alan F

However, they cannot provide detailed spatial and spectral information over Antarctic areas. For obtaining this information, we propose an Antarctic land-cover classification method using IKONOS and Hyperion data over Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. High spatial resolution IKONOS imagery enabled the detection of detailed, accurate boundaries between areas of snow, ice, vegetation, water and rock. Rock types were classified in detail using high spectral resolution Hyperion imagery. Because Antarctic land-cover types exhibit unusual spectral features, a step-by-step classification using various data sets and methods was applied. Five soil types and two rock types were identified by applying spectral linear unmixing to Hyperion data. Our land-cover classification map shows small mossy areas near emperor penguin or skua habitat. Lakes, which are an important factor in environmental monitoring, are also clearly shown. The detailed rock and soil classification map revealed that biotite gneiss and clay soils are dominant. This Antarctic land-cover map is useful for determining a suitable site for an environment-friendly Antarctic station. Among the various land-cover types, the lakes and the vegetation, rock and soil areas are considered to be important environmental factors related to Antarctic living organisms.";"Kim, Sun-Hwa

"AGRIS:US201500052702";"cost effective stratified two-stage sampling design to estimate the forest land area of southern Chile";"";"There is a growing demand for improving the measurement of forest resources, with more frequent updating and better information on environmental variables. We explore the cost efficiency of a stratified two-stage design using area sampling to estimate the forest plantation and native forest areas in southern Chile. Analytical expressions for the approximate mean square error of combined and separate ratio estimators are derived applying Taylor linearization. Under a unified framework, this procedure allows the evaluation of the precision of design and post-design estimators for unequal unit area sizes at both stages. Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess empirically the approximate analytical measures of the mean square error and the biases associated with the ratio estimators. Adopting proportional allocation among strata and clusters, the optimal allocation among the two stages is determined. A substantial improvement in sampling precision was achieved using the separate ratio estimator and the bias was found to be small. Post-stratification based on categorical information on growing zones also improved the precision of estimating the forest plantation area and a smaller extent the native forest area. The results of this paper support a wider adoption of sampling methods to estimate land use and land cover at regional or national levels.";"Niklitschek, Mario E.

"AGRIS:US201300790793";"Shifting cultivation in peatlands";"";"Transboundary haze pollution from smoke from land preparation fires has become a perennial problem in Indonesia, especially in the last 10 years during the dry season. Most of that smoke originates from illegal land preparation fires for oil palm and industrial forest plantation as well as from shifting cultivation, which is usually blamed for the smoke. In order to understand the role of fire in shifting cultivation areas dominated by peat soils, research was conducted during the dry season of 2001 on land belonging to the community of Pelalawan village, Pelalawan district, Riau province, Indonesia. The research showed that burning did not affect all peat areas equally. No peat was burned on a fibric site, while burning on a hemic site varied in depth from 6.0 cm to 12.6 cm, and on a sapric site from 15.4 cm to 31.9 cm. Further, on the fibric site only phosphorus increased significantly following burning, while on the hemic only the base saturation increased; on the sapric site, however, both base saturation and phosphorus increased compared to the condition before burning. These data show that if fire is continues to be used for land preparation in peat areas, peat becomes critically endangered.";"Saharjo, Bambang Hero";"";"Kluwer Academic Publishers";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IDN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300790793";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-006-9048-3";"";"";"";"135-146"
"AGRIS:US201500002810";"Governance of Gene Action and Combining Ability for Certain Grain Quality Traits in Three Diverse Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Growing Ecosystems";"";"Traditional varieties or land races from diverse rice growing ecosystems serving as repository of desirable gene pools for rice improvement including rice hybrids have been marginalized or are at the verge of perhaps total genetic erosion. Biotechnology patent systems and intellectual property rights intrinsic with genetically engineered rices weigh in at odds, competing with these good grain qualified traditional rices. Genetic analyses have been made to uncover the supremacy of gene action and combining ability for certain grain quality related physicochemical traits in seven diverse ecogeographical genotypes of ‘indica’ rice using a 7 × 7 half-diallel cross following Griffing's Model-1, Method-2. Comparative results obtained from 7 parents + 21 F(1)s + 21 F(2)s revealed the involvement of both additive (polygenic) and non-additive (epistasis or interallelic) gene action(s) in the governance of grain quality traits. However, the ratio of σ(2) g/σ(2) (s) exhibited greater importance of non-additive genes for all the traits except kernel length in F(1). This suggests the plausibility of exploitation of heterosis in rice as a self-pollinated crop. Epistasis gene action (interallelic interaction) was found to be more pronounced for all the traits. The genotypes NS 19 (for grain weight), T 21 and IR 24 (for both kernel length and L/B ratio) and Jal Lahri (for protein content) emerged as good general combiners with high ‘gca’ values. The six specific crosses, viz., Mahsuri/IR 24, NDR 359/Jal Lahri, Sarjoo 52/Jal Lahri, Mahsuri/T 21, Sarjoo 52/NS 19 and Sarjoo 52/T 21, revealed significant ‘sca’ effects suggesting their role in improvising for certain physicochemical grain quality traits. These crosses were found to retain at least one parent with high ‘gca’ value and the other parent having either high, average or low ‘gca’ effects indicating for the occurrence of both additive as well as non-additive genetic interactions. These findings may be of greater relevance in shuffling and combining the genes/traits between traditional and modern rice varieties (e.g., semi-dwarf, good to moderate tillering, medium maturity and good grain quality with high protein content) in almost all rice growing ecosystems.";"Verma, O.P.

A dynamic, forward-looking optimization framework applied over the course of the coming century shows that although some deforestation is optimal in the near term, in the absence of climate change regulation, the desirability of further deforestation is eliminated by mid-century. Although adverse productivity shocks from climate change have a modest effect on global land use, such shocks combined with rapid growth in energy prices lead to significant deforestation and higher greenhouse gas emissions than in the baseline. Imposition of a global greenhouse gas emissions constraint further heightens the competition for land, as fertilizer use declines and land-based mitigation strategies expand. However, anticipation of the constraint largely dilutes its environmental effectiveness, as deforestation accelerates prior to imposition of the target.";"Steinbuks, Jevgenijs

"AGRIS:US201301644376";"Livestock water productivity: implications for sub-Saharan Africa";"";"Water is essential for agriculture including livestock. Given increasing global concern that access to agricultural water will constrain food production and that livestock production uses and degrades too much water, there is compelling need for better understanding of the nature of livestock-water interactions. Inappropriate animal management along with poor cropping practices often contributes to widespread and severe depletion, degradation and contamination of water. In developed countries, diverse environmental organisations increasingly voice concerns that animal production is a major cause of land and water degradation. Thus, they call for reduced animal production. Such views generally fail to consider their context, applicability and implications for developing countries. Two global research programs, the CGIAR 'Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management and Agriculture' and 'Challenge Program on Water and Food' have undertaken studies of the development, management and conservation of agricultural water in developing countries. Drawing on these programs, this paper describes a framework to systematically identify key livestock-water interactions and suggests strategies for improving livestock and water management especially in the mixed crop-livestock production systems of sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast to developed country experience, this research suggests that currently livestock water productivity compares favourably with crop water productivity in Africa. Yet, great opportunities remain to further reduce domestic animals' use of water in the continent. Integrating livestock and water planning, development and management has the potential to help reduce poverty, increase food production and reduce pressure on the environment including scarce water resources. Four strategies involving technology, policy and institutional interventions can help achieve this. They are choosing feeds that require relatively little water, conserving water resources through better animal and land management, applying well known tools from the animal sciences to increase animal production, and strategic temporal and spatial provisioning of drinking water. Achieving integrated livestock-water development will require new ways of thinking about, and managing, water by water- and animal-science professionals.";"Peden, D.

AgriPoliS focuses on the socio-economic dimension of multifunctionality at the individual farm and regional levels and explicitly models heterogeneous farms (in size, location and efficiency) within a competitive and dynamic environment. The linear-programming model MODAM allows a detailed representation of production processes and their impact on the environmental dimension of multifunctionality at the farm level. We simulate the impact of a uniform area payment and a fully decoupled single farm payment. Our case study region is the district Ostprignitz-Ruppin in Brandenburg. Results show that the decoupling schemes create a trade-off between the NCO’s and that adjustment reactions differ between farms depending on their legal form, size, and production.";"Happe, Kathrin

"AGRIS:US201500082347";"Implications of land-cover types for soil erosion on semiarid mountain slopes: Towards sustainable land use in problematic landscapes";"";"The impact of land-cover types on soil erosion and runoff, as well as on physico-chemical soil properties, was monitored. The study area, an agroforestry landscape was located in Sierra Nevada Mountains in south-eastern Spain. Eight land-cover types were investigated: farmland planted with olive, almond, and cereals; forest with P. halepensis and P. sylvestris; shrubland; grassland; and abandoned farmland. The erosion plots replicated twice were located on hillslopes, where erosion and runoff were measured after 22 storm events. Forest dominated by Pinus stands exhibited significantly the lowest amounts of erosion and runoff, contrasting with abandoned farmland. Olive had higher erosion than did almond, cereals, or grasslands, but with the highest runoff rate under almond groves. The erosion and runoff response to shrubland showed an intermediate situation between forest and farmland–grassland uses. Under forest and shrubland, better soil properties were determined, especially higher organic C and total N, and lower soil-bulk density. Erosion was highly dependent on runoff, bulk density, soil organic C, and the degree of soil surface covered. Thus, the alteration in land cover is essential to an understanding of productivity of soil undergoing erosion, as sustainable planning can mitigate soil-degradation processes in the overall agroforestry landscape.";"Durán-Zuazo, Víctor Hugo

This study's goal was to map and monitor cheatgrass performance to identify where and when cheatgrass dieoff occurred in the Northern Great Basin and to discover how this phenomenon was affected by climatic, topographic, and edaphic variables. We also examined how fire affected cheatgrass performance. Land managers and scientists are concerned by cheatgrass dieoff because it can increase land degradation, and its causes and effects are not fully known. To better understand the scope of cheatgrass dieoff, we developed multiple ecological models that integrated remote sensing data with geophysical and biophysical data. The models' R² ranged from 0.71 to 0.88, and their root mean squared errors (RMSEs) ranged from 3.07 to 6.95. Validation of dieoff data showed that 41% of pixels within independently developed dieoff polygons were accurately classified as dieoff, whereas 2% of pixels outside of dieoff polygons were classified as dieoff. Site potential, a long-term spatial average of cheatgrass cover, dominated the development of the cheatgrass performance model. Fire negatively affected cheatgrass performance 1 year postfire, but by the second year postfire performance exceeded prefire levels. The landscape-scale monitoring study presented in this paper helps increase knowledge about recent rangeland dynamics, including where cheatgrass dieoffs occurred and how cheatgrass responded to fire. This knowledge can help direct further investigation and/or guide land management activities that can capitalize on, or mitigate the effects of, cheatgrass dieoff.";"Boyte, Stephen P.

Some mined sites reclaimed to pasture are being converted to forests. In the spring of 2001, we compared the establishment and growth of five hardwood tree species on a reclaimed West Virginaia surface mine with compacted soils and a heavy grass groundcover. We planted 1-yr-old seedlings of five species (black cherry [Prunus serotina Ehrh.], red oak [Quercus rubra L.], yellow poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera L.], black walnut [Juglans nigra L.], and white ash [Fraxinus americana L.]) into sites that were mowed and unmowed on north- and south-facing aspects. We applied a ripping treatment, which loosened the compacted soils and disturbed the heavy ground cover. First year results showed >80% survival for all species. After 7 yr black cherry survival averaged 36%, red oak 47%, yellow poplar 66%, black walnut 80%, and white ash 98% across all sites and treatments. Seedling survival was best on north, unmowed, and ripped areas. Average growth (height x diameter2) of trees after 7 yr was greatest with white ash (434 cm3), followed by yellow poplar (256 cm3) and black walnut (138 cm3), then by black cherry (31 cm3) and red oak (27 cm3). Browsing by wildlife had a negative impact on tree growth especially on south aspect sites. Overall, mowing reduced survival of black cherry, red oak, and yellow poplar, but not for black walnut and white ash. Ripping increased survival of black cherry, red oak, and yellow poplar. Growth of all species was improved with ripping. Using inverse linear-quadratic plateau models, the time required for tree survival to stabilize varied from 1 yr for white ash to 6 to 9 yr for the other species.";"Skousen, Jeff

"AGRIS:US201500015705";"methodological approach for deriving regional crop rotations as basis for the assessment of the impact of agricultural strategies using soil erosion as example";"";"Regarding increasing pressures by global societal and climate change, the assessment of the impact of land use and land management practices on land degradation and the related decrease in sustainable provision of ecosystem services gains increasing interest. Existing approaches to assess agricultural practices focus on the assessment of single crops or statistical data because spatially explicit information on practically applied crop rotations is mostly not available. This provokes considerable uncertainties in crop production models as regional specifics have to be neglected or cannot be considered in an appropriate way. In a case study in Saxony, we developed an approach to (i) derive representative regional crop rotations by combining different data sources and expert knowledge. This includes the integration of innovative crop sequences related to bio-energy production or organic farming and different soil tillage, soil management and soil protection techniques. Furthermore, (ii) we developed a regionalization approach for transferring crop rotations and related soil management strategies on the basis of statistical data and spatially explicit data taken from so called field blocks. These field blocks are the smallest spatial entity for which agricultural practices must be reported to apply for agricultural funding within the frame of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) program. The information was finally integrated into the spatial decision support tool GISCAME to assess and visualize in spatially explicit manner the impact of alternative agricultural land use strategies on soil erosion risk and ecosystem services provision. Objective of this paper is to present the approach how to create spatially explicit information on agricultural management practices for a study area around Dresden, the capital of the German Federal State Saxony.";"Lorenz, Marco

"AGRIS:US201500163284";"Assessment of landscape aesthetics—Validation of a landscape metrics-based assessment by visual estimation of the scenic beauty";"";"The assessment of cultural ecosystem services, in our case landscape aesthetics, is the most commonly investigated but least formalized issue in the scope of the ecosystem services concept. In contrast to ecological or economic aspects, the assessment of aesthetics cannot easily be based on quantitative information. Therefore, two different methodological approaches that assess landscape aesthetics either from an objective or a subjective point of view have been established in the past. This article presents in its first part an objective, landscape metrics-based assessment approach. We defined naturalness and landscape diversity as assessment criteria and selected Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI), Shape Index (SHAPE) and Patch Density (PD) as indicators. We tested our approach for a set of nine different landscape types in a model region in Saxony, Germany. For validating the developed methodology, we carried out a survey with 153 participants in order to investigate their subjective preferences for the different landscape types. These preferences had to be expressed by rating the landscape types on a scale from 1 (very ugly) to 5 (very beautiful). The study was based on three different data sets, namely photographs of the landscape types, satellite images, and land cover maps. Statistical tests were applied (a) to investigate the impact of personal factors on the ratings, (b) to detect whether abstraction levels are suitable for preference studies, and (c) to compare the results of the objective approach (landscape metrics) and the subjective approach (visual assessment). Personal factors did not influence the visual assessment results significantly. We found the highest correlation of the landscape metrics-based assessment with the visual assessment results of the photographs. We conclude that the three landscape metrics might be applied to the monitoring of landscape aesthetics. An extended study with more participants might be useful to further investigate the reliability of our findings.";"Frank, Susanne

Hydrological regime and riparian land use cause well-documented changes in riverine larval invertebrate communities. Using a dataset from 66 sites collected over 20 years, we showed that such effects led to spatial and temporal differences in the density and type of larvae with winged adults within a river reach, altering the size and composition of the source pool from which adult aquatic insects can emerge. Mean annual larval densities varied 33-fold and the temporal range varied more than 20-fold between sites, associated with the hydrological regime and land cover and antecedent high and low flows, respectively. Densities of larvae with winged adults were greater in sites that had more algal coverage, agricultural land use, seasonally predictable flow regimes and faster water velocities. More interestingly, by influencing larval communities, riparian land use and the magnitude and frequency of high and low flows affected the size structure, dispersal ability and longevity of adults available to emerge from river reaches, potentially influencing the spatial extent and type of terrestrial consumers supported by aquatic prey. This suggests that anthropogenic alterations to land use or river flows will have both spatial and temporal effects on the flux and potential availability of adult aquatic insects to terrestrial consumers in many rivers.";"Greenwood, M.

Based on the finalyearly reports of the enterprises it is shown, that in Russia five earning ratios can be distinguished:the gross profit, the profit on sales, the profit before taxes, the profit on ordinaryactivity, and the net profit. The gross profit and the profit on sales are similar for all testedenterprises. Therefore, in this article only the gross profit, or the profitability of the grossprofit are discussed. For the year 2000, the average profitability of the gross profit of the examinedenterprises amounted to 2,0 %. The profitability on the basis of the profit before taxeswas 6,4 %, the profitability of the profit on ordinary activity -9,8 %, and the profitability ofthe net profit amounted to -16,0 %. When compared with the profit before taxes, the reducedprofit on ordinary activity is caused by taxes and similar tributes which are notably higher thanthe governmental subsidies granted to the enterprises. The extremely low profitability rate of-16 % based on the net profit is additionally influenced by extraordinary tributes, caused bylocusts in this case.However, if the enterprises would not have costs for supporting the households, and if thegovernment would assume the costs for the social infrastructure of the village, a duty it is incharge of by law, all four earning ratios would be positive: 26,4 %; 31,8 %; 11,8 %; 4,1 % respectively.The regression analyses show that the earning and the profitability ratios are positively influencedby the material factors fuel consumption, number of cows and milking performance per cow and year. In contrast, the number of tractors and, for net profit, the number of permanentemployees have a negative effect on these parameters. The regression analyses based on financialfactors demonstrate the significant positive or respectively negative influence of theproceeds and the costs. Furthermore, there are veritable positive effects of subsidies andnegative influences of taxes and extraordinary tributes. Detailed consideration of costs showsthat material usage have positive, and amortisation and remuneration of work negative effects.As particularly shown by the factor and cluster analyses, the profits decline with increasing grassland and forest area.";"Schulze, Eberhard

Even with low use of crop residue mulching (0.2 kg/m2), CT has considerable potential for adoption in these areas, once technical issues such as supply of appropriate machinery, weed control, and the competing use of the maize residue for forage have been resolved. Even under wetter conditions, CT resulted in acceptable yields which, when considered with its cost savings and long-term benefits to the soil, make it attractive.";"Scopel, E.

"AGRIS:US2016209142";"Diffusion of Bt Cotton in India: Impact of Seed Prices and Technological Development";"";"Recent studies in the literature examining impact of government seed price intervention on adoption of Bt cotton get different results depending on the specifics of the situation analyzed. According to one study, reduction in seed prices enables farmers to buy seeds at lower prices and this can result in surge of area sown under Bt cotton. The other view holds that seed price interventions have little impact on the adoption rates rather these interventions may adversely affect firms’ incentives to innovate. Which of the two views characterize adoption of Bt cotton in India? Using three variations of dynamic logistic model, this paper analyzes the impact of certain economic factors like seed prices, technological development, and cotton prices on the diffusion of Bt cotton in India. It uses panel data set covering 9 major cotton growing states over the years 2002 to 2008 and finds that although seed prices were significant in impacting the diffusion rates, its impact was limited. The study also sheds light on the significance of technological development in impacting diffusion rates.";"Arora, Anchal

"AGRIS:US201400140684";"Natural and human-induced environmental changes in Eastern Europe during the Holocene: a multi-proxy palaeolimnological study of a small Latvian lake in a humid temperate zone";"";"This study uses the Holocene lake sediment of Lake Ķūži (Latvia, Vidzeme Heights) for environmental reconstruction with multi-proxy records including lithology, computerised axial tomography scan, grain-size analysis, geochemistry, diatoms and macrofossils, supported by AMS radiocarbon dating. Numerical analyses (PCA; CONISS) reveal three main phases in the development of the lake. Response to the Lateglacial–Holocene transition in Lake Ķūži took place around 11,300 cal. BP. Organogenic sedimentation started with distinctive 5-cm-thick peat layer and was followed by lacustrine sedimentation of carbonaceous gyttja. Several findings of the peat layer with similar dated age and position at different absolute altitudes indicate that lake basin was formed by glaciokarstic processes. In the Early Holocene (until around 8,500 cal. BP), the lake was shallow and holomictic, surrounded by unstable catchment with erosion and inflow events. Predominance of diatom species of Cyclotella and Tabellaria, large numbers of respiratory horns of phantom midge pupae (Chaoboridae), high Fe/Mn ratio, as well as the presence of laminated sediments indicates the transition to a dimictic and oligo-mesotrophic lake conditions with high water level, anoxia in the near-bottom and stable catchment in the Middle Holocene (8,500–2,000 cal. BP). This contrasts with many hydrologically sensitive lakes in Northern and Eastern Europe in which the water level fell several meters during this period. During the Late Holocene (from 2,000 cal. BP to the present), the lithological and biotic variables reveal major changes, such as the increase in erosion (coarser grain-size fraction) and eutrophication [diatoms Aulacoseira ambigua (Grun.) Sim., Stephanodiscus spp., Cyclostephanos dubius (Fricke) Round]. Characteristics of lake-catchment system during the Late Holocene reflect anthropogenic signal superimposed on the natural forcing factors. To date, the Late Quaternary palaeolimnological reconstructions using lake sediment has been limited in the Baltic region. Therefore, findings from Lake Ķūži provide important information about environmental and climatic changes that took place in this part of Eastern Europe. This study shows that the relative importance of climate and local factors has varied over the time and it is essential to consider the lake basin topography, catchment size and land cover as potential dominant forcing factors for changes in sedimentary signal.";"Terasmaa, Jaanus

Ninety-nine of these A-lines and their counterpart B-lines developed during 1981-2004 were evaluated for 26 morphological traits using DUS descriptors in two seasons (postrainy season 2005 and rainy season 2005) at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India. The purpose of this morphological characterization was to present comparative descriptions of these lines to facilitate their selection and use by hybrid programs of NARS and the private sector, and also to document them as a prior art to protect from any possible infringement. Parentage ofthese lines revealed diverse germplasm base as 52 of these had some component of germplasm and/or composite in their parentage, while remaining 47 lines were developed from crosses between elite parental lines. This resulted in large diversity among the lines observed for all the traits. Some A/B pairs showed significant differences between them for some of the quantitative characters in the same season as well as in different seasons. Similarly A- and B-Iines also had differences for some qualitative traits within the same season and across the seasons. Differences were also observed in B-lines across the replications as well as within the lines for some qualitative traits. This paper, apart from characterizing the morphological characters, discusses the probable reasons for variability in expression of characters with respect to AlB pairs in the same season or different seasons, and also within-line and across replications, and its implications for Intellectual Property Rights protection.";"KN Rai

We examine factors that influence the shift in aspirations in five slum settlements using data from 500 interviews conducted in serviced and non-serviced slums from the state of Gujarat in India. The non-serviced slums did not have access to basic services namely water, sanitation, energy, roads, solid waste and rainwater management. We find empirical evidence which suggests that when basic infrastructure provisions are met, slum dwellers shift their focus from lower order aspirations to the higher order aspirations like health, education, housing and land ownership. We argue that energy provision enhances productivity and enables slum dwellers to shift their aspirations upwards. Furthermore, we test the effect of work days lost due to illness on the relationship between higher order aspirations and aspirations for energy provision. When provision of energy is low, higher work day loss dampens higher order aspirations. For policy makers, this study highlights the critical link between the infrastructure services preferred by slum dwellers and their social aspirations for growth.";"Parikh, Priti

This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District.

"AGRIS:US201600130957";"Constraints of philanthropy on determining the distribution of biodiversity conservation funding";"";"Caught between ongoing habitat destruction and funding shortfalls, conservation organizations are using systematic planning approaches to identify places that offer the highest biodiversity return per dollar invested. However, available tools do not account for the landscape of funding for conservation or quantify the constraints this landscape imposes on conservation outcomes. Using state‐level data on philanthropic giving to and investments in land conservation by a large nonprofit organization, we applied linear regression to evaluate whether the spatial distribution of conservation philanthropy better explained expenditures on conservation than maps of biodiversity priorities, which were derived from a planning process internal to the organization and return on investment (ROI) analyses based on data on species richness, land costs, and existing protected areas. Philanthropic fund raising accounted for considerably more spatial variation in conservation spending (r² = 0.64) than either of the 2 systematic conservation planning approaches (r² = 0.08–0.21). We used results of one of the ROI analyses to evaluate whether increases in flexibility to reallocate funding across space provides conservation gains. Small but plausible “tax” increments of 1–10% on states redistributed to the optimal funding allocation from the ROI analysis could result in gains in endemic species protected of 8.5–80.2%. When such increases in spatial flexibility are not possible, conservation organizations should seek to cultivate increased support for conservation in priority locations. We used lagged correlations of giving to and spending by the organization to evaluate whether investments in habitat protection stimulate future giving to conservation. The most common outcome at the state level was that conservation spending quarters correlated significantly and positively with lagged fund raising quarters. In effect, periods of high fund raising for biodiversity followed (rather than preceded) periods of high expenditure on land conservation projects, identifying one mechanism conservation organizations could explore to seed greater activity in priority locations. Our results demonstrate how limitations on the ability of conservation organizations to reallocate their funding across space can impede organizational effectiveness and elucidate ways conservation planning tools could be more useful if they quantified and incorporated these constraints.";"Larson, Eric R.

"AGRIS:US2016201585";"An Empirical Examination of Real Options and the Timing of Land Conversions";"";"Many studies have examined the effects of land use regulations on land prices and urban spatial form.  Increasingly, jurisdictions have adopted incentive based mechanisms, such as purchase of development rights (PDR) programs, to manage the pace and pattern of urban growth and the conversion of agricultural land.  PDR programs provide a third option to landowners in urbanizing areas:  in addition to deciding whether to develop or not, landowners can decide whether to preserve their land.  To our knowledge no studies have explored how the existence of an option to participate in a PDR program affects landowners' development decisions.  This research provides empirical evidence of a previously untested prediction of real options theory:  that additional options increase the value of waiting to make irreversible decisions.  Our paper considers how an additional land use alternative, preservation, conveys a different type of option value and how that option affects the optimal conversion time.  We estimate a hazard model and find significant evidence that the option to enter an easement decreases the hazard rate of development by about 40%.  The results suggest that PDR programs can provide additional open space and amenity values beyond what is provided on preserved parcels, by delaying development (by at least a few years) of parcels that are not actually preserved.";"Towe, Charles A.

Vidéken a föld racionális használata megkerülhetetlen. A kritikus gazdasági helyzetű térségekben a mezőgazdasági tevékenység – mint a megélhetés egyetlen forrása – felértékelődik. Az intenzív kultúrák versenyképességének fokozása mellett kiemelt fontosságú a foglalkoztatás. Indokolt a zöldség-gyümölcstermelés és az állattenyésztés arányának növelése. A mezőgazdaság szerkezetváltása részben az energetikai célú termelés, részben az integrált és ökológiai gazdálkodás irányába is kívánatos. Az öntözött terület arányának növelése is szükséges, hiszen jelenleg csak a termőterület 1 százalékát öntözik. Új stratégiát több körülmény is indokol, így többek között a foglalkoztatás mellett az, hogy a területi és munkatermelékenységi mutatók hazánkban az EU fejlett mezőgazdasággal rendelkező államaihoz képest csak 35-45%-ot érnek el. A gazdasági teljesítmények növelésének feltétele, hogy együtt jár az erőforrások fenntartható használatával, a hulladéktermelés csökkentésével, a biodiverzitás és az ökoszisztémák megőrzésével. A fenntartható fejlődés indikátorainak figyelemmel kísérésével a változások a jelenlegi gyakorlattól eltérően objektívebben értékelhetők. A hatékonyság és versenyképesség javítása önmagában nem elégséges, mert a népességmegtartás, a környezet- és tájvédelem stb. is egyenrangú célnak tekintendők. -------------------------------------------------- The economic development of our society relies on the use of natural resources. Effectiveness of the land ownership and land use system is at the focus of attention both in Hungary and the EU. Land estate structure and land use have a decisive effect on the profitability of farming operations. The Government intends to set up the National Land Fund to eliminate land speculation. Rational land use is essential in the countryside. Appreciation for agriculture - as the only source of living - is increasing in regions where the economic situation is critical. Apart from improving the competitiveness of intensive crops, employment is a key issue. The share of fruit and vegetable production as well as animal husbandry should be increased. A structural shift towards energy crop production on one hand and towards integrated and ecological farming on the other hand is desirable in agriculture. The share of irrigated lands should also be increased, as currently only 1 percent of arable land is irrigated. Various facts give rise to the need for a new strategy; in addition to the issue of employment, they include the fact that Hungary’s regional and work productivity parameters are only 35-45% of the figures characterising the Member States with developed agriculture. The improvement of economic performance should be accompanied by the sustainable use of resources, reduction of waste produced, and the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems. Changes could be assessed in a more objective manner than it is being done today by monitoring the indices of sustainable development.  Improving efficiency and competitiveness is not sufficient in itself because retaining the population, protecting the environment and landscape etc. should be considered equally important goals.";"Magda, Sandor

Little is known about their habitat requirements, particularly in South Asia. Identifying Pteropus habitat preferences could assist in understanding the risk of zoonotic disease transmission broadly and, in Bangladesh, could help explain the spatial distribution of human Nipah virus cases. We analysed characteristics of Pteropus giganteus roosts and constructed an ecological niche model to identify suitable habitat in Bangladesh. We also assessed the distribution of suitable habitat in relation to the location of human Nipah virus cases. Compared to non‐roost trees, P.� giganteus roost trees are taller with larger diameters and are more frequently canopy trees. Colony size was larger in densely forested regions and smaller in flood‐affected areas. Roosts were located in areas with lower annual precipitation and higher human population density than non‐roost sites. We predicted that 2–17% of Bangladesh's land area is suitable roosting habitat. Nipah virus outbreak villages were 2·6 times more likely to be located in areas predicted as highly suitable habitat for P.� giganteus compared to non‐outbreak villages. Synthesis and applications. Habitat suitability modelling may help identify previously undocumented Nipah outbreak locations and improve our understanding of Nipah virus ecology by highlighting regions where there is suitable bat habitat but no reported human Nipah virus. Conservation and public health education is a key component of P.� giganteus management in Bangladesh due to the general misunderstanding and fear of bats that are a reservoir of Nipah virus. Affiliation between Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and people is common throughout their range, and in order to conserve these keystone bat species and prevent emergence of zoonotic viruses, it is imperative that we continue to improve our understanding of Pteropus resource requirements and routes of virus transmission from bats to people. Results presented here can be utilized to develop land management strategies and conservation policies that simultaneously protect fruit bats and public health.";"Hahn, Micah B.

"AGRIS:US201500209289";"Modern warfare as a significant form of zoogeomorphic disturbance upon the landscape";"";"The damage exerted by warfare on the physical landscape is one, of many, anthropogenic impacts upon the environment. Bombturbation is a term that describes the impacts of explosive munitions upon the landscape. Bombturbation, like many other forms of zoogeomorphology, is a disruptive force, capable of moving large amounts of sediments, and denuding landscapes to the point where changes in micro and mesotopography have long-term implications. The long term implication of bombturbative actions depends on the type and duration of explosive device that rendered the disturbance, and the geographic context of the landscape disturbed; i.e. cultural and physical factors. Recovery from bombturbative activity, in the context of this research, is measured by vegetative regrowth and soil development in cratered disturbances. A comparison and contrast between the two battlefields of Verdun, France and Khe Sanh, Vietnam show that bombturbative actions have significantly altered the topography at each location, thus influencing surface runoff and processes of soil development. Principals of the Runge pedogenic model, or the energy of water moving through the soil profile, best explain how the varying climate and parent material at each location influence post disturbance soil development rates. Whereas the data collected at Verdun suggest that explosive munitions have put that landscape on diverging path of development, thus rendering it much different post-disturbance landscape, Khe Sanh displays much different recovery patterns. Preliminary research at Khe Sanh indicates that reforestation and soil development following disturbance are not so much influenced by bombturbative patterns as land use activities in the area of study.";"Hupy, Joseph P.

"AGRIS:US201400091220";"Pollinator body size mediates the scale at which land use drives crop pollination services";"";"Ecosystem services to agriculture, such as pollination, rely on natural areas adjacent to farmland to support organisms that provide services. Native insect pollinators depend on natural or semi‐natural land surrounding farms for nesting and alternative foraging resources. Despite interest in conserving pollinators through habitat restoration, the scale at which land use affects pollinators and thus crop pollination services is not well understood. We measured abundance of native, wild bee pollinators and the pollination services they provided to highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. crops at 16 sites that varied in the proportion of surrounding agricultural land cover at both the field scale (300‐m radius) and the landscape scale (1500‐m radius). We designed our study such that agricultural land cover at the field scale was uncorrelated with agricultural cover at the landscape scale across sites. We used model selection to determine which spatial scale better predicted aggregate bee abundance, abundance of large versus small bees and crop pollination services. We found that, overall, bees responded more strongly to field‐scale than to landscape‐scale land cover, but the scale at which land cover had the strongest effect varied by bee body size. Large bees showed a negative response to increasing agricultural cover at both scales, but were most strongly affected by the landscape scale. Small bees were negatively affected by agricultural land cover but only at the field scale, while they had a small positive response to agricultural cover at the landscape scale. Aggregate pollination services from native bees were more strongly influenced by field‐scale agricultural cover, due to the combined effects of both large and small bees responding at that scale. Synthesis and applications. Bee abundance and pollination services were strongly determined by field‐scale agricultural cover, suggesting that field‐scale set‐asides may provide significant benefits to pollination services. Further, we found that pollinators respond differently to land use depending on body size, but all groups of bees benefit from decreasing agricultural cover at the field scale. Therefore, small‐scale modifications to habitat can have significant impacts on both pollinator abundance and pollination services to crop plants.";"E. Benjamin, Faye

However, most information on the effects of vegetation changes on ecosystem C stocks originates from low-elevation studies on reforestation or early successional forests, and little is known about how these stocks change during long-term secondary forest succession and at high elevation. We assessed aboveground, belowground, and ecosystem organic matter and C stocks in high-elevation ecosystems that represent the long-term development (centuries) following land abandonment: short- and tall-grass pastures, Swiss mountain pine (Pinus mugo Turra), mixed-conifer, and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) -- European larch (Larix decidua P. Mill.) forests. Aboveground C stocks were lowest in the short-grass pastures (0.1 Mg C·ha-1) and reached a maximum in the mixed-conifer and stone pine - larch forests (166 Mg C·ha-1). Belowground C stocks did not differ among the ecosystems studied. We only detected ecosystem C sequestration during reforestation; whereas no significant differences in ecosystem C stocks were found during long-term secondary forest development. Our calculations showed that only an additional 1733-3032 Mg C·year-1 would be sequestered owing to natural reforestation in high-elevation Switzerland, which likely can be considered negligible compared with total annual C sequestration calculated for Swiss forests in other studies.";"Risch, A.C.

There is variation in the presence of remnant native vegetation across land tenure, agronomic potential and from site-specific historical events. Even when there is an increase in native vegetation on farmland, it is uncertain how different landholders perceive this change and the extent to which environmental programs influence their management. This research explores the scale on which different landholders were increasing native vegetation on their properties; and the influence of environmental programs on landholders’ efforts to increase native vegetation. Combined qualitative and quantitative data reveal that a wide range of landholders is making considerable effort to increase the scale of native vegetation on their properties; however an increase in the extent of native vegetation in the wider district, particularly by natural regeneration, is not always viewed favourably by some landholders; and environmental programs remain an important catalyst across a spectrum of landholders for the management of native vegetation. The findings and the implications for natural resource management in the Australian context are discussed, particularly in relation to improving understanding of how to engage landholders to restore native vegetation on farmland.";"Race, D.

"AGRIS:US2016200215";"DOES THE FARM SECTOR HAVE A CRITICAL MASS?";"";"We examine if the farm sector has a critical mass.  If a critical mass of farmland acres is needed to sustain a viable agricultural sector, agriculture profits may decline once a region has dropped below this threshold, causing the rate of farmland loss to accelerate.  Agricultural census and population and housing census data were assembled as a panel by county and five-year time periods for the 50-year period (1949-1997) for six Mid-Atlantic States.  Three random effects models were estimated. The general model indicates that having less than 189,240 harvested cropland acres accelerates a county's rate of farmland loss.  As acres increase by 10% (5,400 acres), the 5-year loss rate decreases from the predicted 7.9% to 7.67%.  As sales and percent change in income increase, the rate of farmland loss also decreases.  The rate falls with the introduction of a preferential taxation program.  As expenses, population density, percent change in total housing units, and percent unemployment increase, the rate of farmland loss accelerates.  The rate accelerates if the county is metropolitan.  Yet when the data is divided into an early (pre-1978) and late (post-1978) period, this threshold effect disappears in the later period.  The earlier model's results are similar but in the later period, increases in population density and sales, increase the rate of loss.  Conversely and counter-intuitively, as expenses increase, the rate of loss decreases.  Apparently, even if a threshold existed, our results suggest it might dissipate overtime.";"Lynch, Lori

Addressing this decline requires, in part, understanding how landholders perceive and manage scattered trees. We explored this via a quantitative survey of landholders in the Lachlan catchment of New South Wales. Although landholders are typically aware that scattered trees are declining more rapidly than other trees on the land they manage, they are less likely to actively encourage their regeneration compared to other trees. Landholders believe scattered trees have many private and public benefits, although they often believe their public benefits are lower than those provided by long strips or large patches of trees. Landholders who undertake mixed grazing and cropping are less likely than those who focus solely on grazing to actively encourage regeneration of scattered trees, and more likely to view them as impacting negatively on their agricultural enterprise. Reversing scattered tree decline requires programs to both increase landholder awareness of their public benefits and to address the specific land management constraints faced by different types of landholders when considering protecting and regenerating scattered trees.";"Schirmer, J.

Given the identified gaps in Landsat data and the undetermined future status of Landsat data availability, alternatives to Landsat imagery need to be tested in an operational environment. In this study, forest land cover and crown closure maps generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and System Pour 1'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) data were compared to Landsat-based map products currently in use by the grizzly bear habitat-mapping program. Overall accuracies greater than 85% were obtained for both ASTER- and SPOT-based land cover maps. The ASTER and SPOT classification accuracies were higher than that achieved by Landsat. Crown closure maps derived from ASTER and SPOT data show a small increase in accuracy when compared to the Landsat products.

The 13 species include 11 broadleaf and two conifer species. Three different techniques, segmented canonical discriminant analysis (CDA), segmented principal component analysis (PCA) and segmented stepwise discriminate analysis (SDA), were applied and compared for dimension reduction and feature extraction. With each of the three techniques, 10 features were extracted or selected from four spectral regions, visible (VIS: 1412–1797 nm), near-infrared (NIR: 707–1352 nm), mid-infrared 1 (MIR1: 1412–1797 nm) and mid-infrared 2 (MIR2: 1942–2400 nm), and used to discriminate the 13 urban tree species with a linear discriminate analysis (LDA) method. The cross-validation results, based on training samples that were used in the feature reduction step, and the results calculated from the test samples were used for evaluating the ability of the in situ hyperspectral data and performance of the segmented CDA, PCA and SDA to identify the 13 tree species. The experimental results indicate that a satisfactory discrimination of the 13 tree species was achieved using the segmented CDA technique (average accuracy (AA) = 96%, overall accuracy (OAA) = 96% and kappa = 0.958 from the cross-validation results; AA = 90%, OAA = 90% and kappa = 0.896 from the test samples) compared to the segmented PCA and SDA techniques, respectively (AA = 76% and 86%, OAA = 78% and 87%, and kappa = 0.763 and 0.857 from the cross-validation results; AA = 79% and 88%, OAA = 80% and 89%, and kappa = 0.782 and 0.879 from the test samples). In this study, the segmented CDA transformation is effective for dimension reduction and feature extraction for species discrimination with a relatively limited number of training samples. It outperformed the segmented PCA and SDA methods and produced the highest accuracies. The NIR and MIR1 regions have greater power for identifying the 13 species compared to the VIS and MIR2 spectral regions. The results indicate that CDA or segmented CDA could be applied broadly in mapping forest cover types, species identification and/or other land use/land cover classification practices with hyperspectral remote sensing data.";"Pu, Ruiliang

For accurate quantification and fast identification of agricultural land cover areas from the imagery, a hybrid method, which combines automated clustering of self-organizing maps with object based image analysis, and called SOM+OBIA, is proposed. Performance analysis on three test zones (using multi-temporal Rapideye imagery) indicates that for the basic land cover categories (forest, water, vegetated areas, bare areas and sealed surfaces), unsupervised classification with the proposed SOM+OBIA method achieves an identification accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the traditional interactive object oriented analysis, with considerably less user interaction.";"Taşdemir, Kadim

In South Africa rising wealth, urbanisation and a growing middle class means South Africans are eating more processed and high-protein foods, especially meat and dairy products. These foods are more land- and water-intensive than fruit, vegetable and grain crops, and further stress existing resources. Traditional agricultural farms cannot keep up with the increasing demand for animal products and these farms are being replaced with concentrated animal feeding operations. There are a wide variety of problems caused by intensive livestock production. The concerns regarding factory farming in South Africa are social issues affecting food security, health concerns, environmental concerns and ethical concerns. In order to ensure food security in future we need to consider these concerns and support more sustainable systems to produce our food. Animal agriculture, like many other industries, works on the principles of supply and demand. By decreasing the demand for these products, we can decrease their production. Individuals can do this by becoming vegetarian or vegan, but also by simply cutting down one’s consumption of meat, eggs, and milk produced in intensive livestock farms. Less meat would be produced, and there would be less harm to local communities, lower risk of zoonotic disease outbreaks, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, less land degradation and decrease of biodiversity, less damage to our water supplies and fewer animals living lives of suffering in factory farms.";"Jankielsohn, Astrid";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"urbanization;food security;land degradation";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600089892";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-015-9581-8";"";"";"";"1145-1157"

The model is used annually to estimate average land values by county, based on the value of production from cropland and non-cropland. The county land values developed from this procedure form the basis for the 2005 valuation of agricultural land for real estate tax assessment. The average ""all land value"" from this analysis is multiplied by the total acres of agricultural land on the county abstract to determine each county's total agricultural land value for taxation purposes. The State Board of Equalization compares this value with the total value assessed to agricultural property in each county. Each county is required by state statute to assess a total value of agricultural property within 5 percent of this value. 

The average value per acre of all agricultural land in North Dakota increased by 7.8 percent based on the value of production. Cropland value increased by 8.24 percent and non-cropland value increased by 5.1 percent. The formula capitalization rate was below the minimum set by the State Legislature, therefore the minimum rate of 8.9 percent was used.

LOCATION: East Usambara Mountains, Eastern Arc Mountains, Tanzania. METHODS: We surveyed three chameleon species (Rhampholeon spinosus, Rhampholeon temporalis and Trioceros deremensis) along 32.2� km of transects and used a hierarchical, distance‐sampling model to estimate densities. The model included habitat characteristics at the landscape (patch) and local (transect) scales while accounting for detectability. By analysing the model in a Bayesian framework, we were able to propagate error through the entire analysis and obtain exact solutions despite small sample sizes. We then used our estimated relationships between habitat and density to project chameleon population sizes across current and historical land cover maps of the study area (230� km²), giving an estimate of the impact of anthropogenic habitat alteration on these species. RESULTS: Species’ densities increased in larger patches and further from patch edges and varied seasonally. Local vegetation characteristics had significant relationships with expected chameleon densities, though effect sizes were small. Estimates of total current population sizes varied by two orders of magnitude among species, but each was 49–79% higher than detection‐naïve estimates. All three declined from estimated historical levels by approximately 60% in the study area, approximately one‐third more than would be expected from forest loss alone. Remaining populations of the study species are predominantly located in protected nature reserves, so the future of these species will likely be determined by the degree of protection offered by the nature reserves. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Habitat loss and fragmentation have greatly reduced forest‐dependent chameleon population sizes in the East Usambara Mountains. Populations of these species in other areas are experiencing higher rates of habitat loss. Efforts aimed at ensuring the efficacy of protected forests may be a key to conserving remaining populations.";"Shirk, Philip L.

Human activities, as outlined by the Department of Water Affairs resource directed measures (RDM) studies, and their associated land-cover classes are described. Possible links between catchment and buffer zone land-cover class composition and the health of the East Kleinemonde Estuary were explored. There was a relationship between catchment land-cover and estuarine health within all assessed catchment delineations. Natural land-cover was determined to be the best predictor of estuarine health for the East Kleinemonde system. The methods employed in this study can be applied to other temporarily open/closed estuaries in South Africa to prioritise these systems for rehabilitation and/or conservation.";"Masefield, VA

Pollination service in agroecosystems depends on several factors, including the land management systems used by farmers. Here we focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit production along a gradient of management systems in central Veracruz, Mexico. The gradient ranged from low environmental impact management systems (the native forest is not completely removed) to high environmental impact management systems (the native forest is completely removed). We hypothesized that pollinator diversity should be higher in low-impact systems. Then, if fruit production is positively related to pollinator diversity, plantations with low-impact management systems should display higher fruit production than plantations with high-impact management systems. We used observational and experimental data to test this hypothesis. Our results indicated that low-impact management systems have higher species richness and relative diversity (measured with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index) of pollinators than high-impact management systems. In all cases, fruit production was positively related with species richness and diversity of pollinators. Moreover, fruit production was higher in low-impact than in high-impact management systems. These results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers, and that such effects may have strong consequences on coffee fruit production.";"Vergara, Carlos H.

The results show a spatially coherent decrease of trace precipitation despite different reduction magnitudes among the regions. For measurable precipitation, significant regional and seasonal characteristics are observed. In autumn, the whole measurable precipitation decreased over Eastern China (east of 98°E). In summer and winter, a significant increase of heavy precipitation and decrease of light precipitation are detected south of Eastern China. In Western China, measurable precipitation is found to have increased in all four seasons. Composite analysis reveals a quasi-linear relationship between increasing surface temperature and precipitation on a global scale. The responses of precipitation at different intensities to the increased temperature are distinct, with a significant spectra-shifting from light to heavy precipitation. Compared with precipitation over the ocean, the amplification of heavy precipitation over land is relatively less, most likely constrained by the limited water supply. The response of regional precipitation to global warming shows greater uncertainties compared with those on the global scale, perhaps due to interference by more complex topography and land cover, as well as human activities, among other factors.";"Wu, FuTing

The institutional framework of the Galician floating raft culture in the mussel sector set up a scenario of institutional stability and equilibrium, in which new licenses were not granted and a winning coalition maintained the “status quo” from 1976 until 2008. Nevertheless, the two most important legal changes since the 90s took place in Galicia as of December 2008: the Fisheries Act 11/2008 and Act 6/2009 amending the former. Both Acts revoked the institutional framework provided by the Galician Fisheries Act of 1993. This paper presents an institutional economic analysis that studies the impact of the legal changes of 2008 and 2009 on the institutional foundations of the property rights system regarding the mussel floating rafts, and it constitutes a relevant case study on institutional stability in aquaculture production. The paper analyzes how the duration of property rights was extended with the “start counting from zero” formula and no change of status quo took place. The New Institutional Economics approach has provided the paper with a solid theoretical framework.";"Caballero-Miguez, Gonzalo

The study was conducted in the Tver region. The article proposes to determine the values of macroagrogeosystem production potential (PP) by calculating integrated productivity parameters of different locations. There were distinguished 11 types of landscapes within the Tver region. The values of integrated indices were calculated. Those indices reflect the influence on the PP of climatic (coefficient of favorable climate 1.26-1.40), index of matching the climatic conditions of the culture - 0.86-0.90 and soil specifics (index of soil 7.03-8.73 of different types of landscapes. While studying the variability of realization degree of PP (17.8-31.0 %) within the Tver region, there were revealed the nature and anthropogenic factors. The sets of soil-conservation measures on increasing the productivity of particular agrogeosystems include placing of herbage on fine-textured and deep moraine soils, involving hayfield in rotations, dual regulation of water-air regime of soil, and soil drainage. It is determined that agrolandscapes of the Upper Volga region differ in their natural environment, the value of PP (it ranges from 8.86 to 12.19 t/ha of air-dry biomass per year), and on character of measures for optimizing the production process. Schematic maps of the Tver region zoning by the degree of maximum PP in different landscapes and sets of measures for optimizing their production process have been constructed. There is made a conclusion about the opportunity of applying the tested methods for calculating to landscape macro unit conditions.

Multi-temporal satellite images pertaining to 1972, 1990, 2001 and 2011 were used to extract the shoreline. The High water line (HTL) is considered as shoreline and visual interpretation of satellite imageries has been carried out to demarcate the HTL based on various geomorphology and land use & land cover features. The present study used the Linear Regression Method (LRR) to calculate shoreline change rate. Based on the rate of shoreline changes, the coastal stretches of study area has been classified in to high erosion, low erosion, stable, low accretion and high accretion coast. The study found that about 69.31 % of the South Gujarat coast is eroding, about 18.40 % of coast is stable and remaining 12.28 % of the coast is accreting in nature. Field investigation was carried out which confirmed the coastal erosion/accretion derived from the analysis. The high erosion area are mostly found along the Umergaon (near Fansa, Maroli, Nargol, Varili river mouth, Umergaon light house) and Pardi (Kolak, Udwara)Taluka in Valsad district. Stable coastal length of the study area is 21.59 km and mostly found in Nani Dandi and near Onjal. High accretion (3.70 %) was only found near Hajira and low accretion (8.58 %) are distributed the study area. The main causes of coastal erosion of the study area were the strong tidal currents accompanied by wave action and reduced the sediment load of the river.";"Mahapatra, Manik

Government wildland fire policies and restoration programmes in dry western US forests are based on the hypothesis that high‐severity fire was rare in historical fire regimes, modern fire severity is unnaturally high and restoration efforts should focus primarily on thinning forests to eliminate high‐severity fire. Using General Land Office (GLO) survey data over large dry‐forest landscapes, we showed that the proportion of historical forest affected by high‐severity fire was not insignificant, fire severity has not increased as a proportion of total fire area and large areas of dense forest were present historically (Williams & Baker, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 21, 1042–1052, 2012; W&B). In response, Fulé et al. (Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2013, doi: 10.1111/geb.12136; FE) suggest that our inferences are unsupported and land management based on our research could be damaging to native ecosystems. Here, we show that the concerns of FE are unfounded. Their criticism comes from misquoting W&B, mistaking W&B's methods, misusing evidence (e.g. from Aldo Leopold) and missing substantial available evidence. We also update corroboration for the extensive historical high‐severity fire shown by W&B. We suggest that restoration programmes are misdirected in seeking to reduce all high‐severity fire in dry forests, given findings from spatially extensive GLO data and other sources.";"Williams, Mark A.

Although some studies exist reporting gross measures of soil microbial parameters and processes, limited information is available on how land degradation and restoration strategies influence the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities. In this study we compare the structure and diversity of bacterial communities in degraded and restored lands in Northeast Brazil and determine the soil biological and chemical properties influencing bacterial communities. We found that land degradation decreased the diversity of soil bacteria as indicated by both reduced operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness and Shannon index. Soils under native vegetation and restoration had significantly higher bacterial richness and diversity than degraded soils. Redundancy analysis revealed that low soil bacterial diversity correlated with a high respiratory quotient, indicating stressed microbial communities. By contrast, soil bacterial communities in restored land positively correlated with high soil P levels. Importantly, however, we found significant differences in the soil bacterial community composition under native vegetation and in restored land, which may indicate differences in their functioning despite equal levels of bacterial diversity.";"Araújo, Ademir Sérgio Ferreira

An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump‐shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta‐analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal‐area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.";"Stein, Anke

During an 8-year survey of 28 farms across the northeastern United States, we sampled the vegetation on 95 grazed plots, identifying 310 plant species, and collected data on topography, climate and soils. Landscape structure data were obtained from the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2001 for six radii (250-2,000 m) surrounding each site. The 500-m radius was most strongly related to plant community composition. Planned species composition was related only to site factors, while associated species were influenced by both site factors and landscape pattern. Species richness was unrelated to landscape structure for either group. Differing management effects on planned and associated species may explain the variation in their responses.

The main goal of this study was to analyze the ecosystem functions and services of Namatala wetland and their drivers of change, and to suggest directions for sustainable use. Data on climate, hydrology, water quality, population and land use were collected. Stakeholder workshops were organized at national and local levels to identify stakeholder interests in the wetland and conflicts. The institutional context for management of Namatala wetland was analyzed. A qualitative assessment of the ecosystem services was performed. All results were integrated into a DPSIR network showing the drivers of change, impact on ecosystem services and possible responses for management. Results show that the communities around Namatala wetland strongly depend on the wetland ecosystem for provisioning services. A spatial gradient in ecosystem services was observed. The upper, converted part of the wetland is more important for provisioning services while the lower, more intact wetland supports regulating and habitat ecosystem services. The institutional framework is complex due to the involvement of several ministries at the national level and several levels of decentralized, local government. Horizontal and vertical coordination of policy implementation is weak. There are diverging perceptions among stakeholders about the priority issues in wetland management. Resource users worry about water and land use conflicts, while local and national government agencies are more concerned about agricultural encroachment and biodiversity loss. There are also differences in interpretation of land ownership between the national wetland policy and local customary arrangements. For sustainable management of Namatala wetland, there is a need for more horizontal and vertical coordination in wetland policy implementation, application of sustainable agriculture and integrated water and nutrient management techniques, and continued monitoring, research and capacity building to support adaptive management.";"Namaalwa, S.

These areas are faced with increasing surface temperature arising mostly from human activities and other natural sources; hence land surface temperature has become an important variable in global climate change studies. In this paper, Landsat TM/ETM imagery acquired between 1997 and 2013 were used to extract ground brightness temperature and land use/land cover change in Kuala Lumpur metropolis. The main objective of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of quantifying UHI effects, in space and time, using remote sensing data and, also, to find the relationship between UHI and land use change. Four land use types (forest, farmland, built-up area and water) were classified from the Landsat images using maximum likelihood classification technique. The result reveals that Greater KL experienced an increase in average temperature from 312.641°K to 321.112°K which was quite eminent with an average gain in surface temperature of 8.4717°K. During the period of investigation (1997–2013), generally high temperature is been experienced mostly in concentrated built-up areas, the less concentrated have a moderate to intermediate temperature. Again, the study also shows that low and intermediate temperature classes loss more spatial extent from 2,246.89 Km² to 1,164.53 Km² and 6,102.42 Km² to 3,013.63 Km² and a gain of 4,165.963 Km² and 307.098 Km² in moderate and high temperature respectively from 1997 to 2013.

Improving connectivity is widely recommended to preserve the long-term viability of populations, but this requires accurate knowledge of how landscapes influence connectivity. Detectability of landscape effects on gene flow is highly dependent on landscape context, and drawing conclusions from single landscape studies may lead to ineffective management strategies. We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used GENELAND to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts. By integrating GENELAND and individual-based methods we effectively identified regional limiting factors that have landscape-level implications for population viability.";"Parks, Leslie C.

Few large‐scale studies have been devoted to analyse trends in land sensitivity to desertification in the northern Mediterranean basin. The present paper contributes to this deserving issue by quantifying the level of land sensitivity to desertification in Italy at seven points between 1960 and 2010 at a fine spatial scale. The approach used followed the Environmentally Sensitive Area scheme that assesses changes in four key themes (climate, soil, vegetation and land management) related to land degradation processes. Italian land was classified into four levels of sensitivity to desertification (non‐affected, potentially affected, fragile and critical) according to the Environmentally Sensitive Area framework. Interestingly, although land surface area classified as ‘fragile’ and ‘critical’ grew homogeneously in Italy between 1960 and 1990, the increase observed in the most recent time period was spatially clustered and contributed to reverse the polarisation in ‘structurally vulnerable’ and ‘non‐affected’ regions observed in Italy. The paper discussed these trends in the light of socioeconomic changes that occurred in Italy after World War II. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Salvati, Luca

"AGRIS:US201400148388";"Variation in the accuracy of thermal remote sensing";"";"Thermal infrared (TIR) remote-sensing techniques have been used to estimate land surface temperatures (LSTs) and to study the relationship between land uses and LSTs. Remotely sensed thermal data provide a time-synchronized dense grid of temperature data, and there has been a growing interest on LSTs in various fields, such as urban climatology and global environmental change. It is also important for urban planning and management practices to maintain thermally efficient urban structures. This article focuses on differences between the estimated LSTs and the measured temperatures. Three different methods, the Black Body method, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) Threshold method, and the US Geological Survey (USGS) method, are used to retrieve LSTs; how various land uses affect the accuracy of LSTs is also discussed. Landsat-5 data sets covering the Columbus Metropolitan Area (CMA) are used to obtain LSTs for six different dates between January 2005 and February 2006. The land-use map is derived from Landsat-5 data, dated 1 August 2005. Measured temperatures derived from the five measuring stations, located in or near the CMA, are used to compare with LSTs. The USGS method has the estimated temperatures that are close to the measured temperatures for most cases, and the LSTs in homogeneous areas, including green and agricultural areas, have temperatures closer to the measured temperatures. Statistical results of LSTs in six land uses for seven different dates are also displayed.";"Kim, Jun-Pill";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"urban planning;land use";"Urban Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400148388";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.713143";"";"";"";"729-750"

Despite this fact, limited information is documented with regard to SQ indicators, for example weed species, crop types and management practices from farmers' knowledge perspectives. The aims of this study are to analyse factors that determine farmers' knowledge of SQ, identify SQ indicators of weed species and crop types across different SQ status and assess soil‐and‐crop management practices that maintain SQ in the Mai‐Negus catchment, northern Ethiopia. Fifty‐two farmer household heads were chosen randomly for questionnaire interview. The results showed significant (p ≤ 0·05) differences in the proportion of respondents who used different crop‐and‐soil management practices. The success of overall prediction by the logistic regression model (model χ² = 0·84, p < 0·01) and level of model correct predictions (86%) indicated that the explanatory variables have sufficiently explained farmers' knowledge of SQ indicators. Provided that other conditions remained constant, the odds ratio of variables such as farmer experience, access to information, farm location, education, field slope and land tenure have significantly increased the likelihood of farmers for being knowledgeable of SQ indicators. This study also demonstrated that most farmers are knowledgeable in identifying weed species, crop types and management practices across various SQ status, which suggests that such SQ indicators should be used to assess SQ status (degradation severity) while locating fields to be intervened using appropriate management strategies. © 2013 The Authors.

In the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico City (MVMC) located in the high plateau of Mexico City and on former lakes, the dry out policies during the last 300 years have been counterproductive, causing scarcity, pollution, health and environmental problems, subsidence and water conflicts, particularly affecting social vulnerable people. Megacities require an integrated management of water and aquatic systems—integral water resource management, rainwater harvesting, maintenance and replacement of infrastructure, restoration of ecosystems and urban planning. This implies investments and a water culture including a transparent administration and peaceful negotiation of conflicts regarding concessions, access, and reuse of water allocation. Socio-political and environmental processes are complex; besides technical factors and ecosystem recovery, socio-cultural changes must transform human settlements and power structures.";"Oswald Spring, Úrsula";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"deforestation;urban planning;climate change";"Urban Tenure;Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400188654";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2011.11.002";"";"";"";"497-505"

Here, we measure soil respiration, water erosion, litterfall and estimate annual changes in C stored in mineral soil, litter and roots, in three representative land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem (late-successional forest, abandoned agricultural field, rain-fed olive grove), and use two C balance approaches (steady-state and non-steady-state) to estimate TBCA. Both TBCA approaches are compared to assess how different C fluxes (outputs and inputs) affect our estimates of TBCA within each land use. In addition, annual net primary productivity is determined and C allocation patterns are examined for each land use. We hypothesized that changes in C stored in mineral soil, litter and roots will be slight compared to soil respiration, but will still have a significant effect on the estimates of TBCA. Annual net primary productivity was 648 ± 31.5, 541 ± 42.3 and 324 ± 22.3 g C m−2 yr−1 for forest, abandoned agricultural field and olive grove, respectively. Across land uses, more than 60% of the C was allocated belowground. Soil respiration (FS) was the largest component in the TBCA approaches across all land uses. Annual C losses through water erosion were negligible compared to FS (less than 1%) and had little effect on the estimates of TBCA. Annual changes in C stored in the soil, litter layer and roots were low compared to FS (16, 24 and 10% for forest, abandoned agricultural field and olive grove, respectively), but had a significant effect on the estimates of TBCA. In our sites, an assumption that Δ[CS + CR + CL]/Δt = 0 will underestimate TBCA, particularly in the abandoned agricultural field, where soil C storage may be increasing more rapidly. Therefore, the steady-state model is unsuited to these Mediterranean ecosystems and the full model is recommended.";"Almagro, M.

"AGRIS:US201600132142";"Sediment in Alluvial and Lacustrine Debris Fans as an Indicator for Land Degradation Around Lake Ashenge (Ethiopia)";"";"Sediments deposited by (paleo) flash floods can hold valuable information on processes of environmental change, land degradation or desertification. In order to assess the suitability of flash flood deposits as proxies for land degradation, we monitored a representative gully segment in North Ethiopia (Ashenge catchment), investigated a sequence of alluvial debris fans downstream of this segment and dated a neighbouring subaquatic debris fan using short‐lived ²¹⁰Pb isotope counting. During one rainy season (July–September 2014), we measured daily rainfall, peak discharge, bedload transport, suspended sediment load and sediment deposition rates. The data show that sediment deposition in the debris fans is significantly dependent on micro‐topography (net incision in micro‐channels) (p < 0·1) and position within the sequence (net incision farther away from the lake) (p < 0·05). As sediment transfer to the lake significantly depends on the balance between available water and sediment (ratio rainfall depth/bedload transport) (p < 0·05), we could reconstruct the hydro‐sedimentary evolution of the gully over the past half century and validate it with aerial photographs and semi‐structured interviews. The findings are consistent with the short‐lived isotope count results, indicating increased sediment supply from the 1970s onwards, when little amounts of clay were deposited in the lake (<5%), and a subrecent clear water effect that resulted in increased deposition rates of clay in the lacustrine debris fan. Overall, our analysis indicates that debris fan sediments can be used to estimate past environmental degradation rates, if the contemporary water and sediment behaviour is well understood.

"AGRIS:US201301856033";"Does soil variation between rainforest, pasture and different reforestation pathways affect the early growth of rainforest pioneer species";"";"Rainforest deforestation and subsequent reforestation not only alter above-ground vegetation, but also lead to significant changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of soil and in biochemical cycles, which in turn are likely to influence the growth of rainforest plants. However, little research has directly linked soil condition to seedling growth under different forms of rainforest restoration. This study compared the early growth of three rainforest pioneer species (Alphitonia excelsa, Guioa semiglauca, Omalanthus nutans) among soils collected from three different reforestation pathways, and from reference sites in remnant rainforest and pasture in subtropical eastern Australia. The types of reforestation were tree-planting for ecological restoration purposes, autogenic regrowth dominated by the non-native tree species camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), and management of this regrowth to encourage native regeneration. Growth was measured in a shade-house, using soil from five sites in each site-type and three replicate plants of each species. Fifteen physical and biochemical properties were also measured in soil from each site; five of which were related to carbon and eight to nitrogen-dynamics. Two-factor ANOVA of the exponential growth coefficients of seedling height and diameter showed that there was no interaction between tree species and site-type, but there were significant main effects of both these factors. Seedling growth rates did not differ between pasture and rainforest soils, but were around 25% lower in soils from camphor-dominated regrowth sites than in soils from treated camphor and replanted sites. Seedling growth rates were correlated with two independently-varying soil properties: soil pH and plant-available nitrate-nitrogen, whose inclusion as covariates in the ANOVA largely removed the significant site-type effect. These results indicate that reforestation pathways can affect seedling growth by altering the physical and biochemical properties of soil. However, the absolute magnitude of this effect was not large.";"Paul, Miriam

Restoration by blocking drainage canals aims to recover peatland functions, principally by raising the water table. Field surveys in Ruoergai, China identified the status of peatland degradation and satellite image analysis concluded that most of Ruoergai's peatlands are degraded mainly due to drainage and overgrazing. The restoration approach used in Ruoergai resulted in increased water levels up to 26cm higher than previously recorded in canals. Levels in shallow water canals also increased up to 50cm, which led to an overflow of water and rewetting of the adjacent peatlands. This resulted in one peat-mining site being filled with water and aquatic vegetation. Pioneering vegetation including Heleocharis Horsetail (Equisetum heleocharis) and Halerpestes (Halerpestes tricuspis) colonized in the restored sites. It was concluded that blocking canals could be an effective method to restore hydrological function of drained peatlands and contribute to vegetation recovery.";"Zhang, Xiaohong

"AGRIS:US201400184091";"Soil and climate are better than biotic land cover for predicting home-range habitat selection by endangered burrowing owls across the Canadian Prairies";"";"Statistical models that describe species-environmental relationships are important components within many wildlife conservation strategies. These models are typically developed from studies conducted on small geographic scales (hundreds of square kilometres), representing a relatively small range in environmental conditions. Such local models from local studies are often then extrapolated to predict the suitability of other unsampled regions. The value of many models would be increased by considering larger-scale processes that might be structuring spatial patterns across species distributions. We examined home-range habitat selection by burrowing owls throughout the mixed prairie grassland region of western Canada (180,000km²) to determine whether owl selection for biotic factors changes along abiotic gradients. Specifically, we classified 37 explanatory variables into five categories (geography, grassland fragmentation, land-use, soil, and climate), created models for each set of variables, and evaluated the predictive ability of each model. We then examined interaction effects to determine if the relationship between land cover variables and the probability of owl home-range selection varied within large-scale abiotic criteria. Our results showed that soil and climate produce the most predictive models of burrowing owl home-range selection and create unique environmental conditions for owls which are independent of land cover at this scale. This study provides new insight into burrowing owl habitat requirements, and strengthens the case for considering large-scale abiotic gradients when prioritizing areas for species conservation.";"Stevens, A.F.J.

Mechanical drainage is a widely used agricultural practice which allows for the management of surface and sub-surface water. It is vital for improving land productivity and reclaiming marginal land. The use of mechanical drainage is known to have several impacts on the physico-chemical components of soil; however, little is known about its effect on the soil microbiome. In the present study, 454 pyrosequencing of the 18S and 16S rRNA gene regions was used to evaluate differences in fungal and bacterial communities in soil samples taken pre and two months post drainage from an extensively managed grassland in Co., Meath, Ireland.Mechanical drainage was found to have no significant impact on soil pH or on soil carbon and nitrogen levels, however a statistically significant reduction in moisture content was recorded (c. 7%). Analysis of metagenetic data showed that Basidiomycota was the largest classifiable fungal phylum accounting for 16% of all sequences. The predominant bacterial phyla identified in all samples were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria with average relative abundances of 23%, 26% and 27% respectively. Overall fungal and bacterial community structure and diversity remained unchanged in response to mechanical drainage but two fungal phyla, Chytridiomycota and Blastocladiomycota, showed a significant increase in relative abundance in response to drainage. These findings contribute to our overall understanding of how mechanical drainage impacts the soil microbiome.";"Fay, B.J.

The extent to which niches overlap in space determines whether the introduced species threatens the native one or the native species can escape competition or the effect of control. We compared the spatial distribution in relation to landscape and land-use/ land-cover variables of introduced and native Phragmites australis (common reed) in a landscape of protected freshwater wetlands in Quebec, Canada. Results showed that the wetlands still serve as refuges for native P. australis. At this stage of invasion, native and introduced P. australis occupy distinct spatial niches, the more abundant native type in low marsh and areas of lesser human impacts, the introduced one closer to roads and drier land covers. For now, native P. australis largely escapes competition, and the lack of spatial overlap could reduce opportunities for hybridization. Our study also suggests that invasion foci could still be controlled without endangering the native type. Whether the heterogeneous wetland conditions and the different spatial niches will be sufficient to allow long-term coexistence of native and introduced P. australis remains to be seen, but the situation needs to be closely monitored, especially in wetlands protected for biodiversity conservation.";"Taddeo, Sophie

There is overwhelming evidence that conservation compliance has reduced soil erosion. A key issue confronting Congress as they consider 1995 Farm Bill options is the fate of these erosion benefits if commodity programs are eliminated or it the subsidy level is greatly reduced.  This study provides policymakers with additional insights into the relationship between conservation tillage practices and government programs by using observed farmer behavior.  The central question addressed is: If future program benefits are not tied to conservation practices, will there be a significant decline in the amount of acreage on which conservation practices are adopted? 
Tillage adoption decisions are modeled within a multinomial logit framework.  There is limited evidence to argue that there will be a significant decline in conservation tillage for corn if program benefits are reduced.  For wheat, the results suggest that conservation tillage practices are costly, and that wheat farmers may reduce conservation tillage if conservation compliance provisions are weakened or eliminated.  However, no-till on wheat fields may increase with more flexibility. For corn, there is significant support for an increased in no-till if more corn-soybean rotations are adopted.";"Babcock, Bruce A.

The results revealed that less than half of the rice growers were sustainable in terms of economical viability, ecological benefits, and quality of life. By category, Boro rice farming was found to be the most sustainable, followed by Aman and Aus rice farming. Human capital development, increasing land productivity, use of resource conserving practices and technologies, and information availability and accessibility were the main factors promoting rice farming sustainability. The findings indicated that the construction of CI by employing several methodologies such as normalisation provide straightforward and clear-cut policy inputs. The major policy implications that emerged from the findings of the study are outlined to actualise rice farming sustainability, which contributes to sustainable development in Bangladesh.";"Roy, Ranjan

"AGRIS:US201301638471";"Relative impacts of disturbance and temperature: persistent changes in microenvironment and vegetation in retrogressive thaw slumps";"";"In the Low Arctic, a warming climate is increasing rates of permafrost degradation and altering vegetation. Disturbance associated with warming permafrost can change microclimate and expose areas of ion-rich mineral substrate for colonization by plants. Consequently, the response of vegetation to warming air temperatures may differ significantly from disturbed to undisturbed tundra. Across a latitudinal air temperature gradient, we tested the hypothesis that the microenvironment in thaw slumps would be warmer and more nutrient rich than undisturbed tundra, resulting in altered plant community composition and increased green alder (Alnus viridis subsp. fruticosa) growth and reproduction. Our results show increased nutrient availability, soil pH, snow pack, ground temperatures, and active layer thickness in disturbed terrain and suggest that these variables are important drivers of plant community structure. We also found increased productivity, catkin production, and seed viability of green alder at disturbed sites. Altered community composition and enhancement of alder growth and reproduction show that disturbances exert a strong influence on deciduous shrubs that make slumps potential seed sources for undisturbed tundra. Overall, these results indicate that accelerated disturbance regimes have the potential to magnify the effects of warming temperature on vegetation. Consequently, understanding the relative effects of temperature and disturbance on Arctic plant communities is critical to predicting feedbacks between northern ecosystems and global climate change.";"LANTZ, TREVOR C.

"AGRIS:US201400186491";"Estimating the frequency of extreme rainfall using weather radar and stochastic storm transposition";"";"Spatial and temporal variability in extreme rainfall, and its interactions with land cover and the drainage network, is an important driver of flood response. “Design storms,” which are commonly used for flood risk assessment, however, are assumed to be uniform in space and either uniform or highly idealized in time. The impacts of these and other commonly-made assumptions are rarely considered, and their impacts on flood risk estimates are poorly understood. This study presents an alternate framework for rainfall frequency analysis that couples stochastic storm transposition (SST) with “storm catalogs” developed from a ten-year high-resolution (15-min, 1-km²) radar rainfall dataset for the region surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. The SST procedure involves spatial and temporal resampling from these storm catalogs to reconstruct the regional climatology of extreme rainfall. SST-based intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) estimates are driven by the spatial and temporal rainfall variability from weather radar observations, are tailored specifically to the chosen watershed, and do not require simplifying assumptions of storm structure. We are able to use the SST procedure to reproduce IDF estimates from conventional methods for four urban watersheds in Charlotte. We demonstrate that extreme rainfall can vary substantially in time and in space, with potentially important flood risk implications that cannot be assessed using conventional techniques. SST coupled with high-resolution radar rainfall fields represents a useful alternative to conventional design storms for flood risk assessment, the full advantages of which can be realized when the concept is extended to flood frequency analysis using a distributed hydrologic model.";"Wright, Daniel B.

First, a LULC change model was developed using RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 storylines and logistic regression. Three scenarios (climate change only, LULC change only, and climate and LULC change combined) were established, and the streamflow in future periods under these scenarios was simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Each scenario showed distinct seasonal variations in streamflow. Under climate change only, streamflow increased in spring and winter but decreased in summer and autumn, whereas LULC change increased high flow during wet periods but decreased low flow in dry periods. Although the LULC change had less effect than climate change on the changes in streamflow, the effect of LULC change on streamflow was significant. The result for the combined scenario was similar to that of the climate change only scenario, but with larger seasonal changes in streamflow. Although the effects of LULC change were smaller than those caused by climate change, LULC changes may heighten the problems of increased seasonal variability in streamflow caused by climate change. The results obtained in this study provide further insight into the availability of future streamflow and can aid in water resource management planning in the study area.";"Kim, Jinsoo

Nevertheless, such investigations are relatively few in China. We present here a study of pollen assemblages from sediment samples collected from irrigation pools in the Tuoliang and Qipanshan catchments in northern China. Pollen and spores from natural vegetation such as Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Pinus and Selaginella sinensis dominate the pollen assemblages, while pollen types which could be from crops such as cereals, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Apiaceae and Cucurbitaceae are common but not abundant. Pollen percentages of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae become less with decreasing altitude, while Pinus and S. sinensis percentages increase, indicating that saccate Pinus pollen and S. sinensis spores are transported further than non-saccate Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae pollen, and differential sorting of pollen is occurring during transport in river water. Proportions of pollen from farmland and crops increase with decreasing altitude, showing that pollen percentages of crops might be a good indicator of the extent of farmland. A linear correlation analysis between pollen percentages and vegetation proportions shows that pollen percentages of crops are positively correlated with proportions of farmland, while correlation between pollen percentages of trees, shrubs and herbs and proportions of woodland, scrubland and grassland respectively is poor. This study indicates that the relationship between pollen percentages and vegetation proportions can be explained by the differences of pollen productivity, dispersal and deposition, and might be the basis for a modelling approach to infer past vegetation cover in northern China.";"Li, Jianyong

While the value of livestock grazing for managing rangeland vegetation to reduce fire fuel loads and improve wildlife habitat is increasingly recognized by resource management professionals, public concerns, and conflict between recreationist and livestock have led to reductions in public land grazing. Traditional public input methods yield a constrained picture of people’s attitudes toward cows and public land grazing. Public meetings, hearings, and surveys, the most commonly used mechanisms for public land managers to solicit public opinion, tend to foster participation of organized special interests or, in the case of surveys, focus on a specific topic. General public input is limited. This study explored the use of personal photography in social media to gain insight into public perceptions of livestock grazing in public spaces. Key findings of this study include that many recreationist in grazed San Francisco Bay Area parks shared views, interests, and concerns about cows and grazing on the photo-sharing website, Flickrᵀᴹ that seldom show up at a public meeting or in surveys. Results suggest that social media analysis can help develop a more nuanced understanding of public viewpoints useful in making decisions and creating outreach and education programs for public grazing lands.

We studied 43 woody species in 52 plots in three areas. All woody species were colonized by AM fungi, with average root colonization being relatively low (16.6% - ranging from 0% to 95%). Mean spore abundance ranged from 8 to 69 spores 100g⁻¹ of dry soil. Glomus was the dominant genus in all study sites. Season had a strong effect on root colonization and spore abundance. While spore abundance was higher (P <0.001) in the dry season in all three study sites, root colonization showed a more variable response. Root colonization was reduced in the dry season in the site that was least subject to stress, but increased in the dry season in the harshest sites. Management in the form of exclosures (that exclude grazing) had a positive effect on spore abundance in one of the two sites considered. Spore abundance did not significantly differ (P =0.17) between the two soil depths. Our results show that in this arid region all trees are mycorrhizal. This has profound consequences for rehabilitation efforts of such dry deciduous woodlands: underground processes are vital for understanding species adaptation to pulsed resource availability and deserve increasing attention.";"Birhane, Emiru

In boreal winter, strong wind soil erosion processes occur in the arid zones of the Mexican highlands, as a consequence of land use change and land cover change. The effect of land use change and land cover change has consequences in the atmospheric circulation, by altering the balance in solar radiation, albedo, soil moisture and texture, aerodynamic roughness and other surface properties. The anthropogenic impact of land use change from natural vegetation to agriculture lands developed into land degradation and air quality loss by large dust fluxes into the atmosphere. To investigate the magnitude of these erosion processes, we carried out the numerical modeling of a strong dust storm during the passage of a cold front on 18 March 2008. An algorithm based on the friction velocity was implemented for estimating the flux of particulate matter less than 10μm (PM₁₀) into the atmosphere. It was possible to show how the plume of high concentration of particulate matter propagates through the complex topography of the highland and of the Eastern Sierra Madre to reach large urban zones in the northern part of Mexico and Southern of Texas. In our numerical simulation we estimated roughly that the fraction of PM₁₀ emitted during this event was of the order of 9162.72ton. A direct effect of dust particles is appreciated in the reduction of measured solar radiation.";"Pineda-Martinez, Luis F.

Hence, this study assesses farm households’ willingness to participate in soil conservation practice through a Contingent Valuation method in one of the most degraded parts of the country. Double Bounded Dichotomous choice with an Open-ended follow up format was used to elicit the households’ willingness to pay using data collected from randomly selected 140 sample households. Results show that the mean willingness to participate in soil conservation practices was about 25 person days per annum and the total aggregate value of soil conservation was computed to be at 975622.73 person days (24390568.3 Birr). Moreover, the Tobit regression model results indicate that the education level of the household head, initial-bid, income, labour shortage and number of days on holiday and social ceremony were important factors influencing the willingness to participate in soil conservation practices. Hence, to improve the participation level, policy should target on supporting adult education, introducing ways to increase farm income and creating awareness on the loss associated with too many days of social ceremonies";"Musa Ahmed, H.

Currently, farmers are confronted by problems of declining land productivity. Rotations comprising rice and upland crops can increase soil quality, but appropriate cropping systems for paddy soils have received relatively little attention. We therefore established a multiyear field experiment to evaluate the long‐term effects of cropping systems with different rotations on soil chemical quality. Systems laid out in a randomized complete block design with four replications were as follows: (i) traditional rice monoculture with three rice crops per year (R‐R‐R), (ii) rotation with two rice crops and maize (R‐M‐R), (iii) rotation with two rice crops and mung bean (R‐Mb‐R) and (iv) rotation with one rice crop and two upland crops – mung bean and maize (R‐Mb‐M). We hypothesized that systems with rotations of upland crops and their temporary beds improve chemical quality of paddy rice soil. Soil chemical parameters were determined to better understand and evaluate the sustainability of the cropping systems. Results showed an improvement in soil chemical quality for cropping systems with rotations of rice and mung bean or maize grown on temporary beds (R‐M‐R, R‐Mb‐R and R‐Mb‐M), particularly the content of soil organic carbon and a presumed hydrolysable labile carbon fraction compared with rice monoculture. Less pronounced improvements in EC, CEC and total acidity were also found with inclusion of upland crops. Cropping systems of rice with upland crops improved rice grain and straw yield in subsequent season in contrast with rice monoculture.";"linh, T. B.

Using identical observed meteorology for lateral boundary conditions, two one-month simulations were conducted: one using the original United States Geological Survey (USGS) 24-category land cover data (namely NU) and the other using the urban land cover data from 2004 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images (namely HU) as lower boundary conditions in a mesoscale model. October 2004 was chosen for simulation due to no precipitation in the Pearl River Delta corresponding to drought conditions. The spatially averaged value (domain-averaged, land-averaged value, urban-averaged value) used for the analysis can reflect the regional climate over an area of several hundreds of kilometers. The simulation results show that the additional urbanization in the PRD amplifies the spatially averaged diurnal cycle of surface temperature, sensible heat fluxes and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, decreases relative humidity, water vapor in the air and latent heat flux, and increases the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The simulation also shows that the urban heat island (UHI) intensity is about 0.4° in the nighttime and about 1.3° in the daytime after the urban expansion.";"W. LIN

The springs discharge a natural sodium chloride mineral water that consumed for ages for therapeutic purposes attributed to their chemical properties. Development of springs commenced during the Ottoman times and a surface collection structure was built at the discharge point of the main spring. Two deep wells were drilled to tap mineral water within the past decades. The bottled water of these springs is also sold for a couple of years and its consumption as a beverage is increasing. The geochemical properties of these springs were investigated by several researchers in the past. This study comprises geochemical and geophysical measurements performed between July 2001 and July 2002 in order to construct a conceptual hydrogeological model for environmental and land use planning purposes. The seasonal evaluation of Tuzla-Icmeler (mineral spring) shows that the chemical properties fluctuate from the beginning of summer until the beginning of winter. This indicates that the overdraft of water during the summer season causes the movement and mix of normal groundwater with the mineralized groundwater. As a result, mixing of less mineralized groundwater decreases the salinity of mineralized groundwater. Using the site-specific hydrogeological, geochemical and geophysical data, zones of protection areas were delineated in order to prevent a possible pollution access to the springs and surroundings from nearby dockyards, dwellings and vehicle traffic. For this purpose, a new land use plan was proposed using the existing settlement sustainability plans.";"Yalcin, Tolga

Spatial land management to sustain biodiversity and economic returns";"";"Expanding human population and economic growth have led to large-scale conversion of natural habitat to human-dominated landscapes with consequent large-scale declines in biodiversity. Conserving biodiversity, while at the same time meeting expanding human needs, is an issue of utmost importance. In this paper we develop a spatially explicit landscape-level model for analyzing the biological and economic consequences of alternative land-use patterns. The spatially explicit biological model incorporates habitat preferences, area requirements and dispersal ability between habitat patches for terrestrial vertebrate species to predict the likely number of species that will be sustained on the landscape. The spatially explicit economic model incorporates site characteristics and location to predict economic returns for a variety of potential land uses. We apply the model to search for efficient land-use patterns that maximize biodiversity conservation objectives for given levels of economic returns, and vice versa. We apply the model to the Willamette Basin, Oregon, USA. By thinking carefully about the arrangement of activities, we find land-use patterns that sustain high levels of biodiversity and economic returns. Compared to the 1990 land-use pattern, we show that both biodiversity conservation and the value of economic activity could be increased substantially.";"Polasky, Stephen

The restoration of degraded drylands is commonly initiated by restoring the vegetation using plantations of tree/shrub seedlings. We conducted a meta-analysis of published field experiments in drylands to analyze and compare the effects of different ecotechnological techniques (nursery mycorrhization, treeshelters, organic amendments, hydrogels and the combined use of mycorrhization and organic amendments) on the survival and growth of seedlings of woody species used during restoration activities. We also evaluated how these effects were influenced by the planting method used, and by the duration of the experiments. We gathered results from 1207 case studies from 88 studies conducted in 14 countries. Our analyses indicate that the inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi (mycorrhization) in the nursery (alone, or in combination with organic amendments) and the use of treeshelters were the most effective treatments for enhancing both the survival and growth of the planted seedlings. The use of organic amendments by themselves did not increase seedling survival. The combined use of mycorrhization and organic amendments in the field improved the results when compared to the use of organic amendments alone. The analysis of hydrophilic gels and organic amendments revealed evidence of publication bias, so more studies are needed before any generalization on their effects on seedling establishment can be made. The planting method influenced the effects of some of the treatments evaluated, though this response varied depending on the seedling performance variable considered. The length of the study was negatively related to growth variables in treatments including organic amendments. Our results provide general trends and guidelines for researchers and practitioners involved in dryland restoration, which can be used to maximize the benefits provided by the ecotechnological techniques evaluated.";"Piñeiro, Juan

This study aimed to determine the impact of rainfall seasonality and land use change on soil erosion over the last 40 years in a 94-ha cultivated catchment of Normandy (France). To this end, scenarios representative of the different land use conditions were simulated using the STREAM expert-based erosion model. A 13 years long sequence of rainfall events was run with this model. Results showed that erosion increased dramatically after land consolidation (+168% on average). Interannual variability of erosion is important. After land consolidation, 79% of erosion was observed in summer and autumn, even though these seasons only accounted for 58% of annual rainfall kinetic energy. The bulk of erosion was hence produced by a few intense thunderstorms during this period. Thunderstorms correspond to 5% of rainfall events and to 15% of the total rainfall depth, but they generate 51% of total annual erosion after land consolidation (and up to 57% of erosion before land consolidation). Confrontation of the STREAM model outputs with the erosion rates modelled based on Cs-137 measurements suggested that soil redistribution within the catchment was very high but that sediment exports from the catchment remained limited (sediment delivery ratio between 1% and 10%). Local erosion rates derived from Cs-137 measurements showed an important and organised spatial variability, but erosion rates integrated over larger areas remained in the same order of magnitude as those simulated by the STREAM model or were slightly higher. Water erosion would hence not be the only process generating erosion within this catchment. In this context, our results show that tillage erosion cannot be neglected to calculate the sediment budget over several decades.";"Evrard, Olivier

In these areas, the reduction in soil quality is mainly associated with depletion of soil organic matter (SOM), as well as of soil phosphorus (P) reserves. We aimed to evaluate changes in SOM and P fractions of a eutrophic haplic cambisol (Eutric Cambisol) under different uses and management systems in the irrigated perimeter of Jaguaribe/Apodi in Ceará State, Brazil. The evaluated irrigated agroecosystems were perennial banana (Musa ssp.) cultivation (IPBC) and annual maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation (IAMC). The respective natural vegetation (NVIB) and (NVIM) were selected and used as a reference. Soil samples were collected at 0-5, 5-15, 15-25, and 25-40cm soil depths, and evaluated for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), humic substances, fractions of oxidizible organic carbon, and organic and inorganic P fractions. The stocks of TOC, TN, and humic substances in topsoil have been reduced by cultivation, and the largest reductions were observed in the IAMC area. The degree of SOM oxidation decreased with soil depth and the greastest amounts of labile C were found in IAMC. Annual and perennial agroecosystems showed changes in reserves of soil P. Our results pointed out that irrigated agroecosystems in the Brazilian semi-arid regions need to adopt management practices that favor the building up of soil SOM contents, particularly where annual crops are cultivated.";"de Assis, Cristiane Pereira

"AGRIS:US201500089612";"Anopheles species associations in Southeast Asia: indicator species and environmental influences";"";"BACKGROUND: Southeast Asia presents a high diversity of Anopheles. Environmental requirements differ for each species and should be clarified because of their influence on malaria transmission potential. Monitoring projects collect vast quantities of entomological data over the whole region and could bring valuable information to malaria control staff but collections are not always standardized and are thus difficult to analyze. In this context studying species associations and their relation to the environment offer some opportunities as they are less subject to sampling error than individual species. METHODS: Using asymmetrical similarity coefficients, indirect clustering and the search of indicator species, this paper identified species associations. Environmental influences were then analysed through canonical and discriminant analysis using climatic and topographic data, land cover in a 3 km buffer around villages and vegetation indices. RESULTS: Six groups of sites characterized the structure of the species assemblage. Temperature, rainfall and vegetation factors all play a role. Four out of the six groups of sites based on species similarities could be discriminated using environmental information only. CONCLUSIONS: Vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery proved very valuable with one variable explaining more variance of the species dataset than any other variable. The analysis could be improved by integrating seasonality in the sampling and collecting at least 4 consecutive days.";"Obsomer, Valérie

"AGRIS:US2016206266";"Identifying the range of distance over which open space affects housing values";"";"This research uses a sequence of hedonic housing price regressions to estimate open space amenity values. The iterative approach empirically identifies the range of distance over which open space affects housing values. After controlling for numerous other factors in the spatial hedonic model, simple functional relationships were established between the implicit prices of developed open space, forest-land open space, and agriculture-wetland open space and the buffer radius of the area surrounding a given location. In the case of Nashville-Davidson County, Tennessee, households place a positive value on additional developed open space and forest-land open space up to distances of 2.2 miles and 1.5 miles, respectively, and a negative value for additional agriculture-wetland open space up to 0.8-miles from their location. Implicit-price-buffer-size functional relationships found in this study may be useful to local planners or policymakers. For example, local policymakers can identify the set of homeowners who would receive positive amenity values from developed open space or from preservation of forest-land open space, given the distance thresholds determined. Estimates of amenity and disamenity values of homeowners would allow the aggregate value generated by a particular open-space site to be estimated. The aggregate value consumers receive reflects the value residents place on neighborhood open space and is an estimate of the value of open-space as a public good. Thus, decision makers can prioritize specific open-space establishment or preservation decisions by not only accounting for the costs of establishing or preserving open space, but also estimating the public value of open space.";"Cho, Seong-Hoon

The study uses participatory methods and aims to contribute to (i) the development of low-income wetland communities, (ii) to prepare these communities to become less dependent on wetlands without receding into poverty, and (iii) the better management of the wetlands. The communities in direct dependence and intimate interaction with Nakivubo wetlands are mainly poor, live and work under hazardous conditions, and their activities pose a threat to the ecological function of the wetlands. Yet these wetlands are important for filtering the city's waste and storm water before it flows into Lake Victoria's Murchison Bay, which is Kampala's source of piped water. Government approaches to the problem of wetland encroachment have largely failed because they are confrontational, and are not consistent or participatory. The study has in the first year conducted a series of activities including stakeholder analysis, resource analysis, livelihood analysis, a questionnaire survey and action planning. Preliminary data show that wetland dependency is very high among the poor nearby communities. They practice cultivation, brick-making and harvesting of wetland vegetation. However, these activities are under threat because wetland resources are dwindling due to increasing population and over-use. Livelihoods are threatened not only by the decreasing productivity of the wetland, but also by the ever-present government threat to evict wetland encroachers to restore its ecology. The study therefore works with communities to prepare for less dependence on wetlands so that they do not suddenly recede into worse poverty if they are evicted. They formulate strategies to enhance alternative livelihood, and for management of the wetland. Action plans have been formulated to address the situation through a newly created association.";"Kabumbuli, Robert

Producers were asked to provide management information regarding a piece of their land that was managed as a unit. Within the past ten years there has been a reduction in the conversion of remaining native land to crop land, an increase in conversion of annual crop land to perennial cover crops, an increase in the use of minimum disturbance (no-till) farming, and a decrease in the use of fire on stubble fields and sloughs. Many producers in the area often stated economic reasons for their current land use division. Even ecological reasons (productive capacity of the soil, poor cropping soil, light soil etc.) often had an economic basis. If the land was not productive enough, a management scheme with lower input costs would be adopted. This was commonly demonstrated in this survey by the conversion of marginal land to tame forages. Producers within this region seem willing to adopt farming practices that connect economic sustainability with environmental responsibility.

The present study uses a hedonic framework to analyze the effect ofselected attributes on the price of corn and soybean herbicides. Two different empirical modelswere estimated separately for the two crops. The data include information on 51 herbicides, 27for corn and 24 for soybean crops used in Kentucky. Findings indicate that efficacy againstweeds and crop response (illustrates the potential of an herbicide to injure a crop) of herbicidesare significant determinants of their prices. Moreover, some of the environmental statementshave an effect on herbicide prices.

"AGRIS:US201500200083";"Simulation and sensitivity analysis of carbon storage and fluxes in the New Jersey Pinelands";"";"A major challenge in modeling the carbon dynamics of vegetation communities is the proper parameterization and calibration of eco-physiological variables that are critical determinants of the ecosystem process-based model behavior. In this study, we improved and calibrated a biochemical process-based WxBGC model by using in situ AmeriFlux eddy covariance tower observations. We simulated carbon dynamics of fire-dominated forests at tower sites and upscaled the tower site-based simulations to regional scale for the New Jersey Pinelands using LANDSAT-ETM land cover and DAYMET climate data. The Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test approach was used to assess the higher-order sensitivity of model to critical eco-physiological parameters. The model predictions of CO₂ net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) were in agreement with the eddy covariance measurements at the three tower sites in 2005. However, the model showed poor fit in 2006, grossly overestimating NEE and the ratio of ecosystem respiration to GEP because the model did not reflect the carbon loss caused by severe defoliation related to an outbreak of gypsy moths in that year. The model simulations indicated that wildfire reduced annual NEE in pine/scrub oak forest, while prescribed burning in oak/pine and pine/oak stands led to temporary increase in NEE for a period 1–2 years post burning. The uncertainty and sensitivity of the model carbon simulations were mainly attributable to the 2nd- and higher-order interactions between carbon allocation parameters, specific leaf area and fire mortality intensity.";"Miao, Zewei

In the first step, borehole location inventory map consisting of 143 with relatively high yield (>8 L/s) was prepared. Then, eight influencing groundwater factors, namely altitude, slope, geology, land use/land cover, distance to roads, distance to faults, aquifer type, and depth of wells were prepared and integrated into spatial database. The spatial association between borehole locations and each influencing groundwater factors were analyzed and discussed. For the analysis of groundwater productivity, the studentised contrast C/S(C) of each groundwater factors were spatially overlaid and weighted summed to produce groundwater potential index (GWPI) map. The resulting map was classified into four categories: low, moderate, high, and very high according to natural break classification scheme. The low GWPI zone covers 30 % (2,215 km²). The moderate, high, and very high cover 32 % (2,349 km²), 23 % (1,649 km²), and 15 % (1,075 km²) of the total study area, respectively. The high and very high zones cover approximately 40 % of the study area indicating moderate productivity of the aquifer system in the study area. The results of the analysis were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) technique. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for success and prediction rates were 0.81 and 0.80, respectively, indicating the high capability of WOE for modeling groundwater potentiality in the study area.

Combating desertification in Cape Verde is complex because it involves addressing a mixture of endogenous (manual agriculture, fuel wood and fodder extraction, land tenure and steep slopes) and exogenous drivers (high rainfall variability, climate change, prolonged drought or heavy rainfall). To address and mitigate the adverse effects of desertification, it is necessary to develop an approach that identifies and brings together all the key stakeholders affected by and acting on the desertification issue, including land users, policy makers, managers, researchers and rural development technicians. This paper presents a hybrid methodology based on global best practices, applied in Cape Verde. It combines experiences and skills of local stakeholders (farmers, local association of land users and local non‐governmental organizations) with scientific knowledge of external stakeholders such as technicians of the Ministry of Rural Development, environmental advisors of Municipalities and researchers. Integration takes place following a participatory process of appraising and selecting desertification control strategies. The paper presents the first results obtained from application of the hybrid methodology to Ribeira Seca, the largest watershed of Santiago Island. The approach was evaluated with local and external stakeholders. Both groups appreciated that they could voice their views and discuss ways to overcome barriers and also to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by jointly selected promising desertification mitigation options.

This paper reports a study on the preference of local people for different incentives that could help increase local support for nature conservation. It also explores the possibilities for designing a sustainable incentive strategy. Data were obtained from personal interviews conducted with community members around the Okwangwo Division of the Cross River National Park in south-east Nigeria, and were analysed using a multinomial logit model. The results showed that skill development was the most preferred incentive, followed by community forestry. The gathering of non-timber forest products under the supervision of national park officials was least preferred. The local people's preferences were influenced by factors such as education, extraction of bush mangoes, membership of environmental group, farmland size, income from non-timber forest products, ownership of commercial cocoa farms and gender. We conclude that an incentive-based strategy for nature conservation will be more effective if local people are more involved in negotiations regarding the incentive that are being offered. The findings from this study could assist nature conservation managers in designing a more acceptable and effective nature conservation strategy.";"Ezebilo, Eugene E.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"community forestry";"Forest Tenure;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500003333";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21513732.2013.813586";"";"";"";"215-224"

The plant communities now common in urban centers may represent new habitats with unique dynamics and the potential for highly modified ecological services. This study, joining extensive spatial and floristic data sets, examined current distribution patterns of non-native and native woody plant species in the New York metropolitan region, USA. We joined the New York Metropolitan Flora (NYMF) database of woody species with GIS data of urban land cover for 297 5 km by 5 km landscape blocks. We tested the relationship between urbanization and native and non-native species richness patterns, the extent of non-native species presence in the urban area, and the change in beta diversity across a gradient of urban land cover. We found that across the urban–rural gradient, native plant species richness decreased and non-native species richness increased with increasing urban land cover. Total richness does not change across the urban–rural gradient. Our analyses show that these patterns are highly correlated with urbanization, but vary across the New Jersey landscape. We also found an increase in beta diversity with urbanization; urban areas are not homogenized in plant species composition compared to rural areas. Here we show a species-rich flora dominated by non-native species which are differentiating the urban flora. These results can help guide appropriate conservation decisions for the maintenance of plant biodiversity in cities.";"Aronson, Myla F. J.

The ability of Airborne Laser Swath Mapping technology to densely sample ground elevations beneath forest canopies is particularly important because forested watersheds have traditionally been difficult to study with remote sensing techniques. The extraction of stream networks from digital elevation models (DEMs) plays a fundamental role in modelling local and spatially distributed hydrological processes. Our approach, based on an encoding of mathematical morphological operators, is shown to systematically and accurately extract stream channel locations, forms and incipient incisions in a forested watershed.

"AGRIS:US201500161562";"Characterization of vegetation community dynamics in areas affected by construction waste along the urban fringe";"";"The effects of urban sprawl, at the expense of green natural areas, and the increasing anthropogenic pressure on these areas, lead to significant changes in land cover composition and structure. One of the threats and hazardous aspects of the urban sprawl is the disposal of construction site waste (CW) at the cities’ fringes and by the roadsides. The analysis of vegetation community structure over space and time in such areas may contribute to the understanding of community dynamics at the urban fringe following modern human intervention. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the composition and structure of vegetation communities in construction waste and rubble areas at the city of Haifa’s fringe. A control undisturbed site, and sites that were disturbed 20, 40 and 60 years prior to the study were selected and studied.The results indicate that superficially there is no difference among the communities. A closer analysis, however, reveals that there is a significant segregation in species assembly between the control and the damaged sites, and that this difference becomes more significant as time passes. Initially, recently disturbed sites were characterized by a higher abundance of ruderal species, where mean number of ruderal species was 1.75/sampling quadrate, compared to 0.08 species/sampling quadrate. As time passes, the number of exotic species increased from 0.09 species/sampling quadrate at the 20 year disturbed site to 1.02 at the 60 year sites. Additionally, cover of climber species in the sites significantly increased with time, and other local life form groups declined in richness. Further, we have found that the impact of the CW is spreading beyond the area that it was found and into the open and undeveloped area that surround the city.";"Kopel, Daniella

"AGRIS:US2016207683";"Determinants of Forestry Investment and Extent of Forestry Expansion by Smallholders in New Zealand";"";"While there has been a large increase in investment in plantation forestry in New Zealand by smallholders during the past decade, there are still many smallholders who have chosen not to become involved in this land use or who are using only a portion of their potentially planted land for forestry.  To understand why this is the case, this paper studies two issues, the differences between those who have and have not established plantation forests, and the factors that explain the proportion of land used in forestry by small landholders who have identified that they have potentially plantable land.  Land used for forest plantations is treated as a two-step decision process, where first a landowner must decide whether they would consider planting trees at all and then secondly how much land would be planted in trees.  With this approach, a double hurdle model is used to study planting decisions.  Using survey data obtained from 344 landholders in four South Island districts, the results indicate that property-specific factors, such as property size, years of ownership, and ownership being part of a partnership, as well as landowner characteristics such as perceptions of tax policies being favourable for forestry, off farm income level and expectations of increasing log prices were correlated with the decision whether to establish a plantation forest.  The factors determining the extent of land identified as being potentially profitable in forestry actually being used for plantation forestry include forestry tax policy, expectations of increasing log prices, regional location of a property, owner’s annual income, and area used in sheep and beef production.";"Dhakal, Bhubaneswor

To address this problem, there is a need to integrate spatially-explicit information on ecosystem services into conservation planning. We present an approach for identifying conservation areas necessary to safeguard the provision of important ecosystem services for indigenous communities. âCommunity use zonesâ (CUZs) were generated using participatory mapping methods that identify place values indicating significant hotspots for ecosystem services. Using principles from landscape ecology, these areas are buffered to provide connectivity and to delineate ecosystem service delivery areas. We demonstrate the use of CUZs for five villages in southern Suriname (n=191 participants) to inform the South Suriname Conservation Corridor project. The mapped data reveal overlapping hotspots for different ecosystem services depicting multifunctional landscapes that provide an empirical foundation for delineating CUZs. In the absence of legal and traditional land rights for indigenous people, CUZs based on the provision of ecosystem services provide a defensible, spatially explicit approach for integrating indigenous needs into regional conservation plans in southern Suriname. We discuss the utility of CUZ maps for promoting land tenure and security and as a basis for collaborative governance in indigenous and community-conserved areas (ICCAs).";"Ramirez-Gomez, Sara O.I.

"AGRIS:US2016203164";"Benefit Transfer: Choice Experiment Results";"";"Benefit transfer entails using estimates of non-market values derived at one site as approximations to benefits at other sites. The method finds favour because it can be applied quickly and cheaply, however the validity of benefit transfer is frequently questioned. Published studies generally indicate that errors from the approach can be extremely large and could result in significant resource misallocations. Assessing the validity of benefit transfer is complicated by differences in the nature of study and policy sites, the changes being valued, valuation methods, time of study, availability of substitutes and complements, and demographic, social and cultural differences. A choice experiment was used to evaluate the transferability of benefit estimates for identical goods between two different populations. The study design allowed most of the confounding factors to be controlled, so provides a strong test of benefit transfer validity. Several different tests were applied to evaluate benefit transfer validity, with conflicting results. The paper investigates the merits of the alternative tests and concludes that utility functions were different for the two populations.";"Kerr, Geoffrey N.

Geographic features of Bahrain during 1963–2008 are produced using Geographical Information System. Extensive but inexpensive shallow coastal areas and tidal flats have been reclaimed particularly from 1997 to 2007 at a high rate of 21km²/year. Formal records show the increase in the original land mass by the year 2008 to be 91km². An estimated total cumulative loss of major habitats resulting from 10 reclamation projects was around 153.58km². Also much larger scale impacts should be considered resulting from the borrow areas used for the extraction of sand or infill materials. A number of key habitats and species are affected in the vicinity of these projects. The study attempts to assign a monetary value to the marine ecosystem functions. There is a need for efficient coastal zone management to regulate a sustainable use of the marine resources.";"Zainal, Khadija

"AGRIS:US201500210984";"Effect of point density and interpolation of LiDAR-derived high-resolution DEMs on landscape scarp identification";"";"Recognition of geomorphic features, such as landslide scarps, is the first key step for landslide risk assessment and mitigation. Geomorphic features can be identified from high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a useful tool to collect high-density point elevation data from ground surfaces. LiDAR ground points are used to generate high-resolution DEMs. However, LiDAR sample sizes and interpolation methods are critical parameters for DEM estimation under various land cover types. To discuss the effect of the parameters, this study used a series of cases to estimate the DEMs and identify the landslide scarps, especially potential landslide scarps hidden in the forest. Results show that LiDAR sample size affects the visual identification rate of the landslide scarps. The point density of LiDAR data controls the level of detail that can be resolved in the LiDAR-derived DEM. Given low-density LiDAR ground points, the DEM accuracy is the worst, especially in dense forest. Particularly in sparse samples, the identification rate of the landslide scarp is sensitive to the interpolation method. In sparse samples, landslide scarp identification based on Kriging-estimated DEM showed the best results among the three interpolation methods. Hence, this study provides information for the assessment of the effects of sample sizes under land cover for further geomorphic monitoring, assessment and management.";"Chu, Hone-Jay

Beginning in September 1991, a land-market survey involving 121 households and 162 plots of land was administered in two peri-urban green zones of Maputo-districts 4 and 6. Households were queried about their land-settlement histories, mode of land acquisition, terms and conditions of transfer, land rights, size of holdings, perceptions of tenure security, land-use practices, commercial input use, hired labor, agricultural sales and revenues, nonfarm employment and earnings, and general demographic characteristics. The present study reports findings from the land-market survey along with numerous other interviews with producers, buyers and sellers of land, local authorities, and district and national officials in Maputo and its surrounding peri-urban green zones. Section 1 is introductory while section 2 covers the legal foundation of land tenure and describes the various authorities and agencies responsible for setting and enforcing land policy in the peri-urban zone. Section 3 explains the research design and sampling frame used to select households and landholdings for the study, choice of strata, survey instruments, research questions, and data limitations. Section 4 provides a statistical profile of the household economy while section 5 examines processes of land settlement, land acquisition, types and sources of land dispute, and registration benefits. In section 6, economic and political factors are linked with land prices to explain the determination of ""reservation"" and ""offer"" prices of land and to evaluate the influence of market factors and Possible asymmetries in information and bargaining position on land-price perceptions.";"Roth, Michael J.

An artificial neural network (ANN) technique selected the most relevant spectral/textural attributes, which were combined for classification of the ALI scene. From the ANN land-cover map, areas classified as primary forest (PF), initial (SS1), intermediate (SS2) and advanced (SS3) stages of secondary succession were studied. Biophysical parameters were determined from field inventory of 40 sample plots. Results showed an overall classification accuracy of 79% using reflectance and 89% using the combined data set. The combined data set included the reflectance of ALI bands 3–9 and the texture metrics mean (bands 3–4; 6–8) and dissimilarity (band 8). The reflectance of the near-infrared/shortwave infrared bands and their texture mean decreased from SS1 to SS3/PF. The gradient between primary and secondary forests controlled the correlations of reflectance with biophysical parameters. While the aboveground biomass, basal area, leaf area index, tree height and canopy cover increased from SS1 to SS3/PF, the reflectance decreased with the development of canopy structure and the resultant canopy shadows. The mean was the only texture metric correlated with biophysical parameters.";"da Silva, Ricardo D.

Specifically the study examined the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, estimated the farm size of the farmers, identified reasons for not practicing mechanized farming, identified different innovations available to the farmers and identified the factors that affected agricultural productivity . Five communities were chosen randomly and from each of these communities, twenty farmers were randomly chosen. Data were collected, collated and analyzed using relevant techniques such as means, percentages, frequency distribution and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that 85% of the respondents practiced individual land tenure system alone. It was also revealed that the laws of inheritance and increase in population led to the subdivision and fragmentation of existing farmland in such a manner that the sizes of farm holdings discouraged agricultural commercialization. Also, it was found that fragmentation led to a great distance between the plot which increased the waste in man-hour and energy. It was also shown that mechanization of agriculture was impracticable under land fragmentation and adoption of modern innovation was reduced since just 35.0% of the respondents claimed to have adopted other forms of innovation. Lastly, the null hypothesis was rejected concluding that socio-economic factors affected the farmer’s productivity in the area. It was recommended that formation of cooperatives by farmers is an imperative in farm land consolidation of the scattered farm holdings into economic size to encourage large scale operation and bulk input sourcing and procurement.";"Eze, Christopher C.

The area is estimated to be more than 1.4 million ha of seabed. As a result, there was an immediate need to cultivate new crops capable of stopping the movement of sands and the enlargement of saline soils. Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is considered to be a moderately salt‐tolerant crop and, as such, one of a few crops well suited to the cropping systems of salt‐affected soils. It is used in Uzbekistan as a reserve crop when the culture of the main crop fails. In spite of the great economic importance of this oil, there is almost no available information in the literature on the effect of salinity on oil quality and its chemical ingredients. The purpose of the present study was to determine, in greenhouse and field experiments, how irrigation with saline water would influence content of oil, lipids and other lipophylic components in safflower. We found that irrigation of safflower with moderate concentrations of saline water seems feasible, as far as oil and lipid composition is concerned. Consequently, safflower might be a potential crop for lands of little use for plant growth in Uzbekistan or other similar sites in the world.";"Yuldasheva, N.K.

"AGRIS:US2016220926";"Impact of Land Institutional Factors on Farm Management and Soil Quality";"";"Soil quality has important implications for sustainable agricultural development and food self-sufficiency in many developing countries. A decrease in soil nutrient stocks, one of the components of soil quality, necessitates more inputs and greater management skills in order to compensate for the reduction in nutrients availability. This is why the interaction of agricultural development and soil quality management attracts widespread attention from researchers. Applying plot level data on input/output, and a selected number of soil quality indicators and farm household level information, from the three villages, this paper examines the impact of land fragmentation and land tenure on soil management, the dynamic component of soil quality, crop husbandry and rice yield at plot level. A 2SLS econometric approach is applied to simultaneously estimate the interlinked relationships between these variables. From these results we conclude that land fragmentation does play a role in farm management practices and decisions. The land tenure status of a plot does not affect crop husbandry decisions on labor and herbicide use. Farmers on rented-in plots do, however, use more chemical fertilizers (phosphorus and potassium). This implies that farmers care more about short-term yields than about the built-up of long-term soil productivity. In order to sustain long-term soil productivity, measures should be taken to ensure that the prices for renting land reflect such soil investments.";"Shuhao, Tan";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land fragmentation;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016220926";"http://purl.umn.edu/51662";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201600088672";"relative roles of contemporary and ancient processes in shaping genetic variation of a generalist fish in a catchment dominated by agriculture";"";"Conversion of land for agriculture has led to the channelisation of headwater streams and reduced water quality. Resident fish populations are expected to be challenged under such conditions and may experience declines that lead to a loss of neutral genetic variation. However, species‐specific responses to recent ecological changes in stream condition and/or range expansion following glacial retreat can also influence the pattern of genetic variation found within and among contemporary populations. To evaluate the relative roles of contemporary and ancient scenarios that are hypothesised to affect the genetics of populations in streams, we studied the creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), a common species that is tolerant of stream degradation. We screened eight microsatellite loci on 308 individuals originating from ditches and streams surrounded by agricultural and forested land cover within the St. Joseph River catchment in north‐eastern Indiana and southern Michigan, U.S.A. We found weak population structure associated with land cover and, in contrast to expectation, higher allelic richness in agricultural streams. Using Bayesian coalescent modelling, the strongest pattern found within the data set was evidence of a population decline throughout the catchment that most likely preceded stream channelisation and land conversion. The results illustrate the complexity of using neutral genetic variation of populations to assay stream quality. Tolerant species may have increased gene flow in channelised streams that leads to an increase in genetic variation. Meanwhile, post‐glacial landscape change and subsequent colonisation of nascent freshwater streams appears to shape genetic variation regardless of contemporary land use.";"Jordan, Mark A.

It is shown that the types and rates of soil degradation were specified without proper consideration for the taxonomic position of particular soils. Reference (nondegraded) soils were not clearly defined, which made it difficult to judge the degree of soil degradation by means of a comparative analysis of degraded and nondegraded soils. Such reference soils are suggested for several types of soil degradation (dehumification, compaction, depletion of nutrients, etc.). Additional diagnostic criteria of the degree of soil degradation caused by wind and water erosion, waterlogging, swamping, and other adverse processes are specified. The study of qualitative and quantitative changes in the soil properties during the post-Soviet period is important for the development of land monitoring system and for the analysis of economic aspects of land degradation. To ensure reliability of data on changes in the soil properties and soil cover patterns, possible errors related to incorrect comparison of the data obtained by traditional and modern approaches should be taken into account.";"Molchanov, E.

"AGRIS:US201300945988";"influence of land use on desertification processes";"";"Site degradation occurs mainly through deterioration of the soil's capacity to capture and store water, as well as the loss of organic matter or the accumulation of salts or other toxic substances in the soil. This degradation process, leading to the reduction of the biotic potential of the site, is known as desertification. In this study, changes in bulk density, organic matter, and electrical conductivity are used as indicators of desertification in northeast Mexico. The hypotheses put forward here are that degradation processes are affecting extensive areas of the region, and that the type of processes and their magnitude differ according to specific land uses. Thirty-one sites under different land use systems (agriculture, rangeland, induced grassland, and a protected site) were sampled for bulk density, organic matter, and salinity. Soil samples for bulk density estimation were collected in 1996, 1997, and 1999, while those for organic matter and salinity were taken in 1993, 1997, and 1999. Soil bulk density and organic matter showed significant changes across time in rangeland sites. None of the sites showed significant changes in salinity. Organic matter was similar in agriculture, rangeland, and grassland sites across dates. Soil bulk density was similar in grasslands and rangelands and lower in agriculture sites. Values of organic matter were lower and those of soil bulk density were higher when compared to a protected native vegetation site.";"Pando-Moreno, M.

"AGRIS:US201400034060";"Identification of potential areas for biomass production in China: Discussion of a recent approach and future challenges";"";"A standard methodology is needed to recognize potentially suitable areas for sustainable bioenergy crop production. This facilitates better identification of promising crops and cropping systems, logistical and economic studies, and work needed to meet regulatory criteria. A possible approach is built upon three layers of internationally available spatial data: (1) degrading and abandoned areas, (2) potentially suitable land cover classes, (3) exclusion zones such as nature reserves and areas of high biodiversity. For China, areas identified as potentially suitable range from 1.2 to 6.0% of the national territory, depending on different levels of statistical confidence in degrading area status and allowable limits of terrestrial carbon. Verification on the ground showed that about 60% of points tested conformed to the remote suitability assessment in the scenario, which represents the results for the combination of all degrading areas and a terrestrial carbon stock limit of 200 t ha−1. A top-down approach is useful in framing potentially suitable locations, but a complementary bottom-up analysis is still required to ultimately identify areas for sustainable bio-fuel production.";"Schweers, Wilko

Using existing biophysical and socio-economic databases, we explored how human contexts influenced land cover, vegetation composition and agricultural production in five distant regions. On average, cultivated areas represented a minor proportion (<16%) of all the regions, except in Asia (74%). This proportion was positively associated with population density when considering all regions together (slope = 0.2 ha∗inh⁻¹), but the association became weaker in low-population regions. While protected areas displayed highly similar life-forms across regions, non-protected natural vegetation areas presented large contrasts, suggesting different imprints of land management. The observed contrasts were more marked for cultivated vegetation, with different species and species diversities being found in each region. These contrasts likely reflect orientation toward national/global markets in the Australian and American regions and toward local markets/subsistence in Asian and African regions. Africa and Asia were characterized by low and similar per capita levels of food production (∼50 kg grain∗y⁻¹∗inh⁻¹ and ∼0.14 livestock units∗inh⁻¹), in contrast to South America and Australia (585 kg grain∗y⁻¹∗inh⁻¹ and 10.2 units∗inh⁻¹, respectively). This comparative perspective assisted in exploring the reciprocal influences between social-economic development and ecosystems that lead to alternative strategies of land management.";"Baldi, G.

These inequalities are variously manifest in unequal control over land and legal documents, disparities in status and what Fraser calls ‘voice'. These circumstances help account for quantitative evidence that shows a strong preference among local landless populations for land reform organizations that are more decentralized and less hierarchically organized. These circumstances also motivate direct actions undertaken by grassroots MST settlers seeking to destabilize the conditions that ground these inequalities. This research highlights the importance of attending to local histories and interactions through which participatory disparities are christened and reproduced; indicates potential methodological consequences; and examines the interplay of transgressive action, dialogue and recognition as settlers struggle to bring about ‘participatory parity' – or what they might call genuine ‘friendships' – in their communities.";"DeVore, Jonathan";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001875";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2014.990447";"";"";"";"1201-1223"

The project involved systematic reviews of evidence together with case studies. The range of performance in relation to health identified in the project shows that best practice in England depends not so much on the planning system per se, as on the leadership, commitment and knowledge of politicians and practitioners involved. The barriers to health integration are organisational and professional silos, ignorance, resources, and reactive planning regime. Clear lessons for research and practice are emerging: first, well attested research evidence is quite scarce, for example in relation to sustainability appraisal and health; second, planning agencies need to forge good partnerships with public health, transport, housing and economic development decision-makers, and develop proactive, healthy plans; the new planning regime and move of the public health function into local authorities in 2013 in England will give policy opportunities for the consideration of health outcomes in planning decisions, and research should in time evaluate if results have been achieved on the ground.";"Carmichael, Laurence

The effects of the area enrolled in the PFPs on rural households are mixed. It appears that larger area enrolled in the Industrial Timber Plantation Program and the Sloping Land Conversion Program pushed up rural households’ income mobility, whereas greater area enrolled in the Natural Forest Protection Program constrained their income mobility, and the size of enrollment in the Desertification Combating Program around Beijing and Tianjin and the Shelterbelt Development Program in the Three-North Regions and the Yangtze River Basin seem to have little effect on rural households’ income mobility.";"Liu, Can

Although a Forest Department modeled on the Indian Forest Service was established, there was no equivalent settlement process to determine the rights of forest peoples. State Forest area is declared by administrative fiat. These two elements have enabled State-endorsed forestland grabbing. Logging was scattered and selective until the early 1980s. A neoliberal economic program from the 1980s has allowed Asian companies to gain control over at least 80% of large-scale forestry concessions, equivalent to one-third of the 15.8 million hectares (Mha) of State-administered public forests. The relative success of the Asian companies can be understood in terms of available capital, willingness to invest, knowledge of markets, and willingness to corrupt. The relative failure of the preexisting Guyanese-owned businesses can be understood in terms of lack of capital, inability to save and unwillingness to invest, lack of knowledge of marketing, and lack of cooperation within the sector.

"AGRIS:US2016212439";"Proposal for a territorial assessment of the effects of agricultural policies with a georeferred mathematical programming model: a case study";"";"Over the past fifteen years, the common agricultural policy (CAP) is profoundly changed under the pressure of European society and economic trends. The reforms of 2003-2004 marked a new phase in this path. This process continued with the reforms of the sugar (2006) and fruit and vegetables(2007) and is still ongoing with the recent proposals to reform the wine sector. The dynamics of consolidation, evaluation and redirection of the legislative measures adopted are very important and topical in view of the definition of the common agricultural policy. These issues on the political side emphasize the need for policy makers to have evaluative instruments witch can analyze both the effects on farmers behaviour and the effects generated in the territory.   Using instrument that measures and localises the likely effects of agricultural policies, as a matter of fact, allows a correct and comprehensive analysis of actions taken, with the aim of bringing any corrections and adjustments to particular situation.The present work aims to implement and to test in a case study an evaluation instrument based on the integration of two different methodologies: the mathematical programming and the geographic information system. With this research we want to propose a possible method to study at the same time the behaviour of farmers and the localization of their choices under different political conditions. Farmers behaviour has been studied through the implementation of a positive mathematical programming (PMP) model. The construction of a georeferred database made possible to consider the spatial characteristics as variables directly involved in the process of mathematics optimization. Therefore, the geographic information system was used not only to locate the effects of policies, but also to constrain the mathematical model. The proposed model was applied in a rural area in the province of Florence, the Mugello. Through the comparison of different policy scenarios were identified and located the main effects induced by the mid term reform on soil, on livestock and on farms economic performance. Results obtained show how Cap reform induced a reallocation of farms resources and that it did not lead to the feared abandonment of primary activity.In addition, the elaboration of results provide important informations to decision public in order to develop monitoring actions in those areas which show potential problems. This model, for its flexibility and ductility, may constitute the basis for simulate and analyze the potential effects induced by the proposals, for example, in the health check of the CAP.";"Scozzafava, Gabriele

A case study in Northern France";"";"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) impact upon human and animal health and the wider environment. It is important to determine where POPs are found and the spatial pattern of POP variation. The concentrations of 90 molecules which are members of four families of POPs and two families of herbicides were measured within a region of Northern France as part of the French National Soil Monitoring Network (RMQS: Réseau de Mesures de la Qualité des Sols). We also gather information on five covariates (elevation, soil organic carbon content, road density, land cover and population density) which might influence POP concentrations. The study region contains 105 RMQS observation sites arranged on a regular square grid with spacing of 16km. The observations include hot-spots at sites of POP application, smaller concentrations where POPs have been dispersed and observations less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) where the soil has not been impacted by POPs. Fifty nine of the molecules were detected at less than 50 sites and hence the data were unsuitable for spatial analyses. We represent the variation of the remaining 31 molecules by various linear mixed models which can include fixed effects (i.e. linear relationships between the molecule concentrations and covariates) and spatially correlated random effects. The best model for each molecule is selected by the Akaike Information Criterion. For nine of the molecules, spatial correlation is evident and hence they can potentially be mapped. For four of these molecules, the spatial correlation cannot be wholly explained by fixed effects. It appears that these molecules have been transported away from their application sites and are now dispersed across the study region with the largest concentrations found in a heavily populated depression. More complicated statistical models and sampling designs are required to explain the distribution of the less dispersed molecules.";"Villanneau, Estelle J.

Empirical evidence from Costa Rica";"";"Global efforts to reduce deforestation rely heavily on protected areas and land use restrictions.  The effect of these restrictions on local communities is currently the subject of heated debate among conservation and development experts.  Measuring the social impacts of protected areas is difficult because the effects cannot be isolated from other factors, given the nonrandom placement of protection.  We address this problem by applying a quasi-experimental approach to establish the counterfactual (“what would have been the socioeconomic outcome if a protected area had not been established?”).  We use matching methods to measure the impacts of pre-1980 protected areas in Costa Rica on socioeconomic outcomes in 2000.  In 2000, neighboring communities near protected areas were substantially poorer than average. However, after controlling for pre-protection characteristics associated with both protection and economic growth, the results indicate that poverty declined as a result of protection. Although the statistical significance of this decline is moderately sensitive to potential hidden bias, the results emphatically do not support a hypothesis that ecosystem protection, on average, exacerbates poverty.  In contrast, conventional empirical methods implied erroneously that protection had negative social impacts, suggesting that failure to control for confounding factors or baselines can lead to substantially inaccurate estimates.";"Andam, Kwaw S.

The ancient and locally adapted agroforestry system of homegardens is presently estimated to occupy nearly 15� % of the land area in Sri Lanka and is described in the scientific literature to offer several ecosystem services to its users; such as climate regulation, protection against natural hazards, enhanced land productivity and biological diversity, increased crop diversity and food security for rural poor and hence reduced vulnerability to climate change. Our results, based on a limited sample size, indicate that the homegardens also store significant amount of carbon, with above ground biomass carbon stocks in dry zone homegardens (n� =� 8) ranging from 10 to 55 megagrams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha⁻¹) with a mean value of 35� Mg C ha⁻¹, whereas carbon stocks in wet zone homegardens (n� =� 4) range from 48 to 145� Mg C ha⁻¹ with a mean value of 87� Mg C ha⁻¹. This implies that homegardens may contain a significant fraction of the total above ground biomass carbon stock in the terrestrial system in Sri Lanka, and from our estimates its share has increased from almost one-sixth in 1992 to nearly one-fifth in 2010. In the light of current discussions on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), the concept of homegardens in Sri Lanka provides interesting aspects to the debate and future research in terms of forest definitions, setting reference levels, and general sustainability.";"Mattsson, Eskil

Management units are stands 4–32ha in size and are described using a hierarchal vegetative description including vegetation type, size class (age), and overstory canopy cover. For the most part, these stands are relatively homogeneous resulting from decades of even-aged management. Because elk (Cervus elaphus) select habitats at different scales from home ranges to microsites, it is important for managers to know how elk utilize vegetative conditions within these stands. We compared vegetative conditions at microsites selected by elk to the vegetative conditions of similarly classified stands to enable managers to better understand how timber management affects elk habitat. Within these relatively homogeneous forest stands under even-age management of the Black Hills, elk demonstrated selection for particular forest attributes. Vegetative conditions that provide cover for elk were selected for in open stands (both aspen and pine), but while in dense stands, elk selected for more open conditions. The elk hiding cover model should be adjusted for this forest.";"Rumble, Mark A.

The effects of these LULC changes on the hydrologic response were investigated using the WetSpa model to estimate spatially distributed average annual evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge. Digital image analysis revealed major increments of cultivated land and settlements of 15.4 and 9.9 %, respectively, at the expense of shrubland and grazing lands. Population growth and the associated demand for land were found to be the major driving forces. The WetSpa simulation showed an increase in annual surface runoff of 101 mm and a decrease in groundwater recharge of 39 mm over the period 1976–2003.

Here, for the first time, we used a free-air temperature enhancement (FATE) system in a controlled warming-grazing experiment in 2006 and 2007 to test the hypothesis that grazing modifies the response of soil solution DOC concentration to experimental warming. Warming with no-grazing (WNG) significantly increased the average soil solution DOC concentration to 40 cm soil depth by 14.1 and 17.2% compared with no-warming with no-grazing (NWNG) in 2006 and 2007 respectively based on 1.3–1.4 °C soil temperature increase. However, the lack of significant differences among warming with grazing (WG), no-warming with grazing (NWG) and NWNG indicate that moderate grazing modified the effect of warming on DOC concentration in the soil solution. The effect of grazing on DOC concentration in the soil solution varied with sampling date and soil depth. Generally, the direct contribution of soil temperature and soil moisture to variation of DOC concentration in the soil solution was small. Positive correlations were observed between soil solution DOC concentration in the surface soil and standing death quality and belowground biomass. The Lignin:N ratio in the standing death and belowground biomass at 10 cm soil depth explained 60% of the variation of mean DOC concentration at 10 cm soil depth. Soil moisture and belowground biomass explained 79% of the variation of the mean soil solution DOC concentration to 40 cm soil depth in 2007.";"Luo, Caiyun

In this study, we show that forest fragmentation provokes surprisingly rapid and profound alterations in tropical tree community. We examine forest fragments in the tropical region using high-resolution satellite imagery taken between 1973 and 2004 in the Southern Western Ghats (India) in relation to landscape patterns and phytosociological datasets. We have distinguished fragmentation in six categories—interior, perforated, edge, transitional, patch, and undetermined—around each forested pixel. Furthermore, we have characterized each of the fragment class in the evergreen and semi-evergreen forest in terms of its species composition and richness, its species similarity and abundance, and its regeneration status. Different landscape metrics have been used to infer patterns of land-use changes. Contiguous patches of >1,000 ha covered 90% of evergreen forest in 1973 with less porosity and minimal plantation and anthropogenic pressures; whereas in 2004, the area had 67% forest coverage and a high level of porosity, possibly due to Ochlandra spread and increased plantations which resulted in the loss of such contiguous patches. Results highlight the importance of landscape metrics in monitoring land-cover change over time.

The right of exclusion allows owners to prevent others from exercising a right of access. Historically, access and then exclusion contributed to a sense of self-determination and personal freedom in the American landscape. Governing agencies reserve four rights for their use: condemnation, regulation, taxation, and escheat. Using these rights, as well as market purchases, the State of New York has established a Forest Preserve, created an Adirondack Park, and managed private land that remains inside park boundaries. Over the past 15 years, the State has also acquired easements to obtain some rights from private landowners. These transactions have grown increasingly complex, involving not only conservation easements, to prevent subdivision and development, but also easements for access, trespass, recreation, and harvest. Special interests have become involved in the acquisition process through legal requirements as well as the need for financial assistance and technical advice.

Land reforms were successfully implemented in the state of West Bengal througha special program undertaken in 1978 by the then state government. These reformsbrought large amount of land under permanent and inheritable tenancy. We use asurvey data of nearly 9000 plots from 2000 households in 142 villages in WestBengal to ascertain that both productivity and long-term investments on such landare significantly lower than the land under ownership. We also find evidence forlower levels of input usage on the tenancy plots as compared to those which arefully owned by the cultivator.

To date, there has been little published research on landscape metrics that include social perceptions of landscape. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social landscape metrics that quantify human perceptions of place resulting from the use of public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS). We present and explain a set of social landscape metrics that measure the composition and configuration of human perceptions of landscapes from multiple study areas using empirical data from PPGIS studies. We distinguish between two classes of social landscape metrics, boundary and inductive, present methods to develop them, and describe some of their applications to land use planning and management. We conclude with a discussion of future research needs for advancing knowledge about social landscape metrics.";"Brown, Gregory Gordon

Specifically, the paper charts the emergence of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association (IRDA) as a vocal campaigner for private property rights and a laissez-faire approach to accommodating new housing development in the open countryside. For the IRDA, postcolonial narratives and national(ist) identities provide an important vocabulary for protest and opposition to state regulation by: 1) providing a discursive device to create a shared storyline of rural struggle; 2) providing an exclusionary device, whereby drawing on ‘memory’ and representations of rurality creates an insider/outsider discourse where some voices are cast as illegitimate; and 3) providing a frame for placing emotional knowledge at the centre of planning and landscape policy-making. This paper questions the authenticity of this policy narrative and addresses the validity of self-acclaimed knowledge within the landscape and rural policy arena. More broadly, the paper attempts to enhance understanding of how memory shapes policy narratives in the (re)production of cultural landscapes.";"Scott, Mark";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400185713";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2011.637620";"";"";"";"91-114"

A total of 537 soil samples were collected based on a 30m×30m grid in the study area. Soil P was very variable, ranging from 1.3mg/l to 113.5mg/l, with an average of 6.19mg/l. Soil Mg ranged from 134.7mg/l to 685.2mg/l, with an average of 354.4mg/l. Soil K ranged from 20.1mg/l to 433mg/l, with an average of 174.5mg/l. Soil Mg followed a normal distribution, while the other soil properties followed neither a normal nor a log-normal distribution. Box-Cox transformation was applied to achieve normality, followed by geostatistical analyses, including variogram surface analysis, calculation of experimental variograms and model fitting. Variograms were markedly anisotropic for the variables of soil Mg, K, pH and LR, implying the directional features of their spatial distribution patterns. For soil P, an omni-directional spherical model was used to describe the spatial autocorrelation. For soil Mg, a nested model (an exponential model combined with a Gaussian model) was used to fit the variogram. GIS mapping for the studied soil variables was achieved using trans-Gaussian kriging. Soil nutrient index information was applied to classify nutrient concentrations in GIS maps to provide guidance for site-specific fertilizer or slurry application. High soil P concentrations (>8mg/l) were found at the areas surrounding the main farmyard and close to the traffic route, due to high applications of cattle and pig slurry. For these places, no more P fertilizer or slurry was needed to avoid economic loss and environmental pollution. While at the places where soil P concentrations were lower than 5mg/l, appropriate P fertilizer or slurry was needed to obtain optimal grass output. For soil Mg, pH and LR, the general east-west directional spatial patterns were observed, with soil pH playing an important role. These maps provide useful information for agronomic and environmental management.";"Fu, Weijun

Two climate simulations from the GCM–RCM Perturbed Physics Ensemble developed by the UK Met Office Hadley Centre, broadly representing the extremes of future climate simulations, were downscaled and applied to a grid-based dynamic national water balance and nitrate model for Scotland. Results from this model were cross-compared with multiple simulations using synthetic future climate data generated by the 2009 UK Climate Projections Weather Generator (WG) for two selected catchments. At a national scale the model predicted relatively small effects of climate change in terms of spatially and temporally averaged means, but with significant regional variability. Future changes in the seasonality of nitrate losses were also predicted, but with a high degree of uncertainty as to the scale of this change demonstrated by the different climate simulations. A land use scenario was developed in which food security is a very high priority for Scotland and this was linked with a classification of future land capability. Application of this scenario with the national scale model indicated greater changes in nitrate pollution caused by the land use change than those caused by the direct impacts of climate change on hydrological functioning. The multiple climate simulations applied at a catchment scale demonstrated that the two national scale simulations broadly represent likely bounds in future climate, although a probability figure cannot be assigned to them.";"Dunn, S.M.

We used GIS to evaluate strategies that placed highest priority on: smallest patches of cogongrass, largest patches of cogongrass, and cogongrass patches on land considered high-value under military training and conservation priorities on Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center (CSJFTC), MS. Strategies were first evaluated using predicted increase in area of new growth prevented, if prioritized patches were treated with herbicide. Travel and other time needed to implement strategies were then assessed as they affected total area treated. Assuming equivalent areas treated, predicted total reduction in area was consistently highest for the strategy prioritizing smallest patches and lowest for the strategy prioritizing largest patches. However, travel and other time was sufficiently reduced for the strategy prioritizing patches on high-value land compared to the other strategies to suggest that this strategy would result in the greatest reduction in area infested with cogongrass. Analyses of spatial distribution and size of infestations can assist land managers with selecting the appropriate strategy for controlling invasive species.";"Yager, Lisa Y.

The unequal distribution of land in Brazil, and the neglect of this problem by successive Brazilian governments contributed greatly to the organisation of rural movements striving for the implementation of land reform in the country. The struggle for land therefore frames the MST collective action and legitimates its raison d'être as a social movement. The MST framing process, carried out mainly by the movement leaders and organisers, intends to unify the social movement by articulating private beliefs, interpretations and preferences into shared values and meanings. However, this process of framing does not take place without competition or/and conflict: leaders are many times forced to compete with other institutions, with the media, or even with inherited cultural understandings which provide alternative frames. This paper focuses particularly on the conflicting process of framing internal to the MST. More specifically, the present paper looks at how the MST leaders/organisers frame, and interpret, community and land differently from the MST settlers/followers whose lived experiences and inherited cultural understandings naturally informed their perceptions both on community and land.";"Caldeira, R.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300862791";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.12.001";"";"";"";"150-160"

Cluster Analysis technique was used to classify landowners into four groups—amenity focused rural, amenity focused urban, passive rural, and passive urban landowners—based on ownership objectives and rural and urban residence of the landowner. A relatively higher proportion (58%) of amenity focused rural landowners were familiar with red oak borer problems while the level of familiarity was more or less similar among passive rural (35%), amenity focused urban (36%), and passive urban (33%) landowners. Urban residents primarily received information about the red oak borer through mass media whereas rural residents relied on personal communication. Those that had taken some steps to reduce red oak borer impacts ranged from 14 to 19% among amenity focused urban, passive rural, and amenity focused rural landowners while none of the passive urban landowners had taken any action. The results from our study also suggest that targeting landowners based on their ownership objectives may be useful to stimulate forest management. If suitably targeted to amenity focused landowners, personal communication, although expensive and time-consuming, can be fruitful and a more efficient way to optimize resources.";"Surendra, G.C.

It is proposed, initially, the existence of two conflicting explanations for this fact: the first, that blames our historical heritage, characterized by the predominance of the latifundio, and the second, that sees in this fact a technological determinism, with the implication that lesser concentration in agriculture would involve a loss of economic efficiency. This paper, however, attributes to the labor, land and credit policies directed to agriculture, instituted in the decade of 1960, the major responsibility for this problem. As the analysis shows, these policies turned unviable the agricultural temporary labor market and family farm, at the same time that they stimulated agricultural mechanization and large-scale production. The paper ends up proposing a deregulation both of agricultural labor and land markets, as well as a drastic reduction in the subsidized agricultural credit.

Este artigo discute as causas do padrão concentrador do desenvolvimento agrícola brasileiro recente, expresso no predomínio da produção em grande escala, elevado índice de mecanização e baixa absorção de mão de obra não qualificada. Cita, inicialmente, a existência de duas posições antagônicas que procuram explicar esse fato: uma, que culpa a herança latifundiária de nossa agricultura, e a outra, que vê nisso um determinismo tecnológico, não havendo, assim, possibilidade de atuar sobre esse problema sem incorrer numa perda em termos de eficiência econômica. Este trabalho, contudo, atribui às políticas trabalhista agrícola, fundiária e de crédito agrícola, instituídas na década de 1960, a responsabilidade maior por esse problema. Conforme a análise apresentada, essas políticas inviabilizaram o mercado de trabalho agrícola temporário e a agricultura familiar, ao mesmo tempo em que fomentaram a mecanização agrícola e o predomínio da produção em grande escala.

The methodology builds on the evidence that multitemporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images bring significant information on the spatial distribution of forest surfaces. Consequently, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images are potentially useful to improve forest-area assessment based on ground data. This expectation is verified in Tuscany (central Italy) using forest-area references extracted from the Coordination of Information on Environment (CORINE) land-cover map. The accuracy of forest-area statistics obtained at province level by different reference samplings is first assessed. Next, locally calibrated regression analyses are applied to multitemporal MODIS NDVI images in order to obtain per-pixel forest-area estimates. Two statistical methods (the direct expansion and the regression estimator) are finally used to combine these estimates with the ground data and produce corrected per-province statistics. The experimental results confirm that MODIS NDVI data contain relevant information on forest distribution, which can be efficiently extended over the land surface by locally calibrated regressions. The obtained estimates can be combined with the ground data for enhancing forest-area assessment at province level. To this aim, the regression estimator gives the best performance for all sampling densities of the reference data.";"Maselli, Fabio";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400106842";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.510490";"";"";"";"6379-6393"

Then, the outdoor land cover was compared between the two residence types. Vector fitting in ordination space assessed the influences of socioeconomic and legacy effects on plant compositions. Finally, generalized linear models (GLMs) assessed the influence of these variables on garden structures. Relevant differences exist in the plant compositions of primary and secondary residences. Furthermore, secondary residences have larger areas of trees, shrubs, flowers and swimming pools, while vegetable gardens are more common at primary residences.

Several proposals have assumed that this would also eliminate associated freight movement through this area of Minneapolis. However, there would still be a need to move materials such as sand and gravel, cement, steel products, and other construction materials into Minneapolis; and scrap metals from Minneapolis. Truck movements of grain, fertilizer and other commodities from/to northwest of Minneapolis would be rerouted over land through or around Minneapolis to utilize downstream harbors. This study estimates the private costs and public externality costs imposed by this 'modal shift' from barge to truck. These cost estimates include private haulage costs, the public costs due to changes in highway maintenance requirements, and externalities due differences in fuel consumption, changes in air emissions, highway congestion impacts, and highway accident impacts. Facility relocation and required public and private infrastructure investments were not estimated.   Coefficients from the FHWA Highway Cost Allocation Study (HCAS) are used to monetize the estimated public and externality costs. Results from the ""most likely"" scenario indicate an addition of 66,000 truckloads traveling 1.2 million miles in the metro area each year. Increases in transport costs to shippers or customers exceed $4 million annually, increases in highway maintenance exceed $.6 million while public externality costs estimated with the HCAS coefficients exceed $.48 million annually.

We selected 12 populations from mown and grazed calcareous grassland in six regions of central Europe. At each population site, we collected seed material to produce plants for a morphological and phenological analysis of the species in a simulation experiment, which comprised three treatments (control, simulated mowing and simulated grazing). The simulation experiment revealed a clear morphological and phenological differentiation of S. columbaria. Plants from the two treatment types differed in size, since individuals from mown sites had longer top peduncles than individuals from grazed sites. Individuals from mown populations flowered earlier than individuals from grazed populations. In the control treatment, individuals from both habitat types produced a similar number of fruiting capitulums. When subjected to simulated mowing, the reproductive success of the individuals was clearly reduced. Plants from mown habitats produced, however, a significantly larger number of fruiting capitulums than plants from grazed habitats. Simulated grazing reduced the reproductive success stronger than simulated mowing but differences between individuals from both habitat types were not significant.

We studied natural vegetation recovery on abandoned vehicle tracks in the central Mongolia steppe through vegetation surveys and stable isotopic techniques. The following issues were addressed: (i) invasion of pioneering plant species, (ii) alteration of soil surface features, and (iii) contribution of revegetated plants to soil organic matter (SOM). The pioneering plant species that firstly invaded the abandoned tracks are those that could germinate, root and survive in the compacted track surface.Salsola collina is one of these candidate plants. Due to revegetation, soil surface hardness was reduced. With the improvement of surface microenvironmental conditions, other plants began to colonize and establish; concomitantly species richness and species diversity increased. Carbon isotope ratios of SOM at the top surface layer indicated that C₄-derived carbon contributed more to SOM in the early phase of recovery and decreased with further recovery.";"Li, Sheng-Gong

Trends in disturbance features, fuel characteristics, ground layer composition, and woody plants dynamics under combinations of withholding fire and storm-burning over a 3-year period were measured on 19 plots in three landscape settings. Population dynamics of M. viridiflora are described in detail and 20-year population projections based on transition matrices under different fire regimes generated. Numerous M. viridiflora suckers occurred within the grass layer, increasing each year regardless of fire regime, and were rapidly recruited to the canopy in the absence of fire. Storm-burning had little impact on fuel, ground layer or woody plant composition, but maintained open vegetation structure by substantially reducing recruitment of M. viridiflora suckers to the sapling layer, and by reducing the above-grass-layer abundance of several other invasive woody species. Population projections indicated that withholding fire for 20 years could cause a sevenfold increase of M. viridiflora density on Ti-tree flats, and that annual to triennial storm-burning should be effective at maintaining a stable open vegetation structure. These findings argue against vegetation thickening being an inevitable consequence of climate change. We conclude that a fire regime that includes regular storm-burning can be effective for maintaining grasslands and grassy woodlands being invaded by M. viridiflora.";"CROWLEY, GABRIEL

"AGRIS:US201400163406";"Evidence of sustainable intensification among British farms";"";"Several influential reports have suggested that one of the most appropriate responses to expected food shortages and ongoing environmental degradation is sustainable intensification, i.e. the increase of food production with at worst no increase in environmental harm, and ideally environmental benefit. Here we sought evidence of sustainable intensification among British farmers by selecting innovative arable, dairy, mixed and upland farms and analysing their own data on yields, inputs and land use and management for 2006 and 2011. The evidence was obtained by interview, and was interpreted in terms of the ecosystem services of food production (GJha⁻¹, where area took into account estimated area to grow any imported animal feeds), regulation of climate, air and water quality (modelled emissions of GHGs (CO₂eha⁻¹), ammonia (kgha⁻¹) and nitrate loss (kgha⁻¹)) and biodiversity (using an index based on the presence of habitats and management). Several farms have increased both food production and other ecosystem services over this time by increasing yields, using resources more efficiently and/or enhancing biodiversity, and sometimes by reducing livestock numbers and increasing cropping. The motivation has been to improve farm profitability through increasing food production, reducing input costs and accessing public payments through agri-environment schemes and generating renewable energy. Such sustainable intensification was not achieved by farmers who increased meat or milk yields. Sustainable intensification can be achieved when the correct drivers are in place to influence the actions of individual farmers. Also, it is possible to indicate sustainable intensification by using a small number of high-level indicators derived from data that farmers already hold, though such an approach may not capture the impacts of farmer innovative practices.";"Firbank, L.G.

"AGRIS:US201600099617";"Effective Weed Management, Collective Action, and Landownership Change in Western Montana";"";"Rural landscapes are increasingly diverse and heterogeneous, involving a mix of small and large parcels, amenity and agricultural properties, and resident and absentee owners. Managing invasive plants in landscapes with changing ownership requires understanding the views and practices of different landowners. We surveyed landowners in two rural valleys with 26% absentee ownership and a large number of small parcels in Missoula County, Montana. Landowners indicated a high level of awareness and concern about weeds; more than 80% agreed that weeds are a problem in their valley. Seventy-eight percent of landowners managed weeds, but only 63% were effective at weed management. Absentee owners were far less likely to manage weeds on their properties and less likely to utilize herbicides, as compared with resident landowners. Landowners reported that seeds coming from adjacent properties were the most significant barrier to effective weed control. Many landowners manage weeds to be a good neighbor and believe that cooperation between neighbors is critical to weed management.Management Implications: Most rural areas have a diversity of landowners with a range of parcel sizes and management goals. Many of these landscapes are experiencing an influx of amenity migrants and absentee landowners, increasing the number of landowners responsible for weed management. Weed managers and extension agents can benefit from a better understanding of the views and practices of these landowners so that they can develop programs to meet landowner needs. Based on a survey of rural landowners in western Montana, we recommend that in landscapes with a diversity of landowners, practitioners emphasize a range of weed management approaches (from herbicides to biocontrols) and benefits (from wildlife habitat to scenic beauty). In particular, landowners who are concerned about the safety of herbicides might need information on alternative methods. Because absentee landowners are less likely to manage weeds, managers need to find ways to engage these landowners in weed management. Effectively engaging absentee landowners might require innovative communication strategies that involve neighbors, emails, and real estate agents. Further, because seeds coming in from neighboring properties are often seen as a major barrier to effective weed management, engaging a broad range of landowners, including absentee landowners, is critical. Weed managers, extension agents, and community groups can organize landowners and small groups of neighbors to share information, resources, and labor, and build social norms about appropriate weed management.";"Yung, Laurie

"AGRIS:US201500183435";"Impacts of agricultural land-use dynamics on erosion risks and options for land and water management in Northern Mongolia";"";"In Mongolia, nomadic herders have successfully been grazing livestock for more than a millennium. However, in recent years, concerns have increased that changes in management and higher livestock stocking rates may negatively affect vegetation and increase soil erosion, overland flow and sediment load of rivers. In addition, ambitious agricultural policies increase the intensity of agricultural land use thus enforcing a conversion of grassland to agricultural land which is far more susceptible to erosion. In this study, we tackle the question how recent land-use dynamics influence erosion risks and which implications these require on water resources management. The study was part of a larger research effort, studying implementation options for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM); in this paper, specifically impacts of land use and land-use change on water resources are studied. The study has been carried out in the Kharaa river basin (KRB) in Northern Mongolia, in which grazing and agriculture play key roles. As several erosion and run-off-relevant factors such as slope, soil type or land use and land cover are widely varying in the KRB, sub-regions of the catchment have been analysed to identify susceptible combinations of environmental and land management factors. In our study we identified that erosion risks in the sub-catchments under current land use and management calculated with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation sum up to approximately 2–4 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹for steppe and 4–9 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹for croplands, while erosion rates calculated using¹³⁷CS measurements resulted in 2–3 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹on steppe and 15 Mg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹on cropland. Erosion risk scenarios indicate that land use change as well as management and climate factors can reduce (−30 %) or aggravate erosion risks up to sevenfold and contribute to additional challenges in water and soil management in the KRB. Strategies have to be developed to limit land conversion and implement soil protection in erosion prone sub-regions. IWRM has the potential to bridge sectorial measures, e.g. in agriculture, rural development or nature protection, but erosion and runoff-related impacts currently are addressed in different institutions, legal frameworks and regulations, which may slow down or hamper efficient measures.";"Priess, J.

For last decades, landscape has gradually become a stake of land use planning in Europe. The European Landscape Convention formalizes landscape as an issue of general interest and promotes a democratic landscape planning. However, landscape is rarely in practice the subject of pluridisciplinary and concerted approaches. So land use planning searches for a landscape concept able to gather together the various disciplinary and societal points of view. This federative concept can help it to build concerted policies of landscape planning. To question about and clarify nature, scale and ways of reading of landscape then enable us to develop a landscape concept that holds two positions in land use planning.

The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter determined from satellite passive microwave remote sensing provides for global LSP monitoring that is sensitive to changes in vegetation canopy water content and biomass, and insensitive to atmosphere and solar illumination constraints. Direct field measures of canopy water content and biomass changes desired for LSP validation are generally lacking due to the prohibitive costs of maintaining regional monitoring networks. Alternatively, a normalized microwave reflectance index (NMRI) derived from GPS base station measurements is sensitive to daily vegetation water content changes and may provide for effective microwave LSP validation. We compared multiyear (2007–2011) NMRI and satellite VOD records at over 300 GPS sites in North America, and their derived SOS metrics for a subset of 24 homogenous land cover sites to investigate VOD and NMRI correspondence, and potential NMRI utility for LSP validation. Significant correlations (P < 0.05) were found at 276 of 305 sites (90.5� %), with generally favorable correspondence in the resulting SOS metrics (r ² = 0.73, P < 0.001, RMSE� =� 36.8� days). This study is the first attempt to compare satellite microwave LSP metrics to a GPS network derived reflectance index and highlights both the utility and limitations of the NMRI data for LSP validation, including spatial scale discrepancies between local NMRI measurements and relatively coarse satellite VOD retrievals.";"Jones, Matthew O.

Results of three studies spanning 1985 to 2004 were used to develop and evaluate a multiagency research and extension program known as the Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program. Program-sponsored education and research aimed at encouraging landowners to change woodland management has been reflected in a significant reduction in oak cutting and an increase in oak planting. Recent changes have come with the times: landowners were as likely to have consulted land trusts about oaks as Cooperative Extension, and the number engaged in production of crops or livestock continued to decline. On the other hand, the proportion of landowners, including ranchers, reporting that they live in the oak woodland to benefit from ecosystem services such as natural beauty, recreation, and lifestyle benefits significantly increased. Though owners of large properties and ranchers were more strongly against regulation and “government interference” than other respondents, this did not appear to affect oak values and management. Property size remained significantly related to landowner goals, values, and practices, with those producing livestock owning most of the larger properties. There has been a decline in the number of properties being studied due to conversion of some from oak woodland to other uses, though the remaining respondents still own at least 10% of the woodlands. Landowners with conservation easements or those who are willing to consider them, who believe oak recruitment is inadequate, or who use advisory services were significantly less likely to cut oaks and more likely to plant them. Policy, management, and outreach that support synergies between production and conservation activities, and that combine ecosystem service-based income streams that encourage keeping land intact and increased land-use stability, are needed to support conservation of private rangelands.";"Huntsinger, Lynn

"AGRIS:US201301847196";"Early Decomposition of Ashe Juniper (Juniperus ashei) Wood in Open and Shaded Habitat";"";"Grasslands of the Edwards Plateau of central Texas have been extensively altered through woody species encroachment, particularly as a result of increasing abundance of the invasive native shrub, Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei). Over the last several decades there has been widespread mechanical removal of the species. The wood is often left in place to decompose, either mulched or not. Where the wood is left to decompose might have some bearing on its rate of decomposition. This study was conducted to determine the rates of Ashe juniper wood decomposition as a function of open vs. shaded habitat and the potential effect of wood decomposition on nutrient inputs into this system. Wood decomposition in this arid ecosystem might be expected to occur more rapidly in shaded habitat where the moisture and temperature regimes would be more favorable for wood-decomposing fungi. On the other hand, during times of low rainfall we might expect wood to decompose more rapidly when exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation. In our experiment, we found no difference between open and shaded treatments. Wood biomass loss occurred rapidly over the first 3–4 mo of the study and slowed for the remaining 2 yr. Wood carbon (C) increased only slightly (7.3%), but nitrogen (N) increased significantly (176%). As a consequence of changes in wood nitrogen, CN decreased through time. Results of this study suggest that the wood decomposition process in open and shaded habitats in this arid ecosystem during a time of low rainfall do not differ. Our findings also suggest that land managers aiming to establish native species following felling of Ashe juniper should do so in the first year when nutrient release from decomposing wood is the highest.";"Lyons, Kelly G.

It is focused on assessment of climatic and environmental changes that took place since late Neolithic to Roman times, trying to discriminate natural from anthropogenic signals. Based on an integration of archaeological, geomorphological, stratigraphic, pedological, volcanological and soil charcoal (pedoanthracological) data, the following paleoclimatic/environmental reconstruction is proposed: a warm and humid, seasonally contrasted climate, with an overall geomorphological stability suited for soil development, characterized the late prehistoric environment (Holocene climatic optimum), dominated by a widespread oak forest. The main pedogenetic processes consisted in organic matter accumulation, clay illuviation, phyllosilicate and short-range order mineral neogenesis from weathering of granite and volcanic ash, sourced from late Pleistocene–Holocene eruptions of the Aeolian Islands. One or more mid-Holocene episodes of climate deterioration towards drier conditions (indicated by a decrease of clay translocation processes and possible irreversible dehydration of poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates into phyllosilicate clay minerals) promoted intense land degradation. This was in turn enhanced by increasing human activities for settlement and resource exploitation (among which deforestation and ploughing for agriculture), which led to a shift of the vegetation cover towards a dominant pine forest between 3 ka BP and the Roman epoch. Humid and possibly cooler climatic conditions during the late Holocene are indicated by the decrease of clay illuviation, coupled with short-range order components prevailing over phyllosilicate clays during Roman soil formation.";"Pelle, Teresa

We investigated the explanatory power of a group of opportunity cost variables in the decision to participate in a landscape-level conservation initiative on the Agulhas Plain, Cape Floristic Region. Opportunity cost variables outperformed affiliation and demographic variables when used in one model and had almost as much explanatory power as the combined model when used on their own. In the opportunity cost model, conservation was positively related to farm size and education and negatively related to share of income from farming and size of the remnant of natural vegetation on the farm. Of these relationships, that between education and participation was the most elastic: a 1% increase in education led to an almost 2% increase in the likelihood of participating in conservation. A large group of identity variables jointly explained nothing, but a subset of age, gender and Afrikaans language status had some explanatory power when used separately. We suspected this subset of demographic variables to have done nothing but proxy patterns of opportunity cost in the farming community. When re-estimated with the untransformed remnant as a share of farm size rather than an area, similar results were obtained and the negative sign on the remnant was confirmed. We concluded that understanding what opportunity cost conservation imposes on private landholders is not only important, but critical, for predicting which private land will come into and stay in conservation.";"Conradie, Beatrice

The landscape contains a variety of land ownerships, fire regimes, and management strategies. Our comparative hazard assessment evaluated the effects of two management strategies on crown fire potential and northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) conservation: (1) no action, and (2) active manipulation of hazardous fuels. Model simulations indicated that active management of sites with high fire hazard was more favorable to spotted owl conservation over the long term (75years) than no management, given our modeling assumptions. Early in the model simulation, young seral stages were mostly responsible for high fire hazard, and active management in young stands tended to perpetuate that hazard. Later in the simulation, older seral stages accounted for most of the high fire hazard and active management could be used to ameliorate that hazard. At any given time period, ⩽8% of the landscape was identified for treatment. Fire hazard fluctuated over time depending on vegetation regeneration, maturation, and response to treatments. Active management resulted in greater numbers of potential spotted owl territories in lower fire hazard conditions, particularly during later years of our simulation. Our results support the contention that short term risks to protected species from active management can be less than longer term risk of no management in fire-prone landscapes. Thus, a short term, risk averse strategy for protected species in fire-prone landscapes may not be the best long term alternative for conservation. We caution that this finding warrants landscape-level field evaluation and structured adaptive management and monitoring prior to broad scale adoption as environmental policy.";"Roloff, Gary J.

"AGRIS:QL2012002501";"GIS and remote sensing integrated environmental impact assessment of irrigation project in Finchaa Valley area";"";"This research was conducted in order to assess the environmental impacts of Finchaa irrigation project using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Because of the limited resources only some environmental parameters were selected. These parameters are natural vegetation, soil/land, water quality, climate and health conditions. The normalized vegetation index (NDVI) analysis was used to detect the spatial and temporal change of vegetation biomass in the study area. The result indicated that the natural vegetation biomass is declining. This is mainly due to the expansion of agricultural land and escalating human made structures in the area. The water physico-chemical analysis demonstrated that the down stream water has more chemical substances and degraded physical properties than the up stream counterparts. The direct leakage of industrial liquid waste and the agro-chemicals from irrigation fields are supposed to contribute for this result. The GIS analysis of a 100 meter buffer around Major rivers and tributary streams is found to be a necessary action to mitigate the problem of pollution. The soil chemical and physical property analysis in the irrigated and non irrigated fields reveals that the soil samples taken from irrigated fields contain higher phosphorous, Nitrogen and organic carbon compared to its counter parts. The use of agro-chemicals in the irrigation fields contribute for the result. From the twenty two years rain fall, temperature and humidity data no abrupt inclining or declining trend is observed that could tell the possible impacts of the project. The post irrigation development years witness that some water born diseases and malaria case records have increased. It is also found out that expansion of irrigation fields and the respective Malaria case records are positively correlated. Generally, despite the significance of the Finchaa irrigation project, it has negative environmental repercussions.

"AGRIS:US201300949092";"impact of the introduction of transgenic crops in Argentinean agriculture";"";"Since the early 1990s, Argentinean grain production underwent a dramatic increase in grains production (from 26 million tons in 1988/89 to over 75 million tons in 2002/2003). Several factors contributed to this ""revolution,"" but probably one of the most important was the introduction of new genetic modification (GM) technologies, specifically herbicide-tolerant soybeans. This article analyses this process, reporting on the economic benefits accruing to producers and other participating actors as well as some of the environmental and social impacts that could be associated with the introduction of the new technologies. In doing so, it lends attention to the synergies between GM soybeans and reduced-tillage technologies and also explores some of the institutional factors that shed light on the success of this case, including aspects such as the early availability of a reliable biosafety mechanism and a special intellectual property rights (IPR) situation. In its concluding comments, this article also posts a number of questions about the replicability of the experience and some pending policy issues regarding the future exploitation of GM technologies in Argentina.";"Trigo, E.J.

This work tries to fill the gap by analyzing the relationship between farm-size and
productivity in Rwanda.

Our results confirm the existence of an inverse relationship between farm-size and land productivity. Smaller farms have a lower opportunity cost of labor and a higher shadow price of land compared to larger farms. These disparities are the results of constraints faced by smaller farms (a) to access land, and (b) to access labor market opportunities. The observed relationship is affected by land quality proxied by erosion (average annual soil loss), percentage of area fertilized and investment in soil conservation, and by the share of high value crops in gross value of output.

Major implications to draw from the study include the necessity to (a) control market imperfections in rural Rwanda; (b) invest in land improvement (fertilization and soil conservation devices); and (c) promote high value crops.";"Byiringiro, Fidele Usabuwera";"";"";"AGRIS";"1995-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"RWA;002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012202232";"http://purl.umn.edu/11215";"";"";"";""

The objective of this study is to determine if a differential exists between the market or assessed farmland price and the price a farmland owner would accept from a strange. Further this study aims to determine if attachment value has an affect on this differential. Qualitative evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that attachment value to farmland affects the WTA and that variables such as length of ownership tenure, family closeness, and community closeness affect the level of attachment value. The quantitative results provide evidence that there is a significant differential between the WTA and the assessed price and further that family closeness and education levels are significant in explaining the differential.

We find that improved water use efficiency increased profit in the presence of modern irrigation technologies and water trading. Salinity risk downstream is reduced due to the fall in saline discharge from the catchment, and irrigation water is traded away from ecologically significant regions. It is important that the institutional setup gives confidence in the security of water supplies. When irrigators can be assured about the security of their water entitlements in the context of water reform policies, incentives emerge for them to invest in water efficient irrigation technologies and to participate in the water market. Environmental performance can thereby be improved without the need for financial support from the government. Further, minimal government intervention is required to address salinity; given the conjunctive nature of secondary salinity and water use it can be cost-efficient to address both environmental flow and salinity mitigation with a single policy instrument.";"Lee, Lisa Y.

The paper traces the historical dominance of irrigated agriculture in Spanish water policy. It analyses the water efficiency concept at the macro level, by evaluating recent national policy initiatives and public investment programmes over the last decade to modernise irrigation, which anticipated large water savings. “Water efficiency” is then framed in its socio-political context, by looking at debates and discussions over the past, current and future role of irrigation, key evaluation criteria and objectives for large scale irrigation modernisation plans, what are the links to water rights and allocation, benefits and beneficiaries from water savings and important unanticipated consequences and co-benefits in modernisation, and the reform of agricultural policies. Finally it identifies the central role played at national, European and global levels by agricultural (and energy) policies as key external drivers for the long term viability of modern irrigation on social, environmental and economic-productivity terms.";"Lopez-Gunn, E.

Results showed that primary predictors and the predictive ability of spatial regression differed with variables and scales. Topology, distance to river source, land use/land cover (LULC), population density, and gross domestic product (GDP) can be primary predictors for the pattern of certain hazardous chemical variables in 1996 and 2003. LULC types were good predictors for changes of cyanide and heavy metals, while GDP and population density contributed to petroleum dynamics between 1996 and 2003.

A literature survey shows that mainly socio-cultural and some regulating services are dependent on particular species, groups of species, or habitat types, while many other services, especially those related to provisioning, rely more heavily on vegetation structures and land cover. These findings are exemplified and discussed using a case study on Natura 2000 sites in the Ore Mountains in the German state of Saxony. Only a small portion of the species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive is bound to particular Natura 2000 habitat types. Such species can be regarded as indicators both for these habitats and for the ecosystem services they provide, as well as for indicating changes in ecosystems and related services, which are caused by climate change and land use changes (e.g. due to flood mitigation measures and the enhanced use of renewable energies).";"Bastian, Olaf";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land cover;climate change";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500163073";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.05.016";"";"";"";"12-22"

Coevolutionary qualitative-type models are presented.  There has been a failure amongst advocates of structural adjustment policies (involving the extension of markets and economic globalisation) to take account of coevolutionary principles and allow for historical differences in the evolution of communities and their varied circumstances.  This lack of sensitivity has had unfortunate social and ecological consequences for some communities eg  The Russian Federation and subsistence agriculturalists in some less developed countries.  The evolution of globalized market systems involving industrial/commercial agriculture (largely dependent on inputs external to the farm) under the 'patronage' of oligopolistic suppliers is seen to increasingly threaten the balance between social and ecological systems and as undermining the sustainability of both.

"AGRIS:US201500218985";"Emulating nurse plants to restore oak forests";"";"Several forested areas of Mexico are dominated by oaks (Quercus spp.), but these forests have suffered strong changes in land use throughout the last century and need to be restored. Most of these areas, however, are within seasonally dry ecosystems and heavy losses of oak seedlings occur in the dry season. Nurse plants that ameliorate extreme environmental conditions have been proved to enhance the success of reforestation practices in these ecosystems. Nevertheless, at several sites in Mexico the density of putative nurse plants is too low to consider this practice as a viable restoration strategy. This study explores the possibility of emulating the effects of nurse plants by means of artificial-shade structures. The study areas were located at the ecological park Flor del Bosque (State of Puebla, México). At the beginning of the rainy season, seedlings of Quercus castanea and Quercus laurina were transplanted beneath and outside artificial-shade structures at two deforested areas of the park. We monitored seedling mortality during 22 weeks, until the middle of dry season; each week we recorded if individual seedlings were killed by abiotic stress or predation. We also measured chlorophyll fluorescence on seedlings to assess whether the shade structures improve their physiological performance. Comparisons of mortality rates indicated that, at both experimental sites, oak seedlings were less affected by drought and predation beneath the shade structures than outside them. Indeed, seedlings beneath these structures showed higher physiological performances. This suggests that artificial-shade structures can emulate the effects of nurse plants at deforested sites, and that this strategy could help to improve the recovery of oak forests.";"Badano, Ernesto Iván

"AGRIS:US201600189172";"Trees, grass, and fire in humid savannasâThe importance of life history traits and spatial processes";"";"We develop a model to investigate how trees can invade the grass stratum in humid savannas despite repeated fires. In the literature, it is clear that fire reduces tree canopy in savannas. However, fire alone may not be sufficient to prevent tree invasion because there are ecological mechanisms that hamper fire spread by undermining the continuity and density of the grass stratum, which is the means of fire propagation in savannas. Our model is spatially explicit and individual-based, and includes two important factors characterizing the interactions between fire, trees, and grass in savannas, viz. space and the strategies that trees use to cope with fire. The strategies that trees employ against fire emerge from life history traits. According to these strategies, we classify savanna trees into three categories: resprouters, which are able to resprout after their aboveground biomass is burned; resisters, which are able to resist fire due to a thick bark even in the juvenile stages; avoiders, which are very fire-vulnerable in the juvenile stages, but are able to grow fast in the absence of fire. Our results show that trees can invade the grass stratum and finally suppress fire spread because one of the following occurs: (1) trees may resprout and form a population that persists despite repeated effective fires; (2) trees may be fire-resistant; (3) if trees are fire-vulnerable they may cluster and grow in density until fire is prevented. Our results show that fire can be effective in preventing the initiation of the invasion process in the grass stratum. However, once the invasion process has begun, fire alone is not able to reverse this process because of the strategies employed by trees. Furthermore, when a high tree density is reached, grass density is insufficient to allow effective fire spread. From a management point of view, our results imply that fire must be coupled with other factors (browsing, mechanical thinning) to reduce tree density in encroached areas.";"Accatino, Francesco

The paper reviews the nature and consequences of this process in terms of grassland management and land use changes in the Liptov region (N Slovakia) and their impacts on plant communities of fen meadows (Caricion davallianae, Caricion fuscae), wet meadows (Calthion) and mesophilous grasslands (Arrhenatherion, Cynosurion). We studied in detail the changes in structure of the rare plant community Trollio-Cirsietum (KÃ¼hn 1937) Oberd. 1957 that occurred between the first period (1974â1983) and the second period (2002â2003). We recorded the decrease in abundance of species characteristic for permanently wet and fen meadows (alliances Calthion and Caricion davallianae) and the increase in abundance of characteristic species of seasonally dried, mesophilous and thermophilous meadows and mesophilous fringes (classes Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Festuco-Brometea and alliances Molinion caeruleae, Bromion erecti and Trifolion medii). In the second studied period, a large group of mesophilous and thermophilous species appeared as new in this wet-meadow community. A cumulative impact of different factors, especially drainage and intensification of surrounding grasslands as well as abandonment of the community can represent reasons responsible for observed changes. Regardless identified changes, the community still maintains its typical character in significant proportion of the studied sites and hosts a high number of threatened plant species.";"Halada, L.

"AGRIS:US201301883411";"Land-use planning for natural hazards in New Zealand: the setting, barriers, ‘burning issues' and priority actions";"";"Land-use planners have a critical role to play in building vibrant, sustainable and hazard resilient communities in New Zealand. The policy and legal setting for natural hazards planning provides a solid foundation for good practice. But there are many examples of ‘bad practice' that result in unnecessary risks and, in some cases, exposure to repeat events and potentially devastating impacts. Much, therefore, remains to be done to improve hazards planning policy and practice in New Zealand. This article explores the questions: What role does land-use planning play in managing hazard risks in New Zealand; and what needs to be done to reduce hazard risks and build community resilience? The article starts by describing the milieu within which natural hazards planning takes place. It goes onto outline the stakeholders and institutional and legal setting for natural hazards planning in New Zealand, including barriers to realising the potential of natural hazards planning. This synthesis reveals a number of ‘burning issues', including the need to: (a) Improve understanding about the nature of hazards; (b) Prioritise risk avoidance (reduction) measures; (c) Provide national guidance for communities exposed to repeat events and address the relocation issue and (d) Mainstream climate change adaptation. Each ‘burning issue' is discussed, and priority actions are recommended to realise the potential of land-use planning to reduce natural hazard risks and build community resilience in New Zealand. Ultimately, the challenge is to develop a cooperative hazards governance approach that is founded on coordinated policies, laws and institutions, cooperative professional practice and collaborative communities.";"Glavovic, B.

"AGRIS:US2016210255";"Effects of the transformation process on socio-economic functions of ucrainian agricultural enterprises";"Auswirkungen des Transformationsprozesses auf die sozioökonomischen Funktionen ukrainischer Landwirtschaftsunternehmen.";"In the planned Soviet economy, agricultural enterprises in Ukraine played a significant role inmaintaining social infrastructure in rural areas. The state insisted that these enterprisesprovide medical care, transport infrastructure, kindergartens, schools and housing, as well asfood supplies.Over the course of transition, the economic and political conditions of agricultural enterpriseshas drastically changed. The state greatly reduced financing for rural social infrastructure.Additionally, agricultural production significantly fell. As a result, the agricultural enterprisespartially cut their support of social infrastructure in the rural areas, and in some cases, evencompletely depleted it.At the same time, the living conditions of the rural population deteriorated. Food prices roseso dramatically that food demand started to be increasingly covered from private householdplots. Further, the quality of medical services could not satisfy the needs of the ruralpopulation, and the lack of financing made it impossible to maintain the transportinfrastructure. A legal, compulsory transfer of the social infrastructure from the agriculturalenterprises to the respective communities resulted in the infrastructure's dilapidation. Inaddition, the rural population faced new social risks such as unemployment.As a result of this tense situation in the rural areas of Ukraine, the goal of this dissertation isto discuss the changes of social and economic functions of the agricultural enterprises in thecourse of transition by surveying 72 successors of the former kolkhozes and sowchoses inSumy Oblast. Based on this case study, and a historical analysis of agricultural structures andthe social security system, the following phenomena were identified:(1) In spite of the positive expectations of western experts, even after ten years of transitionthe agricultural enterprises in Ukraine demonstrate constancy in terms of their sizemeasured in hectares, livestock herd and employment, and in terms of using farm assetscollectively.(2) Despite economic difficulties, the agricultural enterprises continue providing socialservices. Moreover, the profitable enterprises provide more social financing per worker.(3) The number of workers was reduced, but in comparison to the new German federalstates, which have a similar agrarian structure, and in comparison to other transitioneconomies like Czech Republic and Hungary, for instance, the agricultural enterprises inUkraine still employ a high number of labour per hectare.A theoretical analysis of this phenomenon was conducted from both an economic andsociological perspective. In the economic literature, the methods of institutional economictheory are especially suited to explain the above mentioned phenomena since informalinstitutions prevail over formal ones. The institutional economic theories also suit thesociological analysis. Here, the focus lies on the decision-making behaviour of actors dependent on the interplay of individual actions. In this respect, historically-developednetworks play a very important role, especially under difficult general economic conditions.To ensure the improvement of agricultural enterprises' competitiveness, and to provide fairliving conditions in the rural areas, the social security system in Ukraine should be reformedin order to address these new risks. In this way, agricultural enterprises could partially pass ontheir social responsibility. It is also necessary to fundamentally re-orient the communityadministrations to fulfil their responsibilities not only formal. Finally, the managers of theagricultural enterprises in Ukraine should realise that only after operating profitably wouldthey be able to fulfil their social goals, whereas the rural population has to realise that it is notlonger possible to provide social services without payments.";"Biesold, Helga";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"de";"";"";"";"HUN;UKR;CZE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016210255";"http://purl.umn.edu/93020";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201301932052";"Perceptions of Landowners Concerning Conservation, Grazing, Fire, and Eastern Redcedar Management in Tallgrass Prairie";"";"Successful prairie restoration will depend in part on convincing private landowners with agricultural and recreational use goals to implement appropriate rangeland management practices, such as prescribed burning and cattle grazing, to control invasive species and encroachment of woody plants. However, landowners have been slow to adopt appropriate practices in the US Midwest. The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes and behaviors of private landowners toward prescribed burning and moderate stocking as rangeland management tools. A survey was mailed to 193 landowners (response rate 51%) in the Grand River Grasslands region of southern Iowa and northern Missouri. While 68% of landowners viewed grazing as a legitimate land management tool, only half of landowners thought of fire as a legitimate tool. Over 75% of respondents believed that the increase in eastern redcedar and other trees in grasslands was a problem, with 44% considering it a major problem. Although 84% of landowners said that they had taken action to control eastern redcedar, only 25% had participated in a prescribed burn. Income from agriculture and recreational goals were negatively and significantly correlated (−0.252, P=0.035). While holding recreational goals constant in the analysis, landowners reporting income from agriculture goals as very or extremely important were negatively and significantly associated with reporting environment and grassland factors as very or extremely important. Adoption of prescribed burning by private landowners might be more widespread if proponents focus on the effectiveness of fire for controlling eastern redcedar, which is viewed as a problem by most landowners in the region. Intervention efforts must include landowners with different goals as part of the promotion and educational process.";"Morton, Lois Wright

"AGRIS:US201300784415";"Introducing greenhouse gas mitigation as a development objective in rice-based agriculture: I. Generation of technical coefficients";"";"This study presents a modeling tool to assess emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the agricultural sector as affected by land-use and residue utilization options. The overall purpose of this tool is twofold: (i) a spreadsheet model for comprehensive compilation of the direct and indirect emissions from land management, residue-burning and fossil fuel consumption through on-farm and off-farm operations and (ii) a decision support tool to explore economically viable mitigation options through detailed cost-benefit analysis of different technological options. We developed TechnoGAS (technical coefficient generator for mitigation technologies of greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural sectors), which integrates analytical and expert knowledge with regional databases on bio-physical, agronomic and socio-economic features to establish input-output relationships ('Technical Coefficients') related to GHG emissions in agriculture. The approach includes emissions of methane (CH4) from rice fields, rice straw burning and cattle; carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel and soil organic carbon decline as well as nitrous oxide (N2O) from soil, rice straw burning and fertilizer use. To illustrate the approach of the spreadsheet model for comprehensive compilation of emissions, we applied TechnoGAS for an entire rice-wheat cropping cycle in the state of Haryana in northern India as a case study. Twenty technologies of rice production, which can be adopted by farmers, are analysed for their operation-specific emissions including their global warming potential (GWP). The technologies differ in terms of water regime, residue management/utilization, soil management and additives, which represent different mitigation options for GHG emissions. With the current farmers' practice in various districts in Haryana, soil-borne emissions are the major source of GHG contributing 53% of the average GWP (3288 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1) in rice followed by burning of rice straw (13% of the GWP). Cattle, farm operations, off-farm and inorganic fertilizer contributes 12%, 10%, 10% and 2% of the GWP, respectively. Emissions from wheat are relatively low (1204 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1) as there is no CH4 emission and wheat straw is not burnt. Different mitigation technologies show pronounced effects on the GWP of the rice crop and varied between 1715 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1 with continuous flooding, urea and rice straw used for building materials and 10,020 kg CO2 equivalent ha-1 with continuous flooding, and application of nutrients through organic manure. Compared to current farmers' practice, 13 technologies are found to have the potential to reduce the GWP by 8-51%, but they also reduce the net income of farmers. Upscaling of the estimates to the entire state of Haryana shows that the GWP with the current farmers' practice in rice is 2617 Gg CO2 equivalent. Modification of water management from continuous flooding to alternate flooding or application of urea alone instead of urea plus FYM will reduce the GWP by 15% and 29%, respectively, while feeding of rice straw to cattle and supplying N through urea will reduce it by 41% compared to the current practice of burning rice straw and use of FYM. The study shows that the TechnoGAS tool can be used for estimating GHG emission from various land-use types and for identifying promising mitigation options.

Cost-benefit assessment for different technologies, regions and scales";"";"New tools for land use analysis including detailed cost-benefit assessments are needed to integrate resource management for enhancing farmers' income and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper comprises an assessment of GHG emissions and economic returns under different mitigation technologies in three rice growing regions in Asia, i.e., Ilocos Norte province (Philippines), Zhejiang province (China) and Haryana state (India). Site-specific data on soil, climate and socio-economics were integrated in the previously developed spreadsheet model TechnoGAS (Technical Coefficient Generator for Mitigation Technologies of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural Sectors). Three baseline technologies that differed in terms of inorganic/organic N supply have been compared to different mitigation technologies in form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACCs). For the baseline technology of inorganic N (urea) fertilization, amendment with phosphogypsum and nitrification inhibitors are the most promising mitigation options resulting in shadow prices of less than US$10 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CE). Assuming a mix of urea and farm yard manure for the baseline, we have tested several options including different irrigation patterns and husk used as fossil fuel. Mid-season drainage had a better cost-benefit ratio (ca. US$20 per t CE) than alternate flooding, but was less profitable than husk utilization (ca. US$4 per t CE). Assuming high organic inputs, biogas technology is, in most cases, the preferable option (ca. US$10 per t CE). Finally, we compiled regional abatement cost curves for selected administrative units using the outcome from regional optimization models. Implementing the three most promising technologies required US$6000 for Dingras municipality, Ilocos Norte, in the Philippines (ca. 10³ ha of rice land potentially providing emission savings of ca. 3000 t CE), US$50,000 for Pujiang county in China (ca. 10⁴ ha providing ca. 27,000 t CE), and US$1.2 million for Karnal district in India (ca. 10⁵ ha providing ca. 220,000 t CE).";"Wassmann, R.

State wildlife agencies are generally charged with conserving all native wildlife and their habitats within their respective state. However, some have suggested that state wildlife agencies in the region are not addressing the decline of early-successional wildlife and habitats sufficiently. I investigated the extent to which 11 state agencies in this region are creating and maintaining early-successional habitats on public and private lands. The middle Atlantic subregion (five states: Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) generally affected a greater proportion of state wildlife lands than the New England subregion (six states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont): proportions range from 0.96 to 8.34, and 0.02 to 1.68%, respectively. Mowing was the most commonly used technique throughout the northeast. Only five state agencies in the northeast performed habitat management on private lands and no state affected more than 113 ha per year. Timber harvesting was infrequently used to create early-successional habitats and did not exceed 1.5% of eligible harvest area in nine of 11 states surveyed. A lack of sufficient resources was the most frequent explanation for little activity. Given that commonly used management techniques may be expensive (e.g. up to US$ 486 ha−1 for mechanical clearing to reclaim abandoned fields), state agencies will need to develop new funding sources, and use alternative and more cost-effect management tools. Additionally, agencies should consider expanding technical assistance to private landowners.";"Oehler, James D.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"landowners";"";"";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400063430";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127(03)00253-6";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201300922016";"Efficiency and Concordance of Alternative Methods for Minimizing Opportunity Costs in Conservation Planning";"";"Scarce resources and competing land-use goals necessitate efficient biodiversity conservation. Combining multicriteria analysis with conservation decision-support tools improves efficiency of conservation planning by maximizing outcomes for biodiversity while minimizing opportunity costs to society. An opportunity cost is the benefit that could have been received by taking an alternative course of action (i.e., costs to society of protecting an area for biodiversity rather than developing it for some other use). Although different ways of integrating multiple opportunity costs into conservation planning have been suggested, there have been no tests as to which method is most efficient. We compared the relative efficiency of 3 such procedures( Faith & Walker [1996] , Sarkar et al. [2004] , and a procedure of our own design) in a systematic conservation-planning framework for the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea. We devised 14 opportunity costs and assigned these to 3 scenarios representing different conservation planning concerns: food security, macro-economic development, and biodiversity persistence. For each scenario, we compared the efficiency of the 3 methods in terms of amount of biodiversity protected relative to total expenditure for each opportunity cost. All 3 methods captured similar amounts of biodiversity, but differed in total cost. Our method had the least overall cost and was therefore most efficient. Nevertheless, there was a high correlation and geographical concordance among all 3 methods, indicating a high degree of spatial overlap. This suggests that choosing an appropriate approach may often depend on contextual factors related to the design of the planning question, rather than efficiency alone.";"CAMERON, SUSAN E.

This has led to extensive water rights conflict and litigation. A tool that can reliably forecast natural aquifer discharge months ahead of peak water demand could help water practitioners and managers by providing advanced knowledge of potential water‐right mitigation requirements. The timing and magnitude of natural aquifer discharge from the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA) in southern Idaho is accurately forecast 4 months ahead of the peak water demand, which occurs annually in July. An ARIMA time‐series model with exogenous predictors (ARIMAX model) was used to develop the forecast. The ARIMAX model fit to a set of training data was assessed using Akaike's information criterion to select the optimal model that forecasts aquifer discharge, given the previous year's discharge and values of the predictor variables. Model performance was assessed by application of the model to a validation subset of data. The Nash‐Sutcliffe efficiency for model predictions made on the validation set was 0.57. The predictor variables used in our forecast represent the major recharge and discharge components of the ESPA water budget, including variables that reflect overall water supply and important aspects of water administration and management. Coefficients of variation on the regression coefficients for streamflow and irrigation diversions were all much less than 0.5, indicating that these variables are strong predictors. The model with the highest AIC weight included streamflow, two irrigation diversion variables, and storage.";"Boggs, Kevin G.

Accordingly, we initiated a study to assess the impact of several conservation interventions on the dynamics and persistence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) population in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa. These included revisions of the statutory systems that regulate problem animal control and trophy hunting, and we instituted a program intended to reduce human-leopard conflict in the region. We compared demographic rates of radiocollared leopards from two sampling periods: a pre-treatment period prior to intervention, and a treatment period after intervention. The average annual mortality rate of the population decreased from 0.401±0.070 to 0.134±0.016, with fewer leopards killed by humans and in intraspecific clashes after intervention. The overall reproductive output of the population increased in the treatment period, although annual cub production was higher in the pre-treatment period. This was mainly due to larger litter sizes prior to intervention, which may have been a strategy used by female leopards to offset high levels of infanticide. Results from camera-trap surveys and a Leslie-matrix model indicated an increase in annual population growth rate (λ) of 14-16% after the implementation of conservation measures. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing both the numerical and functional components of population dynamics when managing large carnivores exposed to hunting or persecution.";"Balme, Guy A.

The policies considered are implementation of soil conservation practices with an objective of reducing erosion to a site's tolerance level and a policy with an objective of a voluntary 50% reduction in conventional tillage. Costs and erosion benefits of these two policies are compared with that obtained from CRP. The changes in erosion and cost are estimated relative to 1992 levels. The analysis is conducted on every NRI point in a 12-state region in the north central United States. Erosion metamodels estimated using site-specific resource, production, topography, and weather data make such an endeavor tractable. The results indicate that having farmers adopt conservation plans on highly erodible fields is a sensible, cost effective policy. The public benefits of controlling erosion more than offset the small increased cost from adoption of conservation practices and conservation tillage. A significant amount of current CRP land is not susceptible to high erosion rates, which drives down the average benefit to cost ratio across the study region. A more targeted CRP would increase this ratio to the point where it could approach unity.";"Lakshminarayan, P.G.

We identified interpatch dispersal events from genetic tagging, parentage analyses and assignment tests and modelled the factors associated with apparent emigration and post‐dispersal settlement choices by individual male agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis, a marsupial carnivore of south‐east Australian forests). Emigration decisions were best modelled with on data patch isolation and inbreeding risk. The choice of dispersal destination by males was influenced by inbreeding risk, female abundance, patch size, patch quality and matrix permeability (variation in land cover). Males were less likely to settle in patches without highly unrelated females. Our findings highlight the importance of individual‐level dispersal data for understanding how multiple processes drive non‐randomness in dispersal in modified landscapes. Fragmented landscapes present novel environmental, demographic and genetic contexts in which dispersal decisions are made, so the major factors affecting dispersal decisions in fragmented habitat may differ considerably from unfragmented landscapes. We show that the spatial scale of genetic neighbourhoods can be large in fragmented habitat, such that dispersing males can potentially settle in the presence of genetically similar females after moving considerable distances, thereby necessitating both a choice to emigrate and a choice of where to settle to avoid inbreeding.";"Banks, Sam C.

The potato yield increased by 10.6-11.8 t/ha next year after phosphogypsum applying and over a period of 6 years the average yield increasing was 36-44%. For comparison composts containing glauconite showed the ameliorative effect only in the 3-d year. The average supplementary production cost was from 68.4 to 72.4 thousand rubles per hectare, economic effect – 65.3-70.0 thousand rubles per hectare over the 6 years after applying of phosphogypsum-containig amendment

Изучали влияние фосфогипса и фосфогипсосодержащих мелиорантов на свойства чернозема обыкновенного, деградированного в результате полива минерализован-ными (1,7-2,0 г/л) оросительными водами, и урожайность сельскохозяйственных культур. Установлено снижение солонцеватости почвы при внесении полной расчетной дозы фосфогипса (10 т/га) на 50%, увеличение содержания кальция в почвенном погло-щающем комплексе до оптимальных параметров (85%), достижение хорошей водопрочности. Внесение гипса полной расчетной дозой 12 т/га в тех же условиях обеспе-чило снижение солонцеватости на 30% и увеличение содержания кальция до 81%. Отмечено значительное улучшение физических свойств почвы под воздействием фосфогипса: порозность увеличилась от 47 (удовлетворительная) до 56% (отличная), процент водопрочных агрегатов увеличился от 30 до 50 (водопрочность изменилась от удовлетворительной до хорошей), плотность сложения почвы снизилась от 1,46 до 1,16 т/куб.м (почва из сильно уплотненной перешла в разряд уплотненной). Применение фосфогипса обеспечило повышение урожайности сельскохозяйственных культур в среднем на 46%, в том числе озимой пшеницы – на 54%, кормовой свеклы – на 31%, сои на зерно – 52%. Доказана высокая эффективность удобрительно-мелиорирующих компостов с использованием фосфогипса – уже на следующий год после внесения при-бавка урожая картофеля составила 10,6-11,8 т/га; за 6 лет прибавки урожая составили в среднем 36-44%. Глауконитосодержащие компосты, для сравнения, проявили мелиори-рующий эффект только на 3-й год последействия. В среднем за 6 лет последействия фосфогипсосодержащих мелиорантов стоимость дополнительной продукции составила от 68,4 до 72,4 тыс. руб./га, экономический эффект – 65,3-70,0 тыс. руб./га";"Dokuchaeva, L.M.

In the latter, environmental variables that are themselves spatially organized induce spatial structure in the response variables. The relative importance of these processes has not yet been investigated in urban habitats. We compared the variance explained by purely spatial, spatially structured environmental, and purely environmental components for the community composition of spiders (Araneae), bees (Apidae), and birds (Aves) at 96 locations in three Swiss cities. Environmental variables (topography, climate, land cover, urban green management) were measured on four different radii around sampling points (<10 m, 50 m, 250 m, 1000 m), while Moran's eigenvector maps (MEMs) acted as spatial variables. All three taxonomic groups showed weak spatial structure. Spider communities reacted to very fineâscaled environmental changes of lawn and meadow management and climate. Bird community composition was determined by woody plants as well as solar radiation at all radii, the scale of the influence varying among species. Bee communities were weakly explained by isolated variables only. Our results suggest that the anthropogenic structuring of urban areas has disrupted the spatial organization of environmental variables and inhibited the development of biotic spatial processes. The near absence of spatial structure may therefore be a feature typical of urban species assemblages, resulting in urban community composition mainly influenced by local environmental variables. Urban environments represent a closeâknit mosaic of habitats that are regularly disturbed. Species communities in urban areas are far from equilibrium. Our analysis also suggests that urban communities need to be considered as being in constant change to adapt to disturbances and changes imposed by human activities.";"Sattler, T.

Previous studies found that this species encroaches far more readily on rocky areas than on sandy substrates, although it grows larger on sandy substrates. Rocky substrates are known to retain more water than sandy substrates, which may be of vital importance during recruitment in semi-arid and arid environments. A number of studies have also indicated that competition with grasses may reduce the recruitment and biomass of tree seedlings. We created an experiment in a semi-arid environment (mean annual rainfall = 388 mm) that tested for the effects of rockiness on A. mellifera recruitment. We also tested the hypothesis that grasses effectively compete with A. mellifera in this environment by simulating the effect of grazing by clipping grasses from half the plots in both the rocky and sandy treatments. Significantly more A. mellifera seedlings established in plots where grasses were clipped than in control plots. A. mellifera seedlings had greater biomass on sandy substrates than on rocky substrates. No significant interaction effects were found between substrate and grass clipping treatment for either seedling number or biomass. We conclude that A. mellifera seedlings are more likely to encroach in habitats with low grass density, although they may achieve greater biomass on sandy soils. Thus, it may be the lower grass density rather than rockiness, which increases the encroachment observed in naturally rocky habitats. These results are also consistent with our observations that adult A. mellifera trees are larger on sandy soils than on rocky soils.";"Ward, David

The authority's use is on the rise, and many regard stewardship contracting as a win-win mechanism for federal land management and a means of ending the ""timber wars"" on public land. This report provides an overview of stewardship contracting, with a focus on improvements needed for it to reach its full potential. A case study of the economic impacts of a high-profile pilot project of the new authority, the Clearwater Stewardship Project, is used to illustrate its potential. With impact assessment software (IMPLAN), I find that the project's total economic impact includes a $23 million increase in final sales for 206 industry sectors in eight Montana counties, 148 full- and part-time jobs, $4.6 million increase in wages (2003 dollars), $1.4 million increase in proprietors' income, and $570,000 in indirect business taxes. Over 85 percent of the impacts arise from the harvesting and processing of wood, while 10 percent arise from restoration activities paid for with the receipts from these harvests. The combination of harvesting, wood processing, restoration, administrative, and monitoring activities typical of a stewardship contract serves to spread impacts across a wider variety of economic sectors than timber harvesting alone.";"Kerkvliet, Joe";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600032513";"http://dx.doi.org/10.13073/0015-7473-60.3.213";"";"";"";"213-220"

We compared different types of soils in Mediterranean mountain forests with respect to their edaphic environments and influence of vegetation cover and lithology. We then used this information to determine the suitability of current forest restoration programs in these ecosystems. Twenty-four surface horizons in forest soils in two zones of contrasting lithology (calcareous and metamorphic) and different types of vegetation cover or management (shrubland, autochthonous forest and reforested forest) were sampled. A set of their essential soil properties were analysed and a series of parameters considered as indicators of surface soil processes was selected: aggregate size, structural stability, water repellency, mineralisation rate and fungal activity. Results confirm that the lithological origins of soils determines the properties defined by the geochemical environment of soilscapes (texture, pH, exchange complex and free oxides), and does not much influence organic properties. On the other hand, the type of plant cover and management do not influence the geochemical properties of the soil decisively, but do maintain a relative control of organic properties, especially those that define their quality (C/N ratio). The variability of surface properties is not well explained by environmental factors, and it is assumed that a large part may be related to the historical use of the soils. The specificity of soilscapes implies differences in vulnerability to forest management: the surface horizons in siliceous environments are more vulnerable than calcareous environments. It is necessary to better characterize soil properties in these forests and accordingly re-evaluate forest restoration efforts with respect to them.";"Oyonarte, C.

We conducted surveys of ten 10-km-radius landscapes in north-central Oklahoma from 2007 through 2009 to examine the influence of the amount and composition of wetland habitats and surrounding land cover on shorebird use during migration. We used generalized linear modeling and an information-theoretic framework to identify factors that best explained species richness, total abundance, and abundance of four groups of shorebirds classified by breeding status and migration distance. Total abundance and richness both increased with the area of wetland habitat within a landscape, regardless of the composition of semi-natural and developed land cover surrounding wetlands. Abundance of shorebird species with different migration strategies varied in relation to the composition of wetland types within a landscape. The amounts of various permanent and semi-permanent wetlands best explained abundance of resident species. Short-distance migrant abundance was best explained by the amount of permanent lacustrine wetlands. The amounts of temporary and semipermanent floodwater habitats were important predictors for abundance of intermediate- and long-distance migrants, although permanent riverine habitats were also important for intermediate-distance migrants. Shorebird species richness was best explained by the amounts of floodwater habitats and permanent riverine wetlands. Broad-scale studies thus provide important insights on use of stopover habitats by migratory shorebirds. Within this region, conservation of riverine habitats with a large complement of ephemeral habitats is necessary to provide the stopover habitat for migrating shorebirds.";"Albanese, Gene

"AGRIS:US201500162852";"Community stakeholders’ knowledge in landscape assessments – Mapping indicators for landscape services";"";"The evaluation of landscape services essentially deals with the complex and dynamic relationships between humans and their environment. When it comes to landscape management and the evaluation of the benefits these services provide for our well-being, there is a limited representation of stakeholder and intangible values on the land. Stakeholder knowledge is essential, since disciplinary expert evaluations and existing proxy data on landscape services can reveal little of the landscape benefits to the local stakeholders. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of using local stakeholders as key informants in the spatial assessment of landscape service indicators. A methodological approach is applied in the context of a rural village environment in Tanzania, Zanzibar, where local, spatially sensitive stakeholder knowledge is crucial in solving land management challenges as the resources are used extensively for supporting community livelihoods and are threatened by economic uses and agricultural expansion. A typology of 19 different material and non-material, cultural landscape service indicators is established and, in semi-structured interviews, community stakeholders map these indicators individually on an aerial image. The landscape service indicators are described and spatially analysed in order to establish an understanding of landscape level service structures, patterns and relationships. The results show that community involvement and participatory mapping enhance the assessment of landscape services. These benefits from nature demonstrate spatial clustering and co-existence, but simultaneously also a tendency for spatial dispersion, and suggest that there is far more heterogeneity and sensitivity in the ways the benefits are distributed in relation to actual land resources. Many material landscape service indicators are individually based and spatially scattered in the landscape. However, the well-being of communities is also dependent on the non-material services, pointing out shared places of social interaction and cultural traditions. Both material and non-material services are preferred closest to settlements where the highest intensity, richness and diversity are found. Based on the results, the paper discusses the role of local stakeholders as experts in landscape service assessments and implications for local level management processes. It can be pointed out that the integration of participatory mapping methods in landscape service assessments is crucial for true collaborative, bottom-up landscape management. It is also necessary in order to capture the non-utilitarian value of landscapes and sensitivity to cultural landscape services, which many expert evaluations of landscape or ecosystem services fail to do justice.";"Fagerholm, Nora

Our objective was to determine how slash-and-burn agriculture affected vegetation and soil C stocks and biodiversity on an area of miombo woodland in Mozambique, and how C stocks and biodiversity responded once agriculture was abandoned. We sampled twenty-eight 0.125ha plots that had previously been cleared for subsistence agriculture and had been left to re-grow for 2 to ~25 years, and fourteen 0.25ha plots of protected woodlands, recording stem diameter distributions and species, collecting wood for density determination, and soil from 0 to 0.3m for determination of %C and bulk density. Clearance for agriculture reduced stem wood C stocks by 19.0tCha-¹. There were significant relationships between period of re-growth and basal area, stem numbers and stem biomass. During re-growth, wood C stocks accumulated at 0.7tCha-¹ year-¹. There was no significant difference in stem C stocks on woodlands and on abandoned farmland 20-30 years old. Soil C stocks in the top 0.3 m on abandoned land had a narrower range (21-74tCha-¹) than stocks in woodland soils (18-140tCha-¹). There was no discernible increase in soil C stocks with period of re-growth, suggesting that the rate of accumulation of organic matter in these soils was very slow. The re-growing plots did not contain the defining miombo species, and total stem numbers were significantly greater than in woodland plots, but species richness and diversity were similar in older abandonments and miombo woodlands. Wood C stocks on abandoned farmland were capable of recovery within 2-3 decades, but soil C stocks did not change on this time-scale. Woodland soils were capable of storing >100tCha-¹, whereas no soil on a re-growing area exceeded 74tCha-¹, so there is a potential for C sequestration in soils on abandoned farmland. Management should focus on identifying C-rich soils, conserving remaining woodlands to protect soil C and preserve defining miombo species, and on investigating whether fire control on recovering woodland can stimulate accumulation of soil C and greater tree biomass, and restore defining miombo species.";"Williams, M.

An additional goal was to find out the willingness of farmers to grow energy crops relative to different levels of income and subsidies based on predictions of acreage of energy crop cultivation. In the first CE, farmers were presented with two energy crops and six of their characteristics and asked to choose the alternative he or she preferred most. In the second CE the respondent was asked how many hectares for each crop he/she would be willing to grow on arable land with an energy crop subsidy and how many hectares he/she would be willing to grow on set-aside land without an energy crop subsidy. The results suggest that among the included characteristics in the first experiment, the visual impact on the landscape and the rotation period of the energy crop appear to have a significant impact on the utility derived from growing an energy crop. An increased utility of a crop increases the arable land used for that crop and the income associated with it. Farm characteristics such as leased land, rented land, share of set-aside land, and type of farming had an insignificant effect on the willingness to grow energy crops. Significant characteristics were age of the farmer, size of the farm, and the geographical area.";"Paulrud, Susanne

The main purpose of the study was to test whether the landslides that are mapped within the basin are spatially clustered (i.e., have a spatial attraction) or randomly spatially distributed (i.e., spatially independent) on different types of land cover. The bivariate K-function was employed to evaluate the spatial dependence or randomness with additional estimates of corresponding clustering or independent distance. The bivariate K-function rejects the null hypothesis that all types of landslides tend to cluster similarly across different categories of land cover. At a 98 % confidence interval, significant spatial attractions can be detected in the active and dormant slides that are located on all three types of land cover, whereas the stabilized slides only exhibit spatial clustering in the forested and semi-natural areas within a clustering distance of 9 km. Additionally, the results suggest a spatial attraction between the dormant flows and the three types of land cover, for which only spatial randomness was detected for the active flows. Moreover, the occurrences of the falls appear to be spatially independent in the agricultural areas and on the artificial surfaces, whereas they are spatially clustered in the forested and semi-natural areas. Finally, no clustering was observed for the creeps on any of the three types of land cover.";"Lu, Ping

We explore the challenge of instrument choice in the context of landscape-scale conservation on private land, where the challenge is to select instruments that are able to influence the management practices of large numbers of landholders with diverse values, beliefs and management priorities. We report on a landholder survey and workshop undertaken as part of a study focused on reversing scattered tree decline on private grazing land in Australia. We examined eight policy instruments against stated selection criteria in the context of four land management practices with potential to reverse tree decline: rotational grazing, tree planting, direct seeding of tree species, and reduced chemical fertilisers. Two of the four management practices (rotational grazing and tree planting) received much stronger support. Respondents considered all eight policy instruments more effective for supporting their uptake of these two practices compared to less preferred practices. Landholders preferred policy instruments providing short-term financial or material support, compared to longer-term instruments such as legal regulations or stewardship programs. The nature of the management practice on the production-conservation continuum significantly influenced landholder preferences for policy instruments: different instruments were preferred for conservation-oriented practices versus production-oriented practices. Our results support the conclusion that reversing scattered tree decline at the landscape-scale is best achieved by providing landholders with flexibility through offering multiple options in terms of both policy instruments and management practices.";"Schirmer, Jacki

In this article, a new algorithm, named median change vector analysis (MCVA) has been proposed for multi-class change detection. The algorithm is based on an enhanced 2n-dimensional feature space comprising direction cosine values of both the change vector and the median vector, which allows for more accurate detection of change classes than those obtained from ICVA.

In the present study, an attempt has been made to identify possible groundwater potential zones both in terms of quantity and quality. A methodology is proposed for identification of groundwater potential index (GWPI) and a new water quality index (WQI) based on analytic hierarchy process. The proposed methodology has been applied to the shallow alluvial aquifer of central Ganga basin, Kanpur (India). Land use/land cover, soil, geology, recharge rate, drainage density, rainfall, slope, elevation, normalized difference vegetation index, groundwater depth or depth to groundwater table are used for GWPI calculation. Moreover, WQI considers alkalinity (as CaCO₃), magnesium (Mg²⁺), total dissolved solids and fluoride (F⁻) as influencing attributes. Final integration of attributes yield GWPI and WQI map. The resulting GWPI map has been classified into three groundwater potential zones namely: good, moderate and poor covering 26.94, 43.76, and 29.30 %, area, respectively. The WQI map has been classified into five quality zones namely: above permissible limit, poor, moderate, good, very good covering 12.39, 7.63, 15.17, 38.18, and 26.64 % area, respectively. Monitoring data from well locations along with GWPI and WQI map reveals the proper potential zones.

SOC, SIC and TN content can be significantly increased from 0.56, 0.06, and 4.93 g kg⁻¹ in Desert land to 5.85, 0.47, and 7.26 g kg⁻¹ in revegetated covers, respectively. Different revegetated covers can also change plant species richness, productivity, and plant C and N content. It is also found that Poplar land and Pine land were more effective than Shrubland in improving soil fertility and plant productivity. In addition, this study confirmed that the establishment of revegetated covers can reduce the rates of wind erosion on soil surface up to 74.83–94.15 % compared to natural desert shrubland. The atmospheric dust fall was also affected significantly by the different covers. The results show that there are significant advantageous changes in soil characteristics and vegetation parameters, as well as the reduction of soil erosion and retention of atmospheric dust fall in the revegetated covers and habitat conditions. The results suggested the appreciable ecological effects of the different revegetation covers on soil development and restoration process of plant communities. Additionally, some rational management practices could also cause positive influence on the quality of soil, e.g. irrigation. Understanding these ecological effects may be helpful for designing and establishing protective forest systems in desert–oasis areas.";"Niu, Ruixue

The econometric model is developed from a theoretical model which also endogenizes population growth and prevailing land tenure institutions within the customary sector of Malawi. The analysis reflects changes between 1971 and 1995, utilizing aerial photos taken at these dates and complementing these with field surveys. The data show a deterioration of Malawi's natural resource base: declining yields, loss of tree cover, and near exhaustion of land for agricultural expansion. Key findings are that population pressure induces land conversion but not yield or tree cover change; the matrilocal system of household residence is negatively associated with tree cover but induces agricultural conversion; and there is some improvement in management of resources as their scarcity increases. Policy recommendations include greater focus on agroforestry to increase tree cover as woodland areas are poorly managed, and increased effort to improve market integration since this benefits crop yields without adverse effects on tree cover.";"Place, Frank

"AGRIS:FR2016200891";"La gestion fourragère dans les élevages laitiers des Andes sèches : rationalité et performances";"";"For some fifteen years, dairy cattle farming has been considerably developing in various parts of the Andes. Milk is transformed into cheese or sold fresh, giving rural families a regular income which secures their food supply. The stock-rearing practices in these Andean dairying systems are unrecognized and are often considered, wrongly, as underperforming and inadequate. Eight families, belonging to a rural community in the dry parts of the Peruvian Andes (in Sinto), were monitored during a whole season; the analysis of their stock-rearing practices constituted the basis of this paper’s assessment of the forage management in use in these dairy farms subject to severe constraints. The allotment of cattle heads, the rotational grazing of irrigated lucerne pastures by the cows in milk, the availability of huge rangelands, and the swapping of foggage make it possible for the Sinto farmers to produce milk all the year round, in spite of their very dry climate. The amount of milk produced in each family and its regularity during the year depend narrowly however on the area of irrigated land to which they have access. The low milk performances per cow are no obstacle to a good output per hectare of lucerne, which corresponds to both an optimal use of the main limiting factor and to a good risk management.

Le suivi de 8 familles d’une communauté paysanne des Andes péruviennes sèches (Sinto) et l’analyse de leurs pratiques d’élevage constituent le support de la réflexion menée sur la cohérence de la gestion fourragère de ces élevages laitiers soumis à de fortes contraintes. L’allotement des bovins, le pâturage tournant des luzernières irriguées par les vaches laitières, le recours aux parcours et les échanges de fourrages sur pied permettent de produire du lait toute l’année dans un climat très sec. Le volume de lait produit par une famille et sa régularité sur une campagne sont liés à la superficie de foncier irrigué à laquelle elle a accès. Les faibles performances par vache n’empêchent pas l’obtention de bons rendements laitiers par hectare de luzerne, principal facteur limitant, et une gestion des risques.";"Aubron, Claire

"AGRIS:US201600059818";"Identification of hazelnut fields using spectral and Gabor textural features";"";"Land cover identification and monitoring agricultural resources using remote sensing imagery are of great significance for agricultural management and subsidies. Particularly, permanent crops are important in terms of economy (mainly rural development) and environmental protection. Permanent crops (including nut orchards) are extracted with very high resolution remote sensing imagery using visual interpretation or automated systems based on mainly textural features which reflect the regular plantation pattern of their orchards, since the spectral values of the nut orchards are usually close to the spectral values of other woody vegetation due to various reasons such as spectral mixing, slope, and shade. However, when the nut orchards are planted irregularly and densely at fields with high slope, textural delineation of these orchards from other woody vegetation becomes less relevant, posing a challenge for accurate automatic detection of these orchards. This study aims to overcome this challenge using a classification system based on multi-scale textural features together with spectral values. For this purpose, Black Sea region of Turkey, the region with the biggest hazelnut production in the world and the region which suffers most from this issue, is selected and two Quickbird archive images (June 2005 and September 2008) of the region are acquired. To differentiate hazel orchards from other woodlands, in addition to the pansharpened multispectral (4-band) bands of 2005 and 2008 imagery, multi-scale Gabor features are calculated from the panchromatic band of 2008 imagery at four scales and six orientations. One supervised classification method (maximum likelihood classifier, MLC) and one unsupervised method (self-organizing map, SOM) are used for classification based on spectral values, Gabor features and their combination. Both MLC and SOM achieve the highest performance (overall classification accuracies of 95% and 92%, and Kappa values of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively) when multi temporal spectral values and Gabor features are merged. High Fᵦ values (a combined measure of producer and user accuracy) for detection of hazel orchards (0.97 for MLC and 0.94 for SOM) indicate the high quality of the classification results. When the classification is based on multi spectral values of 2008 imagery and Gabor features, similar Fᵦ values (0.95 for MLC and 0.93 for SOM) are obtained, favoring the use of one imagery for cost/benefit efficiency. One main outcome is that despite its unsupervised nature, SOM achieves a classification performance very close to the performance of MLC, for detection of hazel orchards.";"Reis, Selçuk

The project aims at deriving area estimates of tropical forest cover change for the periods 1990–2000–2005. The paper presents the pre-processing steps applied in an operational and robust manner to this large amount of multi-date and multi-scene imagery: conversion to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, cloud and cloud shadow detection, haze correction and image radiometric normalization. The results show that the haze correction algorithm has improved the visual appearance of the image and significantly corrected the digital numbers for Landsat visible bands, especially the red band. The impact of the normalization procedures (forest normalization and relative normalization) was assessed on 210 image pairs: in all cases the correlation between the spectral values of the same land cover in both images was improved. The developed automatic pre-processing chain provided a consistent multi-temporal data set across the tropics that will constitute the basis for an automatic object-based supervised classification.";"Bodart, Catherine

"AGRIS:US201600196945";"Surface energy exchange in a tropical montane cloud forest environment: Flux partitioning, and seasonal and land cover-related variations";"";"Relationships between seasonal climate, land cover and surface energy exchange in tropical montane cloud forest environments are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the seasonality of flux partitioning in lower montane cloud forest (LMCF), shaded coffee (CO) and sugarcane (SU) in central Veracruz, Mexico, as well as to evaluate the changes in surface energy exchange associated with the conversion of LMCF to CO or SU. Sensible (H) and latent heat (Î»E) fluxes were measured during the late dry and wet seasons using eddy covariance (CO and SU) and sap flow (LMCF) methods. Other measurements included: meteorological parameters, radiation balance, soil heat flux, soil moisture and vegetation characteristics. During the wet-season month of July, average midday Bowen ratios (Î²s) for sunny conditions were lowest and least variable among land covers: 0.4Â±0.2 (SE) in LMCF, 0.5Â±0.1 in SU and 0.7Â±0.1 in CO. In contrast, during the late dry-season months of March and April, Î²s were higher (i.e. higher H and lower Î»E) and more variable. The highest values of Î² were observed in LMCF, reflecting effects of partial leaf-shedding by dominant deciduous species (2.4Â±0.8, March) and increased stomatal control (1.4Â±0.3, April). There was also evidence of stomatal limitation of Î»E in CO and SU, having Î²s of up to 1.0Â±0.1 in April and March, respectively. As compared to LMCF, the average midday available energy (Ae) for sunny conditions was very similar in CO (â3Â±7%) and 15Â±8% lower in SU. Although not all results were statistically significant, they suggest that for the wet season conversion of LMCF to shaded coffee or sugarcane led to a decrease of 15Â±14% or 15Â±17% in midday Î»E under sunny conditions, respectively, whereas corresponding values of H increased by 37Â±38% or remained about the same (â4Â±40%). In contrast, for the late dry season, conversion of LMCF to shaded coffee or sugarcane appears to have resulted in higher Î»E and lower H, with changes of, respectively, +79 (Â±32)%/â45 (Â±16)% (CO) or +39 (Â±32)%/â43 (Â±16)% (SU) for a partially leafless LMCF in March, and +17 (Â±16)%/â11 (Â±16)% (CO) for a fully-leafed LMCF in April. In order to more accurately quantify the changes in surface energy fluxes associated with LMCF conversion, future work should focus on reducing the errors in the flux estimates. Nevertheless, for sunny days during the wet season, potential changes in the moisture and heat content of the local atmosphere due to the conversion of LMCF to CO or SU seem to have been in the same direction as those induced by increased greenhouse gases (drying and warming), whereas for the late dry season the effects appear to have been opposite (moistening and cooling).";"Holwerda, F.

There are reports indicating the involvement of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), the causative agent of PPR, in a camel respiratory syndrome in Africa. Considering that camels share the same grazing land and drinking points with other ruminants, this study was undertaken to determine the seroprevalence and extent of PPRV antibodies in Nigerian camels. A total of 1517 camel sera samples were collected from four states (Borno, Kano, Kastina and Sokoto). The seroprevalence was determined by the H-protein-based competitive ELISA. The overall prevalence was 3.36 % (51/1517, 95 % confidence interval of 2.51–4.39 %). There was no significant differences in prevalence between states (p = 0.8921) and between male and female camels (p = 0.7424). The prevalence differed significantly (p < 0.00001) by body condition score; camels with poor body condition score has higher (16.67 %) antibody seroprevalence to PPR compared to those with fair and good body condition score. There was a statistically significant difference between camels aged ≤ 5 years and those >5 years (p = 0.0042). These results show occasional transient PPRV infection of camels in Nigeria, and there is the need to include camels among species to be studied in elucidating the epidemiology of the disease in sheep and goats.";"Woma, Timothy Yusufu

Dynamics and Trajectories of Vernacular Land Markets in Sub-Saharan Africa";"";"Contemporary discourse on land in Africa is polarized between advocates of tenure reform through state registration of individual titles to land and others who claim that customary or 'communal' tenure is the only check against landlessness among the poor in the African countryside, and that 'pro-poor' land policy should therefore strengthen customary rights to land. This paper draws on a growing body of evidence on the emergence of vernacular rural land sales and rental markets to question assumptions that underlie the non-market 'ideal type' communal tenure model that has historically dominated policy thinking in Africa, and continues to be shared by both sides of the current land tenure reform debate. The paper argues that recognition of the specific characteristics of 'vernacular land markets'- commoditized transfers of land within the framework of customary tenure - is essential if state land policies are to succeed in promoting the interests of the poor.";"CHIMHOWU, ADMOS

Our analysis of quality suggests the published science has improved markedly over the past 60years. That said, there is insufficient data on any subject for a formal meta-analysis. Much of the work published in the past may not pass peer-review today and there are few on-going, long-term studies of the effects of management of a standard that might meet this test. Given the limited number of recent studies of higher quality, this raises the question as to an acceptable standard of evidence for policy making for future management of native ecosystems. With the exception of grassland, feldmark and herbfield types, available data shows that all High Country vegetation types produce fuel loads >10tha⁻¹ in less than 10years after fire, notwithstanding the different fire risk associated with each fuel type (e.g. grasses vs woody shrubs vs forest litter), suggesting that fuel management will continue to be an issue for land managers. The varied and inconsistent history of past land management makes the interpretation of short-term studies difficult. Highlights of past research include the detailed studies of Costin and co-workers that were exemplary for their time in their use of replicated treatments, adequate controls and significant periods of study (4⁺year). Recent studies of effects of fire on water yield and quality that are based on well-replicated studies, again over substantial periods of time, are helping fill knowledge gaps. Many other ecological topics of interest to land managers remain poorly understood, including: long-term vegetation and fuel dynamics, nutrient balance, weed invasions and further aspects of hydrology. If high altitude catchments are to be managed effectively, we must improve our understanding the dynamics of fuel loads, vegetation, nutrients and water supply through collection of long-term quantitative data.";"Adams, Mark A.

Each of these three fires was followed by intensive inquiries and investigations, the most prolonged and intensive being a Royal Commission inquiry (the most rigorous form of legal inquiry in Australia) into the Black Saturday fires. Continuous changes in the organization of public land management agencies and in policies of public land management over the past 30years have disrupted forest and fire management, and resulted in large increases in fuel loads in most forest types. The scientific evidence is that burning to reduce fuels must be increased for effective forest management, effective ecological management and for the protection of life and property. The greatest number of submissions to the Royal Commission concerned fuel-reduction burning. Despite specific recommendations coming from the Royal Commission (as well as from an earlier government inquiry) for a 3-fold increase in the fuel-reduction target, the State remains divided on the effectiveness, propriety and implementation of fuel-reduction burning—divided among ecologists, divided among the community, divided among and within the key land-management agencies. The recent fire history of the eucalypt forests of Victoria demonstrates that leaving fire-adapted forests unattended has long-term social, economic and environmental consequences.

We developed a regional-scale model to assess the wind farm impact on bat migration and commuting routes. The model was implemented for the bat Nyctalus leisleri in a region of central Italy currently undergoing considerable wind farm development. A Species Distribution Model (SDM) for N. leisleri was generated using the MaxEnt algorithm based on 47 presence records (reduced to 19 after the autocorrelation procedure) and 10 environmental variables derived from topographic and land cover maps. We used the SDM to create a map of connectivity using the software UNICOR to identify potential commuting corridors (PCCs). The incidence of each wind farm on bat flight corridors was assessed by overlaying the existing (380) and planned (195) turbine locations onto the PCCs. The SDM was statistically robust (AUC� >� 0.8). Most of the corridors were concentrated in the western part of the region, which hosts the largest suitable areas for the species; most of the existing (54� %) and planned (72� %) wind farms interfered with important corridors connecting the western and the eastern parts of the region. Our results provide key information on the impact of the wind farm industry on biodiversity on a regional scale. The novel approach adopted, based on SDM and connectivity analysis, could be easily extended to other flying vertebrates and landscapes and constitutes a promising planning tool necessary for harmonizing the development of renewable energy infrastructures with issues of biodiversity conservation.";"Roscioni, Federica

In this study, scenarios of climate and political change were calculated for the Upper Danube catchment area using the regional optimization model ACRE. Two political scenarios were calculated for the year 2020. One scenario assumes the continuation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform 2003 the other assumes a strong shift away from payments of the first pillar to payments of the second pillar of the CAP. Both scenarios were combined with four different scenarios of climate change and technological progress derived from ICCP SRES assumptions and the ACCELERATES project. The results of the scenario calculations were analysed with respect to their implications for the whole catchment area as well as for selected districts. Climate change and technological progress both cause small changes in agricultural land use: fodder crop area tends to be converted to cash crop area, and intensive grasslands tend to be converted into extensive grasslands. Climate change and technological progress increase crop productivity, and consequently, total gross margin increases. The impact of climate change might get stronger toward the end of the century which is beyond the scope of the investigations presented here. The impact of climate change might thus switch from bringing net benefits in the short to medium term to bringing net losses for the area investigated in the long run.";"Henseler, Martin

"AGRIS:US201500161781";"Comparison of impacts of human activities and climate change on water quantity and quality in Finnish agricultural catchments";"";"CONTEXT: We studied the influence of human activities and climate change on water quantity and quality. Human activities included methods of agricultural policy, i.e. land use and management practices. OBJECTIVES: Finland started to follow EU’s agricultural policy in 1995. In this study our main objective was to find out whether the original targets of the Finnish Agri-Environmental Programme (FAEP) were achieved. METHODS: We analyzed trends in discharge, water quality and climate parameters in 37 years long time-series in two catchments. We focused on the suspended sediment and phosphorus concentrations and loads, the main interests to FAEP. RESULTS: We found an increasing trend in mean annual temperature, especially in spring and late summer-early autumn. There was no statistical significant change in annual runoff. Increasing winter runoff in the other catchment could be explained by the increased number of days when temperature was above zero degrees making snowmelt possible. In this area high potential sediment delivery occurred in early winter. FAEP succeeded in decreasing the suspended sediment load by reduced tillage and wintertime vegetation cover. In controlling the phosphorus loads FAEP succeeded only in the catchment with erosion sensitive soils. In the catchment where soils were less sensitive for erosion increase in the dissolved reactive phosphorus load exceeded the benefits of the reduced particulate phosphorus load. CONCLUSIONS: Climate change may increase the suspended sediment load by increasing winter runoff. Even then, instead of decreasing the suspended sediment loads FAEP should rather focus on dissolved nutrients as they cause eutrophication in receiving waters.";"Rankinen, K.

"AGRIS:US201400133117";"Food security, climate change, and sustainable land management. A review";"";"Agriculture production in developing countries must be increased to meet food demand for a growing population. Earlier literature suggests that sustainable land management could increase food production without degrading soil and water resources. Improved agronomic practices include organic fertilization, minimum soil disturbance, and incorporation of residues, terraces, water harvesting and conservation, and agroforestry. These practices can also deliver co-benefits in the form of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced carbon storage in soils and biomass. Here, we review 160 studies reporting original field data on the yield effects of sustainable land management practices sequestering soil carbon. The major points are: (1) sustainable land management generally leads to increased yields, although the magnitude and variability of results varies by specific practice and agro-climatic conditions. For instance, yield effects are in some cases negative for improved fallows, terraces, minimum tillage, and live fences. Whereas, positive yield effects are observed consistently for cover crops, organic fertilizer, mulching, and water harvesting. Yields are also generally higher in areas of low and variable rainfall. (2) Isolating the yield effects of individual practices is complicated by the adoption of combinations or “packages” of sustainable land management options. (3) Sustainable land management generally increases soil carbon sequestration. Agroforestry increases aboveground C sequestration and organic fertilization reduces CO₂ emissions. (4) Rainfall distribution is a key determinant of the mitigation effects of adopting specific sustainable land management practices. Mitigation effects of adopting sustainable land management are higher in higher rainfall areas, with the exception of water management.";"Branca, Giacomo

Schultz's assertions that small farmers are rational, low income countries saddled with traditional agriculture have not the problem of many farmers leaving agriculture for nonfarm jobs, part-time farming is efficient, and economies of scale have no logical basis and not stood the test of time, this paper presents that in (1) the low income countries still saddled with traditional agriculture, (2) the low income countries developing towards the high income economy, and (3) the high income countries, numerous able-bodied part-time and absent farmers earning higher off-farm income tend to under-utilize or idle small (and often fragmented) farms without selling or leasing them to full-time farmers to achieve economies of scale which do have logical basis and stood the test of empirical findings; and indicates that this is a global problem unresolved under private land ownership in both developing and developed countries. Thus small farmers in so doing are not so rational to the societal and their own fundamental interests. The paper also shows that in Central-Eastern Europe and Central Asia under private land ownership or possession many farmers voluntarily remain in collective land operation which perpetuates the low individual incentives. The paper further analyses the dilemmas the EU has been facing in resolving food overproduction, reducing trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and tariffs, keeping self-sufficiency, retaining small farmers in agriculture while strengthening large farmers, and efficient land use; and the crucial imperfections in the EU enlargement process. The paper thus proposes possible solutions on how to protect private land ownership, while transferring under-utilized land to full-time farmers; prevent the high costs of the traditional land consolidation, but still reaching its aims; keep part-time small farmers in agriculture, meanwhile bolstering full-time large farmers; avoid collective land operation, in the meantime benefiting from collective services; boosting EU enlargement but not adding burdens on the EU; retain non-cereal agriculture on ecologically sensitive land, at the same time improving the environment and precluding food overproduction; reduce trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and high tariffs, whereas making full-time farmers viable and competitive; and promote off-farm activities, for the meantime reinforcing agriculture.";"Zhou, Jian-Ming";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"143";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016213759";"http://purl.umn.edu/11831";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400056586";"What determines soil organic carbon stocks in the grazing lands of north-eastern Australia?";"";"This study aimed to unravel the effects of climate, topography, soil, and grazing management on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the grazing lands of north-eastern Australia. We sampled for SOC stocks at 98 sites from 18 grazing properties across Queensland, Australia. These samples covered four nominal grazing management classes (Continuous, Rotational, Cell, and Exclosure), eight broad soil types, and a strong tropical to subtropical climatic gradient. Temperature and vapour-pressure deficit explained >80% of the variability of SOC stocks at cumulative equivalent mineral masses nominally representing 0–0.1 and 0–0.3m depths. Once detrended of climatic effects, SOC stocks were strongly influenced by total standing dry matter, soil type, and the dominant grass species. At 0–0.3m depth only, there was a weak negative association between stocking rate and climate-detrended SOC stocks, and Cell grazing was associated with smaller SOC stocks than Continuous grazing and Exclosure. In future, collection of quantitative information on stocking intensity, frequency, and duration may help to improve understanding of the effect of grazing management on SOC stocks. Further exploration of the links between grazing management and above- and below-ground biomass, perhaps inferred through remote sensing and/or simulation modelling, may assist large-area mapping of SOC stocks in northern Australia.";"Allen, D.

Together they have protected over 1.09 million hectares of land. Using in-depth interview data with published documents on CLTOs, this paper examines how CLTOs make decisions as to which projects to pursue and the kinds of justifications they offer for the projects they have completed. We identify 13 aspects that such a decision-making process should contain. The CLTOs studied have, to some degree, incorporated 7 of them. The remaining 6 aspects could easily be contributing substantially to some of the main the challenges identified in both the literature and our own research regarding private land conservation. Consequently, we recommend developing a robust landscape-scale approach to private land conservation, communicating that approach to all CLTOs, and increasing cooperation among CLTOs and between them and government.";"Ryan, Sean

Current knowledge of habitat use by reindeer is primarily based on traditional or local knowledge, or on investigations carried out on wild reindeer and caribou in other parts of the world. We identified spatial and temporal habitat use of free-ranging semi-domesticated reindeer by following 48 GPS-equipped reindeer in three summer ranges in the Swedish reindeer herding area. The GPS equipment registered positions every hour or every second hour, during two snow-free seasons. The GPS-collared reindeer were randomly chosen from herds with several thousand animals. Estimated home-range utilisation distributions were used to fit resource utilisation functions (RUFs) including various topographical features, vegetation types, and the vicinity to water and hiking trails. The GPS-equipped reindeer used different parts of the range throughout the snow-free season. Preferred vegetation types were consistently meadows, grass heaths, and other heaths. Avoided vegetation types were all types of forests, sparsely vegetated areas, and bare rocks. The reindeer were seemingly indifferent to hiking trails within their home ranges, which, however, usually coincided with preferred vegetation types, but they avoided areas with houses and holiday huts during early summer. Later in the season, the reindeer preferred higher elevated areas where human constructions were sparse. The home ranges of the GPS-equipped reindeer overlapped considerably during early parts of the season, indicating a dense use of the range by the entire herds. Crowding within the herds appeared to make individual reindeer select non-optimal habitats. However, in our study, we found a non-significant tendency of less predictable individual home ranges when there were large range overlaps. Vegetation types, direction of slopes, time within the season and the possibilities of avoiding insect harassment appear to be key factors for predicting valuable reindeer habitats in novel areas in a land management context.";"Skarin, Anna

"AGRIS:US201400064668";"Scale-dependent effects of grazing on rangeland degradation in northern Kenya: a test of equilibrium and non-equilibrium hypotheses";"";"This study employs scale-dependence as an analytical approach to understanding effects of livestock grazing on rangeland degradation in northern Kenya. It used extensive datasets previously collected from 13 200 km2 rangelands where grazing pressure gradients of livestock (varied from none, light, moderate, heavy and very heavy grazing) in conjunction with seasonality across different ecological scales influenced plant responses and probably contributed to land degradation. The data representing spatial and temporal scales were used to test the equilibrium and non-equilibrium-grazing models and to verify scales at which the models appropriately described range degradation. The equilibrium-grazing models operated at the coarse scales (e.g. range units, km2) and non-equilibrium-grazing models at multiple scales (e.g. spatial, temporal and fine scales—plots, landscape patches). The study showed that the equilibrium-grazing hypothesis, which stated that responses of plant species richness, cover and biomass varied along grazing pressure gradients at the coarse scale, was rejected, while the non-equilibrium-grazing hypothesis, which stated that the factors responded to temporal and spatial scales combined with grazing pressure gradients at the fine scale, was accepted. This study emphasized that in future discussions on shifts in the thinking of range science from equilibrium- to non-equilibrium-grazing models should clarify scales at which land degradation is assessed. In conclusion, the paper suggests that understanding plant species responses to grazing pressure and seasonality needs to consider multiple scale effects and that the dogmatic notions about degradation of the arid zone rangelands at the coarse scales should be reconsidered. Land degradation assessments in the arid zones should focus at the fine scale.";"Oba, G.

"AGRIS:US201400064663";"assessment of restoration of biodiversity in degraded high mountain grazing lands in northern Ethiopia";"";"Loss of biodiversity is the single most important threat to the conservation and sustainable use of drylands in northern Ethiopia due to many centuries of cultivation and heavy livestock grazing pressure. The current study assessed the restoration of biodiversity in highly degraded areas in eastern Tigray, northern Ethiopia using area enclosures (AEs). The study assessed whether the differences in biodiversity between AEs and open management schemes and time of land abandonment influenced diversity of plant life forms (i.e. herbs, shrubs and trees). Changes in biodiversity were compared using the state-and-transition model. Management types and time since abandonment (hereafter called age) had a significant effect on herbaceous plant species abundance but not in shrub species, while site factors had a greater effect on diversity of plant life forms in general. Herbaceous species richness increased with age of restoration, reaching a maximum after three years of rest and declined thereafter, most probably as a result of hay harvesting and replacement of annual species by perennial grass species. Tree species richness increased gradually with age of land abandonment up to the maximum age of eight years. Four vegetation states and seven possible transitions that could guide management were identified. The vegetation states differed in terms of diversity of herbs and tree species but not those of shrubs. Promotion of tree species states will require longer periods of rest, while promotion of herbaceous species richness will need shorter periods. The state-and-transitional model could, therefore, be used to guide future management by promoting vegetation states that are desired by land users.";"Asefa, D.T.

"AGRIS:US201400064662";"Land under pressure: soil conservation concerns and opportunities for Ethiopia";"";"This paper evaluates the future impact of soil degradation on national food security and land occupation in Ethiopia. It applies a spatial optimization model that maximizes national agricultural revenues under alternative scenarios of soil conservation, land accessibility and technology. The constraints in the model determine whether people remain on their original site, migrate within their ethnically defined areas or are allowed a transregional migration. Key to this model is the combination of a water erosion model with a spatial yield function that gives an estimate of the agricultural yield in its geographical dependence of natural resources and population distribution. A comparison of simulated land productivity values with historical patterns shows that results are interpretable and yield more accurate outcomes than postulating straightforward reductions in yield or land area for each geographic entity. The results of the optimization model show that in absence of soil erosion control, the future agricultural production stagnates and results in distressing food shortages, while rural incomes drop dramatically below the poverty line. Soil conservation and migration support a slow growth, but do not suffice to meet the expected food demand. In a transregional migration scenario, the highly degraded areas are exchanged for less affected sites, whereas cultivation on already substantially degraded soils largely continues when resettlement is confined to the original ethnic–administrative entity. A shift to modern technology offers better prospects and moderates the migration, but soil conservation remains indispensable, especially in the long term. Finally, an accelerated growth of non-agricultural sectors further alleviates poverty in the countryside, contributing to higher income levels of the total population and, simultaneously, relieving the pressure on the land through rural–urban migration.";"Sonneveld, B.G.J.S.

"AGRIS:US201400064667";"investigation of the physical and socioeconomic determinants of soil erosion in the Hararghe Highlands, eastern Ethiopia";"";"The vicious poverty–environmental spiral commonly exists due to the interconnectedness of the socioeconomic aspects of farmers and land degradation. The socioeconomic situation of farmers affects their capabilities to implement environmentally viable soil and water conservation measures. These situations include farm practices and attitudes toward rational use of resources. An observational study was conducted to have an insight of the perception of farmers about the danger of gully erosion and their willingness to adopt new improved soil and water conservation measures. The variables studied included literacy, location of farm within the landscape, major land use, the severity of water scarcity, means of traction, perception, type of soil and water conservation measure in use, willingness to adopt new soil and water conservation measures and type of incentives needed for adopting new soil and water conservation measures. The variables studied were coded using dummy variable coding techniques and were subjected to rigorous statistical analysis using canonical correlation, logistic regression and discriminant analysis. Results suggest that perception about the danger of gully erosion is significantly correlated to severity of water scarcity, location of farm within the landscape and literacy of farmers. Willingness to adopt a new or improved soil and water conservation measure is strongly related to fertilizer availability as an incentive and to the literacy of the farmers. It is concluded that under Hararghe Highland conditions, design and implementation of soil and water conservation measures should take into account farmers' priorities such as alleviation of the water scarcity problem. Moreover, successful implementation of an improved or new measure of soil and water conservation measure is contingent upon the availability of incentives, primarily fertilizers.";"Daba, S.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land use;land degradation;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ETH";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400064667";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.520";"";"";"";"69-81"

In particular, we explore how multinationals divide tasks of different complexities across countries with different levels of IPR protection. The analysis studies the decision of firms between procurement from related parties and outsourcing to independents suppliers at the product level. It also breaks down outsourcing into two types by distinguishing whether or not they involve technology sharing between the two parties. We combine data from a French firm-level survey on the mode choice for each transaction with a newly developed complexity measure at the product level. Our results confirm that firms are generally reluctant to source highly complex goods from outside firm boundaries. By studying the interaction between product complexity and the IPR protection, we obtain that (i) for technology-sharing-outsourcing IPRs promote outsourcing of more complex goods to a destination country by guaranteeing the protection of their technology, (ii) for non-technology-related-outsourcing IPRs attract the outsourcing of less complex products that are more prone to reverse engineering and simpler to decodify and imitate.

Progressive changes in land use and soil erosion distribution are reconstructed by analysing sequential aerial photographs of the area between 1938 and 1988. The distributions of the two phenomena are mapped and quantified at the different dates using PC ARC/INFO GIS. Observable soil erosion is confined to the communal lands at all the dates. Widespread abandonment of cultivated fields between 1965 and 1988 is noted as the most significant aspect of land use change in the communal lands. Gully initiation and intensification appear predominantly from the mid-1970s, coinciding with a period of extreme rainfall events. A close spatial correlation between abandoned cultivated land and severe gullies is identified. The research raises questions regarding both the cause for land abandonment and the reasons for its vulnerability to erosion. The observed land degradation is seen as the result of a complex interaction of social, economic and environmental factors which lead to land abandonment and its consequent erosion.";"Kakembo, V.

"AGRIS:US2016212080";"Payments for environmental services : incentives through carbon sequestration compensation for cocoa-based agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia";"";"Up to 25 percent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation, and Indonesia is the third largest greenhouse gas emitter worldwide due to land use change and deforestation. On the island of Sulawesi in the vicinity of the Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), many smallholders contribute to conversion processes at the forest margin as a result of their agricultural practices. Specifically the area dedicated to cocoa plantations has increased from zero (1979) to nearly 18,000 hectares (2001). Some of these plots have been established inside the 220,000 hectares of the LLNP. An intensification process is observed with a consequent reduction of the shade tree density.This study assesses which impact carbon sequestration payments for forest management systems have on the prevailing land use systems. Additionally, the level of incentives is determined which motivates farmers to desist from further deforestation and land use intensification activities. Household behaviour and resource allocation is analysed with a comparative static linear programming model. As these models prove to be a reliable tool for policy analysis, the output can indicate the adjustments in resource allocation and land use shifts when introducing compensation payments.The data was collected in a household survey in six villages around the LLNP. Four household categories are identified according to their dominant agroforestry systems. These range from low intensity management with a high degree of shading to highly intensified shade free systems.At the plot level, the payments from carbon sequestration are the highest for the full shade cocoa agroforestry system, but with low carbon prices of € 5 tCO2e-1 these constitute 5 percent of the cocoa gross margin. Focusing on the household level, however, an increase of up to 18 percent of the total gross margin can be realised. Furthermore, for differentiated carbon prices up to € 32 tCO2e-1 the majority of the households have an incentive to adopt the more sustainable shade intensive agroforestry system. A win-win situation seems to appear, whereby, when targeting only the shade intensive agroforestry systems with carbon payments, the poorest households economically benefit the most and land use systems with high environmental benefits are promoted.";"Seeberg-Elverfeldt, Christina

This paper shows that spatial panel data models can be successfully applied to an econometricanalysis of farm-scale precision agriculture data. The application focuses on the estimation of theeffect of controlled drainage water management equipment on corn yields. Using field-levelprecision agriculture data and spatial panel techniques, the yield response equation is estimatedusing the spatial autoregressive error random effects model with temporal heterogeneity,incorporating spatial dependence in the error term, while controlling for the topography, weatherand the controlled drainage treatment. Controlling for random effects allows for thedisentanglement of the effects of spatial dependence from spatial heterogeneity and omittedvariables, and thus, to properly investigate the yield response. The results show that controlleddrainage has a statistically significant effect on corn yields. The effect is generally positive butvaries widely from year to year and field-to-field. For the two years of data controlled drainagewas linked to a 2.2% increase in field average yield, but that varied from a -2.6% to a +6.5%.Evaluated at mean elevation and slope in the east part of the field, controlled drainage isassociated with 10 bu/a increase and a 0.6 bu/a decrease in yields in 2005 and 2006, respectively.In the West part of the field, controlled drainage is associated with a 11 bu/a increase in 2006and 2.81 bu/a decrease in 2005.

A combination of economic growth and targeted programs resulted in a steady fall (until the food crisis of 2007/08) in the percentage of the world’s population suffering from undernutrition (from 20% in 1990/92 to 16% in 2006). Yet over a billion people still face both chronic and/or transitory food insecurity due to long-standing problems of inadequate income, low-productivity in agricultural production and marketing, and related problems of poor health and absence of clean water. Assuring adequate food security for such a large share of the world’s population is increasingly challenging due to continuing resource degradation driven by a combination of population pressure and outdated agricultural practices, poorly functioning input markets, rapid urbanization, increased concerns about food safety, and climate change.   This document contains an overview of the past 25 years of research, capacity-building, and outreach by MSU’s Food Security Group. The paper describes key elements of the FSG approach and draws lessons regarding the value of that model. Insights gained from research and outreach and their value in addressing the major current challenges facing food and agricultural systems in Africa are summarized in FSG (2009).";"Food Security Group at Michigan State University";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-10-31";"en";"food security;capacity building;research";"Land & Food Security";"";"002";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204824";"http://purl.umn.edu/55050";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400104585";"comparison of two procedures to estimate three basic monitoring landscape metrics for monitoring";"";"An interesting alternative to wall-to-wall mapping approaches for the estimation of landscape metrics is to use sampling. Sample-based approaches are cost-efficient, and measurement errors can be reduced considerably. The previous efforts of sample-based estimation of landscape metrics have mainly been focused on data collection methods, but in this study, we consider two estimation procedures. First, landscape metrics of interest are calculated separately for each sampled image and then the image values are averaged to obtain an estimate of the entire landscape (separated procedure, SP). Second, metric components are calculated in all sampled images and then the aggregated values are inserted into the landscape metric formulas (aggregated procedure, AP). The national land cover map (NLCM) of Sweden, reflecting the status of land cover in the year 2000, was used to provide population information to investigate the statistical performance of the estimation procedures. For this purpose, sampling simulation with a large number of replications was used. For all three landscape metrics, the second procedure (AP) produced a lower relative RMSE and bias than the first one (SP). A smaller sample unit size (50� ha) produced larger bias than a larger one (100� ha), whereas a smaller sample unit size produced a lower variance than a larger sample unit. The efficiency of a metric estimator is highly related to the degree of landscape fragmentation and the selected procedure. Incorporating information from all of the sampled images into a single one (aggregated procedure, AP) is one way to improve the statistical performance of estimators.";"Ramezani, Habib

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

We used multispectral and hyperspectral sensors to detect saline-exposed soils in an area cultivated with irrigated rice. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was applied to Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 data to identify exposed soils. By measuring the electrical conductivity (EC) of soil samples from 53 sites, we classified them into saline and non-saline. The surface reflectance Thematic Mapper /Landsat-5 product was used to inspect the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variations over time (1984–2011) at the sites. Using OLI/Landsat-8 and Hyperion/Earth Observing One, we obtained five salinity indices and scores from principal component analysis applied to exposed soil pixels. These indices along with the first principal component (PC1) were regressed against EC to estimate soil salinization. Different metrics and support vector machine (SVM) were tested to discriminate saline and non-saline soils. The results showed that exposed soils detected by SMA had NDVI with a lower mean and standard deviation over time in the saline areas due to vegetation growth limitation. NaCl absorption bands were not observed in the Hyperion spectra due to atmospheric water vapor. Therefore, soil salinity detected by OLI or Hyperion was due to soil brightness rather than absorption bands. Because most salinity indices and scores expressed brightness to some extent, they were correlated with EC, especially the Salinity Index and PC1. However, compared with OLI, the narrow-band salinity indices of Hyperion produced a lower root mean square error for EC estimates, better discrimination between saline and non-saline soils using the Euclidean distance and spectral angle metrics, and higher SVM classification accuracy.";"Moreira, Luis Clenio Jario

The management intensity classes were developed in view of a differentiated accounting of olive groves when delineating High Nature Value Farmland areas (HNV) at pan-European level. The remote sensing input data used was the Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF), derived in 10-day intervals from a long-term time series of NOAA AVHRR data. The key physical parameters for the intensity assessment were obtained by parametrization of the observed annual growth cycle. These parameters represent two functional proportions in olive groves, a seasonally changing annual component and a permanent perennial vegetation component, which were interpreted to classify data in three olive farming intensity levels. 27% of the assessed EU-Mediterranean wide olive areas were found to be of very high intensity, 12% were classified as low intensity olive areas and 61% form an intermediate intensity class. Strong intensification was found in Spain, followed by Italy, Greece and Portugal. Most pronounced indications of management changes for the period 1990–2000 were observed for the Spanish provinces Jaèn/Cordoba and the Italian province of Bari.";"Weissteiner, Christof J.

The productivity of the herbaceous and tree components in a silvopastoral system could be limited by soil fertility. The use of adequate doses of organic fertilisers like sewage sludge could enhance the productivity of both pasture and trees and promote biodiversity. The quantification of the best dose of sewage sludge to be applied in a silvopastoral system is important in order to enhance production and biodiversity in a silvopastoral system, while avoiding nitrate contamination of the ground water. This study aims to evaluate the effects of different doses of sewage sludge (100kg total N ha⁻¹, 200kg total N ha⁻¹ and 400kg total N ha⁻¹) on different variables of soil (soil pH, effective exchange capacity and the saturation percentage of Al, K, Ca, Mg and Na), tree growth and pasture (production, species richness and botanical composition) as compared to the fertilisation treatment in a silvopastoral system under Quercus rubra L. Sewage sludge applications initially improved soil nutrient levels (effective exchange capacity and Ca saturation percentage) and subsequently pasture production and tree growth when 200 and 400kg of total N ha⁻¹ were applied. On the other hand, the establishment of pasture and trees improved soil conditions at a medium term due to the organic matter input into the sandy soil, which increased species diversity specially at a 100kg of total N ha⁻¹ dose.";"Ferreiro-Domínguez, N.

"AGRIS:US201500219565";"Linking the restoration of rivers and riparian zones/wetlands in Europe: Sharing knowledge through case studies";"";"Floodplains in Europe are heavily impacted by human intervention and often disconnected from the main river channel. Restoring lateral hydraulic connectivity between wetlands, fringe habitats and riparian land with the adjacent river channel is extremely important to maintain natural functioning of floodplain wetlands. However, there is no simple solution to restoring and rehabilitating rivers and their floodplains, particularly in terms of long-term sustainability. Floodplains are often the most fertile and productive part of the landscape, in terms of both agricultural production and natural ecosystems. Restoration projects must be able to balance conflicting needs and interests. Flood management is one of the most powerful drivers of developing strategies for floodplain restoration. Appropriate restoration management of floodplains is vital for the conservation of unique bio-diverse systems and for sustainable agricultural productivity. By developing strategies that better incorporate floodplain restoration in the context of the basin scale, it will become more feasible to develop the most effective restoration actions for a specific river type and location. Within this context we must not forget that successful natural resource management is much more than developing good science; it requires working with landowners, meeting deadlines, securing funding, supervising staff, and cooperating with politicians. Furthermore, the benefits of floodplain restoration must be equally demonstrated for multiple purposes including a range of ecosystem services. This paper explores the various interactions associated with floodplain dynamics. Through case studies it explores the various approaches that have been taken across Europe to forward the restoration of these fragile and important ecosystems and embeds these in the context of current European environmental policy and directives.";"Gumiero, Bruna

"AGRIS:US201500219561";"Wetland management in New Zealand: Are current approaches and policies sustaining wetland ecosystems in agricultural landscapes?";"";"As a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity and to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, New Zealand has international responsibilities to protect and restore wetland ecosystems. The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy also reflects New Zealand's commitment to help stem the loss of biodiversity worldwide, including wetlands. Wetland loss in New Zealand has been more significant than in most parts of the world, and ecosystems in fertile lowlands have been most severely impacted by agricultural development. Wetlands provide important ecosystem services filtering nutrients and controlling floodwaters but they are under continued pressure from agricultural land use, including drainage, grazing, nutrient runoff, and the impacts of pest animals and plants. Legislation in New Zealand identifies the protection of wetlands as a matter of national importance, and the protection of wetlands on private land has been identified as a national priority for action. While most of the larger nationally and internationally significant wetlands in New Zealand are in public ownership, the vast majority of smaller wetlands, which contribute to the full diversity of lowland ecosystems in New Zealand, are on private land in agricultural landscapes. Regional and district councils have responsibilities to implement legislation and develop policies and regulations to protect wetlands and prevent their damage and degradation. Most use a mix of regulatory mechanisms and voluntary incentives to encourage protection and restoration of wetlands. The strength of regulation for wetland protection varies across the country, with stronger more restrictive rules in more populated regions and where loss in extent has been more significant. While all regional plans have some form of rule restricting damaging activities in wetlands, less than half have strong regulations where drainage is non-compliant, and monitoring is sparse. The majority of plans (60%) restrict damaging activities only in wetlands that are in a schedule or meet criteria for ecological significance; rules in most plans do not protect smaller, often degraded wetlands. Although wetland loss and degradation still occurs in many regions, national and regional rates of loss are not reported. A response requires strong national policies on preventing further loss, the implementation of regulations in regional and district plans, and monitoring of the effectiveness of policies, rules, and non-statutory mechanisms. A combination of bottom lines for statutory regulation, voluntary incentives including support for fencing, and effective practical management is required.";"Myers, S.C.

"AGRIS:US201500211020";"How the social construction of the environment affects people's reactions to water policy";"";"Over the past 20 years, water reform has moved to clarify water rights and responsibilities among users, separated water and land management, and introduced markets. Most recently, water policy has clearly recognised the need for environmental allocations to ensure sustainability. These reforms, especially the last, have created conflicts between stakeholder groups. While these conflicts have been couched on many occasions as irrigation versus conservation, this article shows that the basis of these arguments lies in tacit differences in the constructed meaning attached to the environment by different stakeholders. It explores the differences between how government managers, scientists and non-government stakeholders, such as irrigators, foresters, croppers and graziers, as well as Aboriginal elders, view the environment. Our study is based on interviews with government managers responsible for water management and rural non-government stakeholders in two case study sites in the Murray-Darling Basin, where water reform has caused vigorous debates. The findings show that scientists and government managers tend to see the environment as the passive recipient of human impacts, problems best addressed by objective science. In contrast, landholders see themselves as active agents within the environment, and place much more emphasis on personal experience and local knowledge. These worldviews influence people's reactions to water policy but are rarely explicitly discussed or acknowledged. This results in unnecessary conflict in public debate. Understanding the government and landholder perspectives is essential as a foundation for effective collaborative planning.";"Lukasiewicz, A.

The model reflects on a large class of institutions and natural resources for which complete enclosure by a sole owner may be desirable, but is often institutionally impractical. When a sole owner is granted ownership of only a fraction of the spatial domain of the resource and the remainder of the resource is competed for by an open access fringe, interesting spatial externalities arise. We obtain sharp analytical results regarding partial enclosure of the commons including: (1) While second best, it always improves welfare relative to no property rights, (2) all resource users are made better off, (3) positive rents arise in the open access area, and the resource will maintain higher abundance. Under spatial heterogeneity, we also characterize spatial regions that are ideal candidates for partial enclosure - typically, society should seek to enclose those patches with high ecological productivity and high self-retention, but whether high economic parameters promote or relegate a patch may depend on one’s objective. These results help inform a burgeoning trend around the world to partially enclose the commons.";"Costello , Christopher

However, it is unclear how these changes translate into local habitat suitability for certain bird species given that detailed knowledge on habitat use by forest bird species is still scarce. We have analyzed the habitat preferences of 37 breeding bird species in 19 lowland beech forests, each with an average size of 40 ha. We used Jacobs habitat selection index to quantify preference or avoidance of certain forest developmental phases (fdp). Fdp divide the forest life cycle into different periods, each characterized by a certain combination of habitat parameters (canopy cover, tree dimension, deadwood amount, regeneration cover), thereby integrating several age-specific structural properties. We found that fdp representing the last third of the forest life cycle were significantly preferred by most of the bird species. Of the 37 bird species analyzed, 19 showed the highest preference for the terminal phase or the disintegration phase; this was especially true for hole breeders, semi-hole breeders, ground breeders and beech forest indicator species. Moreover, each bird species showed a characteristic profile of preferred and avoided fdp. Some bird species, such as several free breeders, also preferred younger fdp, such as gaps or regeneration phases. Further, mean fdp patch size turned out to be a strong predictor of bird community composition. Our study confirms that most bird species show a strong preference for later fdp, such as the terminal phase and disintegration phase. However, the simultaneous availability of a mixture of different fdp on local scales meets the habitat preferences of most species and promotes biodiversity of breeding bird communities in lowland beech forests.";"Begehold, Heike

Governments of developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization are faced with two options when licensing GM crop technology: (1) attempt to regulate GM crops to the standards of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) or (2) allow a black market in GM seeds and risk trade retaliation from the GM innovator's host country through a TRIPS trade complaint. This paper develops a conceptual model that frames the adopting country's range of licensing options, including a new levy system, and derives welfare measures for each option. The model illustrates how a levy on GM technology can be a welfare-increasing policy for developing countries, and the operation of a levy is discussed. The conceptual model is applied to Brazil's soybean market and quantitative economic surplus measures are estimated within a calibrated welfare model for a range of licensing scenarios. The model's results suggest that a levy may interfere with the long-term prospects for innovators to collect monopoly rents in adopting countries.";"Cardwell, Ryan

Limited information is available about the magnetic susceptibility properties of semi arid regions of southwestern Iran. This study attempts to link χ and Fe oxides of the soils to landforms, soil characteristics, and land use (paddy and dryland soils) on the same parent materials. Ten representative pedons were taken along a NE–SW transect in different physiographic units in the Yasouj Plain. The results indicated that χ is determined mainly by topography and land use. In most pedons, the highest concentrations of poorly crystalline Fe (Fe ₒ) were observed in the top soil with different types of land use. Aquic condition in paddy soils seems the main cause for a significant decrease in the amount of Fe d in the studied soils. Maximum concentration of pedogenic Fe (Fe d) was noticed in more stable landforms with non-aquic moisture regime. Paddy soils exhibited higher Fe ₒ/Fe d ratio values, suggesting that they have more poorly crystalline iron oxide phases than dryland soils. Magnetic measurements showed that the χ values of paddy soils were much lower (3.8 times) than those of dryland soils. The highest value of χ was found in the pedons located on plateau and piedmont plains and the lowest value of χ belongs to those that are located on hill and river lower terraces. A positive correlation was found between the frequency dependence of χ (χ fd) and χ in paddy and dryland soils. Higher values of χ fd were observed at soil surface than at deeper levels, suggesting a greater proportion of ultrafine grains.";"Owliaie, Hamidreza";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IRN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500160370";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2013.855724";"";"";"";"1015-1027"

A total of 540 sheep and goat serum samples were examined. The seroprevalence of infection in all examined animals was 24.5% for Toxoplasma, 32% for Toxocara, 0% for Leishmania and 85.9% for Echinococcus. The final logistic regression model showed that the species of small ruminant, herd size, anthelmintic treatment, class of anthelmintic treatment, grazing with other herds, educational level of farmer, elevation of farm location, and generalized land cover were associated with Toxoplasma gondii infections, while the species of small ruminant, farm type, anthelmintic treatment, class of anthelmintic treatment, rotation of grazing, age of farmer, elevation of farm location, and generalized land cover were associated with Toxocara canis infections. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 102 (28.3%) of 360 sheep and in 30 (16.8%) of 179 goats. Animals in small flocks (150–300 animals) had an approximately 0.42-fold lower risk of having positive cases of T. gondii among animals compared with large flocks (>300 animals). Antibodies to T. canis were found in 155 (42.9%) of 361 sheep and 18 (10.1%) of 179 goats. The later finding constitutes the first report of seropositive goats to Toxocara. The risk of positivity for T. canis was 7.71-fold higher in sheep than in goats. Geographically, animals from plain areas had 2.9 and 2.01-fold higher risk of having positive cases of T. gondii and T. canis respectively. The significant bioclimatic variables (p<0.05) associated with the occurrence locations of T. gondii infection were related to higher temperature, lower precipitation, and lower elevation compared to the absence locations of T. gondii. The significant bioclimatic variables (p<0.05) associated with occurrence locations of T. canis infection were related to lower temperature and higher precipitation compared to absence locations of T. canis. These findings are useful to formulate appropriate control strategies for zoonotic parasites of sheep and goats in Greece and other areas with similar climatic conditions.";"Kantzoura, Vaia

"AGRIS:US201500223139";"Biogeographical variation in the potential effectiveness of prescribed fire in south‐eastern Australia";"";"AIM: Prescribed fire is a common land management for reducing risks from unplanned fires. However, the universality of such effectiveness remains uncertain due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes. Here, we explore biogeographical patterns in the effectiveness of prescribed fire by calculating leverage (the reduction in unplanned area burnt resulting from recent previous area burnt) across south‐eastern Australia over a 25 year period. LOCATION: The 30 bioregions of south‐eastern Australia. METHODS: We quantified leverage in each bioregion from fire records from 1975–2009, controlling for variation in annual weather. We also identified potential drivers of variation in leverage by relating the bioregional leverage values to measures of fuel type and growth, climate, and weather extremes. RESULTS: Leverage was inferred in four bioregions while in the other 26 bioregions no leverage was detected or prescribed fire had the opposite effect (fire‐follows‐fire). Leverage occurred in the forested eastern section of the study area, where rainfall, fuel load and fire activity is high and fire weather is mild. In all bioregions, weather was a stronger predictor than past‐fire extent of area burnt in a particular year. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of leverage shows that the effectiveness of prescribed fire varies regionally in predictable ways, which means that fuel management strategies applied in one region are not necessarily applicable in another. In most bioregions prescribed burning is likely to have very little effect on subsequent extent of unplanned fire, and even in regions where leverage occurs, large areas of treatment are required to substantially reduce the area burned by unplanned fire.";"Price, Owen F.

Deforested land is sometimes replanted with fast-growing trees; however, the consequences of intensive replanting on biomass accumulation or plant and animal diversity are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how intensive replanting affected tropical forest regeneration and biomass accumulation over ten years. We studied reforested sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda, that were degraded in the 1970s and replanted with five native tree species in 1995. We identified and measured the size of planted versus naturally regenerating trees, and felled and weighed matched trees outside the park to calculate region-specific allometric equations for above-ground tree biomass. The role of shrubs and grasses in facilitating or hindering the establishment of trees was evaluated by correlating observed estimates of percent cover to tree biomass. We found 39 tree species naturally regenerating in the restored area in addition to the five originally planted species. Biomass was much higher for planted (15,675kg/ha) than naturally regenerated trees (4560kg/ha), but naturally regenerating tree regrowth was an important element of the landscape. The establishment of tree seedlings initially appeared to be facilitated by shrubs, primarily Acanthus pubescens and the invasive Lantana camara; however, both are expected to hinder tree recruitment in the long-term. Large and small-seeded tree species were found in the replanted area, indicating that bird and mammal dispersers contributed to natural forest restoration. These results demonstrate that intensive replanting can accelerate the natural accumulation of biomass and biodiversity and facilitate the restoration of tropical forest communities. However, the long-term financial costs and ecological benefits of planting and maintaining reforested areas need to be weighed against other potential restoration strategies.";"Omeja, Patrick A.

However, few studies evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions. This study aimed at assessing the dynamic performance of a number of Atriplex plantations located in the Marrakech province in terms of multitemporal dry biomass production. Three SPOT 5 images (2004, 2008 and 2012) and field biomass measurements were integrated to quantify the dry biomass production dynamics of plantations established from 1996 to 2007. Different plant ages covered the whole plant life cycle curve. Vegetation indices were derived from the images and those of 2012 were coupled to the measured biomass of 2012 to formulate biomass models. An analysis of shrub biomass production was conducted in plantations and in adjacent rangelands, covering varying degree of plant development, and an estimate of the economic benefits generated by the plantations in terms of available fodder biomass was performed. The results show that, on average, the plantation sites produced 2·21 to 3·61 Mg ha⁻¹of dry biomass more than the surrounding rangelands. The best performing plantations yielded even greater differences, up to more than 7 Mg ha⁻¹. It was observed that the most performing plantations, while contributing to mitigating land degradation, have generated economic value and could compensate the economic cost of the intervention even under drought conditions. However, in several cases the plantation performance was far from sustainability, particularly due to poor management (early and/or over grazing), revealing that management is a critical factor for the success of this restoration practice.

This study analyzed spatial and temporal changes in land use and land cover patterns in a typical mountain watershed in the Gumushane district along the Northeastern part of Turkey. The area is investigated by comparing LANDSAT images from 1987 to 2000 and evaluated the temporal changes of spatial structure of forest conditions through spatial analysis of forest cover type maps from 1971 and 1987 using GIS and FRAGSTATS[trade mark sign]. The results show a general decreasing trend in area of natural land cover types including broadleaf and conifer forests as well as coppice between 1971 and 1987 (0.54%, respectively). In contrast, between 1987 and 2000 this natural land cover types show increasing trend (1.6%). In parallel with forest dynamics, the area of managed land including lowland and upland agricultural areas, rangelands and grasslands increased during the first period and decreased during second period. In terms of spatial configuration, Gümüşhane forests aren't generally fragmented by intensive forest utilization in the latter periods. This is partially due to out-migration of rural population in Gümüşhane. Nevertheless, land use pattern significantly changed over time depending on a few factors such as unregulated management actions, social pressure and demographic movements. The study revealed that demographic movements have a major effect on landscape dynamics.";"Kadioğullari, Ali Ihsan

Owing to the exceptionally high biodiversity in Southeast Asian forest ecosystems and the immense amount of carbon stored in forested peatlands, deforestation in this region has the potential to cause serious global consequences. In this study, we analysed deforestation rates in insular Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2010 utilizing a pair of 250 m spatial resolution land cover maps produced with regional methodology and classification scheme. The results revealed an overall 1.0% yearly decline in forest cover in insular Southeast Asia (including the Indonesian part of New Guinea) with main change trajectories to plantations and secondary vegetation. Throughout the region, peat swamp forests experienced clearly the highest deforestation rates at an average annual rate of 2.2%, while lowland evergreen forests declined by 1.2%/yr. In addition, the analysis showed remarkable spatial variation in deforestation levels within the region and exposed two extreme concentration areas with over 5.0% annual forest loss: the eastern lowlands of Sumatra and the peatlands of Sarawak, Borneo. Both of these areas lost around half of their year 2000 peat swamp forest cover by 2010. As a whole this study has shown that deforestation has continued to take place on high level in insular Southeast Asia since the turn of the millennium. These on-going changes not only endanger the existence of numerous forest species endemic to this region, but they further increase the elevated carbon emissions from deforested peatlands of insular Southeast Asia thereby directly contributing to the rising carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.";"MIETTINEN, JUKKA

We examined the effects of encroachment by the indigenous shrub Leptospermum scoparium (Myrtaceae) on herb-rich Eucalyptus camaldulensis woodlands in southern Australia. Species richness and compositional patterns were examined under the canopy of L. scoparium and in surrounding open areas to determine the species most susceptible to structural changes. Richness was significantly lower in areas of moderate to high L. scoparium cover (>15%), suggesting that a threshold shrub cover caused major change in this ecosystem. Shrubs were associated with a significant reduction in above-ground biomass of the ground-layer flora and a significant shift in community composition. The few species that were positively associated with high L. scoparium cover were also common in the woodland flora; no new species were recorded under the shrub canopy. Important environmental changes associated with L. scoparium cover were decreased light availability and increased litter cover, which were likely a consequence of encroachment. Leptospermum scoparium cover was also associated with greater surface soil moisture, which may be a consequence of increased shading under the shrub canopy or indicate favourable soil conditions for L. scoparium establishment.

"AGRIS:US201500205540";"Soil Surface‐Active Fauna in Degraded and Restored Lands of Northeast Brazil";"";"Land degradation reducing vegetation cover may affect the soil surface‐active fauna because both aboveground and belowground invertebrates depend on complex plant communities. In this study, we evaluated the effect of land degradation and restoration on soil fauna in northeast Brazil. Sites differed in degradation status: native vegetation, moderately degraded land, highly degraded land, and land under restoration for 4 years. Araneae and Coleoptera densities were significantly higher in natural vegetation and restored land (8 ± 4 ind./trap and 41 ± 21 ind./trap, respectively) than in degraded lands (−73% and −81%, respectively). The density of Formicidae was significantly higher in natural vegetation (206 ± 181 ind./trap) than in highly degraded land (32 ± 24 ind./trap), while restored land (51 ± 10 ind./trap) and moderately degraded land (37 ± 14 ind./trap) did not differ significantly from the other degradation levels. The density of Orthoptera did not follow the aforementioned patterns, while invertebrate groups mostly had highest densities in natural land and restored land. Linear regressions showed a strong negative relation between faunal density and soil bulk density, and a positive relation with soil organic matter due to an increase in plant cover. Our results indicate that land degradation simplifies soil surface‐active invertebrate communities with pronounced decreases in the density of Araneae, Coleoptera, and Formicidae, but that land restoration practices may recover the density of soil fauna even after only 4 years. Araneae, Coleoptera, and Formicidae respond sensitively to land degradation and restoration practice and are suggested as indicator groups for restoration success.

Best management of degraded land can be done by evaluating the spatial variability of soil properties including chemical properties of degraded land and mapping such variations. Since, a significant portion of arable land in India is chemically degraded due to soil acidity; the present study was conducted to study the spatial variability of soil acidity (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (OC) content, exchangeable potassium (K⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) contents in some cropped acid soils of India. A total of four hundred (one hundred from each series) representative surface (0–0.15 m depth) soil samples were collected from arable soils representing four soil series namely Hariharapur, Debatoli, Rajpora and Neeleswaram situated in Orissa, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala states of India, respectively, and were analyzed. Soil acidity (pH between 3.90 and 6.45) showed a low variability, in contrast to other soil properties, which showed moderate variability. The coefficients of variation varied from 32.4 to 74.3, 31.2 to 50.9, 45.6 to 100, 71.9 to 93.0 and 59.0 to 79.8% for EC (mean between 0.05 and 0.09 dS m⁻¹), OC (mean between 0.29 to 1.86%), exchangeable K⁺(mean between 39.1 and 77.7 mg kg⁻¹), Ca²⁺(mean between 148 and 293 mg kg⁻¹) and Mg²⁺(mean between 111 and 191 mg kg⁻¹), respectively. Soil pH and OC content were positively and significantly correlated with exchangeable K⁺, Ca²⁺and Mg²⁺content. Geostatistical analysis revealed that the best fit models were gaussian, exponential and spherical for different soil properties with moderate to strong spatial dependency.

"AGRIS:US201300852860";"Temporal patterns in the stability, persistence and condition of stream macroinvertebrate communities: relationships with catchment land-use and regional climate";"";"1. A spatially-extensive data set of stream macroinvertebrate communities from 49 northern New Zealand sites sampled over a 10-year period was analysed to assess relationships between the environment (catchment land-cover, landscape position and regional-scale weather patterns), and (i) community persistence and stability based on the constancy of species occurrence (presence-absence) and abundance (per cent composition), respectively and (ii) the temporal variability of various community condition metrics. 2. No significant relationship was evident between community stability or persistence within sites and a gradient of increasing land-use stress (LUS) based on types of upstream land-cover, with interannual mean similarities at all sites falling within the standard deviations recorded at long-term reference sites. In contrast, condition metrics were inversely related to LUS. Land-use appeared to be a key factor influencing community composition among sites whereas climate influenced stability and persistence within sites. 3. Three response trajectories of community variability to increasing LUS were distinguished based on the coefficient of variation of mean interannual similarities, such that (i) persistence and stability appeared to be more variable at developed sites with low LUS and at sites with high stress relative to the variability experienced naturally, but similar to the natural range at intermediate levels of stress ('sinusoidal response'); (ii) variability in Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera metrics increased at low-to-moderate stress and then accelerated rapidly at highly developed sites ('stepped-exponential response') and (iii) variability in a pollution tolerance metric increased rapidly and then maintained a similar level of variability along the remaining stress gradient ('plateau response'). 4. The results of this study have implications for biomonitoring approaches that assume high temporal persistence and stability of communities to define site impairment. Misclassifications caused by interannual variability could lead to misinterpretation of site condition, if conclusions are based on single annual surveys. Temporal variability in stability and persistence may help distinguish low levels of impairment where a predominantly healthy fauna experiences increased environmental fluctuations.";"COLLIER, KEVIN J.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land cover;disturbance";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NZL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300852860";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01923.x";"";"";"";"603-616"

"AGRIS:US201301646750";"Determining the effects of habitat management and climate on the population trends of a declining steppe bird";"";"The Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax is one of the most threatened steppe bird species in Europe, due mainly to agricultural intensification. Despite the relative importance of the Iberian population (approximately 50% of the global population) little is known about its dynamics and trends, especially in core distribution areas. This study evaluates the influences of meteorological factors and land management on the oscillations and medium-term trends of two Little Bustard populations in Central Spain. During 2001-2007, surveys of breeding male and female Little Bustards were carried out in two central Spanish locations: Valdetorres, in Special Protection Area (SPA) no. 139 (1600 ha), and Campo Real, in Important Bird Area (IBA) no. 075 (1150 ha). Densities were 3.3-4.0 and 1.1-2.1 males/km² in Campo Real, and 1.8-2.2 and 0.6-1.3 females/km² in Valdetorres. The sex ratio was biased towards males in both cases. Both populations declined during 2001-2007, especially in Valdetorres (60%). Variation in habitat composition did not explain variation in the numbers of males. Both populations were influenced by total precipitation in the preceding October-May period. Results suggest that the Little Bustard may be sensitive to future climate trends in Europe. Finally, different simulated demographic scenarios suggest that low female survival and productivity may be the immediate cause of the decline in Little Bustard populations, which is consistent with their sensitivity to climatic conditions.";"DELGADO, MARÍA PAULA

"AGRIS:US201400134555";"Rapid deforestation threatens mid‐elevational endemic birds but climate change is most important at higher elevations";"";"AIM: Deforestation and climate change are two of the most serious threats to tropical birds. Here, we combine fine‐scale climatic and dynamic land cover models to forecast species vulnerability in rain forest habitats. LOCATION: Sulawesi, Indonesia. METHODS: We sampled bird communities on four mountains across three seasons in Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia (a globally important hotspot of avian endemism), to characterize relationships between elevation and abundance. Deforestation from 2000 to 2010 was quantified, and predictors of deforestation were identified. Future forest area was projected under two land use change scenarios – one assuming current deforestation rates and another assuming a 50% reduction in deforestation. A digital elevation model and an adiabatic lapse rate were used to create a fine‐scale map of temperature in the national park. Then, the effects of climate change were projected by fitting statistical models of species abundance as a function of current temperature and forecasting future abundance based on warming from low‐ and high‐emissions climate change. RESULTS: The national park lost 11.8% of its forest from 2000 to 2010. Model‐based projections indicate that high‐elevation species (white‐eared myza Myza sarasinorum and Sulawesi leaf‐warbler Phylloscopus sarasinorum) might be buffered from deforestation because their ranges are isolated from human settlement, but these species may face steep population declines from climate change (by as much as 61%). The middle‐elevation sulphur‐bellied whistler Pachycephala sulfuriventer is predicted to undergo minor declines from climate change (8–11% reduction), while deforestation is predicted to cause larger declines of 13–19%. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The biological richness and rapid deforestation now occurring inside the national park emphasize the need for increased enforcement, while our modelling suggests that climate change is most threatening to high‐elevation endemics. These findings are likely applicable to other highland tropical sites where deforestation is encroaching from below and climate change is stressing high‐elevation species from above.";"Harris, J.

Temporal and spatial changes of land use are analyzed based on 3 land use maps which show 8 land use categories using the topographical maps and aerial photos in 1957-1976-1995. The dominancy of land use categories are calculated depending on grid map (1km x 1km). Each period of grid maps and land use maps are analyzed by spatial intersection method in GIS. As a result of the study, natural land cover and agricultural areas are decreased; residential areas are increased in the three observational periods. According to the changes of these land use categories dominances, there isnt any significant change in natural land cover dominancy although there is a significant increase in dominancy of residential areas and significance decrease in the dominancy of agricultural areas.

A total of 7881 mapping units belonging to 109 soil series were compiled into the database. For each SMU geo-referenced physical, chemical and biological attributes in total 20 characteristics were entered. The selection of the criteria is based on the Soil Geographical Database for Eurasia and The Mediterranean. Spatial analysis was conducted in order to produce soil depth, slope, zinc sufficiency levels and soil salinity maps. However the capability of the database is much more where; specific information for any of the attributes could be extracted and a separate map could be processed for each individual characteristic. The spatial analysis of the data showed that 28.75 % of the soils are deeper than 120 cm where 20 % are shallower than 30 cm. Also nearly 60 % of the country soils are on slopes between 0 to 6 %. The results of the soil salinity analysis were 3.5 % of the country soils had salinity problems where 27 % had zinc deficiencies. Soil Information System (SIS), which could be used for sustainable development for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, is completed with this study. This study can assist and provide detailed soil information for agronomists as well as decision-makers from other disciplines for the improvement and sustainability of the country.

However, protected areas, especially freshwater, are under threat with overexploitation of resources changing the land covers and degrading their capacity to supply services. Information on land cover changes and its implications on ecosystems, its services and people, especially in developing countries at a local scale, is largely absent. This study, therefore, seeks to understand people's dependency on ecosystem services and implications of land cover change on ecosystem services and people, with a case study in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve of Nepal. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, our findings show high dependency of the locals on a vast array of ecosystem services provided by the reserve. More than half of the sampled households were found to directly derive income from ecosystem services of the reserve. However, land cover changes especially declines in forest (16%), swamps/marshes (4%), rivers (14%) and other ecosystems over a period of 34-years impacted the provision of ecosystem services and peopleâs dependency notably. The services from forests declined by about 94%, swamps services by 36% and services from river by 57% which were reported to be the high service suppliers. People's dependency, as perceived by the locals, was reduced by 67% over the last ten years. The study highlighting the supply, demand and implications on ecosystem services and people helped to better understand the complex interaction between humans and ecosystems. These results can be used to develop holistic approaches to restore, conserve and manage the ecosystems, and its services by balancing equal supply and demand of ecosystem services required for a self-sustaining human-environment system. It can also contribute to development of important environmental policies and programs in the area.";"Chaudhary, Sunita

This paper provides an analysis and synthesis of the funding strategies, methods and approaches that have been applied and tested under the Partnership to pilot and scale up IEM and sustainable land management (SLM) practices in the western People's Republic of China under its first 10 years. On the basis of a mix of methods using literature reviews, data collection at selected pilot sites through household questionnaire surveys, stakeholder workshops and field sampling, the following lessons were generated: (i) mainstreaming of IEM into relevant policy and development frameworks has been the most effective way of mobilizing funding for scaling up of SLM; (ii) SLM best practices need to be combined with economic incentives for land users, and pilot demonstrations of SLM need to be integrated into larger investment programmes to achieve impacts and economies of scale; (iii) market‐based approaches to scaling up of SLM, such as payment for ecosystem services and public–private partnerships, have a role to play, but cost–benefit analysis need to be better integrated into payment schemes; (iv) the economic benefits of carbon sequestration are too low to fund eco‐compensation schemes on their own but can provide supplementary funding; and (v) land degradation and SLM monitoring and assessment systems should be multiscale to support decision‐making on SLM and to monitor impact from the local to the national level.

Due to accelerating habitat loss from fragmentation, development, and fire, understanding the pygmy rabbit's ecology has become increasingly important. In 2010, we initiated a study of the status of a pygmy rabbit population and its habitat requirements on U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land near Woodruff in northeastern Utah. We first observed and recorded the presence of the rabbit and its use of the area, and then measured sagebrush height, density, cover, and major and minor crown widths at active burrow and potential burrow sites. We also compared understory characteristics and soil texture at active, recently abandoned, and potential burrow sites. Pellets and sagebrush samples were also analyzed to determine dietary patterns. The height, as well as the major and minor crown widths of the sagebrush, and 2 cover measurements were significantly greater at active burrow sites than at potential burrow sites (P < 0.001). Total grass and forb biomass differed between the sites, with active burrow sites having higher total biomass in the spring compared to abandoned and potential burrow sites (P < 0.05) and higher total biomass in the fall compared to abandoned sites (P < 0.05). The principle component of the soil at all sites was sand, with small amounts of silt and clay. The pygmy rabbit's annual diet consisted of 80.7% sagebrush, and the sagebrush chosen for consumption was higher in crude protein and lower in fiber than nonforaged sagebrush. Our results suggest that maintaining stands of large mature sagebrush will provide pygmy rabbits in this area with preferred burrow and foraging sites that are vital to the persistence of populations in this region.";"Schmalz, Jennifer M.

"AGRIS:US201600132160";"Linking Land Cover Changes in the Sub‐Alpine and Montane Belts to Changes in a Torrential River";"";"Channel changes are the consequence of changes in sediment yield from the slopes and in the connectivity between slopes and channels because of distinct land use and climate impacts. In this study, we investigated the characteristics and evolution of a short reach in the headwater of the Ijuez River, central–southern Pyrenees. Assessment of a series of sedimentary and geomorphic structures confirmed major changes to the valley bottom, mainly related to changes in the intensity of human activity. The oldest sedimentary structure is a terrace level located 3 to 4 m above the current alluvial plain. General deforestation, overgrazing and recurring fires in the montane belt (1100–1600 m a.s.l.) have led to increased soil erosion and connectivity, and to the triggering of debris flows that have been deposited on the fluvial terrace. Woody fragments from within the debris flows were dated using accelerator mass spectrometry ¹⁴C radiocarbon techniques (AMS), yielding ages between 100 and 115 cal years bp, which coincides with the period of maximum deforestation and human density in the Pyrenees. Depopulation and farmland abandonment since the beginning of the 20th century has resulted in generalized natural and artificial reforestation, a shrinkage of the eroded areas and a decline in connectivity between slopes and the channel. The most important consequence has been channel incision and narrowing, and the development of a sediment armour layer. Active sediment transport is continuing, although there has been a decrease in sediment yield from the slopes. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Sanjuán, Yasmina

"AGRIS:US201500015647";"Measuring impacts of community forestry program through repeat photography and satellite remote sensing in the Dolakha district of Nepal";"";"During the 1990's community-based forest management gained momentum in Nepal. This study systematically evaluates the impacts that this had on land cover change and other associated aspects during the period 1990–2010 using repeat photography and satellite imagery in combination with interviews with community members. The results of the study clearly reflect the success of community-based forest management in the Dolakha district of the mid-hills of Nepal: during the study period, the rate of conversion of sparse forest into dense forest under community-based management was found to be between 1.13% and 3.39% per year. Similarly, the rate of conversion of non-forest area into forest was found to be between 1.11% and 1.96% per year. Community-based forest management has resulted in more efficient use of forest resources, contributed to a decline in the use of slash-and-burn agricultural practices, reduced the incidence of forest fires, spurred tree plantation, and encouraged the conservation and protection of trees on both public and private land. The resulting reclamation of forest in landside areas and river banks and the overall improvement in forest cover in the area has reduced flash floods and associated landslides.";"Niraula, Rabin Raj

"AGRIS:US201600132166";"Soil Erosion in Steep Road Cut Slopes in Palencia (Spain)";"";"Construction associated to land development, such as roads and railroads, promote severe land degradation. Cutslope sediment yield is one of the major pollutants on waters close to the road and railroad network. To estimate road impact, soil erosion (E), sediment yield (SY) and morphological evolution of a railroad cut in Palencia (Spain), were studied using erosion nails, during the periods 1998–1999, 1999–2000 and 2000–2010. Data from two sample plots were analyzed by an ANOVA for repeated measures. Slope morphological evolution was estimated using a cubic polynomial regression, while E and SY were calculated by integration. The top and the toe of the slope eroded and accumulated 0·5 m respectively, evolving into a concave/convex slope profile. The mean measured E was 220 Mg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. SY was 31 Mg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, ranging from 109 Mg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ to 24 Mg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. Sediment yield was 4·5 times higher during the first year, than in all subsequent years. Results showed a decreasing trend and a stabilization in E and SY rates. However, both rates remain high and critical over the analyzed time, with regards to soil formation, water protection, land degradation and infrastructure maintenance.

The degradation of soil and vegetation by deforestation and overgrazing is one of the downsides of this development, reducing the capacity of the land to provide ecosystem functions and services. In this study, climate simulations are brought together with secondary socioeconomic, pedologic and remote‐sensing data in a GIS‐based assessment of the factors commonly associated with land degradation risk. A high resolution overview is provided for decision‐makers and stakeholders in the region by identifying priority intervention areas where a long‐term decline in ecosystem function and land productivity is most likely to occur. The approach combines 19 risk factors into seven individual ratings for topography, landcover, soil, demography, infrastructure, livestock pressure and climate. These ratings are then weighted and combined into an integrated degradation risk index (DRI). The results show that the land degradation risk is quite heterogeneously distributed in the study area and caused by different factors. Three hot‐spots are identified and compared, one of which is in the far northwestern part of the catchment, one around the local center Rundu and one on the outskirts of the Okavango Delta. We conclude that the approach is suitable to give an overview on degradation risk in the study area, although the classification process is a crucial procedure that should be standardized for further research.

The case of Ceres, 1979 and 1980";"";"In 1979 and 1980 predators were under control on sheep farms in the Ceres Karoo. At the time, a subsidised hunting club assisted landowners with predator control measures. A farm-level analysis of data from the Ceres hunting club's logbooks reveals that four out of five farms have experienced no predator damage whatsoever. For those reporting problems, the typical loss was in the region of one per cent of the estimated turnover. Lynx (caracal), leopards and feral dogs were responsible for most of the damage. Black-backed jackals were not a serious concern, but were also more difficult to catch. Lynx and feral dogs were controlled with ease. Death of some innocent animals was also recorded. The hunting club system thus appears to be succeeding in controlling certain predators, albeit with adverse consequences to other animals. Exploratory statistical analysis establishes that livestock losses lead to increased control efforts, which in turn leads to the death of more targeted and untargeted animals. There is even some evidence that more control efforts reduce stock losses in the following year.";"Conradie, B.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"landowners";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400184566";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2012.649540";"";"";"";"96-113"

Because such damages are expected to increase with changes in wildfire regimes, this calls for more effective wildfire mitigation and adaptation strategies. Wildfire adaptation options for forestland owners include purchasing wildfire insurance, which provides compensation to those insured if a wildfire damages their properties. We attempt to (i) identify factors that influence the decision of family forestland owners in the southern United States to purchase wildfire insurance for their forestlands via logistic regression using landowner survey data and (ii) examine the propensity of these landowners to purchase wildfire insurance under climate change. We find that landowners are much more likely to purchase wildfire insurance if they are female or well educated or if their land is not classed as heirsâ property, has been hit by a hurricane, or has not been burned by wildfire previously. Because climate change is likely to alter future wildfire and hurricane activity in the region, more forestland owners are predicted to purchase wildfire insurance, although the magnitude of such an increase appears moderate under current market institutions. These results would be helpful for developing new wildfire insurance programs and increasing the participation of forestland owners in the wildfire insurance market.";"Gan, Jianbang

"AGRIS:US201300745257";"Model for performance based land area and water allocation within irrigation schemes";"";"This paper focuses on irrigation schemes under rotational water supply in arid and semiarid regions. It presents a methodology for developing plans for optimum allocation of land area and water, considering performance measures such as productivity, equity and adequacy. These irrigation schemes are characterized by limited water supply and heterogeneity in soils, crops, climate and water distribution network, etc. The methodology proposed in this paper, therefore, uses a previously developed simulation-optimization model (Area and Water Allocation Model, AWAM) that considers the heterogeneity of the irrigation scheme in the allocation process, and modifies this to take account of equity and adequacy of supply to irrigated areas. The AWAM model has four phases to be executed separately for each set of irrigation interval over the irrigation season: 1. generation of irrigation strategies for each crop-soil-region combination (CSR unit), 2. preparation of irrigation programmes for each irrigation strategy, 3. selection of specified number of irrigation programmes for each CSR unit and 4. optimum allocation of land area and water to different parts of the irrigation scheme (allocation units) for maximizing productivity. In the modified AWAM model, the adequacy is included at Phase-2 (by including only the irrigation programmes for full irrigation of each CSR unit) and equity is included at Phase-4 (by including the constraints for equity). The paper briefly discusses the applicability of the modified AWAM model for a case study of Nazare medium irrigation scheme in Southern India. The results of the case study indicated that the performance measures of productivity, equity and adequacy conflict with each other.";"Gorantiwar, S. D.

"AGRIS:US201400177957";"Small island developing states: coastal systems, global change and sustainability";"";"The intent of this paper is to place the concepts of exposure, vulnerability, resilience and risk in the context of the consequences of global change for the sustainable development of small island developing states (SIDS). Many such states face a number of global climate change risks, such as an increase in the proportion of more intense storms, along with other global change threats that include energy security and costs. All these threats come on top of local development threats, such as increased run-off, often with increasing levels of contaminants due to unsustainable agricultural and industrial practices. When taken together, the resulting pressures on islands and their communities lead to significant increases in vulnerability to change due to reduced resilience to these changes. Vulnerability is also increasing as a result of contemporary processes that heighten the exposure of material and other assets. The capacity to address hazard risk also influences vulnerability. This includes the level of awareness of coastal hazards and exposure, and access to critical life support infrastructure, especially for people living in hazard-prone areas. Vulnerability and resilience are considered to be important integrating concepts when managing the local consequences of global changes. There are many initiatives that will help reduce the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of SIDS to such changes. These include improving risk knowledge and coastal resource and land use management, while also strengthening socio-economic systems and livelihoods. In this way, managing global change can be closely aligned with local development and humanitarian processes, thereby enhancing the overall sustainability of development processes and outcomes.";"Hay, John E.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use planning;climate change;sustainable development";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400177957";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-013-0214-8";"";"";"";"309-326"

As a result, projects such as Urbanization and Global Environmental Change (UGEC) launched by the International Human Dimension Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP) and the Global Land Project (GLP) jointly proposed by IHDP and IGBP were developed to study the interactions between human activities, land systems, and natural environmental change. Based on a biophysical approach, urban energy theory and Multi-Objective Land Allocation (MOLA), the research presented here develops an integrated ecosystem model for the Taipei-Taoyuan area of Taiwan to enhance understanding of the interactions among energy flows, land use preferences and land use change. This paper illustrates how the joint application of an integrated ecosystem model with MOLA can be used in the simulation of land cover change in a region moving from an agricultural landscape to an urbanized system. The integrated ecosystem model also mimics the interactions between human preferences on land use and development allocations in socio-economic systems and potential material and energy flows in ecosystems with high spatial resolution.";"Wang, Szu-Hua

While soil OC erosion is likely to be a major component of the global C cycle, water erosion-induced CO₂ emissions remain uncertain. In this study, our main objective was to compare the release of CO₂ from eroded topsoils and from the sediments exported by diffuse erosion during an entire rainy season. Conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) maize treatments were considered in an attempt to set up best management practices to mitigate gaseous OC losses from agricultural soils. The study was conducted in the KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, whereas in many other areas of the developing world, erosion is severe and crop residue scarcity is the main challenge. CO₂ emissions from undisturbed 0–0.02m soil samples collected within 2.25m×10m runoff plots and from exported sediments by water erosion, were evaluated continuously at the laboratory over a 140-day period and compared to soil OC stocks. NT significantly reduced CO₂ emissions from both soils and sediments. Overall NT, which exhibited a greater carbon density than CT (17.70 vs 13.19kgCm⁻³), reduced soil gaseous emissions by 4.4% (10.40 vs 10.88gCO₂-Cm⁻², P<0.05) but had a much greater impact on the release of CO₂ from eroded sediments (0.185 vs 0.778gCO₂-Cm⁻²), which corresponded to a 76.3% decrease. For CT, cumulative 141-day emissions were, 19% greater in sediments (0.048gCO₂-CgC⁻¹) compared to soils (0.040gCO₂-CgC⁻¹), while for NT, emissions were 33% lower in sediments (0.024gCO₂-CgC⁻¹) compared to soils (0.032gCO₂-CgC⁻¹), these differences being significant at P<0.05. The lower erosion-induced CO₂ emissions under NT could be explained by a high soil aggregate stability (mean weight diameter of 2.29±0.05mm for NT vs 1.59±0.07mm for CT, P<0.05) and the associated enhanced protection of SOC from the decomposers. These results on a land management control of water erosion-induced CO₂ emissions, might allow improving the impact of terrestrial ecosystems on greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere and associated climate change.";"Chaplot, V.

"AGRIS:US201500199350";"Land exploitation resulting in soil salinization in a desert–oasis ecotone";"";"Understanding the process of agricultural land expansion and its impact on soil properties is crucial for land management and environmental health. A desert–oasis ecotone is typically located between an oasis at the lower reach of inland rivers and neighboring desert in arid regions, and acts as an interactive zone between irrigated farmland and the natural desert ecosystem. The arid region of northwest China has experienced dramatic land exploitation since the 1960s and soil salinization has been a serious environmental problem ever since. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between land exploitation and soil salt accumulation in the topsoil. A typical desert–oasis ecotone, the Fubei region at the lower reach of the Sangong River catchment in arid northwest China, was used as a case study. The results revealed the following: (1) overexploitation of land resources has been astonishing since 1960, with >40% of the area becoming irrigated farmland. There was frequent transition of land-use types from one to another, with about 38% of the area experiencing transitional change during 1982–2009. (2) Comparing soil salt content with land use during 1982–2009 showed an expanding area of soil salinity and an increased degree of salinity in all land-use types. The area with soil salt content>20g/kg increased by 16.4%, while the area with soil salt content of 5–10g/kg decreased by 42% during 1982–2009. In addition, the amount of overall soil salt accumulation was about 21.6×10¹⁰g in the study area during 1982–2009, and soil salt accumulation per unit area increased by 60%, with salt accumulation in farmland, grassland and saline-alkali land higher than for other land-use types (p<0.05). (3) The dramatic salt accumulation was a result of agricultural land exploitation that requires irrigation, and this directly caused a rising groundwater table, and then higher evaporation led to soil salinization. Collectively, the results indicate that overexploitation of land resources had large and prolonged effects on soil salinization, which is a lesson to be learned for integrated land management in similar ecotones in arid zones.";"Wang, Yugang

Increasingly, this PPCO is being challenged, particularly in international investment law. This paper analyzes the efficiency properties of a PPCO in a model with endogenous regulation, investment and entry. We design a one-parameter family of carve-out/compensation schemes that induce efficient regulation and firm level investment even when the regulator suffers fiscal illusion and the social benefit from regulation is private information to the regulator. We show that offering a carve-out reduces the subsidy to risky industry implicit in compensation rules; thus, a carve-out can mitigate the entry problem.";"Aisbett, Emma

Land-cover change in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is different from that in the lowlands; however, a detailed land-cover change in areas such as the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) basin in the TP has not been reported. To fill this gap, the current study explores the land-cover change between 1985 and 2005 in the YTR basin. The results show that only 1 % of the land cover in the YTR basin changed during this time period. The most significant land-cover changes included increases in forest and built-up areas as well as decreases in grassland, water and wetland areas. By percentage, the most rapid land-cover change occurred for built-up areas with an annual variation of 2.07 %. There was an obvious vertical distribution pattern for land-cover types in the YTR basin; from low to high, the average altitudes were forest, farmland, built-up, grassland, water and wetland, and bare land. The average altitude and slope for most land-cover types did not vary over the past 20 years. However, the average altitude and slope of built-up significantly decreased, especially in the zone between 3,500 and 4,000 m. The water and wetland area in altitudes above 4,500 m increased; however, they decreased in the zone between 3,500 and 4,000 m. Natural factors cause most land-cover changes, whereas the increasing intensity of human activities cause some changes to built-up and farmland. Additional attention should be paid to the study of the mechanism of land-cover change in the TP.";"Li, Fapeng

"AGRIS:US201600198097";"Greenbelts in Germany's regional plansâAn effective growth management policy?";"";"Greenbelts are the best-known growth management policies in Germany. As part of its regional plans, they attempt to keep undeveloped areas permanently open, thus avoiding sprawling, i.e., land consumptive forms of urban development. However, the effectiveness of such land use designations in terms of guiding and limiting urban growth has rarely been the subject of in-depth research. This is the first study to present a GIS-based analysis of the restrictiveness of greenbelt designations in Germany and their impact on urban spatial structure and land use. The key question is to what extent greenbelts actually limit urban growth, both individually and in combination with other policy instruments of open space conservation. Key indicators are the tightness of greenbelts around urban areas and their effect on the regional patterns of urban growth, measured by the increase of built-up areas in contained (the inbound area) and uncontained (outside the greenbelt) communities. Our empirical results for four case study regions suggest that greenbelts are an effective means of open space preservation. The impact of greenbelts on spatial urban structure, however, seems to be limited due to a relatively low degree of tightness.";"Siedentop, Stefan

"AGRIS:US201600179853";"Bernstein's Puzzle: Peasants, Accumulation and Class Alliances in Africa";"";"To establish the significance of Henry Bernstein's theoretical work on the dynamics of agrarian class struggles in Africa, this paper discusses two important political debates in which he has been both observer and participant, and that have oriented much of the subsequent Marxist work done in Africa on agrarian change. The first was the heated discussion begun over 40âyears ago around Nyerere's âAfrican socialismâ and the failures of the ujamaa policy of villagization. The second is the still unsettled debate around programmes of redistributive land reform in South Africa. Bernstein's distinction between the peasantry and petty commodity production allowed him to apply Lenin's theory of peasant differentiation to new contexts, and to locate African class struggles within the contradictions between capital and labour. He thus disposed of two competing visions: the harmonic peasant community and the maximizing entrepreneurial peasant hindered by the absence of markets. Yet, this paper argues, his focus on class formation within the peasantry can also limit our understanding of class alliances in the politics of antiâcapitalist struggles in Africa.";"O'laughlin, Bridget";"";"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"ZAF;002;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600179853";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.12177";"";"";"";"390-409"

Four land cover maps were produced for each watershed for 1957/1958, 1975, 1986, and 2000/2001. Nine different types of land cover were identified, five of which were forest cover classes. Between 1957 and 2001, the total forest cover increased in Gilgel Abbay (from 10 to 22� % cover) and decreased in Birr (from 29 to 22� % cover) as well as in Upper-Didesa (from 89 to 45� % cover). The increase in Gilgel Abbay was primarily due to the expansion of eucalyptus plantations. Natural forest cover decreased in all three watersheds. Wooded grassland decreased by two-thirds, dry/moist mixed forests decreased by half, and riverine forests had disappeared by 1975 in Gilgel Abbay and Birr. Major deforestation had already taken place in the northern watersheds, Gilgel Abbay and Birr, before the 1960s and 1970s, while in the southern watershed, Upper-Didesa, much of the deforestation occurred after 1975. The southern watershed still remained by far the most forested watershed in 2001 despite the strong ongoing deforestation. The changes in forest cover could affect natural resource management, greenhouse gas emissions, water resources, and agricultural production including coffee production. The patterns of change are different in the three watersheds. We therefore recommend further studies of the local conditions and drivers of change as the basis for designing effective policy to halt further loss of natural forest, which offers a wealth of ecosystem services.";"Gebrehiwot, Solomon Gebreyohannis

The study emphasizes the role of local governance through an agreement aimed at re-orienting land use activities and forest management. We also present the technical, methodological, and cost-benefit studies behind the proposed framework. For instance, we found that cattle raising profitability in Apuí offers an opportunity for implementing such a pilot project. The framework proposed by the project engage stakeholders and bind together interests of governmental, non-governmental, and local civilian institutions in an agreement mechanism of mutual commitments. We highlight the related challenges and caveats, and the steps identified to overcome these hurdles. This proposal is based on a “Zero Deforestation Pact Agreement” that substitutes “command and control” mechanisms by using positive incentives.

"AGRIS:US201300755594";"How effective are broad-scale nutrient mass balances for determining the sustainability of lot-feed manure application";"";"Nutrient mass balances have been used to assess a variety of land resource scenarios, at various scales. They are widely used as a simple basis for policy, planning, and regulatory decisions but it is not clear how accurately they reflect reality. This study provides a critique of broad-scale nutrient mass balances, with particular application to the fertiliser use of beef lot-feeding manure in Queensland. Mass balances completed at the district and farm scale were found to misrepresent actual manure management behaviour and potentially the risk of nutrient contamination of water resources. The difficulties of handling stockpile manure and concerns about soil compaction mean that manure is spread thickly over a few paddocks at a time and not evenly across a whole farm. Consequently, higher nutrient loads were applied to a single paddock less frequently than annually. This resulted in years with excess nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium remaining in the soil profile. This conclusion was supported by evidence of significant nutrient movement in several of the soil profiles studied. Spreading manure is profitable, but maximum returns can be associated with increased risk of nutrient leaching relative to conventional inorganic fertiliser practices. Bio-economic simulations found this increased risk where manure was applied to supply crop nitrogen requirements (the practice of the case study farms, 200-5000 head lot-feeders). Thus, the use of broad-scale mass balances can be misleading because paddock management is spatially heterogeneous and this leads to increased local potential for nutrient loss. In response to the effect of spatial heterogeneity policy makers who intend to use mass balance techniques to estimate potential for nutrient contamination should apply these techniques conservatively.";"Redding, M.R.

The assessment concentrates on the conditions and causes of the channel development in the last c. 200years compared with the state of European channels, especially those of the Carpathian zone. The Morávka R. pattern has undergone a rapid change in the last 50years, particularly in connection with the active channel narrowing and massive incision. The original anabranching river pattern has gradually been replaced by a simple, narrowed channel incised into the bedrock. The average width of the Morávka R. active channel changed from 153m in 1836–1852 and 165m in 1876–1878 to 44m in the year 2010. At some parts, the original river bed has lowered as much as 8m in the last 40years, which indicates an incision rate of 12–24cm/year. These changes have been caused by strong anthropogenic impacts in the form of the river-channel control, bank stabilisation, and weir and valley dam construction. Other reasons are related to land cover and land-use changes. A great influence on the contemporary processes is also exerted by the geological predisposition of the Carpathian flysch lithology in channel bedrock, particularly the occurrence of claystone layers that present little resistance to water erosion. Currently, the deficit of transportable sedimentary material along with the increased transport capacity of the incised river bed has generated conditions for constantly intensifying erosion processes in the Morávka R. channel.";"Škarpich, Václav

The majority of the valley is protected within the Upper Dividalen Landscape Conservation Area and National Park. A general conception is that until the mid-nineteenth century when agriculture and forestry entered the valley, the landscape was entirely untouched by man and only used as a pathway for Sami and their reindeer herds on their annual migrations between Sweden and the Norwegian coast. Recent investigations on culturally modified trees and fossil pollen from mires have, however, revealed quite a different story. Sami reindeer pastoralism has affected the vegetation composition from the early seventeenth century to the nineteenth century, and traditional land use should be acknowledged as a long present factor in forming the landscape and cultural heritage. The climatic deterioration known as the Little Ice Age had a severe effect on the pine forest stand structure during the same centuries, forming the culmination of a period of climatic stress initiated already in the thirteenth century. Both long-term cultural and climatic factors are thus important to understand the vegetation dynamics and resulting biodiversity within the protected areas.";"Sjögren, Per

This study was conducted during early spring of 2013 and 2014 to monitor the concentration of PM at three different land surfaces (bare land, urban forest, and lake) in the Olympic Park in Beijing and to analyze its effect on the concentration of meteorological factors and the dry deposition onto different land cover types. The results showed that diurnal variation of PM concentrations at the three different land surfaces had no significant regulations, and sharp short-term increases in PM10 (particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter <10 μm) occurred occasionally. The concentrations also differed from one land cover type to another at the same time, but the regulation was insignificant. The most important meteorological factor influencing the PM concentration is relative humidity; it is positively correlated with the PM concentration. While in the forests, the wind speed and irradiance also influenced the PM concentration by affecting the capture capacity of trees and dry deposition velocity. Other factors were not correlated with or influenced by the PM concentration. In addition, the hourly dry deposition in unit area (μg/m²) onto the three types of land surfaces and the removal efficiency based on the ratio of dry deposition and PM concentration were calculated. The results showed that the forest has the best removal capacity for both PM2.5 (particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm) and PM10 because of the faster deposition velocity and relatively low resuspension rate. The lake’s PM10 removal efficiency is higher than that of the bare land because of the relatively higher PM resuspension rates on the bare land. However, the PM2.5 removal efficiency is lower than that of the bare land because of the significantly lower dry deposition velocity.";"Liu, Jiakai

The analysis focuses on four identified vulnerable sectors — food (NTFPs), energy (fuelwood), health (medicinal plants) and water (freshwater) through a multi-stakeholder dialog at national and regional levels. We use a vulnerability assessment framework by combining the elements of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to conceptualize vulnerability in these sectors. The identified sectors in relation to the forest ecosystem are discussed in view of providing an understanding of the sector's potential adaptive capacities for policy intervention. Our analysis presents the possible implications of the vulnerability of these sectors for planning local and national adaptation strategies. Local and national adaptive capacities to respond to climate impacts in the forest sectors includes: reducing poverty, enhancing food security, water availability, combating land degradation and reducing loss of biological diversity.";"Sonwa, Denis J.

Carbon storages for each forest ecosystem were projected according to inventory data, and carbon storages were mapped in a geographic information system (GIS).

The Pagsanjan–Lumban catchment contributes about 18–20% of the total freshwater inflows to the lake but represents only 10% of the catchment area. In this study the suspended sediment transport model, SedNet, was used to assess the relative impacts of changes in land use within the catchment on the quantities of suspended sediment discharged to the lake. The SedNet model predicted the total suspended sediment supply from the Pagsanjan–Lumban catchment (280km²) to be 231.2kt/y of which almost 70% was predicted to come from Balanac River, 23% from Bombongan River and the remaining 7% from the catchment downstream of these two river systems. Overall, the suspended sediment supply was predicted to decrease by 8% for every 20% of intercropped coconut plantations converted to forest. A greater reduction in the total suspended sediment yield discharging to the lake was predicted when reforestation was targeted at the steep slopes (<6.6°) than when reforestation was untargeted (20% reduction compared with approximately 7%). The major limitation with the application of the SedNet model for this work was the limited availability of input data such as more detailed land use classifications (i.e. differentiating plantation into various kinds of crops, as well as different types of grass covers) and information about gullies throughout the catchment. This improved data input would provide greater accuracy and confidence in the modelling. However, the model was very useful for giving a preliminary assessment of the sources of suspended sediment transported from the catchment, and for targeting reforestation for reducing suspended sediment accessions to the lake.";"Hernandez, E.C.

"AGRIS:US201500013990";"Land use and management effects on soil organic matter fractions in Rhodic Ferralsols and Haplic Arenosols in Bindura and Shamva districts of Zimbabwe";"";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major attribute of soil quality that responds to land management activities which is also important in the regulation of global carbon (C) cycling. This study evaluated bulk soil C and nitrogen (N) contents and C and N dynamics in three soil organic matter (SOM) fractions separated by density. The study was based on three tillage systems on farmer managed experiments (conventional tillage (CT), ripping (RP), direct seeding (DS)) and adjacent natural forest (NF) in Haplic Arenosols (sandy) and Rhodic Ferralsols (clayey) of Zimbabwe. Carbon stocks were significantly larger in forests than tillage systems, being significantly lower in sandy soils (15 and 14MgCha⁻¹) than clayey soils (23 and 21MgCha⁻¹) at 0–10 and 10–30cm respectively. Nitrogen content followed the same trend. At the 0–10cm depth, SOC stocks increased under CT, RP and DS by 0.10, 0.24, 0.36Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ and 0.76, 0.54, 0.10Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ on sandy and clayey soils respectively over a four year period while N stocks decreased by 0.55, 0.40, 0.56Mgha⁻¹ and 0.63, 0.65, 0.55Mgha⁻¹ respectively. SOM fractions were dominated by mineral associated heavy fraction (MaHF) which accounted for 86–93% and 94–98% on sandy and clayey soils respectively. Tillage systems on sandy soils had the smallest average free light fraction (fLF) and occluded light fraction (oLF) C stocks (25.3±1.3 g m⁻² and 7.3±1.2gm⁻²) at 0–30cm when compared with corresponding NF (58.4±4 gm² and 18.5±1.0gm⁻²). Clayey soils, had the opposite, having all fLF C and N in tillage systems being higher (80.9±12gC m⁻² and 2.7±0.4gNm⁻²) than NF (57.4±2.0gCm⁻² and 2.4±0.3gNm⁻²). Results suggest that oLF and MaHF C and N are better protected under DS and RP where they are less vulnerable to mineralisation while fLF contributes more in CT. Thus, DS and RP can be important in maintaining and improving soil quality although their practicability can be hampered by unsupportive institutional frameworks. Under prevailing climatic and management conditions, improvement of residue retention could be a major factor that can distinguish the potential of different management practices for C sequestration. The exploitation of the benefits of RP or DS and the corresponding sustainability of systems need support for surface cover retention which should also be extended to conventional tillage.";"Mujuru, L.

"AGRIS:US2016219500";"Inputs use in the agriculture of Emilia-Romagna: farm comparison through the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) index";"";"In order to measure agriculture sustainability, the efficient use of inputs becomes a crucial issue. In this perspective, theanalysts concentrate their attention on the total factor productivity index (TFP). In this view, Lynam and Herdt (1989) proposed theTFP as a suitable assessment of the sustainability of single crops, of cropping systems or of farming systems. Even if the TFP doesnot take into account the non-market output (social and environmental aspects), it is possible to argue that a negative trend of TFPrepresents a resources’ degradation if related to the generated outputs. On the other hand, the non-negative trend of TFPrepresents a fitting measure of a sustainable agricultural system and of an efficient use of the resources. The aim of the paper is toanalyze the productivity in the use of external factors in different types of farming at the Emilia-Romagna Region level, i.e.specialist field crops, specialist permanent crops and specialist milk production farms. A significant number of indexing proceduresis accessible to evaluate the efficiency in converting inputs into outputs. In this paper, the TFP is estimated through an indirectevaluation of quantity index of outputs and inputs of each farming system taken into account in the analysis. Purposely, the amountof the total sales is considered as a measure of the output, whereas labour, capital, external inputs and other intermediateconsumption are considered as a measure of the inputs. Data, referred to the period 2000 – 2009, are collected from the farmaccountancy data network of the Emilia Romagna Region DG Agriculture. The study highlights how the TFP is a convenient indexto evaluate the efficiency in the use of resources. In a broader view, the TFP index trend allows an estimation of economical andsocial benefits or damages which in the end improves or worsens environmental quality.";"Ghelfi, Rino

"AGRIS:US201301538259";"Analysing urban expansion and land use suitability for the city of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, and its surrounding region";"";"This study aimed at quantifying changes in urban area of the city of Kahramanmaraş (K.Maraş) between 1948 and 2006, and analysing suitability of existing land use (LU) to the land potential. Urban change information was derived from two black-white monoscopic aerial photographs, and IKONOS and the QuickBird images acquired in 1948, 1985, 2000 and 2006, respectively. QuickBird image and soil map with 1:25,000 scale were used to analyze suitability of the current LU pattern to the land potential. The findings showed that the urban area of K.Maraş has expanded approximately 13 times during the past six decades. According to current LU and the soil map, productive and moderately productive soils were largely (73.2%) allocated for agricultural activities, which means that there was a strong consistency between the agricultural LU type and the land capability. However, widespread agriculture on the non-productive soils, and urbanization on the fertile agricultural lands were assessed as unsuitable from sustainable LU viewpoint. Considering this phenomenon, it is possible to say that rapid urban expansion has a growing pressure on the fertile agricultural soils. Monitoring LU changes, particularly urbanization, and developing effective LU plans based on the land capability were determined as the most important approaches to encourage sustainable use of land.";"Doygun, Hakan

Their short analysis was realized in the conditions of the Republic of Belarus. It was suggested to consider energy expenses as a combination of techno-energy expenses and bio-energy expenses. Correlation analysis of the relation between space factors and energy expenses was conducted. The influence of space factors and production qualities of land on energy expenses in farming was estimated. Equations for the calculation of energy expenses while conducting intra-field mechanized works during crops cultivation were suggested. The closest correlation communication with techno-energy expenses have run length (R=0.92) and specific resistance of soils (R = 0.89). It was established, that with increase in run length of a working site from 100 to 1200 m decreased in power inputs of fuel with 879 to 706 mJ/ha was observed, and with increase in specific resistance of soil from 50 to 70 kilopaskal expenses of fuel energy increased from 743 to 1021 mJ/ha.

"AGRIS:US201400139784";"TWENTIETH CENTURY LAND RESILIENCE IN MONTENEGRO AND CONSEQUENT HYDROLOGICAL RESPONSE";"";"To study the magnitude of land degradation, desertification or resilience in Montenegro throughout the 20th and early‐21st centuries, we rephotographed the landscapes recorded on 48 historical photographs dating back to between 1890 and 1985, and analysed in a semi‐quantitative way the land use and cover changes that had occurred using an expert rating system (six correspondents). Time‐series of hydrology and population density were analysed for the period since 1948 and were compared with the changes observed using repeat photography. Overall, vegetation cover has strongly increased, and barren areas occupy less space. The industrialisation that expanded in the 1950s led to strong urbanisation. Despite steadily increasing population (with the notable exception of the mountain region), the vegetation cover has increased markedly everywhere. This denser vegetation has led to higher infiltration of rainfall. Partitioning of water led, on one hand, to deep infiltration and better low flows and to increased evapo‐transpiration at the boundary layer, leading to decreased total runoff coefficients. In the mountain region, runoff coefficients have increased, which may be related to earlier snowmelt. Overall, the findings of this study are in line with observations elsewhere in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and suggest that, as a result of erosion control and significant vegetation regrowth, the changes observed over a century there has been land resilience and not degradation.

"AGRIS:US201301850101";"Dew formation characteristics in a revegetation-stabilized desert ecosystem in Shapotou area, Northern China";"";"Soil moisture in the upper layer plays an important role in arid desert ecosystems. Dew as an additional source of fresh water, may have a positive impact upon the ecosystems in arid and semi-arid zones. Measurements on dew formation amount and duration were carried out in the whole October of 2008 at different condensing surface types (bare dune sands, physical soil crusts and biological soil crusts) associated with different inter-space positions between plants, and at the area under plant canopy in a revegetation-stabilized arid desert ecosystem in Shapotou area, China. The results indicated that there was a positive linear correlation between dew amounts and relative humidity, while mean temperature was negatively linearly related to dew amounts and no significant relationship was found between dew amounts and wind speed. Clear and foggy mornings were characterized by higher dew amounts and longer dew duration, whereas less dew was recorded during cloudy and especially windy mornings. Crusts, especially the biological soil crusts, obtained significantly higher amounts of dew than that of bare moving sand dunes. It was more difficult for dew to condense under the canopy of the plants than on the bare sand dunes. At the first stage of ecological engineering projects, dew can renew the moisture losing through the evaporation of soil and transpiration of leaves, and thus can supply important source of water for xerophytic shrubs. The higher dew amount at the inter-space of re-vegetated plants is an important driving factor for the growth of microorganisms and spore plants, which further accelerate the formation of biological soil crusts and stabilization of moving sand dunes. The presence of biological soil crusts, in turn, helps to facilitate the formation of dew. Therefore, a mutual enhanced effect exists between dew and artificially revegetation ecosystems.";"Pan, Yan-xia

"AGRIS:US201400139786";"Historical landscape photographs for calibration of Landsat land use/cover in the northern Ethiopian highlands";"";"The combined effects of erosive rains, steep slopes and human land use have caused severe land degradation in the Ethiopian Highlands for several thousand years, but since the 1970s, however, land rehabilitation programmes have been established to try to reverse deterioration. In order to characterize and quantify the transformations in the north Ethiopian Highlands, a study was carried out over 8884 km² of the Tigray Highlands of northern Ethiopia. Using Landsat Multispectral Scanner and later Thematic Mapper imagery (1972, 1984/1986 and 2000), historical terrestrial photographs (1974–1975) and fieldwork (2008), we prepared land use and cover maps. For assessing the use of the historical terrestrial photographs, Landsat images from 1972 were classified using two different methods, namely conventional change detection (image differencing) and ground truthing (using the historical photographs of 1974–1975). Results show that the use of terrestrial photographs is promising, as the classification accuracy based on this method (Kappa coefficient 0·54) is better than the classification accuracy of the method based on image differencing (Kappa coefficient 0·46). Major land use and cover changes indicate the following: (1) a gradual but significant decline in bare ground (32 per cent in 1972 to 8 per cent in 2000); (2) a significant increase of bushland (25 to 43 per cent) and total forest area (including eucalypt plantations, 2·6 to 6·3 per cent); and (3) creation of numerous lakes and ponds. The dominant change trajectory (27 per cent of the study area) indicates a gradual or recent vegetation increase. These changes can be linked to the population growth and the introduction of land rehabilitation initiatives, complemented by growing awareness of land holders.

"AGRIS:US201500053047";"Variable retention silviculture in Tasmania's wet forests: ecological rationale, adaptive management and synthesis of biodiversity benefits";"";"SummaryThe recognition that biodiversity conservation requires more than a system of reserves has led to the need to consider the outcomes of land management actions, such as timber harvesting, in the matrix land outside reserves. The design of harvesting systems can be guided by the natural disturbance regime, which in Tasmania's lowland wet eucalypt forests is infrequent, intense wildfire. Clearfell, burn and sow silviculture has been used since the 1960s for harvesting these forests but, while this system is practical and effectively regenerates eucalypts in harvested coupes, it is predicted to lead to losses at the coupe level of late-successional species and structures that would survive into stands regenerating following natural wildfire. Variable retention silviculture is thus currently being implemented as an alternative to clearfelling in wet old-growth forest on public land (state forest) in Tasmania. In contrast to clearfelling, variable retention has the explicit ecological goal of maintaining some species, habitats and structural legacies from the pre-harvest forest into the harvested and regenerating stand. This paper synthesises biodiversity findings from the Warra Silvicultural Systems Trial (SST), established in 1997, and demonstrates that aggregated retention is the optimal form of variable retention for ensuring coupe-scale persistence (‘lifeboating’) of mature-forest biodiversity. In addition to providing retained forest, aggregates are also designed to facilitate recolonisation of harvested areas by mature-forest species (‘forest influence’), and to provide connectivity across the forest stand. In the last few years, more than 50 aggregated-retention coupes have been harvested in mature forest across Tasmania. Development and implementation of variable retention in Tasmania is an example of active adaptive management, which we describe in relation to five steps for a formalised adaptive management program, indicating how ecological criteria are incorporated in operational guidelines for implementation of aggregated retention.";"Baker, Susan C.

"AGRIS:QY2016600548";"Adoption of maize production technologies in Eastern Tanzania";"";"This study of the adoption of maize production technologies in Eastern Tanzania forms part of a larger study to evaluate the impact of maize research and extension throughout Tanzania over the past 20 years. Using a structured questionnaire, researchers and extension officers interviewed farmers in June-November 1995. Survey data were classified by agroecological zone (the lowlands and the intermediate zone). The two-stage least squares analysis showed that the availability of labor, extension intensity, and variety characteristics were significant factors affecting how much land a farmer was likely to allocate to improve maize. Short-maturing and medium-maturing varieties increased the probability of allocating land at the means by about 15% and 21%, respectively. Labor and extension increased the probability of allocating land at the means by about 3% and 22%, respectively. Farmers in the lowlands are less likely (by about 3%) to allocate land to improved maize. An increase in the intensity of extension by one unit increased the probability of using fertilizer by 40%. Research needs to develop maize that yields well and can tolerate moisture stress and field pests, especially stalk borers, and should also develop recommendations for fertilizer levels under various weather and soil conditions. Flexible integrated pest management packages that combine a drought-tolerant variety with improved cultural practices can increase yields. An efficient marketing system for inputs and outputs will benefit farmers by providing higher prices for maize and reducing the cost of fertilizer. Research and extension need to be linked and strengthened to increase the flow of information to farmers. Research and extension should also focus on creating off-farm employment that can generate income to meet farmers' short-term needs. In collaboration with the government and other stakeholders, the formal credit system needs to address the credit problems faced by small-scale farmers, especially their lack of knowledge (information) about formal credit systems.";"Kaliba, A.R.M.

The framework employs country-specific agroecological-drought risk zones and considers both yield increases and yield variance reductions when estimating producer and consumer benefits from research. Benefits from yield variance reductions are shown to be an important component of aggregate drought research benefits, representing 40% of total benefits across the eight countries.

"AGRIS:US201301633475";"GIS-integrated fuzzy rule-based inference system for land suitability evaluation in agricultural watersheds";"";"Land suitability evaluation in water scarce agricultural watersheds consists of assessment of land potential for various crops as well as surface water potential to identify the scope for supplementary irrigation. A large amount of information related to the crop land suitability can be conveyed through linguistic terms. Capability of fuzzy sets in modeling involving uncertainty and vagueness is made use of in fuzzy rule-based systems, where various decision making criteria in linguistic terms are expressed as fuzzy rules. In the present study, a fuzzy rule-based inference system is developed in Geographic Information System (GIS) environment to assess the land suitability pertaining to the specified crop, considering both land potential and surface water potential. When large numbers of attributes are involved in decision making, representation of the attributes in a common scale, aggregation of the attributes and design of the rule-base becomes difficult tasks. In order to model the heterogeneous land suitability criteria involving large number of attributes, a new approach is proposed in this study in which the attributes are systematically classified into different groups to estimate the intermediate suitability indices. Weighted linear aggregation method and Yager's aggregation method are used for estimating the aggregated effect of the attributes in each group and the results are compared. Further, the rule-base is developed by using the intermediate land suitability indices. The model has been applied to a subwatershed of Gandheshwari area in West Bengal (India). The input attributes are prepared in raster map format in the GIS environment by using ERDAS IP ver. 9.1 and the output is generated in the form of thematic map showing the suitability of each cell (20mx20m) for the selected crop. For the land suitability evaluation problem in the case study area, Yager's aggregation method has been found more appropriate than the commonly used weighted linear aggregation method. From the analysis, 23% of the existing paddy fields have been found less suitable/not suitable for paddy due to the poor surface water potential or unsuitable terrain conditions of the area. The method, integrated with GIS, is found efficient in handling large amount of attribute information, and is useful in the land suitability assessment in agricultural watersheds.";"Reshmidevi, T.V.

Recently, oasification has been obvious in the southern rim of the Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, China, and agriculture is the main land-use type. In 2004, four experimental fields were established in the Cele Oasis, representing four typical land-use types of local farmers' tillage practices during oasification. Three fields were situated in the desert-oasis ecotone (a newly cultivated land (NEF), a field with normal manure input (NMF), a field with high manure input (HMF)) and one field was situated in the oasis interior (OIF). Additionally, the soil from an uncultivated control plot was analyzed for comparison. Both the Soil Quality Index based on soil properties and the Sustainable Yield Index based on yearly yield were used to assess the soil quality of the different farmlands. There were significant differences in seven soil indicators, including soil particle size distribution and soil organic matter, between the four locations. NEF had the lowest and OIF the highest values in all assessments among the five experiment plots. Fertilization of NMF and HMF had positive effects on soil properties and soil quality; however, the sustainable productivity of these farmlands was low. The results should be beneficial for refining agricultural management practices and improving sustainable land use in the oasification process.";"Gui, D.W.,Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi (China).

"AGRIS:US201600201714";"Conserving tropical biodiversity via market forces and spatial targeting";"";"Significance Protected public lands are insufficient to halt the loss of global biodiversity. However, most commercial landowners need incentives to engage in conservation. Through an interdisciplinary study examining palm-oil plantations in Sumatra, we demonstrate that ( i ) joint consideration of both biodiversity and economic relationships permits the spatial targeting of areas that enhance conservation of International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listed species at relatively low cost to the landowner and ( ii ) the potential exists for funding such private costs of conservation through a price premium on a conservation-certified good. Such an approach avoids the need to assume intervention from an international social planner, while establishing the potential for profitable conservation on private lands, providing an important additional route for sustaining endangered species.
The recent report from the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity [(2010) Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 ] acknowledges that ongoing biodiversity loss necessitates swift, radical action. Protecting undisturbed lands, although vital, is clearly insufficient, and the key role of unprotected, private land owned is being increasingly recognized. Seeking to avoid common assumptions of a social planner backed by government interventions, the present work focuses on the incentives of the individual landowner. We use detailed data to show that successful conservation on private land depends on three factors: conservation effectiveness (impact on target species), private costs (especially reductions in production), and private benefits (the extent to which conservation activities provide compensation, for example, by enhancing the value of remaining production). By examining the high-profile issue of palm-oil production in a major tropical biodiversity hotspot, we show that the levels of both conservation effectiveness and private costs are inherently spatial; varying the location of conservation activities can radically change both their effectiveness and private cost implications. We also use an economic choice experiment to show that consumers' willingness to pay for conservation-grade palm-oil products has the potential to incentivize private producers sufficiently to engage in conservation activities, supporting vulnerable International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listed species. However, these incentives vary according to the scale and efficiency of production and the extent to which conservation is targeted to optimize its cost-effectiveness. Our integrated, interdisciplinary approach shows how strategies to harness the power of the market can usefully complement existingâand to-date insufficientâapproaches to conservation.

Results of a mail survey indicate the typical Minnesota family forest owner has relatively small acreage, owns the land for a long time, lives in a rural area, is an absentee owner, considers hunting the most important reason for forestland ownership, and is not an active forest manager but supplies timber to the marketplace. Analysis of the survey data using a logit model found landowner interest in enrolling in the SFIA program was significantly influenced by the SFIA payment amount, acres of forestland owned, intention to obtain a forest management plan, opposition to the program's covenant requirement, and familiarity with the program. The model also estimated considerable compensation is needed to secure substantial participation of family forest owners in the SFIA program-nearly $24/ac per year to enroll one-half of the owners surveyed. Marketing efforts to increase the program visibility and extolling the virtues of a forest management plan should be part of a strategy to increase family forest owner participation in the SFIA program.";"Kilgore, Michael A.

"AGRIS:DJ2012038309";"Watershed management and farmer conservation investments in the semi-arid tropics of India: analysis of determinants of resource use decisions and land productivity benefits";"";"Integrated watershed management has been promoted as a suitable strategy for improving productivity and sustainable intensification of agriculture in rainfed drought-prone regions. The paper examines the socioeconomic and biophysical factors influencing farmers' soil and water conservation investment decisions and the resulting economic incentives (productivity benefits) from watershed management interventions in the semi-arid tropics of India. The paper develops a theoretical framework to test hypotheses and to explore (a) the interlinkages between land productivity, soil quality, input use and conservation investments, and (b) the influence of local market imperfections on production and conservation decisions. These relationships are analyzed using plot-level data in six semi-arid villages. A systems approach (3SLS) is used for the joint estimation of structural equations related to land productivity, input use, resource investments and land values. The results show that after controlling for input use and germplasm technologies, soil quality and access to supplemental irrigation significantly affect the productivity of land. Off-farm income is negatively associated with resource investments and land productivity. The watershed program seems to have a greater impact on dryland crops (cereals and pulses) than on other crop not supported by the project. A plot-wise analysis found some degree of substitution between private and public investments in land and water management. Differential effects of family labor on the decision to invest in agriculture revealed that male labor plays a key role in this decision while female workers significantly influence the level of labor use in production and resource conservation. This indicates that labor market imperfections, especially for female labor, are most likely to affect production and conservation investment.";"Bekele A Shiferaw

"AGRIS:US201500204969";"Mining in New Caledonia: environmental stakes and restoration opportunities";"";"New Caledonia is a widely recognised marine and terrestrial biodiversity hot spot. However, this unique environment is under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Major threats are related to land cover change and include fire, urban sprawling and mining. Resulting habitat loss and fragmentation end up in serious erosion of the local biodiversity. Mining is of particular concern due to its economic significance for the island. Open cast mines were exploited there since 1873, and scraping out soil to access ores wipes out flora. Resulting perturbations on water flows and dramatic soil erosion lead to metal-rich sediment transport downstream into rivers and the lagoon. Conflicting environmental and economic aspects of mining are discussed in this paper. However, mining practices are also improving, and where impacts are inescapable ecological restoration is now considered. Past and ongoing experiences in the restoration of New Caledonian terrestrial ecosystems are presented and discussed here. Economic use of the local floristic diversity could also promote conservation and restoration, while providing alternative incomes. In this regard, Ecocatalysis, an innovative approach to make use of metal hyperaccumulating plants, is of particular interest.";"Losfeld, Guillaume

Such ecological influences usually operate at multiple scales, involving biological levels from individual to group, population or community and spatial units from field to farms and regions. The aim of this work was to analyze possible multiscale influences of some landscape properties on elephant distribution in the Western Ghats, India, by applying a recent and simple mathematical method to quantify such ecological relationships across space and scales. This method combines a moving window with various correlation indices to investigate the relationship between two mapped variables. Maps of landscape heterogeneity (quantified here at all locations of the landscape with a modified Shannon index) and Asian elephant presence (a two-dimensional presence probability) were significantly correlated. This correlation systematically decreased with increasing scales (i.e. sizes of the reference moving window). Yet, this global relationship includes both positive and negative correlations located at distinct places. We documented a positive feedback (reinforcement) because elephants appeared to seek greater habitat heterogeneity, in heterogeneous areas, such as along the interface between natural and a human-disturbed habitat or in the natural part of the studied landscape. In parallel, we observed a negative feedback (compensation) making elephants seeking more homogeneous places in some relatively heterogeneous zones. Such negative feedbacks corresponded to higher than average probabilities of elephant presence. Finally, when elephant density varied according to landscape heterogeneity (corresponding to significant correlations), it pointed towards swamps and grasslands, but not towards semi-evergreen or secondary forests (as it may have been expected). Land cover information appeared to be less relevant than an integrated heterogeneity index computed at all scales.";"Gaucherel, C.

A post-classification change detection comparison approach revealed only moderate mangrove exploitation and shrimp farms, which displaced a variety of land-cover types in addition to mangroves.

Karst land is a type of important and unique terrain on the Earth's surface because of its extensive distribution, impressive landforms, and high ecological fragility. Recently, more and more researchers have realized that irrational land use practices are leading to a series of alarming environmental issues including rocky desertification in karst areas. Studies on land use/cover change and its driving forces in karst areas are significant in achieving regional ecological construction and sustainable development. Policy has long been considered as one of the major driving forces at national level for land use/cover change. In mainland China, designated and in-depth study on the interaction between land use/cover change and relevant policies is still very limited. Through an integrated technique of geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing (RS), and global positioning system (GPS), the authors attempted to address this issue by using the Maotiaohe watershed in Guizhou province in southwestern China as a case to examine its land use/cover change patterns, and the roles of policies in land use, agriculture, forestry, and eco-environmental protection from 1973 to 2007. The study indicated that land policies contributed largely to the increase of arable land in the 1980s, and helped prevent it from decreasing at the fringe of cities and towns since the 1990s; agricultural policies played active roles in the change of water area and indirectly contributed to the change of construction land. The forestry and eco-environmental policies were found to be the main reasons for the consistent increase of forest land since the 1980s and for the decrease of arable land and rocky desertification land since the 1990s.";"Peng, J.

While transactions for forestland use rights have taken place for more than two decades, few detailed investigations of the transactions have been conducted. This study investigates 222 households in eight villages of Linan and Anji counties located within Zhejiang Province, and reports details of the transactions, their scope and motivation, and the characteristics of households participating in the market for forestland use rights. The results indicate that farmers have become more active in land transactions. The factors influencing transactions are examined in a logit model. Income and sources of income are identified as important factors. Households with higher incomes are likely to buy more land, but households with a higher proportion of income from non-agricultural sources would be more likely to sell land and less likely to buy land. Whether a buyer or seller is satisfied with the price is another important factor for their engagement in a transaction. Some policy implications are discussed in this paper.";"Xu, Xiuying

However, a lack of air monitoring data hinders health impact assessments and the development of transportation and land use policies that could reduce health burdens due to outdoor air pollution. To address this important need, a study of traffic-related PM₂.₅ was carried out in the city of Nairobi, Kenya, a model city for sub-Saharan Africa, in July 2009. Sampling was carried out using portable filter-based air samplers carried in backpacks by technicians on weekdays over two weeks at several sites in and around Nairobi ranging from high-traffic roadways to rural background. Mean daytime concentrations of PM₂.₅ ranged from 10.7 at the rural background site to 98.1μg/m³ on a sidewalk in the central business district. Horizontal dispersion measurements demonstrated a decrease in PM₂.₅ concentration from 128.7 to 18.7μg/m³ over 100m downwind of a major intersection in Nairobi. A vertical dispersion experiment revealed a decrease from 119.5μg/m³ at street level to 42.8μg/m³ on a third-floor rooftop in the central business district. Though not directly comparable to air quality guidelines, which are based on 24-h or annual averages, the urban concentrations we observed raise concern with regard to public health and related policy. Taken together with survey data on commuting patterns within Nairobi, these results suggest that many Nairobi residents are exposed on a regular basis to elevated concentrations of fine particle air pollution, with potentially serious long-term implications for health.";"Kinney, Patrick L.

Nevertheless, there are challenges when working with NAIP imagery, especially regarding varying viewing geometry, radiometric normalization, and calibration. In this article, we compare NAIP orthophotography and RapidEye satellite imagery for high-resolution mapping of mining and mine reclamation within a mountaintop coal surface mine in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, USA. Two classification algorithms, support vector machines and random forests, were used to classify both data sets. Compared to the RapidEye classification, the NAIP classification resulted in lower overall accuracy and kappa and higher allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement. However, the accuracy of the NAIP classification was improved by reducing the number of classes mapped, using the near-infrared band, using textural measures and feature selection, and reducing the spatial resolution slightly by pixel aggregation or by applying a Gaussian low-pass filter. With such strategies, NAIP data can be a potential alternative to RapidEye satellite data for classification of surface mine land cover.";"Maxwell, A.E.

This research proposes a subpixel-based approach to examine land-cover change in Urumqi and Phoenix urban landscapes using multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to unmix TM multispectral imagery into four fractions – high-albedo object, low-albedo object, green vegetation (GV), and soil. ISA was determined from the sum of high-albedo and low-albedo fraction images after removal of non-ISA in both fraction images. The ISA, vegetation abundance, and soil images at different dates were used to examine their change over time. The results indicate that this subpixel-based approach can successfully detect small changes of urban land covers in medium spatial resolution images which pixel-based approaches cannot.";"Zhang, Chi

Fragmentation of populations by urbanization is considered to be a significant threat to several endangered bird populations, although isolation has seldom been demonstrated genetically. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of genetic criteria for identifying at‐risk populations, using a salt‐marsh‐inhabiting bird, the white‐fronted chat Epthianura albifrons, as a case study. DNA was extracted from feathers from 78 individuals from five sites, including two salt marsh remnants situated within the intensively urbanized zone of a city of more than three million people, and three sites up to 500 km distant. Microsatellite markers were used to measure genetic diversity and compare genetic structure between populations. Analyses of population structure demonstrated that the two populations surrounded by intensive urban development were genetically distinct from each other despite being separated by less than 20 km. They were also distinct from larger populations beyond the urban zone that showed much lower levels of genetic differentiation and no evidence of isolation by distance, despite being separated by continuous forest, which is not a recognized habitat for this species. The two endangered populations had low levels of genetic diversity reflected in the number of alleles and heterozygosity. Two immigrants were detected in one of the isolated populations, but their reproductive success was very low and they failed to effect genetic rescue. This study demonstrates that the endangered population satisfies the genetic criteria for listing, and although the population is unlikely to have special evolutionary significance in itself, flagging the population highlights the vulnerability of some coastal fauna to the impacts of urbanization.";"Major, R.

Therefore, this investigation was carried out to study the effect of sewage effluents on Khaya senegalensis seedlings as well as on soil properties after 6, 12 and 18 months of plantation. The primary effluent treatment was highly significant (P<0.0001) for the growth parameters of K. senegalensis (plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, leaves number, fresh and dry weights of leaves, shoots and roots and shoot/root ratio) by improving soil properties as well as uptake of N, P, K, Na, Cd, Ni, Pb and Fe in plant parts, followed by secondary effluent then tap water after 6, 12 and 18 months of plantation. Additionally, the effect of sewage effluent irrigation on the physico-chemical properties of soil was highly significant (P<0.0001). Therefore, sewage effluent could be used as an important alternative source of water and nutrients for forestry production. Also, K. senegalensis could be planted as a phytoremediator in soil polluted with heavy metals for the betterment of soil properties. Thus, planting K. senegalensis as tree seedlings could be useful in controlling land degradation and enhancing the production of wood biomass under ecological improvement.";"Ali, Hayssam M.

This study ascertained the impacts of reforestation on water outflow attenuation (i.e., water flow out of the watershed outlet) and sediment load reduction in the Lower Yazoo River Watershed (LYRW) within the LMRAV using the US-EPA's BASINS-HSPF model. The model was calibrated and validated with available experimental data prior to its application. Two simulation scenarios were then performed: one was chosen to predict the water outflow and sediment load without reforestation and the other was selected to project the potential impacts of reforestation upon water outflow attenuation and sediment load reduction following the conversion of 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the agricultural lands with most lands near or in the batture of the streams. Comparison of the two simulation scenarios (i.e., with and without reforestation) showed that a conversion of agricultural land into forests attenuated water outflow and reduced sediment load. In general, a two-fold increase in forest land area resulted in approximately a two-fold reduction in annual water outflow volume and sediment load mass, which occurred because forests absorb water and reduce surface water runoff and prevent soil erosion. On average, over a 10-year simulation, the specific water outflow attenuation and sediment load reduction were, respectively, 250m³/ha/y and 4.02metric ton/ha/y. Seasonal variations of water outflow attenuation and sediment load reduction occurred with the maximum attenuation/reduction in winter and the minimum attenuation/reduction in summer. Our load duration curve analysis further confirmed that an increase in forest land area reduced the likelihood of a given sediment load out of the watershed outlet. This study suggests that reforestation in or around the batture of streams is a useful practice for water outflow attenuation and sediment load reduction.";"Ouyang, Ying

"AGRIS:US2016213102";"Regional differences in the determinants for structural change in German agriculture";"";"In Germany agricultural land use is very heterogeneous with respect to management orientation and productivity even at local level. Also the rate of structural change shows a wide variation. While for a limited number of factors (e.g. farm size) a stable relation to structural change could be widely confirmed for different parts of Germany, the results for other indicators are contradictory. This holds especially for indicators describing to the marginality of a site. Many concerns related to structural change and development of land use intensity, e.g. abandonment of high nature value farmland, are only relevant in a very specific local context. Therefore, it is necessary to establish indicators for farm development on a disaggregated level.This paper evaluates the stability of the relation between a set of explanatory variables and the rate of structural change at different spatial scales. Our results indicate that only for a few variables (farm size, gross margin per ha, stocking density and productive orientation of the local stock) a generally valid link between them and the rate of structural change can be established. For the majority of the explanatory variables, their respective impact on structural change depends on the regional context.";"Roeder, Norbert

This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides.

However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area. Considering the above background, this study was conducted with the objectives of developing a land degradation assessment model using a GIS based approach.";"Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed, South Eastern University of Sri Lanka";"";"";"AGRIS";"2013-10-07";"";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"LKA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=CH2016309129";"http://www.scipress.com/ILNS.53.80.pdf";"";"";"";"80-86"

"AGRIS:US201400034041";"Characterisation of land types and agro-ecological conditions for production of Jatropha as a feedstock for biofuels in Zimbabwe";"";"There is increasing interest in Zimbabwe in developing a biofuels industry based on the production of biodiesel using Jatropha as the main feedstock. This has led to the introduction of Jatropha as a commercial energy crop in the country. There are plans to grow 1220 km2 of Jatropha which will supply about 365,000 t of seed. This will provide about 110 dam3 of biodiesel required to achieve a blending level of 10% with petro-diesel. The availability and suitability of land for the production of Jatropha cannot be taken for granted, particularly given the fact that the concept and practice of production of feedstocks for biofuels remain contested on the threat they pose to food security. Determining the land that is potentially available for biofuels is a non-trivial task. A multiplicity of factors needs to be considered. It is important to determine the spatial extent of areas with suitable growth conditions for Jatropha. The interaction of soil type and land use is an important interface in agriculture. Added to this is the need to balance food, fodder and fuel supply in land use planning. This paper attempts to assess the availability and suitability of various land types as well as agro-ecological conditions for the production of Jatropha in Zimbabwe.";"Jingura, Raphael M.

The Xiangxi River, which is a first level anabranch of the Yangtze River, was selected for investigation of the effectiveness of selected best management measures (BMPs) to alleviate water pollution through analysis of several scenarios by SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). Specifically, changes in land use, fertilizer management and tillage management measures were simulated in SWAT because they were shown to be the primary factors influencing non-point source (NPS) pollution in the Xiangxi River watershed. The results revealed that when farmland was returned to forests, both runoff and NPS pollution loads showed a clear downward trend and the NPS pollution loads in the Xiangxi River watershed decreased by 20% or more when compared with the status of 2007. Furthermore, conservation tillage and contour farming can help reduce runoff by 15.99% and 9.16%, total nitrogen (TN) by 8.99% and 8%, and total phosphorus (TP) by 7% and 5%, respectively. Conservation tillage has a greater effect in controlling the losses of soil, water and nutrients than contour farming. Based on the fertilizer conditions of 2007, changing the fertilizer application resulted in little change in local runoff; however, for NPS pollution loads, various forms of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pollution loads were directly proportional to the amount of chemical fertilizer applied. Overall, the results of this study can facilitate development of environmental friendly land use plans by local managers, and enable farmers to manage agriculture and fertilizer more efficiently, ultimately achieve the goal of reduce water pollution.";"Liu, Ruimin

A simple ecological sustainability simulator (SESS) for stocking rate management on semi-arid grazinglands, 76, 655 for rangelands with mean annual precipitation of 500 mm to evaluate tendencies in range productivity and cattle production under four management options: (1) supplemental feeding, (2) short-term reduction of stocking rate, (3) early weaning, and (4) adjustment of breeding seasons. We have made five modifications to SESS for the present paper. (1) Cattle mortality now occurs each month as a function of body condition. (2) Cows that are not pregnant 2 months after the end of the breeding season are sold. (3) Forage intake is calculated separately for each cohort of cows. (4) Cows that have been sold or have died are replaced just before the beginning of each breeding season (except for the short-term reduction of stocking rate strategy). (5) The calculation of stocking rate now includes cows, bulls, nursing calves, weaned heifers less than 20 months of age, and pre-reproductive heifers aged 20 months or older. Simulation results suggest the four management options might be ranked from best to worst, in terms of increasing cattle production while maintaining range productivity, as: (1) short-term reduction of stocking rate, (2) adjustment of breeding seasons, (3) early weaning, and (4) supplementation. Short-term reduction of high stocking rates reduces the deterioration of range productivity because of the reduction in the number of stock. Adjustment of breeding seasons such that periods of highest energy requirements of cows and calves coincide with periods of highest forage production increases percentage pregnancy. Early weaning of calves improves the body condition of cows and increases annual production of weaned calves, but does not reduce the stocking rate and thus does not improve range productivity. Supplemental feeding, and other management practices that artificially sustain herbivores, break the negative feedback that promotes good range productivity and maintains long-term system stability. In general, strategies to increase cattle production in semi-arid rangelands should be based on the improvement of natural forage production.";"Diaz-Solis, H.

Corporate appropriation of plant genetic resources, development of transgenic crops and the global imposition of intellectual property rights are now widely recognized as serious constraints on the free exchange of seeds and the development of new cultivars by farmers, public breeders and small seed companies. In response, an Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) has been launched in the United States to apply legal mechanisms drawn from the open source software movement to plant breeding. An open source license is a tool constituted by the provisions of contract law. It is a tool of the master inasmuch as the structure of the legal system has been designed to facilitate the activities of the dominant stakeholders in the overarching social formation. This paper assesses the problematics of re-purposing such a tool by examining the issues that have been raised in OSSI's efforts to develop its licenses and to transmit its sense of their potential to prospective allies. Through an examination of the expressed positions of La Vía Campesina and Navdanya on the nature of ‘seed sovereignty’, the compatibilities and disjunctures of OSSI's stance with those of potential allies in the food sovereignty movement are assessed.";"Kloppenburg, Jack";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"farmers";"";"";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001813";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.875897";"";"";"";"1225-1246"

The symposium set out to review the extent to which market-based instruments were being employed as social policy tools in various contexts, what challenges achieving relevant social policy objectives posed, what trade-offs arose between environmental, social and economic objectives, and whether and how tensions could be resolved. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic. They consider poverty, property rights and equality perspectives of participation and quantify social implications at the program, regional and national levels. They reveal converging messages, e.g. in relation to treatment of poverty, common property rights and nesting across scales. In combination, the papers make a compelling case that social implications of MBIs cannot be ignored and ought to be considered in design and evaluation even if programs do no pursue social objectives, as social dimensions can enhance or affect program effectiveness and efficiency. In doing so, the contributions expand the role that MBIs can play in ensuring sustainable resource use and offer considerations for policy design.";"Greiner, Romy";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"property rights;poverty";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217398";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.04.022";"";"";"";"1-3"

Despite the increased use of economic instruments, many landholders remain unwilling to participate in these programs. Non-participating landholders can be described, according to the participation spectrum, as conditional (i.e., may be persuaded to participate if the program criteria and incentives fit with their personal circumstances) or resistant (i.e., will not participate, irrespective of the program conditions and administrator). I interviewed 29 landholders in north Queensland, Australia, who had not participated in one of three market-based incentive programs offered in their region. The aim of my research was to understand the characteristics of conditional and resistant non-participants and their context-specific reasons for non-participation in market-based programs. The results revealed different reasons, between the two groups, for non-participation in land management programs. Conditional non-participants were influenced largely by external sources of control (e.g., program characteristics) and structural variables (e.g., farm characteristics). Although some conditional non-participants had a preference for financial incentives, the majority preferred practical and credible programs, suggesting that market-based instruments are unlikely to save an otherwise poorly designed program. Resistant non-participants were influenced by internal sources of control (e.g., anti-government attitudes). These internal controls can be difficult to change and may represent a greater gulf between resistant non-participants and other categories of the spectrum that are more willing to participate. The delivery of market-based programs within the private sector provides an opportunity to sidestep the involvement of government in the administration of programs and thus increase participation of this landholding group. The participation spectrum offers a useful classification to explore the relative influences of structural, external and internal variables on participation, which can be used directly to inform policy instrument choice in the design of land management programs.";"Moon, Katie";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217399";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.08.011";"";"";"";"17-25"
"AGRIS:US201600191059";"remote sensing spatio-temporal framework for interpreting sparse indicators in highly variable arid landscapes";"";"The world's extensive and often remote arid landscapes are receiving increasing attention to maintain their ecological and productive values. Monitoring and management of these lands requires indicators and evidence of ecosystem condition and trend, generally derived from widely distributed and infrequently repeated site-based records. However adequate geographic representation and frequent site revisits are difficult to achieve because of the remoteness and vast extent of these landscapes. Interpreting such sparse ecological indicators is difficult, particularly within landscapes that are highly variable in space and time. To interpret ecological indicator data collected in such environments long-term patterns of natural landscape variability need to be understood.This paper presents a framework of landscape spatio-temporal variability within which to interpret ecological indicator data. This framework is based on long-term patterns of vegetation growth across the Australian arid zone, derived from twenty-five years of high temporal resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery. We present a case study of the extensive Alinytjara Wilurara (AW) Natural Resource Management (NRM) region in far western South Australia to illustrate new insights about landscape function gained from this approach, and their implications for collection and interpretation of ecological indicator data. We illustrate how variability in vegetation response is expressed across the region, and how stratification based on active vegetation response differs from more commonly used biogeographic stratifications in this region. Lastly we demonstrate the unique patterns of long-term vegetation response for the major vegetation response classes. Average amount, seasonality, magnitude, timing and variability of vegetation response over time are used to characterise the natural âenvelopeâ of variability of the new landscape classes.The study region showed low vegetation response in summer and higher response in winter. Onset of growth was earlier in the north and in ecosystems dominated by mallee vegetation. Cyclonic influence from the west was evident at the southern margin of the study region. The study demonstrates the landscape functional response of the study region, and presents a method whereby remote sensing reveals the landscape context within which to better interpret ecological indicator data collected in a highly variable landscape.";"Lawley, Evertje Frederika

"AGRIS:US201600001816";"Food sovereignty, food security and democratic choice: critical contradictions, difficult conciliations";"";"In recent years, the concept of ‘food sovereignty’ has gained increasing ground among grassroots groups, taking the form of a global movement. But there is no uniform conceptualization of what food sovereignty constitutes. Indeed, the definition has been expanding over time. It has moved from its initial focus on national self-sufficiency in food production (‘the right of nations’) to local self-sufficiency (‘the rights of peoples’). There is also a growing emphasis on the rights of women and other disadvantaged groups, and on consensus building and democratic choice. This paper provides a critique of some of the major tenets of the food sovereignty movement. It recognizes that many developing countries may wish to pursue the goal of self-sufficiency in the context of the global food crises, and that it is important to promote social equality and democratic choice. Taken together, however, there can be serious contradictions between the key features of the food sovereignty vision, such as between the goals of national and local food self-sufficiency; between promoting food crops and a farmer's freedom to choose to what extent to farm, which crops to grow, and how to grow them; between strengthening family farming and achieving gender equality; and between collective and individual rights, especially over land ownership. The paper also reflects on the ways in which some of the food sovereignty goals could be better achieved through innovative institutional change, without sacrificing an individual's freedom to choose.";"Agarwal, Bina";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"farming systems;women;food security;land ownership;farmers";"Land & Gender;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001816";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.876996";"";"";"";"1247-1268"

This study investigated the trend in year-round enclosure of these seasonal commons for private aquaculture and the impacts of this practice. The floodplain area enclosed for aquaculture was found to be growing at 30–100% a year. Enclosures are organised by individual landowners, informal groups or companies that lease in land. Aquaculture in enclosures produces more fish than capture fisheries, but input costs are high. Traditional fishers report that catches of wild fish decline in the floodplains as a whole and there is a loss of livelihood. Those with large farms benefit while marginal farmers lose access to common aquatic resources and also to land for sharecropping. The landless have less fish to eat and sell, but some gain employment. The government has encouraged private floodplain aquaculture in recent years. However, it is recommended that this trend should be regulated to limit loss of key natural fisheries and widening inequality. This should be informed by more detailed quantification of the costs and benefits of floodplain aquaculture, including fishery and distributional impacts.";"Sultana, Parvin";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"fisheries;aquaculture;landowners;farmers";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"BGD";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400159981";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2011.637104";"";"";"";"1159-1174"

Absentee owners are also less likely to be engaged in active management practices, decision making regarding these practices, and less likely to have contact with extension and local natural resource agency program staff. In addition, little formal policy was identified as having any direct or explicit emphasis on absentee landownership issues involving private forest, range, or farmland. Based on our review we conclude there is a need for: (1) Improved research to understand conservation management and absentee landownership, (2) Improved research and policy that considers the role of the tenant operator in farmland conservation, (3) Improved research and policy that considers the role of the ranch manager in conservation, (4) Creating, implementing and evaluating outreach models and (5) Coordinated efforts on research and outreach.";"Petrzelka, Peggy

The aim is to evaluate the assumption and theoretical basis of FTT with quantitative data, and to propose changes in forest management policy as a potential driver for reforestation. We compiled a number of historical records, geospatial data, and time series forest mapping products to reconstruct the last 100 years of forest trajectory. Forest changes are studied in relation to changes in society, over a range of temporal and spatial scales. Details of forest dynamics (e.g., the rate and extent of forest gain and loss) were quantified, while considering the ecological properties of the secondary forests. Mississippi forests are intensively managed and fragmented secondary forests, while regenerated entirely through plantation. The quantified forest transition (FT) curve indicated that forest dynamics have been nonlinear and have involved multiple reversals, resulting in multiple periods of forest expansion. The spatial and temporal analysis with time series remote sensing data over the last 30 years reveals that Mississippi forests have experienced very frequent changes and disturbance, even during the period of forest expansion. These change patterns are not apparent when considering total forest area estimates. The result illustrates that the “forest scarcity pathway” of FTT (Rudel et al., Global Environmental Change Part A 15(1) (2005) 23–31) worked to reverse the deforestation trend for the initial FT period. However, regenerated forests have experienced another episode of FT and expansion, and this cannot be explained by the forest scarcity pathway. Rather, the case of Mississippi suggests an alternative pathway (Mather, International Forestry Review 9(1) (2007) 491–502; Lambin and Meyfroidt, Land Use Policy 27 (2010) 108–118), distinct from the previous work, and highlights the importance of changes in policy incentives to account for forest recovery. The conceptual basis of FTT proposed by Mather (Area 24(4) (1992) 367–379) and Grainger (Area 27(3) (1995) 242–251) is revisited, showing how two alternative views are complementary, providing explanation for the repeated patterns of FT. This study presents empirical evidence to understand the theoretical basis and assumptions of FTT and suggests a new path for FT, “forest management policy pathway”.";"Yeo, In-Young

The ultimate objective of this approach is the development of a feasible decentralized treatment scheme in parts of the Mediterranean region where most olive mills are small family businesses, soils have low organic matter and the risk of desertification is high. Tests carried out both at lab and pilot scale involving mainly the use of low cost and readily available industrial/agricultural wastes/by-products such as saw dust, lime, iron fillings and goat manure. The aim of pre-treatment was two-fold (a) to produce OMW suitable for land application and (b) to allow its safe disposal in unprotected evaporation ponds, thus minimizing the risk for soil, surface- and groundwater contamination. Trials investigating the effect of pre-treated OMW on the growth of spinach and beetroot, using application rates 4, 10 and 20L/m² (40, 100 and 200m³/ha), were also carried out in 0.5×0.5×0.2m containers. The parameters studied include emergence from soil, plant height, root length, aerial biomass, soil pH and conductivity as well as content of phenols, K, N and P in soils. Furthermore, in order to assess the long term impacts of OMW application on soil, soil quality data are provided from a field where occasional disposal of OMW from an operating evaporation pond takes place for a period of more than ten years. Furthermore, an overview of the existing EU legislation is provided to identify gaps and address important issues related to the management of OMW, its application/disposal on land and the potential risk for soil and water bodies. Finally, a set of indicators is proposed to define a code of good practice for OMW application on soils, safeguard soil quality in disposal areas and improve the overall sustainability of the olive oil sector.";"Komnitsas, Kostas

We experimentally manipulated farmland patches with cutting and (early summer) low- and high-intensity domestic sheep Ovis aries grazing according to traditional use in north Norway. After treatments, grazing reindeer Rangifer tarandus were exposed to the pastures the subsequent fall (2 months after treatments) and spring (11 months after treatments) as they typically do on their migratory route between summer and winter ranges. The experiment was conducted over 2 subsequent years. We predicted that sheep grazing on farmland during early summer may affect the critical fall and spring range conditions for reindeer either through negative (delayed competition) or positive (grazing facilitation) interactions. We found that the most marked effect of land use on the grazing pattern of reindeer was between no use (the control treatment) and all the other management options involving active land use. The grazing reindeer avoided the pastures no longer in use likely due to senescent plant material. There was a tendency that the lower intensity sheep grazing patches attracted more reindeer than the highest intensity use. These results highlight not only the general principle that large-scale agricultural changes may affect large herbivores in natural ecosystems, but they also increase our understanding of grazing facilitation as a mechanism in large herbivore assemblages.";"Colman, J.E.

Consequently, land use planning processes must attempt to balance the goals of diverse stakeholders and the process of reaching consensus becomes more complicated. By investigating the perception of the actors involved in rural planning, this research contributes to the knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of such processes. We have focused on the case of rural planning processes in Flanders in which proponents of nature and agriculture are competing for land. Data are collected through open interviews with key actors such as farmers, representatives of nature preservation organisations, farmers’ unions, and employees of the relevant governmental policy areas. Data analysis according to the grounded theory approach resulted in six categories and 26 concepts that represent the stakeholders’ perception of difficulties in the Flemish rural planning approach. Three points where difficulties arise are (1) the link between envisioning, drawing up the plan and implementation, (2) the need for data, and (3) the role of sectors. We use three concepts from literature (procedural justice, distributive justice and value conflicts) to frame the difficulties observed. Based on this analysis, we discuss several ways to improve rural planning processes.";"Kerselaers, Eva

"AGRIS:US201301960893";"Profiteers of environmental change in the Swiss Alps: increase of thermophilous and generalist plants in wetland ecosystems within the last 10 years";"";"It has been predicted that Europe will experience a rise in temperature of 2.2–5.3 °C within this century. This increase in temperature may lead to vegetation change along altitudinal gradients. To test whether vegetation composition has already changed in the recent decade due to current warming (and other concomitant environmental changes), we recorded plant species composition in 1995 and 2005/2006 in Swiss pre-alpine fen meadows (800–1,400 m a.s.l.). Despite no obvious changes in the management of these fens, overall, plant species richness (cumulative number of plant species at five plots per site) significantly increased over this period. This was mainly due to an increase in the number of thermophilous, rich-soil-indicator and shade-indicator species, which corresponded to increased community productivity and shading within the vegetation layer. In contrast, fen specialists significantly declined in species numbers. The strongest species shifts occurred at the lowest sites, which overall had a higher colonization rate by new species than did sites at higher altitudes. Vegetation change along the altitudinal gradient was also affected by different types of land management: early-flowering species and species with low habitat specificity had high colonization rates in grazed fens, especially at low altitudes.";"Moradi, H.

"AGRIS:US201500064452";"Patterns of vegetation cover/dynamics in a protected Mediterranean mountain area: Influence of the ecological context and protection policy";"";"In Mediterranean mountains, the abandonment of traditional land-uses is promoting a rapid forest expansion. This trend may be exacerbated by nature reserves, which further limit human disturbance in mountain contexts. We investigated whether ecological parameters, landscape structure, and management policy influenced vegetation cover/dynamics over a 14-year period in the Pollino National Park, a large protected area in southern Italy. Based on remote sensed and field data we obtained land-cover maps referred to 2004, 1997, and 1990. Canonical ordination related patterns of vegetation cover/dynamics to ecological (elevation, slope, climate) and structural (spatial heterogeneity) landscape traits. Higher change rate regarded scrublands (decrease) and forests (expansion). Spatial heterogeneity declined over the study period, while the average area of forest patches increased. A non-spatial transition matrix model revealed that the decline of pastures/scrublands, and forest recovery accelerated in the 1997–2004 period compared to the 1990–1997 interval. Since the Pollino National Park was established in 1993, the protection regime may have favored the reduction of open habitats in the second timeframe. The recognized trends suggest a future reduction of both landscape complexity and dynamics in the Pollino National Park, a factor that could possibly be detrimental for the conservation of biodiversity.";"Gargano, D.

"AGRIS:LV2016000285";"Planning as trigger for land use changes";"";"In Poland significant changes in landscape intensified after the political transformation in late 1980’s. One of the signs of the changes are more transformations of agricultural land into developed land (industry, housing, services). At the same time, abandoned land started overgrowing with trees and brushwood. These are a result of changes in living and housing conditions, technical progress and changes in legislation. Local spatial plan is a planning act that defines the designation of the land in Poland. This act is optional at the level of communes (the lowest level of administrative division). If there is no local spatial plan, the designation for non-agricultural and non-forest purposes is determined by an administrative planning decision usually on the basis of the designations of the adjacent plots. The study shows that the direction of changes in land use is affected mainly by local planning policy, including local spatial plans that are perceived to be an instrument of managing suburbanisation in rural areas. Local spatial plans are legal acts; therefore they are binding for the inhabitants and allow for “controlled” spatial development of the communes. But they may be a threat for agricultural areas as they encourage the expansion of developed areas.";"Salata, T., University of Agriculture in Krakow (Poland)

"AGRIS:US201400011891";"Environmental determinants of the spatial distribution of Alaria alata in Hungary";"";"Alaria alata is a potential zoonotic parasite, which is widely distributed in Eurasia. To assess the risk of human infection, it is important to know the spatial distribution pattern of the parasite and factors influencing this pattern. To investigate these relationships, 1612 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) carcasses were randomly collected from the whole Hungarian territory, and the intestines were examined by sedimentation and counting technique. The spatial distribution of the parasite was highly clumped. The topographic positions where the foxes had been shot and the intensity of infections were recorded in geographic information system database. Digitized home ranges of infected and uninfected foxes were analysed on the background of geographic vector data of altitude, land cover types, permanent waters, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation and soil permeability. Multiple regression analysis was performed with environmental parameter values and A. alata scores. Based on the statistical analysis, lack of permanent waters, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation and soil permeability were the major determinants of the spatial distribution of A. alata. It can be explained by the use of biotopes by the intermediate hosts. The lack of permanent waters results in the use of temporary waters by the second intermediate hosts, frogs. The higher temperature, the lower precipitation and the higher soil permeability lead to earlier desiccation of temporary waters, and tadpoles and frogs infected with mesocercariae can be more easily predated by the final hosts (e.g., red foxes). Moreover, temporary waters are more easily contaminated with the faeces of the final hosts containing eggs than permanent waters. Therefore, high infection rate with A. alata can be expected mainly in lowland areas, where the hydrogeography of permanent waters is less complex, the precipitation is lower, the mean temperature and the soil permeability are higher than in highland areas.";"Széll, Z.

Input sources included fouryears, spanning 2008–2011, of annual national-level coverage Cropland Data Layer (CDL) land cover classifications as produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Derived total land area under tillage from the aggregate CDL product equaled 112.8million hectares (278.7million acres). By comparison, the 2007 Census of Agriculture (CoA) produced an estimate of 122.9million hectares, suggesting the map is under representing tilled area by 10.1million hectares or 8.2%. Regression analysis using state-level summaries showed a strong, albeit biased, correlation (r-squared=0.99) between the CDL derived tilled area and the CoA information. Notable outliers were North Dakota and Montana. Comparisons of the CDL tilled map were also made against the 2006 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) land cover product’s Cultivated Crops category. Strong state-level regression agreement (r-squared=0.98) was also found between the NLCD and the CDL acreages, but the NLCD estimated 8.5% more area than the CDL and thus closely matched that of the CoA. However, significant pixel level differences were found between the CDL and the NLCD. Nationally 5.6% of the maps were in disagreement as to whether cultivated or not, a large proportion considering around a seventh of the country’s land area is tilled. States of Arkansas, Montana and Wisconsin had the largest absolute discrepancies between the NLCD and CDL. Accepting the CDL as reference showed a national level NLCD cropland commission error of 23.0% and omission error of 14.5%. Much of what is believed to be problematic in the NLCD could be explained by definitional issues having included alfalfa hay into their cultivated category for many areas. Ultimately, while it is likely that the CDL annually tilled area model is an underestimate of the true total, taken contextually in map form and adjusted for undercount bias it likely is the best available.";"Johnson, David M.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400048912";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2012.08.004";"";"";"";"95-105"
"AGRIS:US201600103173";"Multiscale Environmental Influences on Fish Assemblage Structure of South Atlantic Coastal Plain Streams";"";"South Atlantic coastal plain streams are unique and understudied freshwater environments that provide crucial habitats for a wide range of aquatic taxa. We investigated patterns in fish assemblages across South Carolina's coastal plain, and developed statistical models to identify the dominant multiscale abiotic environmental factors that influence assemblage structure. Cluster and indicator species analyses of fish assemblage data collected at 208 wadeable streams indicated the presence of four predominant species associations that commonly occur in the South Atlantic coastal plain, which we termed the (1) fluvial, (2) Eastern Mudminnow, (3) centrarchid, and (4) nonfluvial assemblages. A random forest analysis indicated that geographic gradients and instream habitat variables associated with velocity, channel form, stream size, depth, and large wood generally played a greater role in distinguishing fish assemblages than catchment land cover. A follow-up principal component analysis showed that these instream habitat variables showed weak relationships with current anthropogenic land-cover conditions. We suggest several possible explanations for our findings, including (1) a sustained dynamic equilibrium among catchment, riparian, and instream conditions over time may encourage assemblage partitioning among differential instream habitats, (2) past landscape conditions may have a greater influence on current instream habitat conditions and fish assemblage structure than current landscape conditions, (3) weak relationships between catchment land cover and instream habitats may be common in low-elevation regions, and (4) seasonal variation in hydrologic patterns may dominantly influence instream habitat conditions and fish assemblage structure. Our study adds essential information towards a better understanding of how South Atlantic coastal plain fish assemblages respond to environmental factors across multiple spatial scales. Such knowledge will help improve management and conservation strategies, as well as assist in the development of appropriate indicators for standardized evaluations of ecological integrity.";"Marion, Cathy A.

"AGRIS:US201300863023";"Time lags in provision of habitat resources through revegetation";"";"Broadscale land use changes are occurring rapidly in rural landscapes worldwide, within which revegetation with native plant species to increase the area of suitable habitat is a key activity. Current models for planning revegetation are based solely on the spatial arrangement of new and remnant vegetation. Making wise decisions about revegetation requires projective models of ecological responses to revegetation, but there are few appropriate data. Substantial time lags are expected in the availability of many habitat resources because different resources are realised at different stages of vegetation maturation. Here we present results of surveys of 72 revegetation sites established over a range from 5 to more than 130yr from the slopes and plains of central Victoria, Australia. We surveyed vegetation provision of habitat resources essential for many birds and arboreal and scansorial mammals (e.g. canopy, large boughs, tree hollows and fallen timber). Predictive models were developed for habitat resource provision as functions of time since planting, planting density and other covariates. Different habitat resources developed at different rates. While dense canopy and various forms of bark resources developed in about 10yr, large boughs, tree hollows and fallen timber loads required at least 100yr to develop. The development of these key habitat resources was delayed in revegetated sites with high stem densities. Habitat resources that are essential for many birds and arboreal and scansorial mammals have long time lags that models for planning offsets or landscape reconstruction should account for. Management has substantial effects: planting at high densities greatly reduces tree girth growth rates and delays the occurrence of large boughs, tree hollows and fallen timber by decades.";"Vesk, Peter A.

Within the small auxiliary sector of agricultural land the turnover arose in the early reform. But in the large agro-industrial sector, the turnover of lands received the necessary legal regulation only in 2003 (more than 10 years later than the mass privatization of these lands). For this type of turnover, a significant part of the regulatory mechanisms was borrowed from foreign experience, because the domestic experience was absent. In modern Russia, the major regulators of the agricultural land market became the priority right of the state on the purchase of lands at their sale, the limited concentration of large land area owned by a citizen or legal person and the prohibition for foreign persons to have land in ownership. The practice of past decade has enabled to identify a number of disputable issues associated with these mechanisms. They are examined in this article.

We developed a two-step method to link species to ecosystem processes related to management goals of improving desirable forage production in grazing lands in northeastern USA. Results: Species were distributed continuously, rather than clustering into discrete functional types. Grasses, legumes and forbs overlapped considerably in trait values with these common classifications failing to adequately distinguish functional differences. Factor analyses were used to assess variation in species traits, and to rate species for six plant processes through which species contribute to the production of desirable forage. Species performed well in some processes and poorly in others, illustrating complex trade-offs.

Location: Central Chile, a world biodiversity hotspot. Methods: Using land-cover data from the years 1975, 1985, 1999 and 2008, we fitted classification trees and multiple logistic regression models to account for the relationship between different trajectories of vegetation change and a range of biophysical and socio-economic factors. Results: The variables that most consistently showed significant effects on vegetation change across all time-intervals were slope and distance to primary roads. We found that forest and shrubland loss on one side and regeneration on the other often displayed opposite patterns in relation to the different explanatory variables. Deforestation was positively related to distance to primary roads and to distance within forest edges and was favoured by a low insolation and a low slope. In turn, forest regeneration was negatively related to the distance to primary roads and positively to the distance to the nearest forest patch, insolation and slope. Shrubland loss was positively influenced by slope and distance to cities and primary roads and negatively influenced by distance to rivers. Conversely, shrubland regeneration was negatively related to slope, distance to cities and distance to primary roads and positively related to distance from existing forest patches and distance to rivers. Conclusions: This article reveals how biophysical and socioeconomic factors influence vegetation cover change and the underlying social, political and economical drivers. This assessment provides a basis for management decisions, considering the crucial role of perennial vegetation cover for sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem services.";"Schulz, Jennifer J.

The main trapping sites were in twenty first order streams, eight second-fourth order headwater streams and one fifth order stream reach. Additional trapping was also undertaken in the South Esk River and farm dams. Sites were trapped during late spring/mid summer and early autumn. A total of 78 individuals were caught in the study area. Platypuses were caught at all sites trapped in the second-fourth order and fifth order stream reaches and in nine of the twenty first order streams. Catch success was greatest in the fifth order stream reach and lowest in the first order streams. There was a trend toward a higher proportion of juvenile/subadult males in the lower order stream sites. For the higher stream orders, a higher proportion of individuals was caught during the summer, however for the first order streams, a higher proportion was caught during the autumn trapping period. Information collected on the body mass, body length and condition of individuals indicated smaller individuals with a higher tail fat index in the lower order streams. There was a trend toward a lower occurrence of platypuses in the first order streams, which had been disturbed 15 years previously by forestry operations compared to first order streams with relatively undisturbed catchments. Differences in occurrence of platypuses were related to differences in the âinstreamâ and riparian characteristics of disturbed streams compared to undisturbed streams. Headwater streams form a large proportion of a river system. Although they provide more marginal habitat for the platypus than larger river reaches, their disturbance may be an important land management issue in the conservation of this species, particularly in river catchments where the species is impacted by other environmental changes or disease.";"Koch, N.

This classification scheme was developed to overcome the spectral inseparability of urban and rural features and to deal with radiometric distortions due to cross-track illumination. The land‐use/land‐cover (LULC) classes were urban/built, corn, soya bean, wheat, forest, dry herbaceous, grass, lentic, lotic, urban barren, rural barren and unclassified. The final phase of processing was completed after an extensive quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) phase with 902 points. The overall accuracy was 83.9%. The data set was made available for public research and application; certainly, this product represents an improvement over more commonly utilized, coarser spatial resolution data sets such as National Land Cover Data (NLCD).";"Heo, Joon

To a large extent, the effectiveness of social activities is determined by the participants’ expectations towards the projects and their knowledge of the subject. Land consolidation projects are the ideal tools for rural development. Land consolidation may be described as the planned readjustment of land ownership patterns with the aim of creating larger and more rational land holdings. Other goals of land consolidation may include infrastructural improvements and the implementation of developmental and environmental policies. Members of the local community participating in the project should have sufficient knowledge about both positive and negative outcomes of their actions. Surveyors, designers, the relevant literature and guidebooks communicate only the positive results to farmers and other project participants to enhance their interest in land consolidation. This article discusses both positive and negative aspects of rural land consolidation and the opportunities and threats associated with consolidation measures. The environmental, social and economic prerequisites for consolidation are presented. Land consolidation measures will be evaluated in a SWOT analysis. Our findings should be presented to members of the local community to increase assist them in the decision-making process.

In 1997, the Agriculture Research Service and Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, initiated a major Integrated Pest Management (IPM) research and demonstration project to develop and demonstrate ecologically based IPM strategies that can produce effective, affordable leafy spurge control.  In 1998 and 1999, a survey of ranchers and public land managers was conducted to evaluate managerial, institutional, and social factors that might affect the rate and extent of implementation of various control strategies.  In 2001, a second survey of the same ranchers and public land managers was conducted to (1) assess any changes in land managers' perceptions of weed problems, control alternatives, and related issues, and (2) evaluate the impact of the TEAM Leafy Spurge project on the respondent's weed control practices.  The impacts of noxious weeds on grazing operations, specifically leafy spurge, are not abating, and ranchers seem more aware than ever of the severity of the problem.  A slightly larger percentage of respondents in 2001 view leafy spurge as a major problem and the most serious problem for grazing operations than in 1998 and 1999.  Heightened awareness among landowners may also be linked to TEAM Leafy Spurge's efforts to inform landowners of the problem and offer affordable, effective weed management techniques.  While the use of biological control methods, specifically flea beetles, has grown, herbicides continue to be the control practice of choice.  While slightly fewer respondents reported using herbicides in 2001 than in 1998 and 1999, the vast majority of landowners plan to continue to use herbicides.  Over 50 percent of respondents are using biological control, and over 76 percent of respondents indicated flea beetles were either somewhat or very effective in controlling leafy spurge.  Nearly half of the respondents had heard of TEAM Leafy Spurge, and all TEAM Leafy Spurge demonstration sites, events, and publications were favorably rated.  A large majority of the respondents agreed that the program had been effective in demonstrating and communicating leafy spurge treatment and control options.  Based on the results of the 2001 survey, it would appear that the program has indeed made progress in communicating the type of information landowners need to address what continues to be a significant issue for grazing operations in the Midwest.";"Hodur, Nancy M.

Tanzania. We compare and contrast the findings of two recent and seemingly conflicting studies on the effectiveness of conservation protection strategies in Tanzania. We evaluate these studies in the context of a wider body of evidence relating to the problem of determining protected area performance. We highlight the importance of landscape-scale management approaches for biodiversity conservation; establishing clear management and monitoring objectives in advance; the interrelation between the choice of target species and the appropriate spatial scale over which to measure their fate; and differences between snapshot and longitudinal scales in assessing the effectiveness of conservation strategies. Protected area assessments should not promote an isolated focus on particular conservation targets or methods of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. Instead we argue for a more pluralistic approach to evaluating conservation performance that can help to reveal where potential synergies in tackling different objectives exist, and clarifying the trade-offs when they do not.";"Caro, Tim

"AGRIS:US201500196888";"impacts of shrimp farming on land use, employment and migration in Tumbes, northern Peru";"";"Export-oriented shrimp aquaculture appeared in the coastal landscape of Peru in the late 1970s. Its rapid development has entailed both positive and negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the newly emerging shrimp farming territory of the Tumbes river delta. Here we combine ground surveys and interviews with remote sensing analysis of the transformed environment in order to characterize and quantify the nature, origin and scale of the environmental and social impacts caused by the intrusion of aquaculture. Results show that shrimp farming has encroached on several land cover categories and converted 17% of the Peruvian mangrove. We provide an overview of the history and nature of those impacts. Minimum full-time equivalent employment, which occurred during a white-spot epidemic, was attained in 2001 with 439 full-time jobs; employment peaked in 2006, with 2660 full-time jobs. However, considering indirect benefits, remittances and the prevalence of part-time jobs, the population reliant on aquaculture probably exceeds 10,000. A geographical analysis of social networks reveals how shrimp farming draws a sustained influx of population from the Andes and how it modifies the interaction between population and the natural coastal environment. Recent sectorial improvements towards achieving a more sustainable management of the coastal resources are analysed, and additional recommendations predicated on a more integrated approach are provided.";"Mialhe, F.

Tree density and heterogeneity were lower while isolation was greater in small than in large or medium-sized parks. Yet, park features were often interrelated, with isolation variables negatively correlated to each other, heterogeneity positively correlated to area, and habitat variables mostly positively correlated with one another but variously to disturbances; whereas pedestrian densities wee positively correlated with green area proportions (ISO3) but negatively with the distances to large green areas (ISO2). Park size played a primary role by positively affecting species richness and numbers of nesting species, thus contributing to higher total and nesting species heterogeneity, and determining the occurrence of a greatest number of species. Pedestrian density, canopy cover, and ground heterogeneity played secondary roles, whereas isolation appeared less influential at the community level. Omnivores, granivores, and aerial insectivores appeared more abundant but were dominated by several common species. Nesting was restricted to even fewer species. While species varied in the occupancy responses to these factors, tree heterogeneity positively affected the nesting of Zosterops japonicus and cavity-nesting birds, and predator density negatively affected those of Lonchura punctulata and Streptopelia doves. Improved urban land use planning and park management incorporating these effects should be implemented to enhance breeding and avoid compositional homogenization for long-term sustainability of urban avian diversity.";"Chang, Hsiang-Yi

Earth-observation methods enable monitoring of land degradation in a consistent, physical way and on a global scale by making use of vegetation productivity and/or loss as proxies. Most recent studies indicate a general greening trend, but improved data sets and analysis also show a combination of greening and browning trends. Statistically based linear trends average out these effects.

"AGRIS:US201301702148";"potential ecological costs and cobenefits of REDD: a critical review and case study from the Amazon region";"";"The United Nations climate treaty may soon include a mechanism for compensating tropical nations that succeed in reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, source of nearly one fifth of global carbon emissions. We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of low-biomass vegetation by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interventions in a large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them.";"STICKLER, CLAUDIA M.

The counties represent three levels of productivity which, due to spatial stratification, were analogous to three biomass supplysheds. An optimal rotation age (ORA) was calculated that minimizes the annualized, discounted per-dry megagrams biomass cost for each county, genetic group and land cover, and for two discount rates (5 and 10 %). The ORA for the lowest-cost county (Todd) with specialist genotypes and a 5 % discount rate is 14 years and the breakeven price at that age is US$71 dry Mg⁻¹, while for the highest-cost county (McLeod), the generalist genotype and a 10 % discount rate, the ORA is 10 years and the breakeven price at that age is US$175 dry Mg⁻¹. Planting after a previous poplar stand increased breakeven prices and increased the ORAs by 1 to 2 years relative to planting after a previous annual crop. An ANOVA analysis showed a significant genetic group effect and significant productivity class × land rent interactions. All other factors being equal, an increase in the discount rate from 5 to 10 % is expected to reduce ORAs by 2 to 3 years. High-productivity supplysheds can also be expected to have ORAs that are 2 to 3 years shorter than low-productivity ones.

Based on the results we estimated the carbon pool capacity of the entire karst canyon area in Guizhou and contribution ratios. Carbon storage and average carbon density of the karst area in Qinglong decreased at first, and then increased over the sampling period. The actual carbon storage of the karst canyon area in Guizhou was estimated to be 42.55 Tg. The average carbon intensity of the karst canyon area in Guizhou is far higher than that of national terrestrial ecosystems, especially in vegetation areas.

There is currently much interest in restoring high quality longleaf pine habitats to such areas, but managers may also desire the retention of some existing canopy trees to meet current conservation objectives. However, fast-growing natural loblolly pine regeneration may threaten the success of artificially regenerated longleaf pine seedlings. We evaluated the establishment and growth of natural loblolly pine regeneration following different levels of timber harvest using single-tree selection (Control (uncut, residual basal area ∼16m²/ha), MedBA (residual basal area of ∼9m²/ha), LowBA (residual basal area of ∼6 m²/ha), and Clearcut (complete canopy removal)) and to different positions within canopy gaps (approximately 2800m²) created by patch cutting at two ecologically distinct sites within the longleaf pine range: Fort Benning, GA in the Middle Coastal Plain and Camp Lejeune, NC in the Lower Coastal Plain. The density of loblolly pine seedlings was much higher at Camp Lejeune than at Fort Benning at the end of the first growing season after harvesting. Following two growing seasons, there were no significant effects of canopy density or gap position on the density of loblolly pine seedlings at either site, but loblolly pine seedlings were taller on treatments with greater canopy removal. Prescribed fires applied following the second growing season killed 70.6% of loblolly pine seedlings at Fort Benning and 64.3% of seedlings at Camp Lejeune. Loblolly pine seedlings were generally less than 2m tall, and completeness of the prescribed burns appeared more important for determining seedling survival than seedling size. Silvicultural treatments that include canopy removal, such as patch cutting or clearcuts, will increase loblolly pine seedling growth and shorten the window of opportunity for control with prescribed fire. Therefore, application of prescribed fire every 2–3years will be critical for control of loblolly pine regeneration during restoration of longleaf pine in existing loblolly pine stands.";"Knapp, Benjamin O.

Data from our 15 year study at an Australian arid zone site reveals asynchronous demographic responses to rainfall and other climatic variables among different lizard species. We show that, in addition to precipitation, key demographic rates (fecundity, recruitment and survival) are correlated strongly with temporal variability in temperature, during and prior to the breeding season, and also to the density of sympatric lizard species. There were nine-fold fluctuations through time in the relative abundance of two similar-sized Ctenotus species, and asynchronous recruitment success and survival among other species, despite the absence of direct anthropogenic affects Understanding the drivers and magnitude of the substantial natural variability in arid-zone lizard assemblages is integral to predicting and interpreting their responses to future land use or climate-change scenarios.";"Read, John L.

"AGRIS:US201600197396";"Ecosystem services in urban planning: Comparative paradigms and guidelines for high quality plans";"";"Ecosystem services are a powerful tool for land-use and environmental planning, which can help decision makers better understand the tradeoffs between different development scenarios. However, there is limited guidance about how ecosystem services should be used in the land-use and environmental planning context. While existing plan quality guidance for sustainability recognizes benefits of ecosystems by promoting conservation and green infrastructure, it fails to provide specific direction on the type of ecosystem service information to collect and how it should be incorporated into land-use planning processes. We explore this gap by using criteria from American Planning Association (APA) Sustaining Places guidance to analyze two comprehensive plans: Damascus, Oregon, which uses ecosystem services as an organizing framework, and Cincinnati, Ohio, which has received recognition for advancing the science and art of planning. In addition, we compare the extent to which the plans incorporate ecosystem services (both concepts and language) into their goal setting, fact base, policies, and public participation process. We find that incorporating ecosystem services into land-use planning may help achieve sustainability goals by elevating the importance of conservation and providing a lens to link multiple community objectives. APA rewards these attributes of Damascusâ plan, but fails to identify the planâs strong ecosystem service strategies or weak analysis of ecosystem service information. Based on these findings, we propose additional metrics to help practitioners incorporate ecosystem services into comprehensive plans.";"Woodruff, Sierra C.

Building on the work of Brueckner (1979, 1982, 1983) and Henderson (1990, 1995) we offer a property value maximization model where levels of local public services are capitalized into property values. Using data for Wisconsin municipalities we demonstrate that service expenditure levels, and corresponding taxation levels, should be increased. In other words, the property value maximization test suggests that local public services in Wisconsin are consistently under-provided. By monitoring local property values officials can objectively determine if public services are being provided in an optimal manner.";"Deller, Steven C.

Thematic maps of the 11 hydrological/hydrogeological factors i.e., geomorphology, soil, topographic elevation, slope, drainage density, proximity to surface waterbodies, pre- and post-monsoon groundwater depths, net recharge, transmissivity, and land use/land cover, influencing the groundwater occurrence were used. The themes and their features were assigned suitable weights, which were normalized by the MCDM technique. Finally, the knowledge-driven groundwater potential map, generated by weighted linear combination, revealed that the good, moderate and poor groundwater potential zones are spread over 90.94 km²(26 %), 135 km²(39 %) and 122.36 km²(35 %), respectively. Furthermore, the data-driven precise groundwater potential index (GPI) map was computed by MLR technique. The results of both the knowledge- and data-driven approaches were validated from the well yields of 18 sites and were found to be comparable to each other. Moreover, exogenous and endogenous factors affecting the good, moderate and poor groundwater potential were identified by applying principal component analysis. The results of the study are useful to water managers and decision makers for locating appropriate positions of new productive wells in the study area. The novel approach and findings of this study may also be used for developing policies for sustainable utilization of the groundwater resources in other hard-rock regions of the world.";"Machiwal, Deepesh

"AGRIS:US201500084034";"Land‐use Change Dynamics, Soil Type and Species Forming Mono‐dominant Patches: the Case of Pteridium aquilinum in a Neotropical Rain Forest Region";"";"Deforestation and agricultural land degradation in tropical regions can create conditions for growth of perennial plant species forming mono‐dominated patches (MDP). Such species might limit forest regeneration, and their proliferation forces the abandonment of fields and subsequent deforestation to establish new fields. Therefore, identifying factors fostering MDP species is critical for biodiversity conservation in human‐modified landscapes. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to identify such factors and apply it to the case of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken fern), a light‐demanding species, tolerant of low soil fertility and fire. We hypothesize that bracken proliferation is promoted by land‐use changes that increase light availability, especially in sites with low soil fertility and land uses involving fire. We assessed this idea using agricultural fields in southeastern Mexico with different land‐use change histories and quantifying prevalence and cover of bracken. Five different land‐use change histories resulted from transitions among forest, crop, pasture, and fallow field stages. Of the 133 fields sampled, 71 percent had P. aquilinum; regression tree analysis indicated that 65 percent of inter‐field variation in prevalence and 90 percent in cover was explained by land‐use change history and soil type. Maximum prevalence, cover, and rates of increase in bracken were found on fields with low fertility sandy/clay soils, which had been used for crops and pasture, were frequently burned, and had high levels of light. Fields on fertile alluvial soil never used for pasture were bracken‐free. Agriculture promoting high light environments on less fertile soils is a major cause of bracken proliferation and likely that of other MDP species.";"Suazo‐Ortuño, Ireri

No new technology of any significance has emerged for quite some time now and there seems to be none in the pipeline. In the WRE sector, R&D does not generate the same level of excitement and challenges that it does in other sectors. Shortage of funds does not seem to be the reason for this disappointing performance of R&D. The main problems are: WRE R&D has very little potential for patents, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and profit and therefore the private sector does not take any interest in R&D in WRE. Most of the research pursued by the universities is too theoretical. There is very little applied research. There is a marked lack of creativity and inspiring ideas for R&D. There are neither any ""technology dreamers"" nor any dreams. Users are not being involved in the planning. The time is running out for R&D managers in WRE. The vision plans of most governments incorporate a set of measurable performance targets to be achieved in a stipulated time frame. Many of the targets are less than 10 years away. Therefore, if R&D is to be of any assistance in achieving the targets set for 2010, then that R&D must start now, not next year.

"AGRIS:US201600184560";"Effect of Supplemental Feeding on the Known Survival of Reintroduced Aplomado Falcons: Implications for Recovery";"";"The northern Aplomado Falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis) inhabited the inland and coastal grasslands of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona until about 1930, when records of aplomados in the United States decreased. In 1986, the species was classified as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Among other recovery efforts, 102 birds were released from 2006 through 2011, in its former range in New Mexico at the Armendaris Ranch in the southâcentral portion of the state. To promote their survival, an extended supplemental feeding program was conducted. From 2006 through 2008, supplemental food was provided daily, whereas from 2009 through 2011 food was provided every other day. Providing food once daily corresponded with an increase in the known survival of the aplomados, where known survival was obtained from the recorded observations of falcons at feedings, and the establishment of nearby nesting pairs. Unfortunately, this increase in known short-term survival and reproduction did not seem to lead to long-term survival or retention. This may be attributable to a lack of available prey throughout the Chihuahuan Desert as a result of ongoing drought, significant brush encroachment caused by historic overgrazing by cattle, the eradication of prairie dogs, and decreased summer and increased winter precipitation, as well as a possible increase in predation influenced by brush encroachment and the fact that the Armendaris Ranch sits at the northernmost edge of the aplomadosâ historical range. If the reintroduction on the Armendaris Ranch, and other areas with similar levels of prey, is to continue, our research supports the incorporation of an extended daily supplemental feeding program and efforts to improve access to prey, possibly by removing brush and restoring grasslands.";"Sweikert, Lily

Where land use and resource extraction is severely limited, local people turn to resource pools outside parks. Kibale National Park in western Uganda is a remnant of a previously larger, mid-altitude forest region surrounded by dense agricultural settlement. We combine remote sensing techniques and household surveys to examine landscape change and fragmentation and the implications for securing rural livelihoods. Forests and wetlands outside the park provide important resources such as fuelwood, building poles, and water, but they are also problematic for local farmers since crop raids by primates and elephants emanate from these fragments. Our analysis shows that since 1984 forests and wetlands have decreased in size and number and those that remain have become increasingly isolated within the agricultural mosaic. Farmers have adapted to resource shortages and human–wildlife conflict in different ways. Our results suggest that wealth, ethnicity, and distance from the park are important factors in determining responses to these issues.";"Hartter, Joel

"AGRIS:US2016214047";"How big is leakage from forestry carbon credits? Estimates from a Global Model";"";"There is widespread recognition that forestry carbon credits can reduce the net emissions of carbon into the atmosphere.  Designing systems to sequester carbon, however, has proven difficult due to a number of efficiency issues, including leakage. Leakage occurs when policy makers develop carbon projects in specific places which protect some parcels of land, but leave other parcels of land unprotected.  This analysis uses a newly developed model of global land use change from an established forestry and land use model, described in Sohngen et al. (1999); Sohngen and Mendelsohn (2003); and Kindermann et al. (2008). To assess leakage we estimate carbon under storage under one scenario where the world is awarded carbon credits and another where tropical developing nations are awarded the credits. We focus our results on several regions, namely Brazil, the rest of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Carbon prices are assumed to be constant, and range from US$0 tC to US$900 tC. The model adjusts global land uses to these specific policies, and leakage is assessed by comparing carbon gains within the project areas to net global changes in carbon.  A number of policy relevant results emerge. First, the estimates indicate that leakage ranges from 2% to more than 14%. Second, as carbon credits increase, leakage decreases across the world.";"Acosta, Montserrat

In this study, we tested 16 experimental hanfets constituting all possible combinations of four barley landraces and four wheat (two landraces and two varieties) at three locations in Eritrea for 3 years during which farmers (both men and women) made selections of suitable hanfets. Across locations and years, the grain yield of hanfets on average was similar to that of the pure barley but significantly higher than that of wheat. The analysis of the land equivalent ratio did not reveal differences between the hanfets but showed an average advantage of 50% by growing hanfets as compared to the pure crops. The stability analysis showed that the most stable entries always included some hanfets but that not all hanfets were necessarily more stable than the pure crops. The interactions of the hanfets with locations and years within locations were never significant while they were significant for some of the characters in the case of pure barley and pure wheat. We did not find major differences in selection between men and women: they both selected for high grain yield, earliness, short heads, low kernel weight and short plants. They appear to prefer those hanfets in which both components are early heading and maturing. We argue that because of possible differences in root architecture, the hanfets may exploit more efficiently water resources than pure crops.";"Woldeamlak, A.

Interviews with resource users in three Solomon Islands villages suggest a strong reliance upon mangrove goods for subsistence and cash, particularly for firewood, food and building materials. Village-derived economic data indicates a minimum annual subsistence value from mangroves of US$ 345â1501 per household. Fish and nursery habitat and storm protection were widely recognized and highly valued mangrove ecosystem services. All villagers agreed that mangroves were under threat, with firewood overharvesting considered the primary cause. Multivariate analyses revealed village affiliation and religious denomination as the most important factors determining the use and importance of mangrove goods. These factors, together with gender, affected usersâ awareness of ecosystem services. The importance placed on mangrove services did not differ significantly by village, religious denomination, gender, age, income, education or occupation. Mangrove ecosystem surveys are useful as tools for raising community awareness and input prior to design of PES systems. Land tenure and marine property rights, and how this complexity may both complicate and facilitate potential carbon credit programmes in the Pacific, are discussed.";"WARREN-RHODES, KIMBERLEY

Corn requires the highest application of nitrogen fertilizer of crops grown in the Midwest US. We developed a method to refine the US Geological Survey National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) (including map and original Landsat images) to distinguish corn from other crops. Overall average agreement between the resulting corn and other row crops class and ground reference data was 0.79 kappa coefficient with individual Landsat images ranging from 0.46 to 0.93 kappa. The highest accuracies occurred in Regions where corn was the single dominant crop (greater than 80.0%) and the crop vegetation conditions at the time of image acquisition were optimum for separation of corn from all other crops. Factors that resulted in lower accuracies included the accuracy of the NLCD map, accuracy of corn areal estimates, crop mixture, crop condition at the time of Landsat overpass, and Landsat scene anomalies.";"Maxwell, S.K.

The use of pack stock has become a contentious and litigious issue for land management agencies in the region inter alia due to concerns over effects on the environment. The potential environmental effects of pack stock on Sierra Nevada meadow ecosystems are reviewed and it is concluded that the use of pack stock has the potential to influence the following: (1) water nutrient dynamics, sedimentation, temperature, and microbial pathogen content; (2) soil chemistry, nutrient cycling, soil compaction and hydrology; (3) plant individuals, populations and community dynamics, non-native invasive species, and encroachment of woody species; and (4) wildlife individuals, populations and communities. It is considered from currently available information that management objectives of pack stock should include the following: minimise bare ground, maximise plant cover, maintain species composition of native plants, minimise trampling, especially on wet soils and stream banks, and minimise direct urination and defecation by pack stock into water. However, incomplete documentation of patterns of pack stock use and limited past research limits current understanding of the effects of pack stock, especially their effects on water, soils and wildlife. To improve management of pack stock in this region, research is needed on linking measurable monitoring variables (e.g. plant cover) with environmental relevancy (e.g. soil erosion processes, wildlife habitat use), and identifying specific environmental thresholds of degradation along gradients of pack stock use in Sierra Nevada meadows.";"Ostoja, Steven M.

"AGRIS:US201500008487";"Resting pastures to improve land condition in northern Australia: guidelines based on the literature and simulation modelling";"";"Pasture rest is a possible strategy for improving land condition in the extensive grazing lands of northern Australia. If pastures currently in poor condition could be improved, then overall animal productivity and the sustainability of grazing could be increased. The scientific literature is examined to assess the strength of the experimental information to support and guide the use of pasture rest, and simulation modelling is undertaken to extend this information to a broader range of resting practices, growing conditions and initial pasture condition. From this, guidelines are developed that can be applied in the management of northern Australia’s grazing lands and also serve as hypotheses for further field experiments. The literature on pasture rest is diverse but there is a paucity of data from much of northern Australia as most experiments have been conducted in southern and central parts of Queensland. Despite this, the limited experimental information and the results from modelling were used to formulate the following guidelines. Rest during the growing season gives the most rapid improvement in the proportion of perennial grasses in pastures; rest during the dormant winter period is ineffective in increasing perennial grasses in a pasture but may have other benefits. Appropriate stocking rates are essential to gain the greatest benefit from rest: if stocking rates are too high, then pasture rest will not lead to improvement; if stocking rates are low, pastures will tend to improve without rest. The lower the initial percentage of perennial grasses, the more frequent the rests should be to give a major improvement within a reasonable management timeframe. Conditions during the growing season also have an impact on responses with the greatest improvement likely to be in years of good growing conditions. The duration and frequency of rest periods can be combined into a single value expressed as the proportion of time during which resting occurs; when this is done the modelling suggests the greater the proportion of time that a pasture is rested, the greater is the improvement but this needs to be tested experimentally. These guidelines should assist land managers to use pasture resting but the challenge remains to integrate pasture rest with other pasture and animal management practices at the whole-property scale.";"Scanlan, Joe C.

However, the effect of vegetation types and climates and the potential variation in NDVI of the effective full cover has not been subject for investigation. The present study proposes a novel methodology to estimate NDVIₘₐₓ that uses observed air temperature to calibrate the NDVIₘₐₓ for each vegetation type. To assess the validity of this methodology, we have compared the accuracy of estimates using the new NDVIₘₐₓ and the previous NDVIₘₐₓ that have been proposed in literature with MSG-SEVIRI images in Spain during the year 2005. In addition, a spatio-temporal assessment of residuals has been performed to evaluate the accuracy of retrievals in terms of daily and seasonal variation, land cover, landscape heterogeneity and topography. Results showed that the new calibrated NDVIₘₐₓ perform well, with a Mean Absolute Error ranging between 2.8°C and 4°C. In addition, vegetation-specific NDVIₘₐₓ improve the accuracy compared with a unique NDVIₘₐₓ.";"Nieto, Héctor

Band selection is one of the necessary preprocessings to reduce the data volume and the redundancy therein for the subsequent analysis. Aiming at speeding up the search-based band selection process, this letter proposes a new technique from the perspective of spectral curve shape similarity. Through a newly defined measure for band subset discriminativeness (BSD), class-specific important bands (IBs) are retained which can preserve the spectral similarity of the samples from the same class and narrow down candidate band subset for the following search procedure. Then optimal search is performed in the aggregated band subset from all classes. Experiments on the Indian Pine benchmark data set have proved the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.";"Li, Shijin

It assesses the implications for bird conservation regionally and the scope for biodiversity assessments generally. Location A 200 km by 400 km area of farmland with seminatural and urban areas, covering south‐eastern England. Methods Cluster analysis was used to link birds to landscapes. Cluster centroid coordinate values were processed to derive indices of bird‐habitat preference. Further developments assessed the relative values of individual habitats for birds. Results Clustering objectively linked birds to landscapes. Maps of the clusters showed strong regional patterns associated with distinctive habitat assemblages. Derived indices related bird species directly to individual habitats and habitats to birds. Even rare species and scarce habitats showed successful linkages, often to each other. Objective corroboration strongly supported the associations of coastal, wetland, urban and woodland birds and habitats; but, it suggested that farmland birds, whose numbers have nearly halved since 1977, may prefer alternative habitats. Main conclusions Land cover maps from remote sensing provide an effective way to link birds to habitats and vice versa. Thus, generalized habitat maps might be used to extrapolate localized or sample‐based bird observations or the results of autecological studies, helping to predict and understand bird distributions in the wider countryside. The weak links between farmland birds and farmland habitats in a region dominated by farming, suggests that reasons for the decline in farmland birds may be deep seated and thus hard to reverse. The procedures described are repeatable elsewhere and applicable more generally to evaluate landscapes and biodiversity. It is suggested that remote sensing could rarely be bettered as a means of assessing habitats, comprehensively, over wide areas, in most parts of the world.";"Fuller, Robin M.

These environmental stressors have been the primary source of ecosystem degradation to date, and climate change is now exacerbating some of their effects. Ecosystems already under stress are likely to have more rapid and acute reactions to climate change; it is therefore useful to understand how multiple stresses will interact, especially as the magnitude of climate change increases. Understanding these interactions could be critically important in the design of climate adaptation strategies, especially because actions taken by other sectors (eg energy, agriculture, transportation) to address climate change may create new ecosystem stresses.";"Staudt, Amanda

"AGRIS:US201301058309";"Ecohydrological impacts of woody-plant encroachment: seasonal patterns of water and carbon dioxide exchange within a semiarid riparian environment";"";"Across many dryland regions, historically grass-dominated ecosystems have been encroached upon by woody-plant species. In this paper, we compare ecosystem water and carbon dioxide (CO₂) fluxes over a grassland, a grassland-shrubland mosaic, and a fully developed woodland to evaluate potential consequences of woody-plant encroachment on important ecosystem processes. All three sites were located in the riparian corridor of a river in the southwest US. As such, plants in these ecosystems may have access to moisture at the capillary fringe of the near-surface water table. Using fluxes measured by eddy covariance in 2003 we found that ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) increased with increasing woody-plant dominance. Growing season ET totals were 407, 450, and 639 mm in the grassland, shrubland, and woodland, respectively, and in excess of precipitation by 227, 265, and 473 mm. This excess was derived from groundwater, especially during the extremely dry premonsoon period when this was the only source of moisture available to plants. Access to groundwater by the deep-rooted woody plants apparently decouples ecosystem ET from gross ecosystem production (GEP) with respect to precipitation. Compared with grasses, the woody plants were better able to use the stable groundwater source and had an increased net CO₂ gain during the dry periods. This enhanced plant activity resulted in substantial accumulation of leaf litter on the soil surface that, during rainy periods, may lead to high microbial respiration rates that offset these photosynthetic fluxes. March-December (primary growing season) totals of NEE were [-]63, [-]212, and [-]233 g C m[superscript [-]2] in the grassland, shrubland, and woodland, respectively. Thus, there was a greater disparity between ecosystem water use and the strength of the CO₂ sink as woody plants increased across the encroachment gradient. Despite a higher density of woody plants and a greater plant productivity in the woodland than in the shrubland, the woodland produced a larger respiration response to rainfall that largely offset its higher photosynthetic potential. These data suggest that the capacity for woody plants to exploit water resources in riparian areas results in enhanced carbon sequestration at the expense of increased groundwater use under current climate conditions, but the potential does not scale specifically as a function of woody-plant abundance. These results highlight the important roles of water sources and ecosystem structure on the control of water and carbon balances in dryland areas.";"Scott, Russell L.

"AGRIS:US201600187197";"Understanding Family Forest Land Future Ownership and Use: Exploring Conservation Bequest Motivations";"";"Due to an aging landowner population, there will be an unprecedented ownership shift in land-based assets in the USA. Approximately 2.7 million family forest owners (FFOs) in the USA over the age of 55Â years old, reflecting 80Â % of all FFO-owned land, will be deciding the future ownership and use of their land, having significant implications for the landscapes and public benefits these forests provide. Little is known about how FFOs plan for the future ownership and use of their land. This study draws from life-cycle theory and FFO decision cycle research to propose a future ownership and use decision-making framework and to explore the presence of and motivation for FFOs to make âconservation bequestsâ designed to maintain land in its current, forested form. Qualitative interviews with professionals working with over 1000 FFOs explore what triggers FFOs to consider their options and influence their decisions. Findings suggest triggers are universally-held (e.g. age, health) and can happen any time in an FFOâs life. FFO decisions are complex and often made in the context of family goals and dynamics. FFOs holding deep attachments to their land may be more likely to make conservation bequests. However, despite conservation preferences, due to the complex nature of the process or external influences, decisions may not always lead to conservation bequests. The framework that this study adopts allows future in-depth research on these critical decisions. In particular, additional research with landowners is required to examine the framework in more detail.";"Markowski-Lindsay, Marla

"AGRIS:US201400174936";"priming potential of biochar products in relation to labile carbon contents and soil organic matter status";"";"Recognition of biochar as a potential tool for long-term carbon sequestration with additional agronomic benefits is growing. However, the functionality of biochar in soil and the response of soils to biochar inputs are poorly understood. It has been suggested, for example, that biochar additions to soils could prime for the loss of native organic carbon, undermining its sequestration potential. This work examines the priming potential of biochar in the context of its own labile fraction and procedures for their assessment. A systematic set of biochar samples produced from C4 plant biomass under a range of pyrolysis process conditions were incubated in a C3 soil at three discrete levels of organic matter status (a result of contrasting long-term land management on a single site). The biochar samples were characterised for labile carbon content ex-situ and then added to each soil. Priming potential was determined by a comparison of CO₂ flux rates and its isotopic analysis for attribution of source. The results conclusively showed that while carbon mineralisation was often higher in biochar amended soil, this was due to rapid utilisation of a small labile component of biochar and that biochar did not prime for the loss of native organic soil organic matter. Furthermore, in some cases negative priming occurred, with lower carbon mineralisation in biochar amended soil, probably as a result of the stabilisation of labile soil carbon.";"Cross, Andrew

However, there are two different conclusions about the effect of light on their germination: light promotes germination versus light inhibits germination. The aim of this study was to evaluate these two conclusions and relate the results to instances of failure of these two species to germinate well when air-dispersed in revegetation projects. The effects of fluctuating temperature, light/dark, source (population), position on mother plant, storage condition, and storage time were tested on germination of achenes of these two species. At low temperature, final percent germination (FPG) of achenes in dark and nearly dark conditions was significantly higher than those in light. At 10:20°C, achenes of both A. sphaerocephala and A. ordosica had higher FPG in dark than in light regardless of source, position on mother plants or storage condition. At suboptimum (5:15°C) and supraoptimal (25:35°C) temperatures, germination of A. sphaerocephala and A. ordosica achenes was inhibited in both light and darkness. It was concluded that light inhibits germination of A. sphaerocephala and A. ordosica achenes at low (10:20°C) temperature but not at high (15:25°C) temperature. Since the temperature in Mu Us sandy land is around 10:20°C in early June, when air sowing is done, achenes should germinate best when they are covered by a thin layer of sand.";"Lai, Liming

The first study aim was to analyse the efficacy of the state property regime in managing the forest through a close examination of the relationship between property rights and mangrove conservation practices. The second study aim was to explore forest-dependent communities' (FDCs) perceptions about their participation in management and conservation practices. The Schlager and Ostrom theoretical framework was adopted to examine the role of potential ownership variations in a common property resource regime. A survey of 412 FDC households was undertaken. Current management by the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD) does not result in implementation of mandated mangrove conservation practices. It was found that allocation of property rights to FDCs would be expected to increase conservation practices. 92% of respondents expressed the view that the evidenced rapid degradation over the past 30 years was due primarily to corruption in the BFD. About half of FDCs (46%) surveyed are willing to participate in mangrove conservation through involvement in management as proprietors. Consistent with Schlager and Ostrom's theory, the results indicate the necessity for de facto and de jure ownership and management change from a state to common property regime to ensure FDCs' participation in conservation practices.";"Roy, Anjan Kumer Dev

We created a model and simulated range-wide population and breeding habitat dynamics for an endangered woodland warbler, the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia). Habitat-transition probabilities were estimated across the warbler's breeding range by combining National Land Cover Database imagery with multistate modeling. Using these estimates, along with recently published demographic estimates, we examined if the species can remain viable into the future given the current conditions. Lastly, we evaluated if protecting a greater amount of habitat would increase the number of warblers that can be supported in the future by systematically increasing the amount of protected habitat and comparing the estimated terminal carrying capacity at the end of 50 years of simulated habitat change. The estimated habitat-transition probabilities supported the hypothesis that habitat transitions are unidirectional, whereby habitat is more likely to diminish than regenerate. The model results indicated population viability could be achieved under current conditions, depending on dispersal. However, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the population projections due to parametric uncertainty. Model results suggested that increasing the amount of protected lands would have a substantial impact on terminal carrying capacities at the end of a 50-year simulation. Notably, this study identifies the need for collecting the data required to estimate demographic parameters in relation to changes in habitat metrics and population density in multiple regions, and highlights the importance of establishing a common definition of what constitutes protected habitat, what management goals are suitable within those protected areas, and a standard operating procedure to identify areas of priority for habitat conservation efforts. Therefore, we suggest future efforts focus on these aspects of golden-cheeked warbler conservation and ecology.";"Duarte, Adam

S. Scholberg, Santiago Dogliotti, Lincoln Zotarelli, Corey M. Cherr, Carolina Leoni and Walter A. H. Rossing, 2010, Jason Bergtold, Jason Fewella, and Patricia Duffy, 2010). An externality of adoption of cover crops that has not been explored is its potential impact on the amount of nitrogen use by farmers. Using a 2009 survey of conventional and organic corn farmers in 7 states of the US, we estimate the factors affecting adoption of cover crops and its impact on nitrogen use. While nitrogen used by farmers is considered as left censored variable, adoption of cover crop is considered as an endogenous dummy variable. The resulting system is a two stage Limited Dependent Variable (LDV) model defined by the amount of nitrogen used by farmers, with endogenous dummy variable that investigates whether the farmer adopts cover crops. We conclude that farmers adopting cover crop technologies, that increase production efficiency, tend to decrease nitrogen fertilizer use. Further, this decrease is significantly higher among organic corn producers compared to conventional corn farmers.";"Chintawar, Sachin

The Lachuá region maintains the largest lowland rainforest remnant in Guatemala, but it has been highly deforested and fragmented during the last decades. This is the first paper to describe the patterns of LCC and the associated political and socioeconomic factors in the region over the last 50� years. We estimated spatial and temporal variations in LCC from a random sample of 24 1-km² landscape plots during three time periods (1962–1987, 1987–2006, and 2006–2011) and evaluated how they were related to some important proximate causes and underlying driving forces. During the study period, 55� % of forest cover disappeared, at an annual rate of 1.6� %. The deforestation rate increased from 0.6� % (during the first study period) to 2.8� % (last period), but there was very high spatial variation. Landscape plots located outside conservation areas and close to roads lost between 80 and 100� % of forest cover, whereas the forest cover in landscapes located within protected areas remained intact during the study period. The establishment of new human settlements, roads, and annual crops was the main proximate cause during the first period, but during the second and third periods, open areas were mainly created to establish cattle pastures. Because ~75� % of forest cover has disappeared outside the protected areas, the conservation of this biodiversity hot spot will depend on the expansion of protected areas, and the promotion of forest regrowth and alternative biodiversity-friendly land uses in the landscape matrix.";"Quezada, Maura L.

Better educated fathers favor daughters in termsof education, while mothers with more land favor sons. These patterns are consistentwith both equity and efficiency objectives, investment in children under resourceconstraints, and parents' risk-diversification strategies.";"Quisumbing, Agnes R.";"";"";"AGRIS";"1997-01-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"PHL";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016205667";"http://purl.umn.edu/97298";"";"";"";""

Cities in tropical countries suffer extensively due to the urban heat island effect, and urban climate studies are necessary to improve the comfort level and city planning. Chennai is the tropical city; it is the fourth largest metropolis in India and one of the fastest growing economic and industrial growth centers in South Asia. The spatial distribution of heat intensity in Chennai Metropolitan Area was studied, and the influence of land use and green cover were analyzed in the present work. Mobile measurements were carried out throughout the study area using a grid network to represent various land use patterns of the city. The study revealed some heat and cool pockets within the city limit; the maximum intensities of temperature were noticed in the central core city and north Chennai, which are distinguished for their commercial centers and densely populated residential areas. In morning time, temperature differences between fringes and central parts of heat packets were in the range of 3–4.5 °C. Land use and green cover play a critical role in microclimate and influences it. Green cover has a significant negative correlation with observed microclimate variations. Thus, the study urges city administration, policy makers, and architects to take up effective mitigation and adaptation strategies in the city to make people more comfortable.";"Jeganathan, Anushiya

"AGRIS:US201600126639";"Evaluation of the Effects of Climate Change on Groundwater Recharge Using a Hybrid Method";"";"In this study, a new framework was developed for the estimation of groundwater recharge based on a hybrid method. In this regard, the homogeneous recharge zones were determined by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The recharge rates in these zones were calculated using the Thornthwaite and Mather’s method. These zones and their recharge rates were entered into the MODFLOW model. Next, the modeling processes, modification of recharge, and calibration of empirical models were interactively continued in the MODFLOW. This way, one of the most important disadvantages of conventional empirical models, i.e., ignoring the physical properties of the aquifer, was resolved by considering the main parameters such as soil properties, unsaturated thickness, land cover, irrigation, and precipitation in the resulting nonlinear equations. The low root mean square error values (less than 5.2) for all equations and high values of the coefficient of determinations indicated the accuracy and reliability of the models. The results of this hybrid method were a series of independent, cost-effective, rapid, and simple to use empirical equations for recharge estimation. As an example for the application of this method, the effects of climate change on groundwater recharge were evaluated in the study area. The obtained results showed that climate change would reduce the recharge rates of the homogeneous zones differently. Moreover, the recharge rate had a general decreasing trend in all regions. Overall, the total annual recharge rate would decrease in the plain. This reduction, especially in the west of the plain which is one of the most important sources of recharge supply, is considerable and will turn the entire plain vulnerable. In general, little reduction in rainfall or increase in temperature would have significant effects on groundwater recharge in the region. Therefore, due to the high dependence of this plain on groundwater resources, special planning is required for the exploitation of groundwater resources in the region.";"Goodarzi, Mustafa

Framing the Mexican agrarian community as a unit of analysis characterized by its history, individual members, resources, civic structure and property rights, we use institutionaleconomic analysis to motivate project design and research on three aspects of Mexicancommunity forestry governance: first, how communities have engaged forest resources toparticipate in forestry markets; second, how internal models of forestry management arereflect historical circumstances and practices, policy trends and managerial preferences that are independent of vertical integration levels; third, correlation among market participation, internal organization and performance outcomes such as conservation levels, wealth and income indicators and public and private goods investment. The project employs unique community-level survey data collected in Durango and Michoacan between 2005 and 2007 to summarize basic statistics to describe the sector from the point of view of the project’s objectives. Preliminary results reveal an inverse relationship betweenintegration into production chains and material wealth measures, no correlation between internal governance models and vertical integration, and significant regional variation in institutional characteristics. The emerging profile shows continually evolving and varied common property institutions and questions “one-size-fits-all” business models, pointing to the need for more specific understandings of the community forestry sector. The lessons learned can be applied to address the future role of “community” in Mexican economic and environmental policy, and, on a larger scale, the meaning of community forestry management in sustainable development strategies.";"Antinori, Camille

In the majority of the former socialist countries of Central Europe the primary land privatization method was restitution to pre-war owners. In Hungary, a mixture of (i) restitution, (ii) division of cooperatively farmed land among cooperatives’ workers and the (iii) sale of land to individuals were applied in land privatization. In lack of a well-functioning land market and realistic land prices (i.e. prices set by the marketable values of a given parcel), prohibition of land ownership by foreigners was a matter of political compromise and that of public opinion. Our study was aimed at identifying key factors determining land ownership patterns with the ban on foreign land purchase in focus. After revealing the stakeholders’ attitude to this prohibition through qualitative interviews, we draw our conclusions concentrating on possible and adequate solutions that are meant to satisfy both domestic and foreign stakeholders.";"Feher, Istvan

This is in spite of significant reductions in airborne pollutants. The relationship between freshwater sulphate and forest cover has decreased from 1996 to 2006 indicating a decrease in pollutant scavenging. The relationship between forest cover and freshwater acidity (pH) is, however, still present over the same period, and does not show conclusive signs of having declined. Furthermore, evidence for forest cover contributing to a chlorine bias in marine ion capture suggests that forest scavenging of sea-salts may mean that the forest acidification effect may continue in the absence of anthropogenic pollutant inputs, particularly in coastal areas.";"Dunford, Robert W.

The pixel-level dependence is measured by the spatial attraction model (SAM) with either surrounding or quadrant neighbourhood, while the subpixel-level dependence is characterized by either the mean filter or the exponential weighting function. Both pixel-level and subpixel-level dependences are then fused as the weighted dependence in the constructed objective function. The branch-and-bound algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem, and thus, obtain the optimal spatial distribution of subpixel classes. An artificial image and a set of real remote sensing images were tested for validation of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve results with greater accuracy than two traditional SPM methods and the mixed SAM method. Meanwhile, the proposed method needs less computation time than the mixed SAM, and hence it provides a new solution to subpixel land cover mapping.";"Chen, Yuehong

These changes have resulted to increasing socio-economic pressure on land and differential access to farmland and intensification of cultivation with far-reaching consequences for land-use management practices and the sustainability of the agricultural system. Severe soil fertility and productivity decline, ecological damages including soil erosion losses, flood and gullies are some of the out comes of the uncontrolled land-use and agricultural intensification in the state. These problems might worsen in future due to the fragile, heavily weathered and leached nature of the soil.

Engineering geology needs to deal with a number of issues related to the origin and development of subsidence basins in areas affected by deep coal mining. An interesting case study from the Upper-Silesian Basin in the northeast of the Czech Republic near the Polish border is presented in this paper. There is a clear time chronological succession in the ground surface changes manifested by a ground subsidence gradation, both in their absolute values as well as in their spatial distribution. The phenomenon is documented by aerial photo time series, which optimally depict the origin and development of the subsidence. In the study area, there are changes in the landscape elements and it is essential to be considered in future land use plans. The marginal conditions of the Quaternary geological structure and hydrogeological conditions are responsible for an unconfined aquifer which manifests there as a water body in an undrained depression in the course of the ground subsidence.";"Marschalko, Marian

Increased interest in the rate of return for investing in farmland suggests that an important consideration is the effect of adjustment costs on this return. A novel theoretical modelis developed that ties together contributions from the farmland pricing and adjustment cost literatures, andthe first order conditions for a utility maximizing decision maker are rearranged into intertemporal arbitrageequations that are similar in spirit to traditional finance models. The common assumptions that land andcapital are quasi-fixed assets, and that production is characterized by constant returns to scale are testedand the evidence supports these assumptions. An empirical application of the arbitrage equations providesevidence that risk aversion and adjustment costs are jointly significant components of agricultural production,and that adjustment costs generate significant changes in the rate of return to farmland. The results haveimportant policy implications as sluggish supply response due to quasi-fixity can lead to dramatically inflatedcommodity prices, and an accurate measure of the farmland return can help determine how far the extensivemargin will expand or contract in response to a variety of policy scenarios, such as the subsidization of cornfor ethanol, an increase in the variety of subsidized crop insurance products, or the introduction of newrevenue support programs such as ACRE.";"Tack, Jesse B.

Differences in parent materials, pedogenic processes, land use, and management practices can have a substantial effect on their characteristics. The goal of this study is to examine intra-aggregate pore characteristics using X-ray computed microtomography (μCT) images in soils of two contrasting parent materials and of contrasting land use and management. In addition, to quantify pore characteristics in aggregate exterior and interior layers we have developed an approach for aggregate boundary delineation in μCT images. Soil aggregates from a Hapludalf under Long Term Ecological Research conventional tillage treatment (LTER-CT) and native succession vegetation treatment (LTER-NS) in southwest Michigan, and from an Ustochrept under native succession vegetation and bare soil in northeast China were used. The LTER-CT aggregates had significantly greater macro- porosity (>14.6 μm in diameter) than those of LTER-NS. The LTER-NS aggregates had more large pores (>97.5 μm) and more small pores (<15 μm) than LTER-CT aggregates, while more medium size pores (37.5-97.5μm) were found in LTER-CT aggregates. Greater abundance of medium sized pores in LTER-CT aggregates could be the cause of their reported lower stability and higher macro-aggregate turnover rate. The differences in pore size distributions between LTER-CT and LTER-NS were more pronounced in the aggregate interiors, as compared to the exterior layers. In aggregates from both studied soils large pores tended to prevail in the aggregate interiors while medium size pores (37.5–97.5 μm) were more abundant in the aggregate exteriors.";"Wang, W.

"AGRIS:US201301621296";"Urban Containment Policies and the Protection of Natural Areas: The Case of Seoul's Greenbelt";"";"Countries around the world have responded to the problems associated with rapid urban growth and increasingly land-consumptive development patterns by creating a wide range of policy instruments designed to manage urban growth. Of the array of growth management techniques, urban containment policies are considered by some to be a promising approach. This paper focuses on greenbelts, the most restrictive form of urban containment policy. The long-standing greenbelt of Seoul, Republic of Korea is examined as a case study. Seoul's greenbelt has generated both significant social costs and benefits. Costs include higher land and housing prices in the urban area surrounded by the greenbelt, additional costs incurred by commuters who live beyond the greenbelt and work in Seoul, and increased congestion and related quality of life impacts. Benefits include the amenity value of living near the greenbelt, recreational resources, bequest and heritage values, fiscal savings due to increased efficiency in the provision of public services and infrastructure, and a wide range of life-supporting ecosystem services. After standing virtually unchanged for almost three decades, Korea's greenbelt policy is currently being revised and weakened, largely due to pressure from greenbelt landowners and developers. Although there is no definitive answer to the question of whether Seoul would be a more or less “sustainable city” today without the greenbelt, it is certain that in the absence of the greenbelt, Seoul would have lost much of its rich natural heritage and essential ecosystem services.";"Bengston, David N.

"AGRIS:US201600057805";"improved automated land cover updating approach by integrating with downscaled NDVI time series data";"";"Land cover change monitoring is important for climate and environmental research. An automated approach for updating land cover maps derived from Landsat-like data is urgently needed to process large amounts of data. Change detection is an important part of the updating approach; however, pseudo-changes commonly occur because satellite images acquired in different seasons can capture phenological differences. Change detection based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data could avoid this problem; nevertheless it suffers from the much lower spatial resolution of the NDVI data. To address the resolution issue, this study improves an automated land cover updating approach by integrating downscaled NDVI time series data. First, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data at 250-m resolution are downscaled to 30 m using the NDVI linear mixing growth model. Then, the NDVI-based change detection method is used to detect the changed/unchanged areas, and the unchanged areas are removed from the changed areas that were detected using the original land cover updating approach. A case study shows that the NDVI-based change detection module sufficiently removed the pseudo-change caused by seasonal differences and improved the land cover updating result, with an increase in overall accuracy from 76.6% to 89.6%.";"Chen, Xuehong

"AGRIS:US201301654056";"Finding a way to legality, local coordination modes and public policies in large-scale irrigation schemes in Algeria and Morocco";"";"The design of public policy related to irrigation sectors in North Africa was often based on the state view. Local farmers' organizations, made up of family farms, did not contribute to building the legal framework, which was in turn unable to propose specific solutions for family farming. Legal reforms currently underway in Morocco and Algeria show how difficult it is to integrate field realities. Access to land and water resources is often obtained through informal local coordination modes. The purpose of this paper is to clarify how collective action can integrate the dynamics of local coordination modes and contribute to the formulation of public policies. The underlying hypothesis is that by doing so, the public policies can be continuously renewed and will be more appropriate and robust, and consequently favour rural development. We show that local coordination modes, presently often invisible or even illegal, can help farmers to go beyond survival strategies by providing access to more formal development spheres and policy making. These results should encourage development and extension agencies to redefine collective action as a tool of learning and empowerment centred on the co-construction of public policies.";"Errahj, M.

"AGRIS:US201400085599";"Integrating single-species management and landscape conservation using regional habitat occurrence models: the northern goshawk in the Southwest, USA";"";"Conservation planners and land managers are often confronted with scale-associated challenges when assessing the relationship between land management objectives and species conservation. Conservation of individual species typically involves site-level analyses of habitat, whereas land management focuses on larger spatial extents. New models are needed to more explicitly integrate species-specific conservation with landscape or regional scales. We address this challenge with an example using the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), a forest raptor with circumpolar distribution that is the focus of intense debate regarding forest management on public lands in the southwestern USA. To address goshawk-specific habitat conservation across a management area of 22,800-km² in northern Arizona, we focused on the territory scale rather than individual nest sites. We compiled a 17-year database of 895 nest sites to estimate territory locations. We then estimated the likelihood of territory occurrence for the entire management area using multiple logistic regression within an expert-driven, spatially balanced, and information-theoretic framework. Our occurrence model incorporated forest structure variables that were derived from USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis plots and high-resolution satellite imagery. Results indicated that high canopy-bulk density, intermediate canopy-base heights, and low variation in tree density were strong predictors of territory occurrence. We used model-averaged parameter estimates for these variables to map and explore patterns of territory distribution across multiple land jurisdictions and ecological subregions. Our iterative modeling approach complements previous demographic studies in the region. It also provides a robust framework for integrating species conservation and landscape management in ongoing and future regional planning efforts.";"Dickson, Brett G.

This challenges the traditional ecosystem services (ESS) mapping approach, which has often made the assumption that ESS can be mapped uniquely to land use and land cover data. Using a functional fragmentation measure, we show how landscape pattern changes might lead to changes in the delivery of ESS. We map changes in ESS of dry calcareous grasslands under different land use change scenarios in a case study region in Switzerland. We selected three ESS known to be related to species diversity including carbon sequestration and pollination as regulating values and recreational experience as cultural value, and compared them to the value of two production services including food and timber production. Results show that the current unceasing fragmentation is particularly critical for the value of ESS provided by species-rich habitats. The article concludes that assessing landscape patterns is key for maintaining valuable ESS in the face of human use and fluctuating environment.";"Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne

"AGRIS:US201400084972";"Erosion regulation as a function of human disturbances to vegetation cover: a conceptual model";"";"Human-induced land cover changes are causing important effects on the ecological services rendered by mountain ecosystems, and the number of case-studies of the impact of humans on soil erosion and sediment yield has mounted rapidly. In this paper, we present a conceptual model that allows evaluating overall changes in erosion regulation after human disturbances. The basic idea behind this model is that soil erosion mechanisms are independent of human impact, but that the frequency–magnitude distributions of erosion rates change as a response to human disturbances. Pre-disturbance (or natural) erosion rates are derived from in situ produced ¹⁰Be concentrations in river sediment, while post-disturbance (or modern) erosion rates are derived from sedimentation rates in small catchments. In its simplicity, the model uses vegetation cover change as a proxy of human disturbance. The erosion regulation model is here applied in two mountainous regions with different vegetation dynamics, climatic and geological settings: the Austro Ecuatoriano, and the Spanish Betic Cordillera. Natural erosion benchmarks are necessary to assess human-induced changes in erosion rates. While the Spanish Betic Cordillera is commonly characterized as a degraded landscape, there is no significant difference between modern catchment-wide erosion and long-term denudation rates. The opposite is true for the Austro Ecuatoriano where the share of natural erosion in the total modern erosion rate is minimal for most disturbed sites. When pooling pre- and post-disturbance erosion data from both regions, the data suggest that the human acceleration of erosion is related to vegetation disturbances. The empirical regression model predicts human acceleration of erosion, here defined as the ratio of post-disturbance to pre-disturbance (or natural benchmark) erosion rate, as an exponential function of vegetation disturbance. This suggests that the sensitivity to human-accelerated erosion would be ecosystem dependent, and related to the potential vegetation cover disturbances as a result of human impact. It may therefore be expected that the potential for erosion regulation is larger in well-vegetated ecosystem where strong differences may exist in vegetation cover between human disturbed and undisturbed or restored sites.";"Vanacker, Veerle

Considerable attention has been drawn to the measurement of regional-scale patterns of land-cover change and assessment of its environmental and socioeconomic consequences. Yet little is known about the quantity of land-cover change within individual exurban residential parcels, which reflect homeowner preferences, land-management strategies, and the ecosystem services they generate. Similarly, little is known about the spatial autocorrelation of land cover among parcels and how it may change over time. Using a dataset delineating land-cover change within exurban residential parcels in southeastern Michigan from 1960 to 2000, the quantity and composition of land cover and carbon storage are examined. The spatial similarity of land-cover quantity among neighboring parcels is evaluated using local indicators of spatial association. Results show, among other findings, that (1) the number of exurban residential parcels, the quantity of tree cover, and amount of carbon storage increased steadily from 1960 to 2000; (2) the distribution of parcel sizes remained relatively constant and dominated by small parcels; (3) an increasing proportion of parcels were significantly similar to their neighbors; and (4) using a benefits transfer approach, new exurban parcels are estimated to store ~15,000–29,000� kg� C over the study period. The measured changes in land cover and carbon storage improve our understanding of how ecosystem services may change in human-dominated landscapes and provide evidence that policy opportunities are available to increase carbon management.";"Huang, Qingxu

AIMS : We explore an innovative production system that combines the production of short rotation coppice in wide alleys with the production of high-value trees on narrow strips of land; it is an alternative form of alley cropping which we propose to call ‘alley coppice’. The aim is to describe this alley coppice system and to illustrate its potential for producing two diverse products, namely high-value timber and energy wood on the same land unit. METHODS : Based on a comprehensive literature review, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of the alley coppice system and contrast the features with well-known existing or past systems of biomass and wood production. RESULTS : We describe and discuss the basic aspects of alley coppice, its design and dynamics, the processes of competition and facilitation, issues of ecology, and areas that are open for future research. CONCLUSION : Based on existing knowledge, a solid foundation for the implementation of alley coppice on suitable land is presented, and the high potential of this system could be shown.";"Morhart, Christopher D.

However, limited attention has been given to arid regions. The focus of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal variability of surface soil (0–6 cm) water content and to identify its controlling factors in a region of the Gobi Desert (40 km ²). The standard deviation of SWC decreased logarithmically as mean water content decreased, and the coefficient of variation of SWC exhibited a convex upward pattern. The spatial variability of SWC also increased with the size of the investigated area. The spatial dependence of SWC changed over time, with stronger patterns of spatial organization in drier and wetter conditions of soil wetness and stochastic patterns in moderate soil water conditions. The dominant factors regulating the variability of SWC changed from combinations of soil and topographical properties (bulk density, clay content and relative elevation) in wet conditions to combinations of soil and vegetation properties (bulk density, clay content and shrub coverage) in dry conditions.

In this paper we assess the effects and interactions of temperature and wildfire on plant communities across the transition between the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Mackenzie Delta region, Northwest Territories, Canada. We sampled air temperatures, green alder (Alnus viridis ssp. fruticosa) cover, growth, reproduction and age distributions, and overall plant community composition on burned and unburned sites across a latitudinal gradient. Mean summer temperature across the study area decreased by 3 °C per degree of increasing latitude (6 °C across the study area). In the northern part of the study area, where seed viability was low, alder was less dominant than at southern sites where seed viability was high. The age structure of alder populations across the temperature gradient was highly variable, except in the northern part of the forest-tundra transition, where populations were dominated by young individuals. Alder growth and reproduction were significantly greater on burned sites (38-51 years following fire) than on unburned sites. North to south across the temperature gradient, vegetation changed from a community dominated by dwarf shrubs and fruticose lichens to one characterized by black spruce (Picea mariana), alder and willows (Salix spp.). Regardless of the position along the temperature gradient, burned sites were dominated by tall shrubs. Temperature limitation of alder abundance and repro-duction, combined with evidence of recent recruitment on unburned sites, indicates that alder is likely to respond to increased temperature. Elevated alder growth and reproduction on burned sites shows that wildfire also has an important influence on alder population dynamics. The magnitude of alder's response to fire, combined with observations that burns at the southern margin of the low Arctic are shrub dominated, suggest that increases in the frequency of wildfire have the potential to alter northern vegetation on decadal scales. By creating new seedbeds, fire provides opportunities for colonization that may facilitate the northward movement of tall shrubs. Feedbacks between the global climate system and low Arctic vegetation make understanding the long-term impact of increasing fire frequency critical to predicting the response of northern ecosystems to global change.";"Lantz, Trevor C.

"AGRIS:US201300912220";"role of natural habitats in agricultural systems for bird conservation: the case of the threatened Lesser Grey Shrike";"";"Birds of agricultural systems are one of the most threatened groups of birds in Europe mainly due to their sharp population decline in recent decades. Habitat intensification resulting from more productive agricultural practices has been proposed as a major cause for these declines. However, especially in some regions such as Eastern European and Mediterranean countries, little is known about the ultimate factors linked to habitat intensification that drive population declines for different species. The Lesser Grey Shrike is a good study species for a better understanding of such processes since it is closely related to agricultural habitats in Europe and has suffered a strong decline in range and population size across the western half of the continent. In this study, we explored variations in breeding parameters of this shrike related to habitat composition and food supply at the territory level. We found that fledgling success of early breeders was related to the presence of natural (shrub lands) and semi-natural (fallows) habitats in the predominantly agricultural matrix that dominated breeding territories. Their influence on fledgling success appeared to be mediated by a higher arthropod availability on these habitats. Indeed, Lesser Grey Shrike showed a strong preference for these habitats as hunting locations. Our results highlight the importance of natural habitats in intensified agricultural land mosaics for the conservation of bird species. We suggest that management plans should pay special attention to the availability of habitats which serve as high quality food reservoirs and can potentially contribute to enhance the species population viability in an area. Finally, we discuss the possible link between agricultural intensification and Lesser Grey Shrike population declines in Western Europe.";"Giralt, David

country gained its independence from the Soviet Union. While an impressive land
individualization process has been in effect since then, the pace and the performance of
this process are far from satisfactory. This is due to a combination of institutional and
economic constraints. We use comparable survey data from 1996 and 2003 and show
that the land reform has been progressing mainly through land leasing. This allows
successful farm households to expand their farming operation and improve their
well-being. Land documentation doesn’t seem to yield the expected results, and the
blame may be on less than sufficient labor and credit opportunities. We conclude that

"AGRIS:US2016206768";"Testing Speculative Behavior in Farmland Demand";"";"Substantial increases in farmland demand in sub-urbanization have had profound effects on agriculture and produced a surge in farmland values. With escalating land values, farmland can take on the characteristics of a speculative asset and farmland owners may be more responsive to the investment value of farmland than the productive value.  Speculation has been shown to have a significant impact on the agricultural production decisions of farms, and may encourage farmers to curtail capital investments and prematurely idle productive farmland. This paper investigates the effects of farmland value appreciation on agriculture and isolates the speculative component of land use demand, using New Jersey as a case study. A conceptual model of land use and investment behavior is developed and estimated. Two empirical models are used in the analysis; one that accounts for speculation and one that does not. The former is found to be superior. An inverse relationship is estimated between the rate of appreciation and the demand for farmland, suggesting a direct relationship between appreciation and land supplied to development. The relationship, however, is found to be positive at rates of farmland value appreciation in excess of the risk free rate of return. This suggests an identifiable speculative demand component whereby farmland owners retain farmland at high rates of appreciation. Results also support the conjecture that when the rate of appreciation is lower than the risk free rate, the speculative behavior of farmland owners is to keep less land in agriculture.";"Barton, Nick

Soil samples from the 0- to 20-cm depth were collected from 118 locations on a 100- by 100-m grid across an 88-ha watershed at Sakaliseripalli village in the Nalgonda District in Andhra Pradesh State, India. Geostatistical analysis showed that most of the soil parameters were moderately spatially dependent. An assessment framework, including a minimum data set, linear scoring technique, and additive indices, was used to evaluate the soil quality index (SQI). Principal component analysis identified cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Na percentage, DTPA-extractable Zn, available P, available water, and dehydrogenase activity as the most important indicators for evaluating soil quality. A kriged map of SQI was prepared for the watershed. The SQI was higher in irrigated systems (3.01) than under rainfed conditions (2.53), and it was 2.61 and 2.53 in fallow and permanent fallow fields, respectively. In this study, potential soil loss calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation and crop yield were identified as the quantifiable management goals; the results indicated that good soils having higher soil quality indices were also productive and less erosion prone.";"Mandal, Uttam Kumar

In this paper, two scenarios of sea level rise and storm surge flooding along the Shanghai coast are presented by forecasting 24 (year 2030) and 44 (year 2050) years into the future and are applied to a digital elevation model to illustrate the extent to which coastal areas are susceptible to levee breach and overtopping using previously developed inflow calculating and flood routing models. Further, the socio-economic impacts are examined by combining the inundation areas with land use and land cover change simulated using GeoCA-Urban software package. This analysis shows that levee breach inundation mainly occurs in the coastal zones and minimally intrudes inland with the conservative protection of dike systems designed. However, storm surge flooding at the possible maximum tide level could cause nearly total inundation of the landscape, and put approximately 24 million people in Shanghai under direct risk resulting from consequences of flooding (e.g. contamination of potable water supplies, failure of septic systems, etc.).";"Yin, Jie

"AGRIS:US201400149722";"Automated cloud and shadow detection and filling using two-date Landsat imagery in the USA";"";"A simple, efficient, and practical approach for detecting cloud and shadow areas in satellite imagery and restoring them with clean pixel values has been developed. Cloud and shadow areas are detected using spectral information from the blue, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared bands of Landsat Thematic Mapper or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery from two dates (a target image and a reference image). These detected cloud and shadow areas are further refined using an integration process and a false shadow removal process according to the geometric relationship between cloud and shadow. Cloud and shadow filling is based on the concept of the Spectral Similarity Group (SSG), which uses the reference image to find similar alternative pixels in the target image to serve as replacement values for restored areas. Pixels are considered to belong to one SSG if the pixel values from Landsat bands 3, 4, and 5 in the reference image are within the same spectral ranges. This new approach was applied to five Landsat path/rows across different landscapes and seasons with various types of cloud patterns. Results show that almost all of the clouds were captured with minimal commission errors, and shadows were detected reasonably well. Among five test scenes, the lowest producer's accuracy of cloud detection was 93.9% and the lowest user's accuracy was 89%. The overall cloud and shadow detection accuracy ranged from 83.6% to 99.3%. The pixel-filling approach resulted in a new cloud-free image that appears seamless and spatially continuous despite differences in phenology between the target and reference images. Our methods offer a straightforward and robust approach for preparing images for the new 2011 National Land Cover Database production.";"Jin, Suming

"AGRIS:US201600196728";"Food or flowers? Contested transformations of community food security and water use priorities under new legal and market regimes in Ecuador's highlands";"";"During the past three decades, the Pisque watershed in Ecuador's Northern Andes has become the country's principal export-roses producing area. Recently, a new boom of local smallholders have established small rose greenhouses and joined the flower-export business. This has intensified water scarcity and material/discursive conflicts over water use priorities: water to defend local-national food sovereignty or production for export. This paper examines how including peasant flower farms in the capitalist dream â driven by a âmimetic desireâ and copying large-scale capitalist flower-farm practices and technologies â generates new intra-community conflicts over collective water rights, extending traditional class-based water conflicts. New allocation principles in Ecuador's progressive 2008 Constitution and 2014 Water Law prioritising food production over flowers' industrial water use are unlikely to benefit smallholder communities. Instead, decision-making power for peasant communities and their water users' associations on water use priority would enable water user prioritization according to smallholders' own preferences.";"Mena-VÃ¡sconez, Patricio

The study was conducted in a U.S. state (Kentucky) where private individuals own a majority (78%) of the state's forest resources. Intent of family forest owners was measured using a mail-based survey. We used the Theory of Planned Behavior to model factors that affect landowner intention, and we tested the effect of educational materials on participates' reported intent. Two-thirds of respondents indicated that they intend to include energy wood in future harvests, but the educational material treatment did not affect intentions. Respondents' attitudes, perceived subjective norms, and perceived control each had a significant effect on intent to harvest. No demographic or land ownership characteristics had an effect on behavioral intent. The only prior harvest activity that significantly increased intent was whether the subject had harvested pulpwood from their forest in the past. Respondents identified barriers that may prevent them from harvesting energy wood, providing forestry professionals with a list of challenges to overcome if supply is to be maximized. Lack of bioenergy markets and woodland access issues were the most frequently reported barriers.";"Leitch, Zachary J.

"AGRIS:US201500200296";"integrated model for assessment of sustainable agricultural residue removal limits for bioenergy systems";"";"Agricultural residues have been identified as a significant potential resource for bioenergy production, but serious questions remain about the sustainability of harvesting residues. Agricultural residues play an important role in limiting soil erosion from wind and water and in maintaining soil organic carbon. Because of this, multiple factors must be considered when assessing sustainable residue harvest limits. Validated and accepted modeling tools for assessing these impacts include the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Version 2 (RUSLE2), the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS), and the Soil Conditioning Index. Currently, these models do not work together as a single integrated model. Rather, use of these models requires manual interaction and data transfer. As a result, it is currently not feasible to use these computational tools to perform detailed sustainable agricultural residue availability assessments across large spatial domains or to consider a broad range of land management practices. This paper presents an integrated modeling strategy that couples existing datasets with the RUSLE2 water erosion, WEPS wind erosion, and Soil Conditioning Index soil carbon modeling tools to create a single integrated residue removal modeling system. This enables the exploration of the detailed sustainable residue harvest scenarios needed to establish sustainable residue availability. Using this computational tool, an assessment study of residue availability for the state of Iowa was performed. This study included all soil types in the state of Iowa, four representative crop rotation schemes, variable crop yields, three tillage management methods, and five residue removal methods. The key conclusions of this study are that under current management practices and crop yields nearly 26.5 million Mg of agricultural residue are sustainably accessible in the state of Iowa, and that through the adoption of no till practices residue removal could sustainably approach 40 million Mg. However, when considering the economics and logistics of residue harvest, yields below 2.25 Mg ha⁻¹ are generally considered to not be viable for a commercial bioenergy system. Applying this constraint, the total agricultural residue resource available in Iowa under current management practices is 19 million Mg. Previously published results have shown residue availability from 22 million Mg to over 50 million Mg in Iowa.";"Muth, D.J., Jr.

For this purpose Toposheet and IKONOS satellite data were used to generate various thematic layers using ArcGIS software. Criteria using five parameters, i.e. slope, road proximity, land use/land cover, land values and geological formation were used for site suitability analysis following land evaluation. The generated thematic maps of these criteria were standardized using pairwise comparison matrix known as analytical hierarchy process (AHP). A weight for each criterion was generated by comparing them with each other according to their importance.

A common path towards local governance is decentralisation, and within this context, a transfer of property rights from central government to local resource users. Yet, despite the successes of many decentralisation policies, the phenomenon of elite capture remains a risk. Our paper investigates elite capture in Albaniaâs Lake Ohrid fishing region. We aim to contribute to the state of knowledge by identifying determinants for elite capture. Our empirical case shows how âblueprintâ approaches, top-down implementation, and weak institutions led to further empowerment of privileged locals, who realise personal gains at the expense of distributional inequity within the community. Specifically original insights are derived from our analysis of implications from the post-socialist context, which we show to facilitate capture due to a common susceptibility for destructive leadership and lacking confidence in collective action.";"Schmidt, Oscar

"AGRIS:US201400171997";"Salinity dynamics of wetland ditches receiving drainage from irrigated agricultural land in arid and semi-arid regions";"";"Agricultural drainage ditches are considered as wetland ecosystems when they possess the characteristic hydrology, soil and vegetation of wetlands. In arid and semi-arid regions, wetlands receiving agricultural drainage have to cope with the conservative nature of salts leached from soils. Excessive accumulation of salts in wetlands may threaten the ecological functions of the system, thus endanger the sustainability of the drainage disposal system and the productivity of the farmlands. Based on the salt and water balance in a farmland drainage and wetland disposal system in arid regions, this paper presents a thorough investigation on salinity dynamics of wetland ditches receiving agricultural drainage. Theoretical equations were derived to describe salinity changes in water and soils of wetlands under both equilibrium and pre-equilibrium conditions; a case example was then used to display model predictions of salinity variations over time under different salinity management goals. The example wetlands are de facto drainage ditches that possess wetland characteristics, and the ditch to farmland area ratio is 9.1%. The results showed that salt as a conservative substance will eventually concentrate in the ditches to a very high level if there is little outflow discharge; but the salt accumulation process may develop over a relatively long time, which opens a time window for management practice, such as flushing the salts when fresh water is available. By assuming different threshold salinity levels in the ditches, the proposed analytical models were used to predict time intervals when fresh water recharge is needed to bring down the salinity level in the ditches. For the study area under current drainage practice, the predicted outflow to inflow ratio for salinity was 58.2% and reached an equilibrium level of 9.60gL⁻¹ in the ditches; salinity levels in the ditches reached threshold values of 5, 7 and 9gL⁻¹, in about 1, 4 and 12 years, respectively. Salinity analysis showed that the salt retention capacity of the ditch soil is limited, the soil salinity varied according to the ditch water; salt removal through plant uptake and harvest was insignificant. This study indicates that although salt concentration in wetlands receiving agricultural drainage may eventually build up to a critical level, timely recharge with fresh water may bring down salt content in the wetlands and sustain adequate environmental and ecological functions of such a drainage disposal system in arid and semi-arid regions.";"Jia, Z.

"AGRIS:US201400182349";"Assessing woody biomass in African tropical savannahs by multiscale remote sensing";"";"Woody biomass production is a critical indicator in evaluation of land use management and the dynamics of the global carbon cycle (sequestration/emission) in terrestrial ecosystems. The objective of the present study was to develop, through a case study in Sudan, an operational multiscale remote-sensing-based methodology for large-scale estimation of woody biomass in tropical savannahs. Woody biomass estimation models obtained by different authors from destructive field measurements in different tropical savannah ecosystems were expressed as functions of tree canopy cover (CC). The field-measured CC data were used for developing regression equations with atmospherically corrected and reflectance-based vegetation indices derived from Landsat ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery. Among a set of vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provided the best correlation with CC (R² = 0.91) and was hence selected for woodland woody biomass estimation. After validation of the CC-NDVI model and its applicability to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, time-series MODIS NDVI data (MOD13Q1) were used to partition the woody component from the herbaceous component for sparse woodlands, woodlands and forests defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Land Cover Map. Following the weighting of the estimation models based on the dominant woody species in each vegetation community, NDVI-based woody biomass models were applied according to their weighted ratios to the decomposed summer and autumn woody NDVI images in all vegetation communities in the whole of Sudan taking the year 2007, for example. The results were found to be in good agreement with those from other authors obtained by either field measurements or other remote sensing methods using MODIS and lidar data. It is concluded that the proposed approach is operational and can be applied for a reliable large-scale assessment of woody biomass at a ground resolution of 250 m in tropical savannah woodlands of any month or season.";"Wu, Weicheng

This paper examines the livelihoods of forest villagers (Khasia ethnic people) and their contribution to forest conservation, using data from the Sylhet forest division. The forest villagers are well-endowed with all the elements of a sustainable livelihoods framework, though human capital in terms of education is not satisfactory. Strong social capital, stable natural capital and a productive market-oriented agroforestry system facilitate the generation of financial and physical capital that make the livelihoods of Khasia people sustainable. At the same time, their reciprocal contributions in terms of forest protection and plantation development support forest conservation. However, some institutional issues such as insecure land tenure with regular agreement renewal problems need to be resolved for the sake of their livelihoods and forest conservation. Lessons learned from the study can be utilized in formulating future participatory forest management schemes in the country.";"Nath, Tapan Kumar

"AGRIS:US201500210398";"Properties, best management practices and conservation of terraced soils in Southern Europe (from Mediterranean areas to the Alps): A review";"";"Terrace soils are distinctive features of the agricultural landscape in Europe. Due to their historical and aesthetic significance, they are a resource for agriculture and tourism: however they are also a challenge for land conservation and management. Nevertheless, the fundamental role of terrace soils for agricultural quality and natural hazard prevention has not been fully investigated. In the past, terraced slopes became ideal sites for human settlement and agricultural activities. At present, they are often used for high quality crops that grow on soils with specific chemical and physical properties. The filling material used for building terraces is a human-reworked substrate, where pedogenesis occurs under a strong human influence. This leads to soils with a generally limited pedogenic development and coarse texture, although, often, with good productivity. When abandoned, terraces are subjected to progressive decay due to erosion processes and slope failures. This review focuses on terrace soil properties, conservation and management in Southern Europe. In particular, it reports some examples from the northwestern Italian Alps, where terraced slopes are characterised by ancient origin and, presently, are subjected to specific practices for their preservation. The different effects of land degradation at hill slope scale may be mitigated through appropriate management practices favoring the terrace walls maintenance, drainage optimization, and the presence of a spontaneous vegetation cover. These subjects require careful planning and conservation measures that could be collected in “best practices” guidelines for farmers, landowners and decision-makers.";"Stanchi, S.

However, little is known about their ecology in moorlands which are important habitats in terms of biodiversity and carbon storage potential. Moorlands are under threat from a range of factors such as drainage, burning, over grazing, pollution and climate change. In this study we investigate testate amoebae communities within three zones of a UK moorland characterised by contrasting fire histories, and use these data to examine the potential of testate amoebae as environmental bioindicators in moorlands. Although several factors control testate amoebae communities in moorlands, it is clear that there are marked differences in testate amoebae communities between the zones which primarily relate to hydrological status, influenced by fire regime. The taxon Hyalosphenia subflava is a clear indicator of severe disturbance as it was found to be abundant in mosses which colonised a hydrophobic peat surface following a severe wild-fire event. Testate amoebae have much potential for ecosystem monitoring of moorlands which can inform sustainable land management practices.";"Turner, T. Edward

The present study aims to estimate the land productivity of modern varieties (MV) paddy production under RPG and (year-round modern varieties) YRMV paddy farming systems in the southwest Bangladesh. The RPG farming system has significant impacts on inputs used in MVboro paddy production. The findings of the study indicate that more chemical fertilizers were used in per ha MV boro paddy production under YRMV paddy farming in comparison with RPG farming. Similarly, per ha cost of irrigation, pesticides and land preparation were also higher in MV boro paddy production under YRMV paddy farming system compared to RPG farming system. The inputs usage for MV boro paddy production under two farming systems showed statistically significant difference with each others. Although fewer inputs were being used in MV boro paddy production under RPG farming system, yield was higher (statistically significant) than YRP MV paddy farming system. Therefore, it could be concluded that land productivity of MV paddy production under RPG farming system was significantly higher than YRMV paddy farming system. The TFP of MV boro paddy production was higher in RPG farming system compared to YRMV paddy farming system. Moreover, the TFP varied widely within the farms between the two farming systems.";"Barmon, Basanta Kumar

"AGRIS:US201500224717";"Weed Control, Crop Response, and Profitability When Intercropping Cantaloupe and Cotton";"";"Intercropping cantaloupe and cotton can improve grower profits over traditional monoculture practices because crops share resources and production costs. However, developing effective programs to control weeds with herbicides that are safe to both crops can be challenging. Research was conducted to (1) identify herbicide systems to manage Palmer amaranth in cantaloupe–cotton intercropping production while minimizing crop injury, and (2) determine the profitability of cantaloupe–cotton intercropping. Ethalfluralin applied preplant did not injure cantaloupe or cotton, but Palmer amaranth was not controlled. The addition of fomesafen preplant improved Palmer amaranth control to at least 92% without injuring cotton, but cantaloupe necrosis and chlorosis of up to 20% was recorded. Halosulfuron-methyl was safely applied over cantaloupe, but its residual activity reduced cotton growth by 12% at 4 wk after planting; halosulfuron-methyl did not improve Palmer amaranth control beyond that noted with ethalfluralin plus fomesafen preplant. Intercropping systems that controlled Palmer amaranth at least 92% produced cantaloupe yields (25,760 to 25,890 fruit ha⁻¹) similar to the weed-free monoculture system (24,120 fruit ha⁻¹) but produced lint cotton yields that were 170 to 275 kg ha⁻¹ less than the weed-free monoculture cotton system. Although cotton production was less in the intercropping system, the returns over variable costs with intercropping systems ($21,670 to 21,920 ha⁻¹) exceeded those of cantaloupe monoculture ($18,070 ha⁻¹) or cotton monoculture ($1,890 to $1,955 ha⁻¹), as long as Palmer amaranth was controlled. Intercropping cantaloupe and cotton is an effective approach to share land resources and production inputs as well as to improve grower profitability and is being rapidly adopted by Georgia growers.Nomenclature: Ethalfluralin; fomesafen; halosulfuron-methyl; Palmer amaranth, Amaranthus palmeri S.

"AGRIS:US201400187837";"Pushing the envelope? Maize production intensification and the role of cattle manure in recovery of degraded soils in smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe";"";"Soil fertility decline is a major constraint to crop productivity on smallholder farms in Africa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term (up to nine years) impacts of nutrient management strategies and their local feasibility on crop productivity, soil fertility status and rainfall infiltration on two contrasting soil types and different prior management regimes in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. The nutrient management strategies employed in the study were: a control with no fertiliser, amendments of 100kg Nha⁻¹, 100kg N+lime, three rates of manure application (5, 15 and 25tha⁻¹) in combination with 100kg Nha⁻¹, and three rates of P fertiliser (10, 30 and 50kg Pha⁻¹) in combination with 100kg N, 20kg Ca, 5kg Zn and 10kg Mnha⁻¹. Maize grain yields in sandy soils did not respond to the sole application of 100kg Nha⁻¹; manure application had immediate and incremental benefits on crop yields on the sandy soils. A combination of 25tha⁻¹ manure and 100kg N gave the largest treatment yield of 9.3tha⁻¹ on the homefield clay soils, 6.1tha⁻¹ in the clay outfield, 7.6tha⁻¹ in the homefield and 3.4tha⁻¹ in the eighth season. Yields of the largest manure application on the sandy outfields were comparable to yields with 100kg N in combination with 30kg P, 20kg Ca, 5kg Zn and 10kg Mnha⁻¹ in the homefields suggesting the need to target nutrients differently to different fields. Manure application improved rainfall infiltration in the clay soils from 21 to 31mmh⁻¹ but on the sandy soils the manure effect on infiltration was not significant. Despite the large manure applications, crop productivity and SOC build-up in the outfield sandy soils was small highlighting the difficulty to recover the fertility of degraded soils. The major cause of poor crop productivity on the degraded sandy soils despite the large additions of manure could not be ascertained. The current practice of allocating manure and fertiliser to fields closest to homesteads exacerbates land degradation in the sandy outfields and increases soil fertility gradients but results in the most harvest for the farm. On clay soils, manure may be targeted to outfields and mineral fertiliser to homefields to increase total crop productivity. Farmers who owned cattle in the study site can achieve high manure application rates on small plots, and manure application can be rotated according to crop sequences. Consistent application of manure in combination with mineral fertilisers can be an effective option to improve crop yield, SOC and moisture conservation under smallholder farming conditions. Combined manure and mineral fertiliser application can be adapted locally as a feasible entry point for ecological intensification in mixed crop–livestock systems.";"Rusinamhodzi, Leonard

"AGRIS:US201600006409";"Cover Estimations Using Object-Based Image Analysis Rule Sets Developed Across Multiple Scales in Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands";"";"Numerous studies have been conducted that evaluate the utility of remote sensing for monitoring and assessing vegetation and ground cover to support land management decisions and complement ground measurements. However, few comparisons have been made that evaluate the utility of object-based image analysis (OBIA) to accurately classify a landscape where rule sets (models) have been developed at various scales. In this study, OBIA rule sets used to estimate land cover from high–spatial resolution imagery (0.06-m pixel) on Pinus L. (pinyon) and Juniperus L. (juniper) woodlands were developed using eCognition Developer at four scales with varying grains—1) individual plot, 2) individual sites, 3) regions (western juniper vs. Utah juniper sites), and 4) pinyon-juniper woodland network (all plots)—that were within the same study extent. Color-infrared imagery was acquired over five sites in Oregon, California, Nevada, and Utah with a Vexcel UltraCamX digital camera in June 2009. Ground cover measurements were also collected at study sites in 2009 on 80 0.1-ha plots. Correlations between OBIA and ground measurements were relatively high for individual plot and site rule sets (ranging from r = 0.52 to r = 0.98). Correlations for regional and network rule sets were lower (ranging from r = 0.24 to r = 0.63), which was expected due to radiance differences between the images as well as vegetation differences found at each site. All site and plot OBIA average cover percentage estimates for live trees, shrubs, perennial herbaceous vegetation, litter, and bare ground were within 5% of the ground measurements, and all region and network OBIA average cover percentage estimates were within 10%. The trade-off for decreased accuracy over a larger area (region and network rule sets) may be useful to prioritize management strategies but will unlikely capture subtle shifts in understory plant communities that site and plot rule sets often capture.";"Hulet, April

"AGRIS:US201500161790";"Managing landscape heterogeneity in different socio-ecological contexts: contrasting cases from central Loess Plateau of China and southern Finland";"";"CONTEXT: Landscape transition drives environmental change across the globe. However, landscape and its change are complex with high spatial heterogeneity, which challenges strategic decision-making. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to derive management meaningful units based on landscape status and change analysis and the generalization of landscape spatial heterogeneity. METHODS: Based on contrasting cases from Finland (Vanajavesi) and China (Baota District), this paper analyzed the landscape attributes and change since 2000. A k-means clustering approach was used to generalize the landscape types based on indicators of landscape composition and its change, spatial pattern, population, and income. RESULTS: Most significant change in land covers was the expansion of artificial surfaces, and the bi-directional transitions between agricultural areas and forests and semi-natural areas in Vanajavesi, while the expansion of artificial land and shrinkage of cropland were most significant in Baota District. Larger changes in landscape metrics were also observed in Baota District. Finally, three landscape clusters were generalized in both of the case areas. For each cluster, the landscapes and their change characteristics were interpreted as pertinent to the average land cover pattern and its change and socioeconomic conditions. Brief landscape management recommendations were also given for the resulting clusters. CONCLUSIONS: This paper contributes to enriching the understanding of the analysis and management of landscape spatial heterogeneity based on the information from both landscape status and change. The contrasting case analyses from an international perspective indicate the usefulness of clustering approach in accommodating spatial heterogeneity, which imply a regionalized need for landscape monitoring, assessment, and management.";"Lü, Yihe

Many methods have been developed to search for the influencing factors on land use changes at farm household level. However, these methods have difficulty in evaluating the intertwined influences between factors and achieving farmer decision rules on LUC. Taking three regions located in Jiangsu Province as the study areas, the present work proposed a data mining method, classification and regression tree (CART), to simulate farmer decisions on LUC at farm household level. The accuracy of the simulated LUC by CART was above 85.00%, indicating that the proposed method could be used to simulate farmer decisions. The simulation results also showed that farmer decision rules on LUC presented regional characteristics. In Jiangsu Province, 20 rules were inferred for LUC using 10 factors which were related to the household resources, land market, and so on. These factors were ranked in the decreased importance on LUC as labor transfer, land market, location, resources of household, and characteristics of household. In Rudong County, the which were related factors with LUC included land market, labor transfer, and household resource, while in Changshu County, the additional factor of location was involved.

"AGRIS:US201400177713";"Gender as a factor in an environmental assessment of the consumption of animal and plant-based foods in Germany";"";"PURPOSE: Due to their production intensity, different foods of animal or plant origin play a crucial role in the assessment of the environmental impacts of human nutrition and diets. Based on a representative nutrition survey in Germany from the year 2006, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to quantify nutrition-related emissions of animal and plant-based foods (excluding beverages), with a special focus on the socio-demographic factor gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the study, representative data sets concerning German food production and consumption were used. These were complemented by the Danish LCA Food database and other LCA data to analyse the impact of food imports. As regards environmental impact assessment, global warming potential (GWP) was assessed, which included emissions from direct land use change and land use (dLUC, LU), along with three inventory indicators (ammonia emissions, land use, blue water use). The following food groups were analysed from cradle-to-store and their impacts were evaluated and compared with each other: animal-based foods (meat products, milk products, egg products and fish products), plant-based foods (grain products, vegetables, fruits, potato products, margarine/oils, sugar/sweets). The reference year in the study is the year 2006. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: For all indicators, the results show strong variation between the genders. Even if the physiologically different consumption patterns among men and women are adjusted on a weight basis, men show a higher impact in terms of GWP (CO2 eq. +25%), ammonia emissions (+30%) and land use (+24%). In contrast, women demonstrate a higher water demand (+11%). These differences are primarily caused by a higher share of meat and meat products in the usual diet of men (+28%) as well as of fruit and vegetables in the diet of women (+40%). If men were to shift qualitatively to the usual diet of women, then 14.8 Mt CO2 eq. and 60.1 kt ammonia emissions could be saved annually. Within the system boundaries of our study, this would translate into a reduction of 12% of CO2 eq. and 14% of ammonia emissions. With regard to land use, this equals an area of 15,613 km2 year−1 (−11%), whereas the total blue water demand would be increased by 94 Mm3 year−1 (+7%). Limitations within this study are caused by the system boundaries cradle-to-store and are also due to the restricted set of environmental indicators which were analysed. Nonetheless, our results for GWP and land use are in keeping with previous studies. The results concerning ammonia and blue water use are limited when compared with other study results. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that within one society distinct diet profiles with markedly different environmental impacts are already established. Taking cultural and physiological considerations among the genders into account, these differences could be seen as offering potential opportunities to strengthen sustainable diet profiles. Further research should also consider health impact assessments to ensure that alterations in diet profiles due to environmental constraints do not lead to disadvantageous public health effects. Particular attention should be paid here to potentially undernourished subgroups (such as the elderly, sick people, pregnant women).";"Meier, Toni

"AGRIS:US2016203465";"Landowner response to policies regulating land improvements: lease or search for other options?";"";"Land improvements with long pay-back periods are often delayed on leased agricultural land,resulting in social costs through land degradation, decreased land productivity and environmentalproblems. An important question is thus how landowners would respond to regulations andmandates concerning land improvements. Based on a landowner survey, we analyse landownerchoices under certain land improvement regulations, using the currently dominant choice ofleasing land for agricultural use as the benchmark. The results indicated that land leasing willcontinue to increase in the future, but if the landowner mandate to co-finance costly landimprovements is increased, landowners are predicted to respond significantly to these mandatesand search for other land management options. Three heterogeneous landowner groups wereidentified based on their land use choices. Current leasers and amenity owners, in particular, weresensitive to land improvement mandates, and would avoid compulsory investment expenses byselling or afforesting their land.";"Eija, Pouta

"AGRIS:US2016203467";"Economic Liberalization and Rural Land and Labour Markets in India: A Study";"";"The paper examines the rural land and labour markets in the context of economic liberalization in India. Land and labour are the two fundamental resources available to the rural people for income generation. The access to land and to employment for labour become basic determinants of well-being for the rural households. Reforms are often seen as hostile to rural areas and the poor, although they should be beneficial not only for overall growth, but also rural growth and poverty alleviation. The study based on primary household data examines the land and labour markets in the reform period and the underlying linkages of these to different characteristics of the household. The study finds that over the reform period in India the land markets are leading to less landlessness rather than more, and growth in marginal and medium farm sizes rather than large. Lease markets are leading to operated land in more hands. Land purchase behaviour is related to less land, more education, greater crop diversification, and higher crop and livestock revenues. Leasing-in is also related to many of the same variables and is showing great diversity in lease agreements involving outputs, inputs and rent. Labour-employment is showing diversity of occupations but the primary dependence on agriculture is still about 80 percent. There has been some change in the occupational structure. Nonfarm employment is associated with higher overall employment. Own-farm employment is strongly related to crop diversification and livestock activity; other farm employment to number of male and female family members and irrigation; and non-farm employment to education. Broadly, liberalization does not show adverse consequences but rather some positive impact on rural land and labour markets.";"Gandhi, Vasant P.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"development;land;poverty";"";"";"IND";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016203467";"http://purl.umn.edu/25749";"";"";"";""

This research uses stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) to determine the preferred management strategies under various risk preferences and utility-weighted certainty equivalent risk premiums.  Yields, input rates, and field operations from an experimental field in western Kansas are used to calculate net returns for each tillage strategy.  Although current net returns to crop production using reduced tillage and no-tillage strategies are higher than CRP, risk analysis indicates CRP would be the preferred strategy for some risk-averse managers.";"Williams, Jeffery R.

This article investigates the potential of structural biophysical variables as common parameters to consistently combine multi-sensor time series and to exploit them for land/crop cover classification. Artificial neural networks were trained based on a radiative transfer model in order to retrieve high resolution LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER from Landsat-8 and SPOT-4. The correlation coefficients between field measurements and the retrieved biophysical variables were 0.83, 0.85 and 0.79 for LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER, respectively. The retrieved biophysical variables’ time series displayed consistent average temporal trajectories, even though the class variability and signal-to-noise ratio increased compared to NDVI. Six random forest classifiers were trained and applied along the season with different inputs: spectral bands, NDVI, as well as FAPAR, LAI and FCOVER, separately and jointly. Classifications with structural biophysical variables reached end-of-season overall accuracies ranging from 73%–76% when used alone and 77% when used jointly. This corresponds to 90% and 95% of the accuracy level achieved with the spectral bands and NDVI. FCOVER appears to be the most promising biophysical variable for classification. When assuming that the cropland extent is known, crop type classification reaches 89% with spectral information, 87% with the NDVI and 81%–84% with biophysical variables";"Waldner, François

"AGRIS:DJ2012062497";"Evaluation of rapeseed cultivation suitability in Apulia with GIS-multicriteria analysis";"";"The potential of land for energy crops is determined by an evaluation of biophysical and economical variables. From this respect, climate, soil and geomorphologic environmental components are the most important agro-ecological variables to conduct this kind of evaluation. In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) has been used to identify the most suitable areas for rapeseed crop production in the Apulia region. Environmental components such as climate (precipitation, temperature), soil (chemical and physical characteristics including texture, gravel percentage, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil depth, etc.), topography (slope) and economical components (farm-useful surface, mechanization, percentage of land covered by cereals and horticulture, irrigated surface, set-aside surface) were considered. Biophysical parameters (climate, geomorphology and soil) were used to draw a map of agronomic suitability of rapeseed according to the <em>Agronomic Classification of the Territory II </em>(CAT II) classification system; a map of general suitability of rapeseed in the Apulia region has been drawn with the support of multicriteria analysis, which also takes into account the economical parameters. The results from overlay maps for agronomic evaluation in the Apulia region showed that 38% (189,983 ha) of the arable land area is highly suitable (S1), 43.4% (21,6642 ha) is moderately suitable (S2), 11.9% (59,487 ha) is marginally suitable (S3) and 6.7% (33,210 ha) is and not suitable (N) for rapeseed cultivation.";"Nicola Grassano

"AGRIS:US2016212607";"The Irrational and Polyopolistic Land Use across the World: An Evolutionary Political Economy Approach to a Microeconomic Obstacle Ignored by Nobel Laureate Schultz and Nominee Hirschman";"";"Section I challenges Schultz's assertions: (1) small farmers are rational; (2) low income countries saddled with traditional agriculture have not the problem of many farmers leaving agriculture for nonfarm jobs; (3) part-time farming can be efficient; (4) economies of scale do not exist in agriculture; and (5) investment in human capital counts much more than institutional changes and is the key to agricultural growth. It reveals that ever since the 1950s, after the land reform, the irrational and polyopolistic land use by able-bodied part-time and absent (mainly small) farmers earning higher off-farm income but unwilling to lease their insufficiently produced land beyond family consumption need to full-time farmers, has evolutionarily been a global obstacle with both public and private land ownership, traditional and modern agriculture, fragmented small and consolidatorily enlarged land, low and high income economies, food under-self-sufficiency and overproduction, and developing and developed countries, albeit land property rights have been well defined and sale/lease allowed, causing many negative consequences on agriculture, rural development, income distribution, government expenditure, competition, trade, environment, etc. (Polyopoly is designed by the author to mean the control by many sellers in contrast to monopoly and oligopoly). It has become a microeconomic root of the three persisting global macroeconomic problems: under-self-sufficiency, overproduction and agricultural protectionism. Evidence in Asia, Africa, South and North Americas, and Europe is cited.Section II argues that Hirschman ignores that it has hampered the linkage effects.Section III presents that only China has successfully exercised effective and appropriate solutions, but under public land ownership which may be unacceptable to others.Section IV indicates that effective and appropriate solutions have not been adopted under private land ownership world-wide. It presents two effective (but not appropriate) Western European legislations and their shortcomings at the under-self-sufficiency stage, and fundamental and derived dilemmas at the overproduction stage at which, without a solution, the EU (and many other developed nations) has exercised protectionism by a coupling between subsidies and production (which together with price supports, export aids and import restrictions has made their farmers less competitive and harmed their consumers and taxpayers and the developing countries). In July 2002 the EU proposed a complete decoupling, but retreated in June 2003 to allow the Member States to keep the coupling, due to no solution to avoid production abandonment caused by part-time and absent landowners' refusal to lease their irrationally and polyopolistically used land to full-time farmers at low rents, which has just exposed this microeconomic root of protectionism.Section V proposes effective and appropriate solutions for both developing and developed countries at both under-self-sufficiency and overproduction stages without changing private land ownership to achieve the following aims at the same time: minimize/abolish/prevent protectionism, while avoiding production abandonment and overproduction; reinforce full-time large farmers, whereas not crowding part-time and absent small farmers out of agriculture; reach/maintain basic self-sufficiency in cereals, meanwhile promoting multi-functionality of other agricultural and rural sectors and improving the environment. Section VI predicts the promotion of fraternity among nations if the proposed solutions could be adopted globally.

"AGRIS:US201400150563";"Changing hydrologic connectivity due to permafrost thaw in the lower Liard River valley, NWT, Canada";"";"Flows from river basins in northwestern Canada have been rising in the last two decades as a result of climate warming. In the wetland‐dominated basins that characterise the southern margin of permafrost, permafrost thaw and disappearance, and resulting land‐cover change, is occurring at an unprecedented rate. The impact of this thaw on runoff generation in headwater basins is poorly understood. Permafrost thaw has the potential to fundamentally alter the cycling and storage of moisture inputs in this region by altering the type and relative proportions of the major land‐cover types, such as peat plateaus, channel fens and flat bogs. This paper examines streamflow changes in the four Water Survey of Canada gauged river basins (152–2050 km²) in the lower Liard River valley, Northwest Territories, Canada, a region where permafrost thaw has produced widespread loss of forest and concomitant expansion of permafrost‐free wetlands. Annual runoff in the lower Liard Valley increased by between 112 and 160 mm over the period of 1996–2012. The Mann‐Kendall non‐parametric statistical test and the Kendall‐Theil robust line were used to ascertain changes in streamflow. Historical aerial photographs from 1977 and high‐resolution satellite imagery (WorldView 2) from 2010 were used to measure the rate and pattern of permafrost thaw in a representative 6 km² area of Scotty Creek. Permafrost thaw‐induced land‐cover change is both increasing the adjacency between runoff producing and transmitting land cover types and transforming certain land covers that store water into ones that produce runoff. This land‐cover change was found to be the single most important factor (37–61 mm) contributing to the observed increase in river discharge. Other contributing factors include increases in plateau runoff contributing areas (20–32 mm), increases in annual effective precipitation depth (18–30 mm), contribution of water from the melt of ice within permafrost (9 mm) and increases in baseflow (0.9–6.8 mm). Although runoff has significantly (p < 0.05) increased in all four basins, the largest increases are in basins with a relatively high cover of flat bogs.

The LD definition and assessment methods are examined in the light of the most important natural and human driving forces of the phenomenon, such as land use and climate changes.Various methodological issues are dealt with from multidisciplinary perspective with the aim of providing the ground for the development of integrated approaches: monitoring needs, assessment of costs, development of mitigation strategies, etc. Factors affecting land vulnerability to degradation are classified into bio-physical and socio-economic drivers with some examples of applications in Italy. The role of determinants such as agricultural development, population growth, and urban sprawl is recognised as important but still ambiguous and thus needs further studies. Based on these findings, policy responses aimed at mitigating LD and thus reducing desertification risk are discussed and methodological proposal are presented.";"Luca Salvati

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

Over the period from 2005 through to 2012, 253 woodlots at 170 sites were sampled as part of a large multidisciplinary project, resulting in a substantial timber inventory database. The inventory was undertaken to provide information for three separate but interrelated studies, namely (1) tree growth, performance and timber availability from private smallholder woodlots on Leyte Island; (2) tree growth and performance of mixed-species plantings of native species; and (3) the assessment of reforestation outcomes from various forms of reforestation. A common procedure for establishing plots within each site was developed and applied in each study, although the basis of site selection varied. A two-stage probability proportion to size sampling framework was developed to select smallholder woodlots for inclusion in the inventory. In contrast, community-based forestry woodlots were selected using stratified random sampling. Challenges encountered in undertaking the inventory were mostly associated with the need to consult widely before the commencement of the inventory and problems in identifying woodlots for inclusion. Most smallholder woodlots were only capable of producing merchantable volumes of less than 44� % of the site potential due to a lack of appropriate silviculture. There was a clear bimodal distribution of proportion that the woodlots comprised of the total smallholding area. This bimodality reflects two major motivations for smallholders to establish woodlots, namely timber production and to secure land tenure.";"Herbohn, J. L.

This study uses three different Landsat images of 1989, 1998 and 2009 to study the land use/cover and landscape pattern changes in the middle reaches of the Tarim River basin. envi®, erdas®, ArcGIS® and fragstats® software were used to analyse the land use/cover changes. The objectives of study were to map and study the changes in land use/cover and landscape pattern, and propose some possible factors in making the land use/cover changes from 1989 to 2009. Seven different types of land use/cover are analysed, and the results are listed in tables. From 1989 to 1998, the percentage of farmland, slight–moderate saline land, heavy saline land and water areas have increased; woodland, desert and the undeveloped land have decreased. From 1998 to 2009, farmland, heavy saline land and the undeveloped land have increased; the other types of land use/cover have decreased. The gravity centre of each land use/cover types has shifted. The farthest shifting of the gravity centre was heavy saline land, which occurred between 1989 and 1998. The transformation and changes of land use/covers and landscape occurred more frequently from 1989 to 2009. Other types of land use and land cover changes to saline land have increased, which implied that a serious salinization took place in the Tarim Basin. The results from this study would show the adverse environmental changes (e.g. salinization and desertification) and they can be used for future sustainable management of land resources.

The high nature value farmlands (HNV) are characterized through three criteria: low-intensity farming, presence of residual semi-natural vegetation (hedgerows, uncultivated, shrubs, scattered trees, marginal uncultivated) and diversity of land cover mosaic; values that are often correlated with highest farmland bird diversity. In this work, we used Generalized Linear Models to evaluate the presence of different bunting species, typical of farmlands in Central Italy, as potential indicators of HNV of farmland and surrogates of landscape heterogeneity. Our results showed how the presence of bunting species is associated with markedly different environmental parameters. A species which could potentially be more useful for identifying HNV farmlands (more heterogeneous landscape, supporting also greater bird species richness) is the Cirl Bunting. The Corn Bunting and Ortolan Bunting were less predictive as indicators of farmland heterogeneity. Ortolan Bunting was unrelated to the complexity of farmlands and bird richness. This information is important for the planning of large-scale conservation policies and to increase our understanding of farmland bird indicators.";"Morelli, F.

To investigate whether this expansion has been promoted by high nitrogen deposition or by the cessation of agricultural management, grassland plots dominated by C. villosa were manipulated with four treatments: control (Con), fertilised (Fer), cut (Cut) and cut-fertilised (Cut-Fer). NH₄NO₃ was used at the rate of 30kgNha⁻¹ and fertilisation and cutting were performed once a year after data collection in late July between 2000 and 2006. Plant species composition (analysed by RDA) was significantly influenced by cutting but not by fertilisation. Cutting reduced the cover, biomass, sward height and tiller density of C. villosa. Seedlings of N. stricta and panicles of C. villosa were recorded only in plots with cutting management. To investigate the effect of treatments on the spread of C. villosa, grassland sods dominated by N. stricta were transplanted into the experimental plots. Six years later, the density and cover of C. villosa spreading into the N. stricta sods were highest in Fer treatment. C. villosa was recognised as a defoliation-sensitive species and this sensitivity cannot be overcome by an increase in N supply. Recent expansion of C. villosa in the sub-alpine grassland can by explained by a long-term succession after the cessation of agricultural management and an increase in the N availability in recent decades.";"Hejcman, Michal

Turtle doves were surveyed in the breeding seasons of 2002 and 2003, from 3160 point counts spaced at about 1-km intervals along 158 transects of about 20� km, evenly covering the country. The frequency of occurrence of turtle doves at each transect was used as a proxy of species abundance, and related using GAM modelling to 21 variables describing land cover and woody linear features (e.g., hedgerows and riparian galleries). Turtle doves were most abundant in north- and central-eastern Portugal, with high abundances also recorded in the regions around Lisbon and along the Guadiana valley. Abundances were positively related to forest cover, particularly by broadleaved forests and by pine stands without woody understory, to cover by permanent crops, and to the density of woody linear habitats. Results suggest that conservation of Mediterranean turtle doves requires policies and management strategies reversing the pervasive trends of forest management neglect and agricultural abandonment, while preserving hedgerows and riparian galleries in more intensive agricultural landscapes.";"Dias, Susana

This project explores methods suitable for use by community volunteers seeking to effect local environmental improvement by restoring geoecological self‐sustainability on lands that are commonly affected by extreme auto‐compaction and low soil nutrient status. This paper describes a formally established 7‐year experiment designed to assess the effect of three alternative tree planting strategies used in the forestation of such lands. These are notch planting (e.g. forestry), pit planting (e.g. parks and gardens) and trench planting (e.g. orchard terraces). The study explores tree survival and growth for two species commonly used in land reclamation contexts: alder [Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn] and Welsh or Durmast Oak [Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl]. t‐testing of the results shows that survival and growth rates for both species tend to be significantly better for trench planting than for pit planting than for notch planting. Differences in mortality between pit‐planted and trench‐planted trees become less significant during the experiment while differences in growth increase with time. The conclusion is that providing a loosened, lower density, rooting substrate significantly improves both the growth and the survival rates of trees planted in compacted Welsh surface coal‐mine spoils and that trench planting is more effective than parks and gardens‐style pit planting, which is more effective than forestry‐style notch planting.

As the U.S. and other economies have grown, the carrying-capacity of the planet - in regard to natural resources and environmental quality — has become a greater concern, particularly for common-property and open-access resources. The focus of this article is on some important, unsettled problems of the commons. Within the realm of natural resources, there are special challenges associated with renewable resources, which are frequently characterized by open access. An important example is the degradation of open-access fisheries. Critical commons problems are also associated with environmental quality. A key contribution of economics has been the development of market-based approaches to environmental protection.

We used analysis of variance to test whether metrics differed between years or between other variables and used non-metric multidimensional scaling to examine compositional differences among samples and the environmental variables that were most associated with these differences. Metrics primarily varied on a seasonal basis, largely reflecting life history patterns of dominant groups such as chironomids and the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera orders. Variation between the time periods generally reflected atypically high abundance of chironomids in the spring of 1999/2000, but we did not observe reduced community quality between the earlier and later survey periods. Taxonomic composition was most related to seasonal differences and to the land cover characteristics of the study sites. No long-term compositional changes were evident, but water quality variables did not clearly differ and changes in land cover were slight between the survey periods. Reference stream conditions remained as indicative of high environmental quality in the later samples as in the earlier samples.";"Scott, Casey G.

For last decades, landscape has gradually become a stake of land use planning in Europe. The European Landscape Convention formalizes landscape as an issue of general interest and promotes a democratic landscape planning. However, landscape is rarely in practice the subject of pluridisciplinary and concerted approaches. So land use planning searches for a landscape concept able to gather together the various disciplinary and societal points of view. This federative concept can help it to build concerted policies of landscape planning. To question about and clarify nature, scale and ways of reading of landscape then enable us to develop a landscape concept that holds two positions in land use planning. Firstly, landscape as we define it constitutes a stake of land use planning in line with its pluridisciplinary and concerted approach.

With rapid increase of urban stream rehabilitation projects in developing countries, the concept of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (PAR) has become a highlight in evaluating river ecosystem improvement. In this study the Comprehensive Index of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (CIPAR) that consists of 4 sub-indexes and 12 indicators is designed for assessing the conditions of PAR. The index system is novel for its combined consideration of riverfront accessibilities and benefits. These four sub-indexes measure (1) spatial accessibility reflecting riverfront openness and main transportation convenience, (2) visual accessibility reflecting visual field openness, (3) corridor continuity reflecting riverfront vegetation condition, water-oriented settings, and spatial continuity, and (4) amenity reflecting comfortable experience of riverfront environment and diversity of riverfront activities. Based on the questionnaire and field data collected during March 1–15, 2011, 24 reaches of the Suzhou Creek and its distributaries were assessed with CIPAR, and the urban riverfront after rehabilitation was quantified. The result showed that most of the reaches of Suzhou Creek still suffered a poor–fair PAR condition, and that among the four sub-indexes, visual accessibility got the lowest score with an average score of 0.7. The unsatisfactory PAR condition along the Suzhou Creek mainly resulted from the failure in synchronizing the planning and management of riverfront land uses and river channels in previous phase of the rehabilitation project. This case study supports the use of CIPAR to assess the effectiveness of riverfront rehabilitation project.";"Che, Yue

This OSSE is implemented to study the errors related to the use of simple retrieval models in passive microwave applications. To this end, a theoretical forward model was introduced, which is suitable to reproduce some of the complexities related to canopy vegetation scattering. So far, this OSSE has been successfully exploited to study the artifacts in the retrieved soil moisture associated to: 1) uncertainties and aggregation of the ancillary parameters needed for the retrieval, and 2) instrumental noise effects. In this paper, we attempt to model the influence of this “model asymmetry” (different forward and inverse model) in the estimated soil moisture. These asymmetries are related to the fact that the emissivity of real surfaces is complex and strongly dependent on land cover type and condition. In particular, surface covered by average to dense vegetation presents complex scattering properties, related to canopy structure. Using this theoretical model, the difficulties related to retrieving soil moisture from passive data with a simple model are studied. The accuracy of the soil moisture estimation is analyzed in order to illustrate the impact of discrepancies between both models. In general, retrieved soil moisture performs worse over dense vegetated areas and under wet conditions. Furthermore, accuracy is highly dependent on land cover.";"Bruscantini, Cintia A.

Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs “traditional conserved forests” (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes “government conserved forests” (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts “community conserved forests” (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.";"Nautiyal, Sunil

Nevertheless, unlike protection of existing areas, restoration changes existing land use and can therefore be more controversial. Some restoration projects negatively affect surrounding landowners, creating social constraints to restoration success. Just as negative off-site impacts (i.e., negative externalities) flow from industrial areas to natural areas, restoration projects can generate negative externalities for commercial land uses, such as agriculture. Negative externalities from industry have led to government regulation to prevent human health and environmental impacts. Negative externalities from restoration projects have elicited similar legal constraint on at least one large-scale conservation project, riparian restoration in the Sacramento River Conservation Area. The negative externalities of restoration that are perceived to be the direct result of specific goals, such as endangered species management, are likely to be more contentious than externalities arising from unintended phenomena such as weed invasion. Restoration planners should give equal consideration to off-site characteristics as to on-site characteristics when choosing sites for restoration and designing projects. Efforts to control externalities can lead to off-site ecological benefits.";"BUCKLEY, MARK C.

A comparative analysis of five small‐scale Latin American shellfisheries was conducted to identify factors suggesting success and failure. In Chile, Uruguay and Mexico Co‐M produced positive effects, including stabilization of landings at low levels, increase in abundance, CPUE, unit prices and revenues per unit of effort, and reduced interannual variability in several fishery indicators, particularly in landings. Co‐M was successful because it was mainly bottom‐up implemented and accompanied by‐catch shares (spatial property rights and community quotas). By contrast, Co‐M implementation was unable to prevent the collapse of the Galapagos sea cucumber fishery, as reflected by a decrease in abundance and CPUE. Negative effects were also observed in the Galapagos spiny lobster fishery during Co‐M implementation. However, recovery was observed in recent years, reflected in a stabilization of fishing effort and the highest CPUE and economic revenues observed since the beginning of the Co‐M implementation phase. The combined effects of market forces, climate variability and a moratorium on fishing effort were critical in fishery recovery. We conclude that Co‐M is not a blueprint that can be applied to all shellfisheries to enhance their governability. These social–ecological systems need to be managed by jointly addressing problems related to the resources, their marine environment and the people targeting them, accounting for their socioeconomic and cultural contexts.";"Defeo, Omar

Data from large-scale bird and butterfly monitoring schemes in the north-east Iberian Peninsula were used to evaluate the impact that land abandonment has had on local biodiversity. Speciesâ habitat preferences, along a gradient from open to forest habitats, were significantly related to population trends: for both birds and butterflies, open-habitat species showed the most marked declines while forest species increased moderately. Multi-species indicators for tracking the impact of land abandonment on bird and butterfly populations were developed using habitat preference estimates and population trend indices. The patterns shown by these indicators were in line with the changes occurring in forest cover in the monitoring sites. This study reveals that multi-species indicators based on monitoring data from different taxonomic groups (here, birds and butterflies) may usefully be employed to track impacts of environmental change on biodiversity.";"HERRANDO, SERGI

"AGRIS:US201400018272";"Birds, beasts and bovines: three cases of pastoralism and wildlife in the USA";"";"BACKGROUND: Pastoralism in the USA began coincidently with the initiation of profound ecological change resulting from colonization in the sixteenth century. Relationships between pastoralism and wildlife conservation in three different contexts of land tenure, environmental legacy, and geography are examined. RESULTS: On the federal rangelands of the Intermountain West, based on limited scientific information, wildlife policy has been interpreted to require separation of native bighorn sheep from livestock to prevent disease transmission. Ignored are the possible long term and broad scale impacts of removing grazing on the ecosystem and the ‘social disturbance’ to local communities. In southwestern deserts, the implementation of wildlife policy exemplifies the contradictions between conservation of individuals versus populations, and fire suppression and grazing removal as ‘inactions’ requiring no review versus grazing and burning as ‘actions’ requiring regulation and control. In California’s Mediterranean rangeland, wildlife policy under the Endangered Species Act is at once a regulatory burden and an opportunity for ranchers. The opportunities result from an evolving recognition that cessation of grazing can harm wildlife. CONCLUSIONS: In all three cases, the environment has changed and is changing due to ecosystem engineering that alters the resources available to wildlife and plant species. Grazing offers potential benefits as a management tool, and pastoralism a means of maintaining un-fragmented landscapes. Yet, absent adequate ecological information, the assumptions of innate conflict between livestock and wildlife, and that cessation of grazing is not an action, as well as the norms of a politically popular yet ecologically unsupportable discourse of restoration, fill in the gaps.";"Huntsinger, Lynn

As an alternative to resource-intensive field-based methods to obtain such information, remotely sensed products can be utilized in species distribution models to infer a species’ distribution and ecological needs. Here we demonstrate how to arbitrate among a variety of remotely sensed predictor variables to estimate the distribution and ecological needs of an endangered butterfly species occurring mainly in inaccessible areas. We classified 19 continuous environmental predictor variables into three conceptually independent predictor classes, terrain, land cover, and vertical vegetation structure, and compared the accuracy of competing Maxent habitat models consisting of different combinations of each class. Each class contributed, though disproportionately, to our most reliable model that considered all 19 variables. We confirm that variables obtained from remote sensors can effectively estimate the distribution and ecological needs of a relatively unknown imperiled species occurring in inaccessible locations. Importantly, increasing the variety of predictor classes through multi-sensor fusion resulted in greater model accuracy than increasing the absolute number of predictor variables.";"Wilson, John W.

"AGRIS:US201300950657";"Comparison of 2 techniques for monitoring vegetation on military lands";"";"The U.S. Army is responsible for preparing a well-trained combat force while maintaining the ecological diversity and integrity of the lands it manages. The ability to efficiently collect data that accurately capture plant community diversity and percent composition is imperative to proper monitoring and land management of military lands. To ensure that the dual goals of military training and land stewardship are met on an army-wide basis, the U.S. Army Land Condition-Trend Analysis (LCTA) Program was developed. The LCTA Program specifies the Army's standard methodology for the collection, analysis, and reporting of natural resource data used for land inventory and monitoring. However, the LCTA sampling technique was developed in Colorado and Texas and little information is available on whether these methods are suitable for vegetation inventory and monitoring in other grassland ecosystems. This study compares LCTA measures of species richness and composition with quadrat sampling in the transitional area between the tall- and mixed-grass prairies of Camp Gilbert C. Grafton (South Unit) in North Dakota. Species richness was 67% higher when sampling with quadrats than using the LCTA technique, suggesting that LCTA samples did not detect a third of the plants present. Compared with the quadrat technique, LCTA samples overestimated the community contribution of Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Steud. (blue grama) and underestimated proportions of forbs and sedges. Moreover, LCTA samples are labor intensive and time consuming to collect. Other sampling methods may be needed to detect shifts in species composition towards a less desirable plant community or decreases in biodiversity that may be due to land-use. Thus, it is important for Camp Gilbert C. Grafton (South Unit) to re-evaluate the current standard methodology for monitoring the impacts of military training. Since military installations are located in many different ecosystems, it may be necessary for other installations to likewise examine the usefulness of LCTA techniques in their ecosystems.";"Prosser, C.W.

In this context, the development of effective methods for the classification of forest types constitutes a crucial issue as forests represent the most widespread vegetation structure and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. In this study a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important variables in the produced models. Moreover the comparison with a spectral response-based fuzzy classification, showed a higher accuracy in the Maxent outputs, demonstrating how the use of environmental variables, combined with spectral information in the classification of natural or semi-natural land cover classes, improves map accuracies. The modeling approach followed by this study, taking into account the uncertainty proper of the natural ecosystems and the use of environmental variables in land cover classification, can represent a useful approach to making more efficient and effective field inventories and to developing effective conservation policies.";"Amici, Valerio";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400143095";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.07.001";"";"";"";"371-383"
"AGRIS:US201301913567";"Does plantation forestry restore biodiversity or create green deserts? A synthesis of the effects of land-use transitions on plant species richness";"";"Plantations are established for a variety of reasons including wood production, soil and water conservation, and more recently, carbon sequestration. The effect of this growing land-use change on biodiversity, however, is poorly understood and considerable debate exists as to whether plantations are ‘green deserts' or valuable habitat for indigenous flora and fauna. This paper synthesizes peer-reviewed articles that provide quantitative data on plant species richness in plantations and paired land uses, most often representative of pre-plantation land cover. The results of this synthesis suggest that the value of plantations for biodiversity varies considerably depending on whether the original land cover is grassland, shrubland, primary forest, secondary forest, or degraded or exotic pasture, and whether native or exotic tree species are planted. The results of this study suggest that plantations are most likely to contribute to biodiversity when established on degraded lands rather than replacing natural ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and shrublands, and when indigenous tree species are used rather than exotic species. These findings can help guide afforestation and reforestation programs, including those aimed at increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration.";"Bremer, Leah L.

The main premise of the programme is to address the racially skewed land distribution pattern inherited at independence in 1980. While the programme has been accompanied by an overall reduction in agricultural production which has created widespread food insecurity throughout the country, empirical research on the impact of the programme on the agricultural productivity of its beneficiaries has been limited. This paper uses data on beneficiaries of the programme and a control group of communal farmers to (i) investigate the presence of agricultural productivity differences between beneficiaries and communal farmers, and (ii) examine differences in chemical fertiliser use as a possible source of these differences. The results suggest that FTLRP beneficiaries gain a productivity advantage not only from the fact that they use more fertiliser per hectare, but also from attaining a higher rate of return from its use.";"Zikhali, P.

"AGRIS:US201400184585";"marginal product value of irrigation water for potato and vine cultivation in the Sandveld region, South Africa";"";"The advent of grid electrification in the Sandveld region of South Africa in the 1980s increased the utilisation of groundwater resources for commercial irrigation purposes. In the wake of the consequent increased pressure on the resource, it behooves landowners to use water more productively and responsibly. This paper calculated the marginal product value (MPV) of irrigation water for potatoes and vine production in this region to assess and to allow the comparison of the productivity of irrigation water with other commodities and regions. However, the results suggested that the scope for leveraging changes to water use behaviour in the Sandveld solely through water pricing is limited. Given that electricity is a critical input for the utilization of groundwater, we suspect that the price of electricity would be a suitable lever to influence irrigation behaviour. In light of the imminent Government electricity price hikes, we advise some further investigation on the impacts these impending hikes will have on irrigation farming in the study area. We suspect that pumping costs (as opposed to the price of water itself) will become the most limiting factor for irrigation water use in the Sandveld in the foreseeable future. A mixture of water and energy pricing strategies therefore lends itself as a more pragmatic policy approach to follow in order to influence irrigation behaviour, as opposed to a sole focus on water pricing.";"de Lange, W.J.

"AGRIS:US201300788748";"Spatial based compromise programming for multiple criteria decision making in land use planning";"";"Today, competing land use is continuing to occur in many developed regions. In the Agricultural Development Zone of Western Sydney Region, which is characterised by complex landscape patterns, land use competition is widespread. From a land use planning perspective, identification of suitable locations for a given type of land use is necessary for decision makers to formulate land use alternatives in different locations, based on existing land potential and constraints. For such a region, use of a simple method that implements a categorical system and considers only inherent land characteristics in the analysis is often inadequate to arrive at an optimal spatial decision. The primary aim of this paper is to develop spatial modelling procedures for agricultural land suitability analysis using compromise programming (CoPr) and fuzzy set approach within a geographical information systems (GIS) environment. Five main sets of spatial data for use as decision criteria were developed by using fuzzy set methodology: a land suitability index (LSI) for maximising the land productivity objective; an erosion tolerance index (ETI) for minimising the erosion risk objective; a runoff curve number (CN) for maximising the water discharge regulation objective; an accessibility (RP) measure for maximising the land accessibility objective; and the proximity to water body (WP) for minimising the water pollution objective. An L p -metric was used in the analysis utilising different strategies with representative indices ranging from a situation where full tradeoff among criteria occurs to a noncompensatory condition. Different weighting combinations were also applied, and decision analysis was carried out by using values ranging from 0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is considered as an ideal point. The CoPr model demonstrated in this paper yielded a promising result, as several different techniques of sensitivity analysis show reasonably good results. Likewise, an overlay of that result with the present land use/land cover indicates a good corresponding spatial matching between existing land use (orchard and cultivated land), and the cells (land parcels) classified as the best in CoPr. The results are amenable to various map display techniques, either using continuous values or by defining different cut off points in the data space within a raster GIS environment.";"Baja, Sumbangan

It is difficult to evaluate the long-term, cumulative effects and tradeoffs these and other associated management objectives. To demonstrate the capabilities of techniques suitable to support such evaluations we combined a spatially explicit landscape-scale, succession and disturbance model (LANDIS) with wildlife habitat suitability models and a multi-criteria decision-making framework to compare four management alternatives across a 700km² area of the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri, USA. We estimated the combined, cumulative effects of tree species succession, fire disturbance, fuel accumulation, fire hazard, wind disturbance and timber harvest on future species composition, age class distribution, timber products, and wildlife habitat suitability for eastern wild turkey and eastern gray squirrel. We applied a structured, multi-criteria, decision-making framework (PROMETHEE) to analyse forest conditions and to derive weighted composite scores for seven criteria applied to each alternative management scenario. The approach provides a systematic, repeatable, transparent, spatially explicit framework for evaluating the long-term, landscape-scale cumulative effects of management alternatives. The methodology does not encompass all the factors that influence decisions about public land management, but it captures many important ones. The underlying models provide a way to test and accumulate knowledge about forest response to succession and disturbance and to use those relationships to support decision making with the best available science.";"Shang, ZongBo

In general, we observed that the mean and particularly the standard deviation of the backscatter were viable measures to discriminate land cover classes. Both measures were lowest for water bodies and highest for built-up areas, with agricultural areas and forest in intermediate positions. Trees outside forest were not differentiable from forest with the applied method. The HH-polarised image was better suited for a classification of built-up areas, whereas the VV-polarised image was more appropriate when classifying agricultural areas. Consequently, the combination of the two differently polarised images leads to a significantly better model. Since forests in one study area were generally found on steeper slopes in comparison to other land cover classes, the inclusion of terrain slope further improved the classification, which resulted in an overall accuracy of 92-95%. Systematic differences in the parameter values of the explanatory variables for one class between the study areas may be caused by differing class probabilities. Thus, transferring the model of one study area to the image of another resulted in a 7-9% loss of accuracy.";"Breidenbach, Johannes

"AGRIS:US2016210350";"How Smart Should Farms Be Modeled? Behavioral Foundation of Bidding Strategies in Agent-Based Land Market Models";"";"Land markets play a crucial role in agricultural structural change. Because the dynamics of structural change and land markets, respectively, mainly depend on the interactions between individual farms, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been established as a tool for understanding and explaining structural change and land market dynamics. This is particularly so because of ABM's ability to capture heterogeneity, non-convexity and dynamics. Unfortunately, the behavioral foundation of economic actors in ABM, i.e., of the farms, is often specified as ad hoc or simply based on ""expert knowledge"". In this contribution, the highly-detailed ABM AgriPoliS - which uses a myopic normative behavioral foundation - is coupled with a genetic algorithm (GA) to detect market equilibria on a land market. This is done in the dynamic context of the model and its heterogeneous, non-convex production functions. This approach enables the creation of a benchmark with a sound economic foundation for evaluating alternative behavioral patterns. As results illustrate, forming a rational strategy requires bidders that are able to anticipate size effects and their growth potential in a competitive situation. Moreover, the contribution shows that reaching the market equilibrium would imply ""aggressive"" bidding strategies.";"Kellermann, Konrad

Only a few land-cover categories were accurately discriminated using spectral information exclusively, with an overall accuracy of 0.56 and a kappa coefficient of 0.51. The inclusion of topographic information as additional bands provided higher overall accuracy (0.69) and kappa coefficient (0.65) than topographic correction (overall accuracy, 0.57–0.58; kappa coefficient range, 0.52–0.53), which failed to markedly improve classification accuracy. In contrast with the exclusive use of spectral bands, most of the included land-cover categories were correctly classified using textural features exclusively (overall accuracy, 0.67–0.88; kappa coefficient, 0.63–0.87). In particular, classification based on geostatistical features led to slightly more accurate results than did grey-level co-occurrence matrix parameters. The window size selected for texture calculation markedly affected the texture-based classification accuracy: larger window size yielded higher classification accuracy. However, no optimal window size exists. The inclusion of the topographic bands in the texture images led to an increase in the overall accuracy of 1.1–9.0%, and to an increase in the kappa coefficient of 0.0–10.9%. Thus, for the Nujiang Grand Canyon, topographic information was more important for the discrimination of some land-cover types than spectral and textural information. Among the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral bands, bands 6 and 4 were of greatest importance. The relative importance of textural features generally increased with window size, and a few textural features were of consistently high importance. Although a random forest classifier does not overfit, undertaking feature selection analysis prior to classification may still be valuable.";"Fan, Hui";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400169090";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.820366";"";"";"";"7545-7567"

In this study, a diurnal temperature cycle genetic algorithm (DTC-GA) approach was used to generate the hourly 1 km land-surface temperature (LST) by integrating multi-source satellite data. Diurnal variations of the UHI in ‘ideal’ weather conditions in the city of Beijing were examined. Results show that the DTC-GA approach was applicable for generating the hourly 1 km LSTs. In the summer diurnal cycle, the city experienced a weak UHI effect in the early morning and a significant UHI effect from morning to night. In the diurnal cycles of the other seasons, the city showed transitions between a significant UHI effect and weak UHI or urban heat sink effects. In all diurnal cycles, daytime UHIs varied significantly but night-time UHIs were stable. Heating/cooling rates, surface energy balance, and local land use and land cover contributed to the diurnal variations in UHI. Partial analysis shows that diurnal temperature range had the most significant influence on UHI, while strong negative correlations were found between UHI signature and urban and rural differences in the normalized difference vegetation index, albedo, and normalized difference water index. Different contributions of surface characteristics suggest that various strategies should be used to mitigate the UHI effect in different seasons.";"Zhou, Ji

Exploring perceptions not only gives us insight into decision-making (agency) but also reveals structural constraints influencing those decisions (including perceived constraints). This study focuses on the human–nature dynamics of Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) in China, a biodiversity hotspot and the only habitat for the Guizhou golden monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi). The monkey is endangered and increasingly threatened by growing human activity and development but is also affected by changing habitat through reforestation programs. This research aims to understand how human demographics, a recent reforestation program (Grain-to-Green), land use, livelihood, and perception of conservation may affect local people's perception of human impact on the environment. This perception underlies many land use decisions yet is not uniformly shared among FNNR inhabitants. Using logistic regression, the data from a 263-household survey conducted in the spring of 2010 were analyzed. The results indicate the Grain-to-Green Program participation is insignificantly related to perception of human environmental impact. However, personal observation of the golden monkey is vital to locals reporting an enhanced appreciation for potential human environmental impacts. Other significant factors predicting sensitivity to human environmental impacts include having heard of climate change, interest in tourism entrepreneurship, current worries of food security, viewing FNNR regulations as restrictive, income source, and fuelwood consumption. Results suggest the importance of examining environmental perception for a more integrated understanding of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS).";"Wandersee, Sarah M.

Household factors such as age, and post primary education positively influenced farmers' decision to abandon plots. Therefore, more fallows and abandoned terraces were common with older farmers compared to younger ones. However, farm size and household type had no significant influence on abandonment of plots. Plot variables such as slope and plot distance had the expected positive signs while soil fertility had a significant negative sign as predicted. Two types of interventions are recommended. Those aimed at highly cultivable, moderate slopes and those aimed at uncultivable and fragile areas. For the former, the probability of adoption and intensity of use of appropriate agrobased interventions is likely to be very high. The latter require specific interventions that are profitable and yet allowing farmers to keep the land under cover for a very long time.

The Law 'On Administrative-Territorial Division Project of local governments' was carried in 2006 but rules on administrative division of local governments were issued in 2008. According to the law on Administrative-territorial reform, it is envisaged to implement administrative territorial reform of the municipalities till election of local municipalities in June 2009 (deadline - 31 January, 2009). Its’ aim is to form administrative territories with local governments able to develop independently which would secure qualitative service to population.

Aboriginal Australian hunting fires have been hypothesized to buffer such variability, mitigating mortality on small-mammal populations, which have suffered declines and extinctions in the arid zone coincident with Aboriginal depopulation. We test the hypothesis that the relationship between climate and fire size is buffered through the maintenance of an anthropogenic, fine-grained fire regime by comparing the effect of climatic variability on landscapes dominated by Martu Aboriginal hunting fires with those dominated by lightning fires. We show that Aboriginal fires are smaller, more tightly clustered, and remain small even when climate variation causes huge fires in the lightning region. As these effects likely benefit threatened small-mammal species, Aboriginal hunters should be considered trophic facilitators, and policies aimed at reducing the risk of large fires should promote land-management strategies consistent with Aboriginal burning regimes.";"Bliege Bird, Rebecca

"AGRIS:US201400037831";"Arid old-field restoration: Native perennial grasses suppress weedsand erosion, but also suppress native shrubs";"";"Rates of cropland abandonment in arid regions are increasing, and abandoned fields in such regions can have low levels of ecosystem function and biodiversity. Long-lived, drought-tolerant shrubs are dominant components of many arid ecosystems, providing multiple ecosystem services such as soil stabilization, herbaceous plant facilitation, carbon storage and wildlife habitat. On abandoned agricultural fields, shrub restoration is hindered by multiple challenges, including erosion, water stress and invasive species. We hypothesized that applying short-term irrigation and seeding native perennial grasses would facilitate native shrub establishment by reducing erosion and weed abundance. Using a blocked split-plot design, we evaluated the separate and combined impacts of short-term irrigation and perennial grass seeding on five-year restoration outcomes (including direct measurements of wind erosion) at two former agricultural fields in North America’s arid Great Basin. After two years, irrigation had increased the density and biomass of seeded grasses by more than ten-fold. The combination of irrigation and seeded grasses was associated with significantly lower wind erosion, weed density and weed biomass. Three years after irrigation ended, seeded grasses remained significantly more abundant in formerly irrigated than non-irrigated plots. Formerly irrigated plots also had significantly less bare ground, annual plant cover and weed biomass than non-irrigated plots. Large plant-canopy gaps were fewer in irrigated and seeded plots. Although seeded grasses reduced erosion and invasion, they failed to facilitate native shrub establishment. Shrub cover and density were highest in plots that had been drill-seeded and irrigated, but lacked perennial grasses. Our results indicate that short-term irrigation has persistent restoration benefits, and that a tradeoff exists between the benefits and costs of seeding perennial grasses into degraded arid shrubland sites.";"Porensky, Lauren M.

"AGRIS:US201300755605";"Spatial and temporal analysis of vegetation change in agricultural landscapes: A case study of two brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) landscapes in Queensland, Australia";"";"The majority of landscapes around the world have been modified or transformed by human activities to meet the needs of human societies. The loss of native vegetation for agricultural development affects the sustainability of growing proportion of the world's ecosystems. Factors such as land tenure, roads and agricultural intensification, together with biophysical properties, have been cited as drivers of deforestation. This paper combined analysis of the historical drivers of change with analysis of the trends of deforestation since 1945 in two brigalow landscapes (100,000 ha) in sub-tropical Australia. A selection of these drivers were then applied at a property-level (1000 ha) to test their influence on native vegetation retention. Regression trees were used to identify significant human drivers and biophysical properties, and then a generalised linear modelling approach was used to quantify the effect of these factors on the proportion of remnant native vegetation. Results showed that until the mid-20th century, government policies to intensify settlement did not result in increased agricultural production, but since this time, landscape change has been rapid, and has particularly affected ecosystems on fertile clay soils. Although socio-economic factors were critical in driving deforestation, after 60 years of agricultural intensification by far the most significant explanatory variable determining the proportion of native vegetation retained at a property scale was the suitability of the soil for agriculture. Property size was an important secondary influence. The results were not, by and large, consistent with other studies of landscape change and suggest that generalised principles explaining deforestation may be elusive. Solutions to the problem of over-clearance of native vegetation, therefore, need to be tailored to the specific regional situations encountered.";"Seabrook, L.

Emergy analysis is an effective method for value analysis of ecosystems, assessment of the health of ecosystems, which is based on principles of systems ecology and energy. And fuzzy logic is a generalization tools to operate with vaguely defined parameters or concepts, which has been extensively applied in the quality evaluation of soil and land. The health of agricultural land as an aggregate that takes into account the quality and productivity of land as well as the soil environment. This paper presents an integrated evaluation model based on emergy analysis and fuzzy logic and using the geographic information system (GIS) to evaluate the health of agricultural land. An evaluation system is developed, which includes quality, productivity and the soil environment. A major grain-producing region in the North China Plain, namely Luancheng County, was selected for the case study. Field survey, household inquiry, sampling, and experimental analysis were conducted in the study area. The health of agricultural land expressed as the emergy index ranged from 0.471 to 0.763; as the fuzzy index, from 0.603 to 0.878; and as a composite index, from 0.284 to 0.666. Based on the composite index, the agricultural land was divided into four classes, namely in perfect health (which accounted for 7.6% of the agricultural land), in normal health (54.3%), in sub-health (32.9%), and in poor health (5.2%). Overall, agricultural land in Luancheng County is healthy, although 89.00km² of the farmland – mainly in Douyu, Nangao, and Liulintun – is in sub-health and 14.22km² in Douyu is in poor health because of poor productivity and unfavorable soil environment.";"Li, Qiang

Here, we examine the Sloping Land Conversion Program, the largest such program in the world and found that after 13� years of implementation at our study site, it has had negative impacts on natural tropical forests. GIS and remote sensing techniques revealed that both natural forests and natural shrub and grasslands were replaced by non-native monocultural plantations on Hainan Island, China, a key tropical biodiversity hotspot. Under current Chinese policy, these plantations are classified simply as “forests”, with the assumption that they are equivalent to natural forests. This lack of a distinction in forest quality has led to substantial deforestation and plantation expansion, including encroachment into protected areas on Hainan. Additional social and economic drivers of these changes were identified by examining the participants in this program and their actions. Without a new ecologically based definition of forests and new goals for reforestation, such programs designed to improve ecosystem services, and forest quality may actually threaten remaining natural forests and other vegetation types in Hainan and in other areas of mainland China.";"Zhai, De-Li

Although the reform measures have been specific about surface water, there still is ambiguity on the groundwater situation in India. The reforms have failed to de-link the conventional linkages between right to land and right to (ground) water. Most policy reforms have been in response to the emerging crisis of water allocation, use and management. The current perspective towards water has been holistic in nature in contrast to the excessive importance to technoengineering approach that characterized the earlier period of water sector. Further, there have been changes acknowledging the rights of farmers, women and end-users as stakeholders in the whole process of water governance. In this regards, the policy changes have proceeded hand in hand with other reforms in decentralized governance, providing greater emphasis on user participation in decision making concerning water governance.";"Rout, S.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"water rights;property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IND";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QL2012002267";"http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H042926.pdf";"";"";"";""

In the past decades climate versus land use management have dramatically increase both the soil loss rate and the muddy-flooding frequency. In this paper the impact of global change on soil production rates and erosion/deposition dynamics at medium-time scale (1949–2000) for two permanent gullies (Fosso Lavandaio and Fosso San Teodoro) has been studied. Pluviometric regime, land use changes and multi-temporal (1949, 1986 and 2000) subtraction method of digital elevation models have been conducted. From 1949 to 1986 the sediment production rate was estimated in 1,988.43 Mg ha−1 year−1 at Fosso Lavandaio and in 808.5 Mg ha−1 year−1 at Fosso San Teodoro, with deposition prevailing over erosion processes. From 1986 to 2000 the sediment production rate was estimated in 2,487.92 Mg ha−1 year−1 at Fosso Lavandaio and in 2,883.9 Mg ha−1 year−1 at Fosso San Teodoro, with higher values of net erosion. The data confirm that the increase in sedimentation would be due to human activities, in particular the levelling of gully heads for the production of cereals and orchards. Differently, the increase of the erosion processes depends on the recent changes of the pluviometric regime characterized by the extension of dry horizon and the concentration of high magnitude precipitation in macro-events of three to four consecutive days.";"Piccarreta, M.

"AGRIS:US201300751943";"Stream ecosystem responses to spatially variable land cover: an empirically based model for developing riparian restoration strategies";"";"1. The restoration of native, forested riparian habitats is a widely accepted method for improving degraded streams. Little is known, however, about how the width, extent and continuity of forested vegetation along stream networks affect stream ecosystems. 2. To increase the likelihood of achieving restoration goals, restoration practitioners require quantitative tools to guide the development of restoration strategies in different catchment settings. We present an empirically based model that establishes a relationship between a 'stress' imposed at different locations along a stream by the spatial pattern of land cover within catchments, and the response of biologically determined ecosystem characteristics to this stress. The model provides a spatially explicit, quantitative framework for predicting the effects of changes in catchment land cover composition and spatial configuration on specific characteristics of stream ecosystems. 3. We used geospatial datasets and biological data for attached algae and benthic macroinvertebrates in streams to estimate model parameters for 40 sites in 33 distinct catchments within the mid-Atlantic Piedmont region of the eastern U.S. Model parameters were estimated using a genetic optimisation algorithm. R² values for the resulting relationships between catchment land cover and biological characteristics of streams were substantially improved over R² values for spatially aggregated regression models based on whole-catchment land cover. 4. Using model parameters estimated for the mid-Atlantic Piedmont, we show how the model can be used to guide restoration planning in a case study of a small catchment. The model predicts the quantitative change in biological characteristics of the stream, such as indices of species diversity and species composition, that would occur with the implementation of a hypothetical restoration project.";"JOHNSON, THOMAS E.

"AGRIS:US201400103974";"Rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility zonation of Puerto Rico";"";"Landslides are a major geologic hazard with estimated tens of deaths and $1–2 billion in economic losses per year in the US alone. The island of Puerto Rico experiences one or two large events per year, often triggered in steeply sloped areas by prolonged and heavy rainfall. Identifying areas susceptible to landslides thus has great potential value for Puerto Rico and would allow better management of its territory. Landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) procedures identify areas prone to failure based on the characteristics of past events. LSZs are here developed based on two widely applied methodologies: bivariate frequency ratio (FR method) and logistic regression (LR method). With these methodologies, the correlations among eight possible landslide-inducing factors over the island have been investigated in detail. Both methodologies indicate aspect, slope, elevation, geological discontinuities, and geology as highly significant landslide-inducing factors, together with land-cover for the FR method and distance from road for the LR method. The LR method is grounded in rigorous statistical testing and model building but did not improve results over the simpler FR method. Accordingly, the FR method has been selected to generate a landslide susceptibility map for Puerto Rico. The landslide susceptibility predictions were tested against previous landslide analyses and other landslide inventories. This independent evaluation demonstrated that the two methods are consistent with landslide susceptibility zonation from those earlier studies and showed this analysis to have resulted in a robust and verifiable landslide susceptibility zonation map for the whole island of Puerto Rico.";"Lepore, Chiara

We present discharge simulations with the conceptual precipitation–runoff model COSERO in 11 basins located under different climates in Europe, Africa and Australia. All of the basins exhibit some form of non-stationary conditions, due, for example, to warming, droughts or land-cover change. The evaluation of the daily discharge simulations focuses on the overall model performance and its decomposition into three components measuring temporal dynamics, mean flow volume and distribution of flows. Calibration performance is similarly high as in previous COSERO applications. However, when looking at evaluation periods independent of the calibration, the model performance drops considerably, mainly due to severely biased discharge simulations in semi-arid basins with strong non-stationarity in rainfall. Simulations are more robust in European basins with humid climates. This highlights the fact that hydrological models frequently fail when simulations are required outside of calibration conditions in basins with non-stationary conditions. As a consequence, calibration periods should be sufficiently long to include both wet and dry periods, which should yield more robust predictions.";"Kling, Harald

To understand a region's forestry dynamics, and especially to predict its future tendencies, we must include all the necessary variables in a single database, calculated for spatial units that are stable over time and adequate for planning purposes. In our study, we developed a Forest Geographic Information System for Galicia called 'SIFGa'. We used it to examine 310 variables describing the environment, population tendencies, land tenure and forest management in the Spanish autonomous region of Galicia, at both council and parish levels. Results reveal the connections between our variables, which reflect the changes the regional forestry sector has experienced in the past, and explain its current situation.

"AGRIS:US201500077102";"High resolution land cover data improve understanding of mechanistic linkages with stream integrity";"";"Recent progress in very high spatial resolution imagery (VHSRI) has increased the availability of fine‐scale land cover data over extensive areas. This new spatial information might improve our understanding of how land cover affects stream ecosystems. Land cover information was investigated in whole catchments and riparian areas in Normandy (France) and related to stream macroinvertebrates at 155 sites. The first model was based on the land cover data obtained via moderate spatial resolution imagery (MSRI) at the catchment scale. The second and the third models were additionally based on riparian land cover data both locally (at the site) and upstream. The riparian land cover data were derived from the MSRI for the second and from the VHSRI for the third model. Riparian vegetation (at a distance from the channel of 5–100� m) was poorly detected by MSRI when compared to VHSRI. The model based on higher resolution data at the riparian scale (i) ensured that relationships identified at the riparian corridor scale were independent from those at whole catchment scale, (ii) identified the influence of riparian vegetation on the aquatic environment as being most pronounced when using data from a 20‐m wide strip (i.e. 20� m on each bank for a total of 40� m) and (iii) disentangled the effects of roads from other urban infrastructure. This study confirms the advantages of using very high resolution data in landscape approaches to the study of aquatic ecosystems. It provides accurate spatial information at the riparian scale that improves interpretation of the influence of land cover on the ecological condition of streams and allows identification of relevant features for management.";"Tormos, T.

more rent from grazing. This increases the incentive to comply with federally mandated regulations. Optimal grazing contracts therefore include grazing fees that are lower than competitive private rates. The optimal policy also includes random monitoring to prevent strategic learning by cheating ranchers and avoid wasteful efforts to disguise noncompliant behavior. Finally, an optimal policy includes a penalty for cheating beyond terminating the lease. This penalty must be large enough that the rancher who would profit the most from cheating experiences a negative expected net return.";"Watts, Myles J.

"AGRIS:US201400174544";"Exergy-based accounting for land as a natural resource in life cycle assessment";"";"PURPOSE: In life cycle assessment (LCA), literature suggests accounting for land as a resource either by what it delivers (e.g., biomass content) or the time and space needed to produce biomass (land occupation), in order to avoid double-counting. This paper proposes and implements a new framework to calculate exergy-based spatial explicit characterization factors (CF) for land as a resource, which deals with both biomass and area occupied on the global scale. METHODS: We created a schematic overview of the Earth, dividing it into two systems (human-made and natural), making it possible to account for what is actually extracted from nature, i.e., the biomass content was set as the elementary flow to be accounted at natural systems and the land occupation (through the potential natural net primary production) was set as the elementary flow at human-made systems. Through exergy, we were able to create CF for land resources for these two different systems. The relevancy of the new CF was tested for a number of biobased products. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Site-generic CF were created for land as a resource for natural systems providing goods to humans, and site-generic and site-dependent CF (at grid, region, country, and continent level) were created for land as a resource within human-made systems. This framework differed from other methods in the sense of accounting for both land occupation and biomass content but without double-counting. It is set operationally for LCA and able to account for land resources with more completeness, allowing spatial differentiation. When site-dependent CF were considered for land resources, the overall resource consumption of certain products increased up to 77� % in comparison with site-generic CF-based data. CONCLUSIONS: This paper clearly distinguished the origin of the resource (natural or human-made systems), allowing consistent accounting for land as a resource. Site-dependent CF for human-made systems allowed spatial differentiation, which was not considered in other resource accounting life cycle impact assessment methods.";"Alvarenga, Rodrigo A. F.

This paper is based on a recent study undertaken to investigate challenges facing optimal implementation of formal water rights systems for irrigation purposes in the Great Ruaha River Catchment in Tanzania. The study integrated social survey, hydrologic, water abstraction and water use data, and Geographical Information System techniques. The results showed that all the canals studied, except one, abstracted water throughout the year, provided there was water in the rivers irrespective of the conditions spelt out in their formal water rights. The formal water rights were also found to be problematic as the quantities to be abstracted were much higher compared to the actual water requirements and the actual river flows. This resulted in over-abstraction of water and increased water shortages for downstream users. The study concludes that although formal water rights are meant to control and regulate the use of water, they are also subject to abuse if not managed and monitored closely. The basin authorities in Tanzania therefore need to be equipped adequately and collaborate more closely with local water users in order to attain high levels of supervision and monitoring essential for optimal implementation of formal water rights systems.";"Rajabu, Kossa R.M.

However, little is known about the conditions and landcover of urban schoolyards. To understand the structure of the landcover on city schoolyards, this study used Geographic Information System software to classify and compare landcover on 258 U.S. public elementary and middle schools in Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, and Detroit, MI. For all three cities, schoolyard was found to cover, on average, more than 68% of the school property, which was an average of 1.0-2.5 ha in size. Boston's schoolyards (circa 1995) were notably smaller from those in Baltimore and Detroit, and they had far more impervious surface. On average, schoolyards were dominated by turf grass and impervious surface, while tree canopy occupied the smallest fraction of schoolyard landcover (approximately 10%). In light of these findings, we conclude by discussing how greening might be achieved on these and other yards.";"Schulman, Alexis

Here, we analyze the outcomes of different policies on land use/land cover change (LUCC) in a traditional, shifting cultivation landscape in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil), one of the world’s top biodiversity hotspots. We also investigate the impacts of those policies on the environment and local livelihoods in Quilombola communities, which are formed by descendants of former Maroon colonies. Our findings show that conservation and social policies have had mixed effects both on the conservation of the Atlantic Forest and on the livelihoods of the Quilombola. We conclude that future interventions in the region need to build on the new, functional links between sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity, where less restrictive state policies leave room for new opportunities in self-organization and innovation.";"Adams, Cristina

The estimation of ecosystem carbon dynamics depends on the quality of land cover change data and the effectiveness of the ecosystem models that represent the vegetation growth processes and disturbance effects. We used the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) and a set of 30- to 60-m resolution fire and land cover change data to examine the carbon changes of California's forests, shrublands, and grasslands. Simulation results indicate that during 1951–2000, the net primary productivity (NPP) increased by 7%, from 72.2 to 77.1TgCyr⁻¹ (1 teragram=10¹²g), mainly due to CO₂ fertilization, since the climate hardly changed during this period. Similarly, heterotrophic respiration increased by 5%, from 69.4 to 73.1TgCyr⁻¹, mainly due to increased forest soil carbon and temperature. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was highly variable in the 50-year period but on average equalled 3.0TgCyr⁻¹ (total of 149TgC). As with NEP, the net biome production (NBP) was also highly variable but averaged −0.55TgCyr⁻¹ (total of –27.3TgC) because NBP in the 1980s was very low (–5.34TgCyr⁻¹). During the study period, a total of 126Tg carbon were removed by logging and land use change, and 50Tg carbon were directly removed by wildland fires. For carbon pools, the estimated total living upper canopy (tree) biomass decreased from 928 to 834TgC, and the understory (including shrub and grass) biomass increased from 59 to 63TgC. Soil carbon and dead biomass carbon increased from 1136 to 1197TgC. Our analyses suggest that both natural and human processes have significant influence on the carbon change in California. During 1951–2000, climate interannual variability was the key driving force for the large interannual changes of ecosystem carbon source and sink at the state level, while logging and fire were the dominant driving forces for carbon balances in several specific ecoregions. From a long-term perspective, CO₂ fertilization plays a key role in maintaining higher NPP. However, our study shows that the increase in C sequestration by CO₂ fertilization is largely offset by logging/land use change and wildland fires.";"Liu, Jinxun

"AGRIS:US201400159543";"Incorporating canopy gap-induced growth responses into spatially implicit growth model projections";"";"Public land management across North America now incorporates multiple ecological and social values and has led to use of increasingly complex silvicultural systems, such as those designed to emulate natural disturbance regimes, in an effort to manage for this wider variety of objectives. In the eastern United States and Canada, canopy gap-based silvicultural systems are often used to promote and sustain intra-stand variability in temporal and spatial patterns. These are difficult to model in many of the region's growth and yield models, with the inherent intra-stand variability tenuously assumed to have negligible effects on stand responses despite increasing evidence to the contrary. Using the University of Maine's Acadian Forest Ecosystem Research Program (AFERP) as a test case, we investigated this assumption for canopy gap-based systems by first modeling the proportion of area potentially influenced by gaps in these systems with a discrete space model, and then estimating the influence of canopy gap-induced growth increases on growth projections of a calibrated version of the Northeast variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS-NE), a spatially implicit model commonly used by managers in this region. Results from the discrete space model showed that, across both AFERP gap-based treatments, up to 52.4% of the stand area can be within one mature tree height of a gap edge, and that the edge area could persist for multiple cutting cycles (>10 years), potentially having a dramatic impact on stand growth and yield. However, results from FVS-NE suggested the contrary, with a 20–50% increase in growth within the edge area only increasing merchantable sawtimber yields by 1–5% over the course of an entire 100-year rotation. We conclude that edge effects are likely being severely underestimated due to limitations in the FVS model, most notably the relatively inflexible control of stand density index-based growth maximums. Short-term projections with plots not approaching these maximums suggest that a 20–50% edge effect could increase merchantable yields by 15–37% in these gap-based systems, suggesting the need for significant reworking of the underlying FVS model.";"Arseneault, Justin E.

"AGRIS:US201600190079";"Indicators for spatialâtemporal comparisons of ecosystem service status between regions: A case study of the Taihu River Basin, China";"";"With the development of ecological science, the demand to integrate ecosystem services into ecological management is increasing. Stakeholders are interested in comparing stocks and ability to supply ecosystem services in different regions. However, different areas may have different primary ecosystem services and knowledge of the aggregated value of ecosystem services may be lacking, making comparisons difficult. Relevant indicators that can integrate a group of ecosystem services for comparison are therefore needed. This paper formulated two indicators, ecosystem service supply rate and supplyâdemand ratio, and applied them in a case study to compare and map the spatialâtemporal status of ecosystem services and the ability to supply these in different regions. Using nine regions in the Taihu River Basin in China as an example, data obtained from high-resolution spatial land use, land cover maps and stakeholder interviews were used to identify the spatialâtemporal potential supply and flow of ecosystem services and human demand patterns. The results showed that ecosystem service supply rate had declined from 2000 to 2010, indicating that the overall proportion of potential ecosystem services turned into flow in the Taihu River Basin declined. Determination of supplyâdemand ratio revealed that the status of ecosystem service provision in the basin is in deficit, with the deficit increasing between 2000 and 2010. These findings indicate that ecosystem service supply rate and supplyâdemand ratio are useful indicators of ecosystem service status and can permit comparisons between regions on both a spatial and temporal scale.";"Li, Jinghui

Indigenous communities have upheld their role and responsibilities, passed down over centuries by their ancestors as custodians of these places through time. The 5391 hectares in the Nyambene forest in central Kenya is a sacred site to the Ameru people, a community/tribe living on the northeastern slopes of Mt. Kenya. The forest is a resource from which customs, spiritual practices, and governance systems are derived to protect the territory as a whole and maintain its order, integrity and well-being. The Njuri Ncheke (council of elders) play a vital role in upholding the traditional ecological knowledge and customs, practised over generations, including acting as custodians of sacred groves around which rain-making rituals are performed. This paper examines the link between traditional custodianship and community livelihoods against a background of diverse national legislations on forest/land use management and religious influences.

Much scientific knowledge of changes in soil properties through time has been learned from these few, highly productive LTAEs. We determined the effects of land management changes (LMC) on soil organic carbon (SOC) by re-sampling 27 LTAEs across Canada using identical sampling and laboratory protocols. Seven LTAEs were sampled comparing perennial to annual cropping and it was found that SOC stocks (0-30 cm) were 9.0 +/- 1.5 Mg C ha-1 higher under perennial cropping after an average of 16.9 +/- 2.1 yr. This yielded a SOC stock change factor of 0.6 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, comparing favourably to a modelling assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default factor. In six LTAEs in western Canada, no-tillage increased SOC storage by 3.2 +/- 1.3 Mg C ha-1 in the top 15 cm over a period of 23.3 +/- 2.7 yr relative to conventional tillage, a rate of SOC storage of 0.14 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. This rate was also similar to that derived by simulation modelling and was slightly lower than the default IPCC rate for subhumid and semi-arid regions. In eastern Canada, where tillage is much deeper than western Canada, SOC storage was not significant differently between the two tillage systems. In six LTAEs in western Canada, removing fallow periods every second or third year in favour of continuous cropping increased SOC storage by 5.2 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 over 21.8 +/- 4.0 yr or an average SOC stock change factor of 0.23 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 to 15 cm depth. This was slightly higher than two independent meta-analyses and rates derived from simulation modelling. The results determined from a re-sampling of LTAEs across Canada provided an invaluable method of validating rates of SOC change concluded by other means.";"Vandenbygaart, A.J.

However, accelerating human-pressures on mangrove forests are resulting in the loss of key mangrove ecosystem services. In this paper, we assessed spatial–temporal changes in the extent and width of fringe mangroves, and changes in adjacent land use. The study focused on the Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, for the period 1989–2009. The total mangrove extent was estimated at seven points in time using four Landsat TM images (1989, 1992, 2003, and 2006) and three SPOT images (1995, 2003 and 2009). Supervised classification was conducted for image classification and mapping changes using a Maximum Livelihood Classifier approach. Changes in mangrove width were calculated for 2003 and 2009 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis Application. An assessment of the four Landsat TM images showed a significant decrease in mangrove extent for the periods 1989–1992 (−2.7% yr⁻¹) and 2003–2006 (−2.1% yr⁻¹), while a significant increase in mangrove extent was observed during 1992–2003 (0.7% yr⁻¹). SPOT images were used to classify shoreline land cover into four types, namely mangroves; shrimp farms; built-up areas; and bare and wet ground areas. The total loss of fringe mangrove extent was significantly correlated with the increase in extent of other land covers, especially shrimp farms and bare and wet ground, during the period of 2003–2009. The overall accuracy assessment of the classification using 2003 and 2009 SPOT 5 images was 90.1% and 90.5% respectively. The overall accuracy assessment of the 2003 Landsat image was 92.1%. This accuracy in classification of mangroves and non-mangroves showed that use of Landsat images was adequate for assessing spatial–temporal mangrove dynamics when higher spatial resolution satellite images were limited. The results highlight the dynamic nature of fringe mangrove communities in the region, and provide data useful for informing shoreline mangrove rehabilitation, conservation efforts, and national monitoring programs for estimating mangrove values of carbon sequestration and shoreline protection functions in Vietnam.";"Nguyen, Hai-Hoa

In its efforts to contribute positively to achieving the primary goal of halving the number affected by hunger, as set forth in the Millennium Development Goals, ICID aims to improve quality of life and reduce poverty in developing countries.ICID's efforts in stimulating and promoting the development of the art, science and techniques of engineering, agriculture, economics, ecology and social sciences for better land and water management are achieved through specialized internationally composed work groups. These work bodies attempt to produce updates that are focused not only on the scientific and technological aspects, but also emerging trends in management and sustainable solutions of water management for agriculture.ICID played a crucial role, together with other leading international organizations, to develop a joint vision on water for future generations. This included leading in the formation of the World Water Council.In the paper, an attempt has been made to highlight some of the recent achievements and other roles that ICID has played in the global water arena. ICID's strong country network enables best practices to be implemented at the local level. Thanks to the inherent strength of its broad-based National Committees, ICID's efforts and activities trickle down to irrigators, food producers and water user groups. The National Committees are also a source of identification of unique problems and challenges in the field, which require the concerted attention of the global body of expertise residing in ICID. The immediate challenges facing ICID are responses to the current global food crisis and the impacts of the global financial crisis on water and food security in a global context.";"Madramootoo, Chandra

Confronted with the implications of degraded lakes, such as loss of property values and declining recreational experiences, lakefront landowners, and those using the lake for recreation, are increasingly looking for meaningful ways to engage in activities to improve lake water quality. Even with increased citizen interest in lake management issues, state and county agencies are struggling to find effective methods that transform citizen interest into citizen action. We examine the Minnesota Lake Improvement District (LID) Law as a mechanism for formally involving lakefront homeowners in the design and implementation of lake management actions from the citizen perspective. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews with LID participants were used to explore what citizens perceived tobe benefits and challenges of the programme. Findings provide insight to environmental planners regarding citizen perceptions of pursuing a participatory management approach in which citizens are able to request a new taxing district to fund their desired lake management activities.";"Steiger-Meister, Kaitlin

This study defined the capacity of NIRS to predict soil organic matter (SOM), total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) in native prairie (n = 3) and conventionally tilled wheat (n = 1) experimental paddocks (1.6 ha) in central Oklahoma under different forms of long-term (1978-2004) management. Samples were collected from paddocks along 150-m transects situated between a ridge and toe slope. The A horizon was divided into sections (0- 5, 5-10, and 10-25 cm), reflectance (R) measurements (log 1/R) collected, and absorption spectra (750-2500 nm) developed for random samples collected from all paddocks (total n = 124 for C and N; n = 214 for SOM). Calibration equations between absorbance at various wavelengths and laboratory-measured properties were developed by multivariate partial least squares regression, and tested with an independent validation set of observations. Relationship between laboratory values and NIRS estimates (n = 62 for C and N; n = 75 for SOM) generated significant calibration equations (0.91 < R2 < 0.98; P < 0.01; 2.5 < RPD ratios < 3.7). Application of calibration equations to validation datasets (n = 62 for C and N; n = 139 for SOM) generated significant relationships (0.85 < R2 < 0.92; p < 0.01) with slopes that did not differ from calibration equations (0.70 < p < 0.76). Results suggest the developed equations could provide useful predictions of soil properties for routine determination of responses to management. More accurate and broadly applicable equations for central Oklahoma mollisols will require samples from a wider range of exposures, landscape positions, soil types, and management regimes.";"Northup, Brian K.

It can, moreover, solve conflicts between different activities, making rational use of the land. This study was conducted to identify suitable sites for development of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) farming in Sitakunda Upazila (sub-district), Bangladesh, using GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation of water and soil quality, topography, infrastructure and socio-economic factors. ASTER image and eighteen thematic layers were analyzed using ENVI and ArcView software to identify the suitable areas for tilapia farm development. A constraint layer was used to exclude areas from suitability maps that cannot be allowed to implement tilapia farming. A series of GIS models were developed to identify and prioritize the most suitable areas for tilapia farming. The output of the model clearly indicates the location and extent of tilapia farming areas on different suitability scales, i.e. most suitable (7,744 ha), moderately suitable (2,479 ha), and not suitable (838 ha). Model outputs were assessed against field verification data, and were consistent. Because existing aquaculture covers only 1,540 ha of land in the study area, the potential for expanding tilapia farms should take into consideration socio-political and environmental issues. The results are encouraging in terms of tilapia culture development and suggest that grassland-agriculture areas could be used for sustainable development of tilapia farming to diversify the economic activities of rural communities.";"Hossain, M.

The trade ban on species listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List may be counter-productive, as increasing the rarity and thus price of these species acts as a stimulus to illegal markets rather than a deterrent. Since illegal markets cannot have legal property rights, there is no basis for any form of sustainable harvesting based on property rights. The Malagsy radiated tortoise (Astrochelys radiata) is an example of a species that is threatened by domestic and international trade; legalizing international trade could, under certain circumstances, provide financial incentives that might effectively reduce the domestic trade and subsistence harvest of this animal. This paper argues this critically-endangered species may be more effectively conserved by assigning trading rights to local communities, rather than demanding a trade ban that cannot be enforced successfully.";"GANZHORN, JÃRG U.

We examined temporal (40 years) and spatial (1700 m elevational gradient) variation in butterfly communities, aiming to test whether the composition of communities in terms of species' thermal envelopes tracked regional warming, and whether local habitat influenced community responses to climate variation. LOCATION: Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain). METHODS: Butterfly assemblages were sampled at sites between 550 and 2250 m elevation, in 1967–1973 and 2006–2012. Changes in community composition over time and space were evaluated using the community temperature index, or CTI, which reflects for local assemblages the balance between species whose geographic ranges occupy regions of low vs. high temperatures. We used multiple regressions and an information‐theoretic approach to test: (1) whether relationships of CTI with elevation or temperature remained consistent after an estimated 1.78 °C regional warming; and (2) how spatial variation in CTI was related to air temperature and land cover. RESULTS: Community temperature index decreased consistently with increasing elevation and increased after 40 years of warming, as communities were increasingly composed by species with warmer geographic ranges. Long‐term CTI change represented a c. 160 m uphill shift in community thermal composition, whereas isotherms shifted 307 m upwards. In 2006–2012, CTI was influenced positively by temperature, and negatively by forest and meadow cover. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Variation in community composition over space and time suggested a role of climate in structuring butterfly assemblages. Despite this, changing spatial patterns of community composition (CTI) did not appear to keep pace with climate change. In addition, lower values of CTI recorded for sites with greater forest and meadow/pasture cover suggested a role for local habitat in buffering the effects of climate change on community composition.";"Nieto‐Sánchez, Susana

We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. Bypromoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight oftheir socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting.";"Eloy, Ludivine

The research objective was to investigate soil moisture variation in eight homogeneous 30 by 30m plots, similar to the pixel size of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) image. The plots were adjacent to eight stations of an in situ soil moisture network operated by the United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service USDA-ARS in Tifton, GA. We also studied five adjacent agricultural fields to examine the effect of different landuses/land covers (LULC) (grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil) on the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture. Soil moisture field data were collected on eight occasions throughout 2005 and January 2006 to establish comparisons within and among eight homogeneous plots. Consistently throughout time, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high variation in the soil moisture behavior among the plots and high homogeneity in the soil moisture behavior within them. A precipitation analysis for the eight sampling dates throughout the year 2005 showed similar rainfall conditions for the eight study plots. Therefore, soil moisture variation among locations was explained by in situ local conditions. Temporal stability geostatistical analysis showed that soil moisture has high temporal stability within the small plots and that a single point reading can be used to monitor soil moisture status for the plot within a maximum 3% volume/volume (v/v) soil moisture variation. Similarly, t-statistic analysis showed that soil moisture status in the upper soil layer changes within 24h. We found statistical differences in the soil moisture between the different LULC in the agricultural fields as well as statistical differences between these fields and the adjacent 30 by 30m plots. From this analysis, it was demonstrated that spatial proximity is not enough to produce similar soil moisture, since t-test's among adjacent plots with different LULCs showed significant differences. These results confirm that a remote sensing approach that considers homogeneous LULC landscape fragments can be used to identify landscape units of similar soil moisture behavior under heterogeneous landscapes. In addition, the in situ USDA-ARS network will serve better in remote sensing studies in which sensors with fine spatial resolution are evaluated. This study is a first step towards identifying landscape units that can be monitored using the single point reading of the USDA-ARS stations network.";"Giraldo, Mario A.

Managing it has been a significant challenge for land resource managers and researchers due to its extensive rapid invasion. To assess the effects of soil pH on growth, nutrient uptake, and mycorrhizal colonization in the roots of L. microphyllum, we conducted a 60-day greenhouse experiment by growing it in pots filled with pH-adjusted soils to a range from 4.5 to 8.0. L. microphyllum was able to survive and grow at all soil pH levels; however, final biomass, relative growth rate, photosynthesis, and specific leaf area were all greater in soil pH 5.5–6.5 compared to the other treatments. Correspondingly, nitrogen concentration was also related to these four plant parameters. Root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi was higher in soil pH 5.5–7.5 and lowest for plants growing in 4.5 or 8.0 and was correlated with plant growth parameters as well as elemental concentration in the leaves. Soil pH 8.0 was not strong enough for a pronounced growth decline, thus further increasing soil pH could provide a desired outcome and merit further investigation, although its potential negative impact on native flora (both plants and microorganisms) would need to be assessed.";"Soti, Pushpa G.

We used a readily accessible interface (COMET VR) to a simulation model (CENTURY) to predict changes in soil carbon in response to management changes commonly associated with conservation programs. We also used a subroutine of the model to calculate an estimate of uncertainty of the model output based on the similarity between climate, soil, and management history inputs and those used previously to parameterize the model for common land use (cropland to perennial grassland) and management (stocking rate reductions and legume addition) changes to test the validity of the approach across the southwestern United States. The conversion of small grain cropland to perennial cover was simulated acceptably (<20% uncertainty) by the model for soil, climate, and management history attributes representative of 32% of land area currently in small grain production, while the simulation of small grain cropland to perennial cover + legumes was acceptable on 73% of current small grain production area. The model performed poorly on arid and semiarid rangelands for both management (reduced stocking) and restoration (legume addition) practices. Only 66% of land area currently used as rangeland had climate, soil, and management attributes that resulted in acceptable uncertainty. Based on our results, it will be difficult to credibly predict changes to soil carbon resulting from common land use and management practices, both at fine and coarse scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose an integrated system of spatially explicit direct measurement of soil carbon at locations with well-documented management histories and climatic records to better parameterize the model for rangeland applications. Further, because the drivers of soil carbon fluxes on rangelands are dominated by climate rather than management, the interface should be redesigned to simulate soil carbon changes based on ecological state rather than practice application.";"Brown, Joel

"AGRIS:US201301804236";"Supplying Carbon Sequestration From West African Rangelands: Opportunities and Barriers";"";"The emergence of markets for mitigation of climate change presents new opportunities for increasing economic and ecological returns to rangelands in developing countries. Improving rangeland management is a potentially significant source of mitigation from sequestration. It is appealing due to the likely links to sustainable agricultural development and poverty reduction. Many of the changes needed to sequester carbon are also associated with improved rangeland productivity and incomes. We provide an overview of the key issues that arise in determining the potential of carbon markets to support improved rangeland management focusing on West Africa, an area where pastoralism is a major economic activity with extensive rangelands that offer considerable potential for sequestering carbon. Estimates of the potential for increasing sequestration through improved rangeland management are summarized. Per hectare amounts are low, but aggregate potential is high. Carbon emission reductions are generated by reducing or avoiding land degradation, rehabilitating degraded lands, and increasing native carbon stocks by increasing aboveground and belowground biomass. Avoiding degradation and rehabilitating lightly degraded lands are the least costly and can generate significant carbon emission reductions. Carbon offsets from agricultural sources are currently limited under regulatory cap and trade regimes, and prices in voluntary markets are relatively low. Low returns to carbon offsets per hectare mean that significant co-benefits in the form of increased rangeland productivity and incomes would be necessary to induce participation. High transactions costs can be a problem in carbon markets and in adopting improved rangeland management practices, highlighting the need for institutions to provide effective coordination, monitoring, and enforcement. Evidence from Burkina Faso suggests the potential for existing local-level institutions to play an important role in future carbon payment programs, should they emerge.";"Lipper, Leslie

Fluxes from swamp forest soils were also measured once per year as the native state of this investigated area. Land-use change from drained forest to lowland paddy field significantly decreased the CO2 (from 266 to 30 mg C m-2 h-1) and N2O fluxes (from 25.4 to 3.8 microgram N m-2 h-1), but increased the CH4 flux (from 0.1 to 4.2 mg C m-2 h-1) in the soils. Change from drained forest to cassava field significantly increased N2O flux (from 25.4 to 62.2 microgram N m-2 h-1), but had no significant influence on CO2 (from 266 to 200 mg C m-2 h-1) and CH4 fluxes (from 0.1 to 0.3 mg C m-2 h-1) in the soils. Averaged CO2 fluxes in the swamp forests (94 mg C m-2 h-1) were estimated to be one-third of that in the drained forest. Groundwater levels of drained forest and upland crop fields had been lowered by drainage ditches while swamp forest and lowland paddy field were flooded, although groundwater levels were also affected by precipitation. Groundwater levels were negatively related to CO2 flux but positively related to CH4 flux at all investigation sites. The peak of the N2O flux was observed at -20 cm of groundwater level. Lowering the groundwater level by 10 cm from the soil surface resulted in a 50 increase in CO2 emission (from 109.1 to 162.4 mg C m-2 h-1) and a 25% decrease in CH4 emission (from 0.440 to 0.325 mg C m-2 h-1) in this study. These results suggest that lowering of groundwater level by the drainage ditches in the peat lands contributes to global warming and devastation of fields. Swamp forest was probably the best land-use management in peat lands to suppress the carbon loss and greenhouse gas emission. Lowland paddy field was a better agricultural system in the peat lands in terms of C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission. Carbon loss from lowland paddy field was one-eighth of that of the other upland crop systems, although the Global Warming Potential was almost the same level as that of the other upland crop systems because of CH4 emission through rice plants.";"Furukawa, Y.

The authors show that such integration of socioeconomic objectives can contribute to the maintenance of incomes and employment without overly harming the attainment of ecological goals.As far as the MCA is concerned, two methods are applied: The linear-additive model, and the outranking model ELECTRE. The models serve to evaluate four different land use options. Nine criteria are used, derived from the relevant landscape functions. Weights are based on writteninterviews with major decision-makers, and stakeholders of the region. The major assumptions underlying the models are discussed. The authors interpret the results of each model on the basis of sensitivity analyses, and compare them. Finally, the paper discusses policy implications resulting from the implementation of land use concepts for agricultural landscapes, in particular the question of a regionalisation of agri-environmental policy, and raises some administrative and practical issues that come up if policy makers apply MCA more widely in the design of such concepts.";"Ahrens, Heinz

The system consists of programs, which run independently. Each module performs a certain task only and contributes to the modelling of landscape transformations in a different way. The modelling approach results in reducing the semantic complexity of landscape transformations, while this model can be understood by both humans and machines. The output consists in linguistic descriptions of the landscape or landscape properties, along with quantitative descriptions. For instance, the system can reason what have been the possible causes of certain landscape transformations if certain ecological effects are observed on the face of the landscape and reversely, what are the expected ecological results if certain causes of landscape change are given.";"Papadimitriou, Fivos";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400023982";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2011.11.009";"";"";"";"87-96"
"AGRIS:US2016221349";"An Agent-Based Model of Exurban Land Development";"";"In contrast to urban areas that are aptly characterized by a large population base and scarce land supply, exurban regions have limited households and plentiful land. This basic difference has far reaching implications for spatial equilibrium in exurban land markets. Rather than bidding their maximum willingness-to-pay and reaching a spatial equilibrium in which households are indifferent to location, as is the central condition of urban economic models, we argue that exurban households will be able to retain some amount of surplus in moving to an exurban location and therefore will choose the location that maximizes this locational surplus. In this paper, we first review the handful of structural spatial models of exurban land development that have been developed. We then develop a structural spatial model of exurban land development that captures these hypothesized features of exurban land markets using an auction model to represent household bidding and adapting the Capooza and Helsley (1990) model to represent landowners’ optimal timing of development. A key innovation of our approach is that, in the absence of full capitalization of land or location differences into land prices, households have preferences for some locations over others and thus it is possible to order household location choices in time and space. This greatly facilitates modeling of land use dynamics by enabling us to model location and land use decisions sequentially in time rather than assuming that all development is instantaneous for given levels of population and income in the region.  In addition, the spatial agent-based simulation method that is used to implement the model permits an explicit examination of the implications of exurban land market conditions for the evolution of urban development pattern. Specifically, we ask whether these exurban market conditions explain the emergence and persistence of so-called leapfrog development that is characteristic of exurban regions.";"Chen, Yong

"AGRIS:US201500016098";"How much soil organic carbon sequestration is due to conservation agriculture reducing soil erosion?";"";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) redistribution by soil erosion is fundamental to the C cycle and is a key component of global soil C accounting. Widespread conversion of cropland to forest and grassland and the adoption of conservation agriculture (minimum-till and no-till practices) worldwide and particularly in China since 2000, may have reduced wind erosion and increased SOC storage and ‘avoided’ CO2 emission. However, few SOC sequestration studies have separated changes in SOC stock caused by changes in land-use and management activity from net SOC redistribution due to reduced SOC erosion and SOC dust accumulation, particularly from individual or short-term (months) wind erosion events. We used measurements of SOC and the short-lived natural radionuclide beryllium-7 (7Be, half-life 53.3 days) to estimate net SOC redistribution for changes in several land-use and management practices in Fengning County in North China. Compared with conventional tillage (CT), conservation grassland (CG) and minimum tillage (CL) showed enhanced SOC stocks (0–245mm depth) of ~0.8±0.03 and 2.0±0.06tCha-1year-1 as a consequence of their land-use conversion for 5 and 3 years, respectively. However, SOC erosion on CG (0.46±0.04tCha-1year-1) and CL (0.52±0.04tCha-1year-1) plots was 54% and 47%, respectively, less than on CT (0.99±0.11tCha-1year-1). Net C sequestration (0–245mm), considering SOC redistribution for CG (0.27±0.12tCha-1year-1; 5 years) and CL (1.53±0.13tCha-1year-1; 3 years), revealed an overestimate of 196% and 31% without considering SOC redistribution (CG, 0.8±0.03tCha-1year-1; CL, 2.0±0.06tCha-1year-1), respectively, relative to CT. Reduced SOC erosion and/or SOC dust accumulation by vegetation–crop cover must be included when considering SOC sequestration induced by changes in land use and management.";"Li, Yong

"AGRIS:US201600056832";"Wavelet Based Post Classification Change Detection Technique for Urban Growth Monitoring";"";"Urban areas are the most dynamic region on earth. Their size has been constantly increased during the past and this process will go on in the future. Since there is no standard policy and guidelines for construction of buildings and urban planning, cities tend to have irregular growth. Many cities in the world face the problem of urban sprawl in its suburbs. So issues of urban sprawl need to be settled with the help of technologies such as satellite remote sensing and automated change detection. This paper presents a wavelet based post classification change detection technique that is applied to 1996 and 2004 MSS images of Madurai City, South India to determine the urban growth. The classification stage of the technique uses coilflet wavelet filter to correlate with the MSS land cover images of Madurai city to derive texture feature vector and this feature vector is inputted to a fuzzy-c means classifier, an unsupervised classification procedure. The post classification change detection technique is employed for identifying the newly developed urban fringe of the study area. The error matrix analysis is used to assess the accuracy of the change map. The performance of the presented technique is found superior than that of classical change detection methods such as image differencing, change vector analysis and principal component analysis.";"Raja, R.

The study was designed to test the effect of varying training site selections (location and number) among six analysts performing a supervised classification on a Landsat ETM + image. Design constraints maintained other aspects of the classification process constant (i.e., type of classifier, choice of band combinations, etc.). Results indicated that training site selection alone did not provide a predictive measure of classification accuracy. Only when training data selection was combined with variations in spatial resolution did significant differences occur. Differences in classification accuracies between analysts increased threefold in the aggregation process from 90 × 90 m to 1200 × 1200 m. Error sources (i.e. analyst differences) and the dynamics of the spatial aggregation process can potentially account for differences in environmental modeling outcomes.";"Iiames, John S.

The effects of surface water heat flux and surface covering on the EWT were analyzed via studies of the regional land cover status and the combined EWT with land surface parameters. This article also analyzed the roles and limitations of EWT in drought monitoring combined with classification of the regional drought and regional water stress index (RWSI). From the results, the following conclusions were reported. (1) The spatial distribution of the EWT is closely related to the vegetation, and the EWT is able to monitor the regional water conditions to a certain extent. (2) The distribution of the EWT is affected significantly by the density of vegetation cover, land surface temperature and evapo-transpiration. (3) The correlation between the NDVI (or fractional vegetation cover) and the EWT differs under different vegetation coverage conditions. (4) The evapo-transpiration of the ecological environment is closely tied to the EWT such that the changes in evapo-transpiration affect the EWT significantly. (5) The ability of the EWT to monitor regional drought is conditional, and therefore no significant indication exists that can be used to monitor moderate to severe drought conditions.";"Gao, Zhiqiang

"AGRIS:US201301687172";"Cropping strategies, soil fertility investment and land management practices by smallholder farmers in communal and resettlement areas in Zimbabwe";"";"Three smallholder villages located in typical communal (from 1948), old (1987) and new (2002) resettlement areas, on loamy sand, sandy loam and clay soils, respectively, were selected to explore differences on natural resource management and land productivity. Focus group discussions and surveys were carried out with farmers. Additionally, farmers in three wealth classes per village were chosen for a detailed assessment of their main production systems. Maize grain yields (t ha⁻¹) in the communal (1·5-4·0) and new resettlement areas (1·9-4·3) were similar but significantly higher than in the old resettlement area (0·9-2·7), despite lower soil quality in the communal area. Nutrient input use was the main factor controlling maize productivity in the three areas (R² = 59-83%), while soil quality accounted for up to 12%. Partial N balances (kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) were significantly lower in the new resettlement (-9·1 to +14·3) and old resettlement (+7·4 to +9·6) than in the communal area (+2·1 to +59·6) due to lower nutrient applications. Averaged P balances were usually negative. Consistently, maize yields, nutrient applications and partial N balances were higher in the high wealth class than in poorer classes. This study found that most farmers in the new resettlement area were exploiting the inherent soil nutrient stocks more than farmers in the other two areas. We argue that effective policies supporting an efficient fertilizer distribution and improved soil management practices, with clearer rights to land, are necessary to avoid future land degradation and to improve food security in Zimbabwe, particularly in the resettlement areas.

"AGRIS:US2016212474";"Intellectual Property Rights and Their Impacts in Developing Countries: An Empirical Analysis of Maize Breeding in Mexico";"";"There is little empirical evidence concerning the effects of intellectual property rights (IPR) on a technologically advanced developing country. Complete enumeration of the Mexican maize breeding industry showed that, contrary to the hypothesis that IPR would provide, in a technologically advanced developing country, incentives for R&D and innovation, IPR play no role for the industry in general, but that they are important for certain breeders' categories. The paper presents the theory on IPR and a short background on the Mexican maize breeding industry. The analysis of the interviews with maize breeders leads to the conclusion that the theory on IPR should be revised and take into account the characteristics of developing countries critical for the good functioning of IPR, especially the quality of the institutional environment and the judiciary system, and the importance of transaction costs related to IPR protection. The level of technological development also determines the extent to which actors can benefit from IPR protection. Given the relatively good score of Mexico on these two critical factors, IPR are likely to play an even smaller role for other developing countries.";"Leger, Andreanne";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2005-12-31";"en";"transaction costs";"";"";"MEX";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212474";"http://purl.umn.edu/18835";"";"";"";""

For validation and interpretation of observed greenness trends, two methods are applied: (1) a qualitative approach using in-depth knowledge of the study areas and (2) a quantitative approach by time series of biomass observations and rainfall data. Significant greening trends from 1982 to 2010 are consistently observed in both GEOV1 and GIMMS3g FAPAR datasets. Annual rainfall increased significantly during the observed time period, explaining large parts of FAPAR variations at a regional scale. Locally, GEOV1 data reveals a heterogeneous pattern of vegetation change, which is confirmed by long-term ground data and site visits. The spatial variability in the observed vegetation trends in the Sahel area are mainly caused by varying tree- and land-cover, which are controlled by human impact, soil and drought resilience. A large proportion of the positive trends are caused by the increment in leaf biomass of woody species that has almost doubled since the 1980s due to a tree cover regeneration after a dry-period. This confirms the re-greening of the Sahel, however, degradation is also present and sometimes obscured by greening. GEOV1 as compared to GIMMS3g made it possible to better characterize the spatial pattern of trends and identify the degraded areas in the study region.";"Verger, Aleixandre

"AGRIS:US201400104489";"Land use and climate changes and their impacts on runoff in the yarlung zangbo river basin, china";"";"Impacts of land use and climate change on runoff were investigated by studying the runoff in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, China. Trends in precipitation, mean air temperature, and runoff were analysed by non‐parametric Mann‐Kendall tests. Land‐use changes were examined with land‐use transition matrix and geographic information system tools. Land‐use and climate changes showed several characteristics, including increased reforestation, decreased grassland, retreat of glaciers and increased desertification. Human activity caused great impact, especially within densely populated regions and cities. Reforestation and degradation of grasslands were more frequent than deforestation and cultivation of grasslands. Annual mean air temperature, precipitation and runoff showed increasing trends between 1974 and 2000. The impacts of land use and climate change on runoff had different effects depending on region and season. In the season of freezing, climate change clearly affected runoff within regions that experienced precipitation. Altered evapotranspiration accounted for about 80 per cent of runoff changes, whereas land‐use changes appear to have had greatest impact on runoff changes within regions that have inconsistent relationships between runoff and climate change. It was demonstrated that afforestation leads to increased runoff in dry seasons. It was estimated that glacier snow melt has caused annual runoff to increase at least 6·0 mm/10yr, 2·1 mm/10yr and 1·7 mm/10yr in Regions 1, 3 and 4, respectively, whereas evapotranspiration caused annual runoff to decrease at least 7·4 mm/10yr in Region 2.

Here, we divided the environmental predictors into three groups: site conditions, hedge stand and landscape structure. We determined their independent and joint effects on the richness of four guilds of herbaceous species in 92 hedge stands in a north-Mediterranean intensive agricultural landscape. The fine—(at <250 m) and broad—(>550 m) spatial patterns of the key environmental predictors and the pure spatial effects on species richness were measured using a computation of the principal coordinates of a matrix of geographical neighbours integrated into a variation partitioning. The total explained variation of species richness among hedgerows was highest for wetland herbs (62 %), with increasing rates for rare plants (33 %), forest herbs (43 %) and arable weeds (47 %). 43–11 % of that variation was spatially structured and mostly explained by some of the key environmental predictors, such as proportion of a given landuse, presence of woody species and dead trees. This indicates that complex relationships between herbaceous species distribution and spatial processes exist in woody field margins and much of that is related to key factors which are spatially structured, both at fine or broad-scales, with implications for management and landuse planning.";"Sitzia, T.

"AGRIS:US201400104485";"Impacts of land cover change scenarios on storm runoff generation: a basis for management of the nyando basin, kenya";"";"The effects of conceptual land cover change scenarios on the generation of storm runoffs were evaluated in the Nyando Basin. The spatial scenarios represented alternatives that vary between full deforestation and reforestation. Synthetic storm events of depths 40, 60 and 80 mm were formulated according to the rainfall patterns and assumed to have durations corresponding to the runoff times of concentration. The Natural Resource Conservation Service–Curve Number model was used to generate runoff volumes within the sub‐catchments, which were subsequently routed downstream to obtain effects in the whole basin. The simulated land cover change impacts were evaluated relative to values obtained from the actual land cover state of the basin in the year 2000. From the results, an agricultural land cover scenario constituting of about 86 per cent of agriculture indicated increased runoff volumes in the entire basin by about 12 per cent. An agricultural‐forested land cover scenario with 40 and 51 per cent of forest and agriculture respectively revealed reduced runoff volumes by about 12 per cent. Alternatively, a scenario depicting a largely forested land cover state with about 78 per cent of forests reduced the runoff volumes by about 25 per cent according to the model estimates. Runoff volumes in the basin were also likely to reduce by about 15 per cent if the appropriate land cover scenario for the respective sub‐catchments were to be assumed for runoff management purposes. Considering the prevalent data uncertainty, the study effectively highlights the potential hydrological vulnerability of the basin. The results obtained can form a basis for appropriate catchment management of the area. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Olang, L. O.

"AGRIS:US201500083246";"comparison of remotely sensed and pollen‐based approaches to mapping Europe's land cover";"";"AIM: Remote sensing coupled with direct observation allows recent changes in vegetation to be investigated but, in order to extend our understanding of land‐cover change further back in time, different proxies for vegetation are required. The pseudobiomization (PBM) approach has been developed to transform fossil pollen data into land‐cover classes (LCCs) in order to reconstruct broad‐scale anthropogenic land‐use change through time. The aim of this study was to test and refine the PBM approach through application to an extensive modern pollen dataset and comparison with remotely sensed CORINE land‐cover maps for Europe. LOCATION: The study area comprised 2471 modern pollen sites from across Europe. METHODS: Pollen sites were assigned to one of eight LCCs using the pollen‐based PBM method, which draws upon biomization techniques to transform pollen data into records of land‐cover change. Five of the LCCs were ‘pure’ classes (e.g. broad‐leaf forest) and three of them were mixed vegetation. Remotely sensed CORINE land‐cover maps were used to assign LCCs to sites, and the results were compared with pollen‐assigned LCCs. RESULTS: The results revealed a good correspondence between the proportions of different LCCs that were registered using CORINE and pollen‐based PBM, when data were aggregated at a pan‐European scale. However, the match between the two datasets was much less close at a site‐specific level. The overall results were improved to c. 60% when the target was broadened to include similar as well as identical LCCs. The spatial correspondence was best across north‐central Europe and least good in south‐west Europe, the Mediterranean and northern Scandinavia. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The ability of distinct data types to sense actual vegetation is limited by various sources of error; for example, both pollen and remote sensing vary in terms of spatial and temporal heterogeneity and taxonomic resolution. It is likely that many of the main sources of error are common to both methods, rather than being approach‐specific. We conclude that pollen‐based methods of intermediate complexity can be used as a proxy for broad‐scale land‐cover change across most of temperate Europe, but may be less reliable at a site‐specific scale.";"Woodbridge, Jessie

"AGRIS:US201600180848";"Measuring external costs of ruralâurban land conversion: An empirical study in Wuhan, China";"";"Externalities of ruralâurban land conversion are major factors in the inefficiency of land resource allocation. Although many studies have proposed policy solutions of externalities, measuring externalities is still a challenge. According to definition of externalities, externalities of ruralâurban land conversion are the sum of nonmarket externalities and market externalities during land conversion process excluding owner of converted land. Therefore, to measure external costs accurately, the identification of internal parcels (converted parcels) and external parcels (influenced parcels) is necessary, and both nonmarket and market external costs should be considered. This paper proposed an improved approach to measure external costs by division of parcels. Firstly, the approach distinguishes internal parts and external parts by GIS technique and field surveys, and uses the boundary where WTP just decrease to zero to define extent of external part basing on Loomis' linear equation. Secondly, the model enumerates and analyzes effects of externalities in ruralâurban land conversion. Finally, to integrate these effects, the approach uses questionnaire survey and the method combining contingent valuation method (CVM) with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to solve âwhole-part biasâ and to acquire results. In the empirical study, Dongxihu district, Huangpi district, Caidian district and Jiangxia district are chosen as study area according to extend direction of Wuhan, China. Our result shows that in Wuhan, the external cost of ruralâurban land conversion is 1.2 Ã 104â32.6 Ã 104 yuan/hm2/a. Among these effects, market external costs such as irrigation facility destruction, water pollution and local government restriction cause large damages. However, non-market external costs including deterioration of air quality, noise pollution, landscape broken and accumulation of refuse are common phenomenon in land conversion. The measurement process of external costs highlights that internal and external part division are essential in externality measurement. The result of externalities measurement could provide a standard for compensation and tax policy in ruralâurban land conversion. Besides, space extent of externalities could provide reference for zoning and green belts policies.";"Chen, Zhu

"AGRIS:US2016207170";"The Impact of Ethanol Production on Spatial Grain Market Relationships";"";"Using cointegration theory, grain markets in Michigan, Kansas, Iowa and Indiana were examined to determine if increased ethanol production affected spatial corn price relationships in these states from 1998 through 2008. It was determined that corn prices operated in a stable, long-run equilibrium from 1998 through 2008 and increased ethanol production did not have an effect on this relationship. These findings suggest policy boosting ethanol production has not altered relationships between spatially dispersed corn markets. In addition to policy makers, this information is also useful to farmers and commodity traders who utilize market information when managing their businesses.

Historically, breeding access to proprietary maize germplasm was limited by trade secrets and heterotic group assignation. Advances in marker technologies, doubled haploidy and off-season nurseries have revolutionized the speed and efficiency of germplasm access and utilization. Immediate access and facilitated deployment of germplasm that is already widely used in cultivation reduces the effective level of intellectual property protection (IPP) that was previously in effect by virtue of plant variety protection (PVP). Consequences of reduced IPP include yet further development of hybrids that more closely resemble existing widely used varieties and reduced incentives for the private sector to broaden the adapted germplasm base from the introduction of exotic germplasm. Breeders worldwide should have the choice of using utility patents and/or a new form of PVP that includes a revised breeder exemption. These changes will promote investments in crop improvement, together with additional benefit sharing via royalty flows from the use of exotic and underutilized germplasm, providing broader social benefits. Regular surveys of genetic diversity deployed on farms should also be undertaken because they represent an important component of national and global food security.";"Smith, S.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300912476";"http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2007.07.0413";"";"";"";"1277-1290"

This approach needs to be accompanied by new and innovative pro-poor forms of land recordation to cater for these new forms of tenure. The proposed design draws on conventional land administration systems and the experiences of professionals, civil society and researchers regarding the land tenure systems of the poor and how they work in customary, informal, and post crisis areas. It is based on eight general design requirements, including delivery of preventive justice and co-management arrangements. The design is made up of ten interlinked elements, with an emphasis on a continuum of land recording. The design is only a first step toward a coherent robust framework. Some first experiences are reported, however, further suggested work includes: dissemination and awareness raising; further piloting; incorporation of institutional and political economy analysis; tailoring methods of implementation; and investigating approaches for funding, training, and material resources. Ultimately the pro-poor land recordation system should bring tenure security to the poor at faster rates and lower costs, and should thus enable a foothold on the lower rungs of the property ladder.";"Zevenbergen, Jaap

The abandonment of agricultural land is one of the ongoing processes of landscape change that are having a profound impact not only in Norway – the subject of this article – but across Europe. The article presents the findings from a study of perceptions of stewardship in Norwegian agricultural landscapes and the ways in which perceived stewardship is linked to landscape preference. The results of the study show that there are differences between landscape professionals and the general public with regards to the perception of stewardship and cues used for assessing stewardship, and suggests that stewardship is a stronger factor in shaping the general public's preferences.

We assessed the effectiveness of PAs in covering the ranges of 157 globally threatened terrestrial bird species in mainland Africa and Madagascar. To reduce commission errors, rather than using Extent of Occurrence (EOO) as a measure of distribution, we estimated the Extent of potentially Suitable Habitat (ESH) for each species within its EOO, using data on habitat preferences and land cover. On average, 14% of species' ESH fell within PAs, with negligible coverage of Critically Endangered species. By contrast, an average of 30% of species' ESH fell within Important Bird Areas (IBAs), a network of sites identified using globally standardized criteria as critical for bird conservation. IBAs that overlapped or fell within PAs were significantly less effective at covering the ESH of threatened birds than those falling outside the PA network, and for IBAs partly overlapping with PAs, coverage of threatened birds was significantly greater in the unprotected part. Expansion of the PA (and IBA) networks in parts of Madagascar, the Albertine Rift, Cameroon Highlands, Eastern Arc and eastern Kenya would benefit globally threatened bird species conservation.";"Beresford, A.E.

Data for future (2070s) climate change, according to present conditions (1990s), were estimated from the prediction results of a regional climate model (RCM). The RCM, which was developed in Japan, is based on the MRI model. The potential impacts of climate change were estimated according to the A2 scenario of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Aridity index, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, was computed by using measured data for the present condition and estimated data by the RCM for the future years. Changes in aridity were evaluated by comparing the current and future index values. Aridity variables were interpolated to determine the spatial distribution by means of geostatistical methods. Land cover was modelled and mapped by using the present and future aridity index data. In the southern regions of Turkey, especially along Mediterranean coasts, projected precipitation for 2070s will be 29.6% less than the present. On the contrary, an increase (by 22.0%) in precipitation was projected along the coast of Black Sea. The model predicted that the temperature might increase by 2.8-5.5 °C in the different regions of the country. This increase in temperature could result in higher evaporative demand of the atmosphere in the future (on the average 18.4 and 22.2% in the Mediterranean and Black Sea coastal regions, respectively and 17.8% in the whole country). Thus, an increase in aridity was foreseen for the whole Turkey except the north-eastern part. A conversion of deciduous broadleaf forest to evergreen needle-leaf forest is predicted in the northern coastal areas when we compare the future land cover with the present situation. The mixed forest vegetation could spread in the interior parts of East Anatolia and the north-western part of the country in the future.";"ÖNDER, Derya

The dry land regions of world are affected by climate change to a greater extent and facing food insecurity. The current pattern of food production has been estimated to be inadequate to meet demands of growing population and required around 38% increase to meet world`s food demands by 2025. Food insecurity in erosion hit dry land regions of Pakistan also demands development of resource-efficient cropping systems to meet the food needs of population growing. The research studies involved different cropping patterns such as fallow-wheat, mungbean-wheat, sorghum-wheat, fallow-lentil, mungbean-lentil, sorghum-lentil, fallow-barley, mungbean-barley and sorghum-barley. The organic amendments involved farmyard manure, NPK, poultry manure, compost and inoculation by phosphorus solubilizing microbes. The effect of cropping systems and soil amendments were evaluated at field scale in terms of water use efficiency measured in terms of economic terms. The results of the studies revealed that double cropping (mungbean-lentil and mungbean-barley) was feasible option in the dryland regions of Pakistan if integrated with the use of poultry manure as alternate environmental-friendly strategy to cut down the use of mineral fertilizers and eliminate summer fallowing.";"Ahmad, A.

The variables describing the agricultural land markets are land prices, prices for rental land and the share of rented land. Over a longer period of about two decades, the prices for agricultural land have been decreasing in real terms in general (exception NL) while rental prices have been more stable. A regression analysis shows increasing price effects on prices for agricultural land and on rental prices due to the ha-premiums, which were introduced by the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP)-Reforms in 1992. In ""Part II - Farm Level Strategies for Land Purchase"" the economic effects of changing land ownership are analysed using the data base of Part I. Recommendations for farmers are to find out if long term rental contracts are available to avoid tying up capital. If land market prices are lower than a certain threshold, land can be bought considering the financial liquidity of the enterprise. Selling land could be appropriate to avoid financial liquidity stress, but this should be only temporary and restricted to a marginal amount of land stocks. If profitability of crop production is relatively low or land prices are relative high and rental contracts terminated, an entrepreneur should seek to rent new land, if possible, or find alternative investments which yield higher profits than crop production.";"Fuchs, Clemens";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012203648";"http://purl.umn.edu/24318";"";"";"";""

Results showed that SSA modified the chemical properties of mudflat soil by decreasing soil salinity and pH, increasing soil organic matter, total and available N and P, and heavy metals. The biomass of root and aboveground parts of ryegrass showed increments with increasing SSA rates. Maximum increases of 5.6- and 1.3-fold in fresh weight of aboveground parts and root of ryegrass were observed at 300 t ha⁻¹ rate. Root grown at all SSA rates showed positive response to higher nutrient availability in the mudflat soil with increasing root average diameter and volume. The root length and surface area at 30 t ha⁻¹ SSA rate was significantly higher than those in other treatments. The sewage sludge amendment increased N and P content in both aboveground and root parts of ryegrass. Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn accumulation in ryegrass was positively correlated with SSA rates. However, heavy metal concentrations in ryegrass did not exceed the safety standard for feed in China (GB 13078-1999), except for Cd at 300 t ha⁻¹ SSA rate. The study suggests that sewage sludge can be applied for mudflat soil amendment, which provides an innovative solution pertaining to new arable land resources and solid waste disposal. The optimum SSA rate is 150 t ha⁻¹ with maximum plant yield yet permissible metal accumulation.";"Bai, Yanchao

The joint monitoring activities in the Carpathians from the Romanian territory were launched in 1998 by including six study sites in the network of twenty- six sites established for monitoring and assessment changes in the Carpathian forests at the scale of the entire Carpathian Mountain range. The paper addresses the results gained by repeating field studies protocols in 2005, in the same study sites from the Romanian stretch of Carpathian Mts, and shows first findings of the attempt of comparative analysis of two sets of empirical results collected in 1998 and 2005. The biometric characteristics of the investigated forest stands have changed between the years 1998–2005, due to moderate (Retezat) or intensive (Fundata) silvicultural interventions, progressive improvement of the amount of precipitations and significant decrease of pressure exerted by air pollution (Badea et al, 2006). Except a relatively low volume increment (4.8 cubic mper yr per ha) estimated for Fundata forest stands, which is located at the upper altitudinal limit (1360 m asl), good (6.7–7.1 cubic m per yr per ha) and high (10–11 cubic m per yr per ha) volume increment were estimated for Magura Odobesti and Stana de Vale, respectively Obcina Mare and Retezat sites, according with the tree species composition and yield class. The data related to the share of damaged trees (defoliation classes 2–4) indicate that between 1998 and 2005 the health status of forests from the Romanian Carpathians has been slightly improved, as well as for all Romanian forests (Badea et al, 2006). The recorded data indicate also that the dominant plant species have not been changed, and thus, the type of plants associations. However, they indicate an increase with 5 species (SdV), 8 species (F; MO; R), 16 species (RA) and 19 species (OM) in the plant species richness between 1998 and 2005. In addition, the results of the comparative analysis based on Jaccard coefficient of similarity, show profound changes (78 percent) in species composition, in particular subordinate and transient species.";"Vadineanu, A., University of Bucharest (Romania).

Reindeer management has natural limits of growth. Consequently it should be managed to optimise both the use of reindeer pastures and herder income. Reindeer pastures should be grazed at the economic carrying capabity level. This gives the maximum sustained harvest from reindeer stock and also the maximum sustained foraging from pastures. How is this to be accomplished? First, reliable knowledge about reindeer pastures in time and place is necessary: to estimate the quantity and quality of specific reindeer pastures within each management district, as well as the productive capacity and the changes in condition and productivity of those pastures. Secondly, data is needed on the accurate productivity of reindeer stock and the production costs for each management district. Thirdly, study the relationships between pasture resources and productivity of reindeer stock together with the effects of long-term reindeer densities on pasture condition and productivity. Finally, knowledge is needed about the effects of herd structure on reindeer stock productivity as well as the factors which restrict the use of reindeer pastures. Models based on adequate data could provide a useful tool for optimising the use of reindeer pastures and herder income. First the economic carrying capacity of reindeer pastures should be studied. Subsequently the economy of reindeer husbandry could be modelled with respect to reindeer stock density. Also the economy of reindeer husbandry based on different levels of feeding, and the effects of this husbandry practice on pastures, should be modelled. Models should be accurate and flexible enough to use when looking for solutions to practical questions and challenges in reindeer management.";"Jouko Kumpula";"";"";"AGRIS";"1999-04-05";"";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012085847";"http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1604";"";"";"";"111-120"

In this paper, we evaluate five explanations for geographic gradients in species richness, using South American owls as a model. We compared the explanatory power of contemporary climate, landcover diversity, spatial climatic heterogeneity, evolutionary history, and area. An important aspect of our analyses is that very different hypotheses, such as history and area, can be quantified at the same observation scale and, consequently can be incorporated into a single analytical framework. Both area effects and owl phylogenetic history were poorly associated with richness, whereas contemporary climate, climatic heterogeneity at the mesoscale and landcover diversity explained ca. 53% of the variation in species richness. We conclude that both climate and environmental heterogeneity should be retained as plausible explanations for the diversity gradient. Turnover rates and scaling effects, on the other hand, although perhaps useful for detecting faunal changes and beta diversity at local and regional scales, are not strong explanations for the owl diversity gradient.";"Diniz-Filho, José Alexandre Felizola

To evaluate the accuracy of this product, ground-based measurements of energy fluxes obtained from eddy covariance sites installed in tropical biomes and from a hydrological model (MGB-IPH) were used to validate MOD16 products at local and regional scales. We examined the accuracy of the MOD16 algorithm at two sites in the Rio Grande basin, Brazil, one characterized by a sugar-cane plantation (USE), the other covered by natural savannah vegetation (PDG) for the year 2001. Inter-comparison between 8-day average MOD16 ET estimates and flux tower measurements yielded correlations of 0.78 to 0.81, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.78 and 0.46 mm d ⁻¹, at PDG and USE, respectively. At the PDG site, the annual ET estimate derived by the MOD16 algorithm was 19% higher than the measured amount. For the average annual ET at the basin-wide scale (over an area of 145 000 km ²), MOD16 estimates were 21% lower than those from the hydrological model MGB-IPH. Misclassification of land use and land cover was identified as the largest contributor to the error from the MOD16 algorithm. These estimates improve significantly when results are integrated into monthly or annual time intervals, suggesting that the algorithm has a potential for spatial and temporal monitoring of the ET process, continuously and systematically, through the use of remote sensing data.

"AGRIS:US2012209753";"Land Degradation in Ethiopia: What Do Stoves Have To Do With It?";"";"In Ethiopia deforestation is a major problem and many peasants have switched from fuelwood to dung for cooking and heating purposes, thereby damaging the agricultural productivity of cropland. The Ethiopian government has embarked on a two-pronged policy in an effort to stem deforestation and the degradation of agricultural lands: (i) tree planting or afforestation; (ii) dissemination of more efficient stove technologies. The motivation in here is, therefore, to examine the potential of the strategy of disseminating improved stoves in the rehabilitation of agricultural and forests lands. For empirical analysis we used a dataset on cross-section of 200 farm households from the highlands of Tigrai, northern Ethiopia. We used a two-step procedure reminiscent of hedonic pricing. Results in this paper indicate that farm households in Tigrai/ Ethiopia are willing to adopt new/improved stove innovations if these result in economic savings. Moreover, results suggest a significant positive impact in slowing the degradation of agricultural and forested lands. On a per household basis, we found that adopters will collect 68.3 kg less wood each month, while more dung in the form of manure becomes available as 19.899 kg less dung is collected each month. In terms of wood alone, assuming an average of 79 t of biomass per ha, we found the potential reduction in deforestation amounts to some 1,794 ha per year, not an inconsequential savings.";"Gebreegziabher, Zenebe

OBJECTIVES: (1) Assess the relative influences of WUI expansion versus climate-driven fire regime change on spatial and temporal patterns of burned WUI, and (2) determine whether WUI developed in the future will have higher or lower wildfire risk than existing WUI. METHODS: We projected the spatial pattern of the WUI and its associated wildfire risk from 2005 to 2050 at 90-m spatial resolution and 5-year intervals in Colorado Front Range using CHANGE, a landscape change model that simulates land cover and land use change, natural vegetation dynamics, and wildfire in a unified framework. A total of four scenarios from a factorial design with static versus changing WUI and static versus changing fire regimes were simulated to examine the effects of WUI expansion and climate-driven fire regime change on burned area in the WUI. RESULTS: Both WUI expansion and fire regime change contributed to the increase of burned WUI, but fire regime change had a stronger influence. The effects of WUI expansion and fire regime change had a combined influence greater than the sum of their individual effects. This interaction was a result of projected WUI expansion into regions of higher wildfire risk than existing WUI. CONCLUSIONS: The human footprint will continue to expand into wildland areas and must be considered along with climate effects when assessing the impacts of changing fire regimes in future landscapes.";"Liu, Zhihua

"AGRIS:US201600124102";"Biodiversity in cultural landscapes: influence of land use intensity on bird assemblages";"";"CONTEXT: Land use changes and intensification have been amongst the major causes of the on-going biodiversity decline in Europe. A better understanding and description of how different levels of land use intensity affect biodiversity can support the planning and evaluation of policy measures. OBJECTIVES: Our study investigates how land use-related landscape characteristics affect bird diversity, considering different spatial scales and species groups with characteristic habitat use. METHODS: We used breeding bird census data from 2693 observation points along 206 transects and applied a random effects hurdle model to describe the influence of the landscape characteristics altitude, forest proportion, patch density, land cover diversity, and land use intensity on avian species richness. RESULTS: Land use intensity and related landscape characteristics formed an important explanatory variable for bird richness. Increasing land use intensity was accompanied by a decrease in bird species richness. While forest bird richness decreased with a decreasing amount of forest cover, farmland species richness increased. This led to a bird diversity peak in extensively used semi-open landscapes. The influence of land cover diversity on species richness was small. Increasing patch density had positive effects on forest birds, but affected farm birds negatively. The strongest correlation between land use-based indicators and bird diversity was determined using spatial indicators at a close range around observation points (100–500 m radius). CONCLUSIONS: Our results assist interpretation of the Pan-European Common Bird Indices and emphasize the importance of using multifaceted and thoroughly selected indicators in the context of biodiversity monitoring and decision-making support.";"Rüdisser, Johannes

"AGRIS:US201500184801";"Monitoring prospective sites for rainwater harvesting and stormwater management in the United Kingdom using a GIS-based decision support system";"";"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a practice of growing importance in the United Kingdom, particularly in the southeast of England where the water availability per person is even less than in many Mediterranean countries. Although there is a huge amount of rainfall in the north and west of England and Wales, water resources in the southeast and east of England are under pressure due to the growing population and the changing climate. Therefore, RWH becomes particularly important to reduce the dependence on the mains water supply. In the present study, suitable areas for RWH in the UK have been identified using a geographic information system-based decision support system (DSS) and remote sensing. The DSS undertakes a combination of thematic layers such as rainfall surplus, slope, curve number, land cover/use, and soil texture. The spatial extents of suitability areas for RWH were identified using multi-criteria evaluation. The spatial distribution of the suitability map shows that the excellent suitable areas for RWH are in the northwest of UK but less suitable areas in the northern and eastern parts. On average, the suitability for RWH in the UK was found that 18.95 and 27.25 % of the area are excellent and good, about 23.53 % is moderate, whilst 30.26 and 0.02 % are unsuitable and poor, respectively. The use of a number of RWH sites in the excellent areas is recommended to ensure successful implementation of RWH systems.";"Mahmoud, Shereif H.

To assess these land change dynamics and their causes in the Great Plains, we compare and contrast contemporary changes across 16 ecoregions using Landsat satellite data and statistical analysis. Large-area change analysis of agricultural regions is often hampered by change detection error and the tendency for land conversions to occur at the local-scale. To facilitate a regional-scale analysis, a statistical sampling design of randomly selected 10km×10km blocks is used to efficiently identify the types and rates of land conversions for four time intervals between 1973 and 2000, stratified by relatively homogenous ecoregions. Nearly 8% of the overall Great Plains region underwent land-use and land-cover change during the study period, with a substantial amount of ecoregion variability that ranged from less than 2% to greater than 13%. Agricultural land cover declined by more than 2% overall, with variability contingent on the differential characteristics of regional human–environment systems. A large part of the Great Plains is in relatively stable land cover. However, other land systems with significant biophysical and climate limitations for agriculture have high rates of land change when pushed by economic, policy, technology, or climate forcing factors. The results indicate the regionally based potential for land cover to persist or fluctuate as land uses are adapted to spatially and temporally variable forcing factors.";"Drummond, Mark A.

In the first scenario, the development decision is indivisible. In contrast, in the second scenario, the development decision is divisible. Specifically, we study the properties of the indivisible development decision when there is a time constraint on when land is to be developed. We then analyze the ways in which the divisible land development decision depends on the extent of a landowner's landholding and on the number of development opportunities awaiting this landowner.";"Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.

The markets-as organizations approach suggests that markets are governed by an internal ""constitution"" containing rules on dissemination of information, control procedures and sanctioning mechanisms that provide advantages to members. The design of the market constitution is believed to be strongly influenced by the constellation of actors and their characteristics. In order to investigate the validity of this assumption the study chooses a comparative approach that analyses the content of land market rules in settings with different actor constellations and tries to find out why they have been established in this way. Both qualitative and quantitative data collected in three village case studies and a survey in two structurally different regions of Poland is used. The results underline that the internal constitution of the organisation ""land market"" is designed to serve members' interests by decreasing transaction costs and protecting community welfare and also support the expectation that the rules differ according to actor constellations.";"Hurrelmann, Annette";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"POL";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016219211";"http://purl.umn.edu/18840";"";"";"";""

They cover >Â 12% of the Earth's terrestrial area, with over half of this designated since 1970, and are thus a unique example of governments and other stakeholders consciously changing management of land and water at a significant scale. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has a global programme to complete ecologically-representative protected area networks, and this is driving the creation of large numbers of new protected areas. But there is also growing criticism of protected areas because of the social costs of protection and doubts about their effectiveness. We acknowledge this criticism but believe that it is over-stated and applied to a protected area model that has already been replaced by newer thinking. As protected areas are becoming more complex in concept and more complicated in management, we review the six most important changes affecting them over the last 2 decades: (1) a new protected area definition with more emphasis on nature conservation; (2) a plurality of management and governance models; (3) acknowledgement of wider protected area benefits beyond nature conservation; (4) greater social safeguards for protected areas; (5) evidence that protected areas are effective conservation tools; and (6) a new emphasis on larger protected areas, transboundary protected areas, connectivity conservation and landscape approaches.

Lithuania, as well as other Baltic states, has created the agrarian sector under the very complicated economical, social, and cultural circumstances. Each Baltic state (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) had some specific features of rural development, which were formed during the last century. The land reform carried out during the first period of independence in the first half of the twentieth century (1918-1940) led to the formation of farmer's social stratum, which comprised the majority of freshly created middle class in Lithuania. Growing family farms became as the main form of management in agrarian sector. But occupation and annexation of Lithuania interrupted the fast economic growth. Expropriation and enforced collectivisation of agricultural land completely destroyed farmers as a social class, and rural inhabitants became as state farmhands. After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the restitution of private land property was started. But implementation of democratic reforms became a very complicated process. Lithuania is still looking for optimal decisions of modern rural development. Concept of the new role of countryside is presented in the paper.";"Jasaitis, J., Siauliai Univ. (Lithuania).

"AGRIS:US201301533808";"Application of Tabu Search Algorithm With a Coupled AnnAGNPS-CCHE1D Model to Optimize Agricultural Land Use";"";"Abstract: A principal contributor to soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, agricultural activities have a major influence on the environmental quality of a watershed. Impact of agricultural activities on the quality of water resources can be minimized by implementing suitable agriculture land-use types. Currently, land uses are designed (location, type, and operational schedule) based on field study results, and do not involve a science-based approach to ensure their efficiency under particular regional, climatic, geological, and economical conditions. At present, there is a real need for new methodologies that can optimize the selection, design, and operation of agricultural land uses at the watershed scale by taking into account environmental, technical, and economical considerations, based on realistic simulations of watershed response. In this respect, the present study proposes a new approach, which integrates computational modeling of watershed processes, fluvial processes in the drainage network, and modern heuristic optimization techniques to design cost effective land-use plans. The watershed model AnnAGNPS and the channel network model CCHE1D are linked together to simulate the sediment and pollutant transport processes. Based on the computational results, a multi-objective function is set up to minimize soil losses, nutrient yields, and total associated costs, while the production profits from agriculture are maximized. The selected iterative optimization algorithm uses adaptive Tabu Search heuristic to flip (switching from one alternative to another) land-change variables. USDA's Goodwin Creek experimental watershed, located in Northern Mississippi, is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. The results show that the optimized land-use design with BMPs using an integrated approach at the watershed level can provide efficient and cost-effective conservation of the environmental quality by taking into account both productivity and profitability.";"Qi, Honghai

"AGRIS:US201600123845";"Site-scale isotopic variations along a river course help localize drainage basin influence on river food webs";"";"In human-impacted rivers, nutrient pollution has the potential to disrupt biodiversity organisation and ecosystem functioning, prompting calls for effective monitoring and management. Pollutants, together with natural variations, can modify the isotopic signature of aquatic organisms. Accordingly, we explored the potential of isotopic variations as an indicator of drainage basin influences on river food webs. We assessed stable N and C isotopes within six food webs along a river affected by multiple pollution sources. CORINE land cover maps and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were also applied to understand the impact on surface waters of anthropogenic pressures affecting the catchment. N isotopic signatures of taxa fell in association with ammonium inputs from agriculture, indicating that nitrogen pollution was related to synthetic fertilizers. Isotopic variations were consistent across trophic levels, highlighting site-specific communities and identifying taxa exposed to pollutants. This allowed us to locate point sources of disturbance, suggesting that food web structure plays a key role in pollutant compartmentalisation along the river. Thematic maps and DEMs helped understand how the anthropogenic impact on river biota is mediated by hydro-geomorphology. Thus, the integration of site-scale analyses of stable isotopes and land use represents a promising research pathway for explorative nutrient pollution monitoring in human-impacted rivers.";"Bentivoglio, Flavia

"AGRIS:US201600102643";"Evaluating the Success of Arkansas Darter Translocations in Colorado: An Occupancy Sampling Approach";"";"Like many fishes native to western Great Plains streams, the Arkansas darter Etheostoma cragini has declined, apparently in response to changes in flow regimes and habitat fragmentation. We investigated the effectiveness of translocation as a management strategy to conserve this threatened species in the Arkansas River basin of southeastern Colorado. We used a multiscale design to sample the darter and several attributes of its habitat at the local 10-m site scale, the 3.25-km translocation segment scale, and the 10-km riverscape scale in all 19 streams where it had been previously translocated. The darter was captured in 11 of the 19 streams, although 5 were completely dry when visited. Arkansas darters had reproduced in 10 of the 11 streams (one criterion in the state recovery plan), and 6 streams also met a second criterion for abundance (>500 individuals). However, the populations in only two streams unequivocally met a third criterion of being self-sustaining, because the other four streams had been stocked annually with hatchery-reared Arkansas darters. We used multistate occupancy estimation, based on two consecutive dipnetting surveys, to determine the habitat characteristics correlated with site occupancy and the detectability of Arkansas darters at the local site scale. The probability of detection for the darter at occupied sites was high for both age-groups, 92% for age-0 darters and 75% for age-1 darters, and was a function of day of year (age 0) and habitat depth (age 1). Cool stream temperature (a site-scale variable) and sufficient length of available habitat (a riverscape-scale variable) were the strongest predictors of site occupancy for both age-groups. The models are useful in identifying new sites for translocations and factors that may place current populations at risk. Effective conservation will require land management practices that conserve, protect, and restore contiguous stream segments with cool temperatures that can sustain Arkansas darters.";"Groce, Matthew C.

The paper seeks to identify and analyze the kinds of institutional arrangements that might be deployed to support indigenous communities in the management of indigenous-owned land. It is concerned with a particular planning context in which the role of state agencies is focused on supporting and facilitating the work of indigenous landowners. This paper considers how best to arrange the institutional systems and processes of the nation state to support the management of indigenous lands management by their indigenous owners. To this end, the paper interrogates the utility of three models of planning: (1) institutional-regulatory, (2) community-based planning, and (3) reticulist, or facilitated process, approaches. The paper identifies the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches and argues for the development of a hybrid approach that integrates the positive features of all three models. The paper concludes that this hybrid model offers a set of institutional arrangements that enable collaborative planning between indigenous peoples and institutions of the state.";"Lane, Marcus";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016211920";"http://purl.umn.edu/12779";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400159305";"REDD Policy Impacts on Indigenous Property Rights Regimes on Palawan Island, the Philippines";"";"Several Southeast Asian states have been working feverishly to design and implement REDD policy frameworks to fulfil their commitment to global climate change mitigation. In doing so, state agencies will be challenged to design REDD plus policies that value and conserve forest carbon in ways that align with national policies and local priorities for managing forest landscapes defined by complex property rights regimes. However, as with other market-based policies, the expeditious delivery of REDD could bypass critical analysis of potential interactions with national tenure regimes, customary property rights, and local livelihoods. Drawing on the case of Palawan Island—a forested frontier island in the Philippines—we examine how nascent REDD policies can articulate with state sanctioned tenure, customary tenure, and forest uses in changing livelihood contexts. This paper draws on research among Tagbanua and Pala’wan people to illustrate how complex and changing tenure structures, commodity markets and livelihood dynamics may influence how REDD plus interventions affect indigenous customary lands and forest use. We argue that the ability of indigenous forest users to maintain stored carbon and improve livelihoods is contingent upon the ‘socio-material’ form of carbon—a commodity defined in relation to the resources and social processes of which it is part.";"Dressler, Wolfram

"AGRIS:US201400003795";"Red deer hunting—commercializing versus availability";"";"Many deer populations in Europe and North America have increased in abundance over the last decades. The increasing populations potentially entail both ecological and economic challenges and opportunities, but in practice we still know little about the extent to which these opportunities are being exploited in different management systems. The Norwegian red deer population has increased in density and expanded rapidly since the 1950s. Traditionally, red deer hunting has been undertaken by the local landowner and his relatives and friends. The present large population raises the question whether attracting other hunters could provide a higher economic return for the landowners and, if so, if they are interested in providing such hunting opportunities. We designed a survey to learn more about the landowners, both with respect to the present level of hunting income as well as economic costs of, for example, forest and agricultural damage; we also sought to understand their interest in increasing their income from red deer hunting and potential obstacles to realizing such an increased economic benefit. The results indicate that landowners on average think that red deer populations on their land result in higher costs than income but are nevertheless satisfied with the way things are. This highlights that increased numbers of deer need not automatically lead to more income for landowners and that the potential for income may be hindered by cultural factors such as reluctance to allow access to non-local hunters.";"Olaussen, Jon Olaf

"AGRIS:US201500204494";"Characteristics of nitrogen loading and its influencing factors in several typical agricultural watersheds of subtropical China";"";"Increasingly, the characteristics of nitrogen (N) loading have been recognized to be critical for the maintenance and restoration of water quality in agricultural watersheds, in response to the spread of water eutrophication. This paper estimates N loading and investigates its influencing factors in ten small watersheds variously dominated by forest and agricultural land use types in the subtropics of China, over an observation period of 23–29 months. The results indicate that the average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), NH₄⁺–N, and NO₃⁻–N were 0.83, 0.07, and 0.46 mg N L⁻¹in the forest watersheds and 1.49–5.16, 0.21–3.23, and 0.99–1.30 mg N L⁻¹in the agricultural watersheds, respectively. Such concentrations exceed the national criteria for nutrient pollution in surface waters considerably, suggesting severe stream pollution in the studied agricultural watersheds. The average annual TN loadings (ANL) were estimated to be 1,640.8 kg N km⁻² year⁻¹in the agricultural watersheds, 63.3–86.1 % of which was composed of dissolved inorganic N (DIN; comprising NO₃⁻–N and NH₄⁺–N). The watershed with intensive livestock production (i.e., the maximum livestock density of 2.66 animal units (AU) ha⁻¹) exhibited the highest ANL (2,928.7 kg N km⁻² year⁻¹) related to N loss with effluent discharge. The results of correlation and principle component analysis suggest that livestock production was the dominant influencing factor for the TN and NH₄⁺–N loadings and that the percentages of cropland in watersheds can significantly increase the NO₃⁻–N loading in agricultural watersheds. Therefore, to restore and maintain water quality, animal production regulations and more careful planning of land use are necessary in the agricultural watersheds of subtropical China.";"Li, Yuyuan

"AGRIS:US201301665654";"Ecohydrological feedback mechanisms in arid rangelands: Simulating the impacts of topography and land use";"";"The interaction between ecological and hydrological processes is particularly important in arid and semi-arid regions. Often the interaction between these processes is not completely understood and they are studied separately. We developed a grid-based computer model simulating the dynamics of the four most common vegetation types (perennial grass, annuals, dwarf shrubs and shrubs) and related hydrological processes in the region studied. Eco-hydrological interactions gain importance in rangelands with increasing slope, where vegetation cover obstructs run-off and decreases evaporation from the soil. Overgrazing can influence these positive feedback mechanisms. In this study, we first show that model predictions of cover and productivity of the vegetation types are realistic by comparing them with estimates obtained from field surveys. Then, we apply a realistic range in slope angle combined with two land use regimes (light versus heavy grazing intensity). Our simulation results reveal that hydrological processes and associated productivity are strongly affected by slope, whereas the magnitude of this impact depends on overgrazing. Under low stocking rates, undisturbed vegetation is maintained and run-off and evaporation remain low on flat plains and gentle slope. On steep slopes, run-off and evaporation become larger, while water retention potential decreases, which leads to reduced productivity. Overgrazing, however, reduces vegetation cover and biomass production and the landscape's ability to conserve water decreases even on flat plains and gentle slopes. Generally, the abundance of perennial grasses and shrubs decreases with increasing slope and grazing. Dominance is shifted towards shrubs and annuals. As a management recommendation we suggest that different vegetation growth forms should not only be regarded as forage producers but also as regulators of ecosystem functioning. Particularly on sloping range lands, a high percentage of cover by perennial vegetation insures that water is retained in the system.";"Popp, Alexander

Unfortunately, little is known about how competition control affects initial seedling survival and subsequent investment returns for hardwood plantations. This study examines five alternative competition control regimes for southern oak establishment. The regimes include no site preparation, disking only, sub-soiling with rotary mowing, herbicides only, and herbicides with rotary mowing and sub-soiling. The analysis includes both before- and after-tax estimates of land expectation value (LEV) for comparing alternatives. Our results suggest that greater returns can be achieved for southern oak plantations in Mississippi during both good and bad rainfall years using herbicides only or herbicides with rotary mowing and sub-soiling for competition control. Applying intensive competition control during the first year yields after-tax LEVs of $577.64 to $691.66 per hectare despite precipitation levels. Not applying competition control yields after-tax LEVs from $84.43 to $502.06 per hectare.";"Grebner, Donald L.

"AGRIS:US201400189060";"Temporary conservation for urban biodiversity";"";"Urban habitats, particularly wastelands and brownfields, maintain rich biodiversity and offer habitat for many species, even rare and endangered taxa. However, such habitats are also under socio-economic pressures due to redevelopment for housing and industrial uses. In order to maintain urban biodiversity, it is currently unknown how much open area must be preserved and whether conservation is possible without complete exclusion from economic development. In this study, we applied a simulation model based on species distribution models for plants, grasshoppers, and leafhoppers to investigate planning options for urban conservation with special focus on business areas. Altogether, we modelled the occurrence of 81 species of the urban species pool and analysed settings of different proportions of open sites, different habitat turnover times, and different lot sizes. Our simulations demonstrated that dynamic land use supports urban biodiversity in terms of species richness and rarity. Setting aside brownfields before redevelopment for a period of on average 15years supported the highest conservation value. Consequently, we recommend integrating the concept of ‘temporary conservation’ into urban planning for industrial and business areas. This concept requires habitat to be destroyed by redeveloping brownfield sites to built-up sites, but simultaneously creating new open spaces due to abandonment of urban land uses at other locations. This maintains a spatio-temporal mosaic of different successional stages ranging from pioneer to pre-forest communities.";"Kattwinkel, Mira

The effects of land use change on greenhouse gases and climate change are receiving greater attention in many developing countries. We simulated changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) pool over 100 years (1950-2050) under managed dense Shorea forest (DS), rainfed upland (Bari) and irrigated low land (Khet) of Pokhare Khola, a mid-hill watershed of Nepal, using the Century model. The model was calibrated and parameterized on the basis of biophysical and weather data of the watershed and field measurements made in September/October 2004. Historic C pool data were calculated using the IPCC inventory guidelines for the year 1976 and 1989. The Century model performed well in representing the effects of various land management systems on SOC in the Pokhare Khola watershed. There was a dramatic loss of SOC following the removal of tree biomass and conversion to agriculture. However, it was shown that partial recovery of lost SOC is possible through better forest management, especially if erosion is abated. In the cultivated land we found better recovery by addition of farm yard manure and fertilizer. In all the land use systems, the SOC recovery was lower under the climate change scenario than under prevailing climate.";"Shrestha, B.M.

Although the recent swings in prices for oil may slow down these surges in supply and demand, production of biofuels from food remain profitable above $50/barrel making the biofuel market viable. Here we use municipality-level data for the state of São Paulo in Brazil to explore the effects of fires associated with sugarcane cultivation on respiratory health of elderly and children. We examined the effects of fires occurring in the same year in which respiratory cases were reported as well as chronic effects associated with long-term cultivation of sugarcane. Across the state, respiratory morbidity attributable to fires accounted for 113 elderly and 317 child cases, approximately 1.8% of total cases in each group. Although no chronic effects of fire were detected for the elderly group, an additional 650 child cases can be ascribed to the long-term cultivation of sugar cane increasing to 5.4% the percent of children cases that can be attributed to fire. For municipalities with greater than 50% of the land in sugarcane the percentage increased to 15% and 12%, respectively, for elderly and children. An additional 209 child cases could also be attributed to past exposure to fires associated with sugarcane, suggesting that in total 38% of children respiratory cases could be attributed to current or chronic exposure to fires in these municipalities. The harmful effects of cane-associated fires on health are not only a burden for the public health system but also for household economies. This type of information should be incorporated into land use decisions and discussions of biofuel sustainability.";"Uriarte, María

In order to identify female caribou habitat requirements, we conducted a fine-scale habitat selection analysis in a managed forest of eastern Canada. Five land-cover types used by 8 female caribou during 2 periods (winter and snow-free) were considered to characterize structural attributes, ground cover, and lichen abundance at 320 GPS locations and at 200 random points within home ranges. Because caribou rely on a limited food supply in winter, we predicted that they would select sites of higher biomass of terrestrial and/or arboreal lichens. Since female caribou (especially those with calves) are more vulnerable to predation during the snow-free period, we predicted that they would select sites where predation would be reduced by a denser hiding cover (i.e., high basal area, shrub height, and/or lateral cover) or by a lower forage availability for alternative prey (i.e., low shrub density). Within each land-cover type, comparisons between used and random sites were conducted using an exploratory PCA analysis followed by conditional logistic regressions. Our results demonstrated that, in winter, female caribou selected sites with higher terrestrial lichen biomass or ericaceous shrub cover in old spruce stands and old cutovers. During the snow-free period, female caribou did not select sites of denser hiding cover. However, well-regenerated shrub layer was avoided during both periods, suggesting that caribou avoided sites containing abundant forage attractive to moose and, consequently, wolf. At a fine scale, forest management should focus on protecting sites or stands with a high biomass of terrestrial lichens. Silvicultural practices that prevent cutovers from regenerating into areas with abundant moose forage should also be favoured.Nomenclature: Marie-Victorin, 1995; Farrar, 1996; Brodo et al., 2001, Feldhamer et al., 2003.";"Briand, Yves

In this context, we ask to what extent a small, marginal Quercus suber (Cork oak) population located in the eastern Iberian Peninsula (Valencia, Spain) has the capacity for self‐regeneration and what are the factors that determine its recruitment variability. Location: Quercus suber forest in Pinet (Valencia, Spain). Methods: We performed a spatially explicit sampling both of the recruitment and of the potential parameters that could account for the recruitment variability. Using regression techniques we model the recruitment occurrence and abundance, and then we test to what extent the model obtained is still constrained by the spatial dependence. Results: Quercus suber recruitment density ranges from 0 to 18.66 individuals/25m² (mean = 1.46, SD = 2.8), with a very skewed distribution. Recruitment is similar under Q. suber forests and under Pinus forests, but it is almost absent under shrublands. Thus the parameters that explain most of the recruitment variability in local vegetation types are: the presence and cover of shrubs (negative relationship with recruitment), the basal area of Q. suber and Pinus and the amount of bare soil (all positively related to recruitment). These parameters are strongly related to the ecological processes driving recruitment (i.e. dispersal and predation) and they remove most of the spatial dependence of recruitment. Most recruiters, however, are small, forming a seedling bank rather than growing to successfully colonize new habitats. Conclusion: The results suggest that although recruitment densities are not very high, they do not limit potential regeneration in the Pinet Q. suber forest. However, successful regeneration is not observed. If we aim to increase the Pinet Q. suber population size, land management measures need to provide appropriate conditions for both seedling establishment in shrublands (e.g. shrub clearing) and seedling growth in woodlands (e.g. Pinus logging).";"Pausas, J.G.

"AGRIS:US2016209463";"Impact of Foreign Intellectual Property Rights Protection on U.S. Exports and FDI";"";"Since the early 1990s, there has been a growing interest in the potential contribution of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection to global trade and investment. However, there is an ongoing debate among analysts regarding the extent to which stronger IPR actually stimulate international transactions via transfer of technology. This paper addresses this issue by evaluating how foreign intellectual property rights (IPR) protection affects how U.S. firms serve overseas markets through exports and foreign direct investment (FDI). Using  panel data from 53 countries over 1994-2006, the empirical analysis was based on a dynamic system GMM modeling framework. The empirical results suggest that IPR has a weak negative effect on U.S. exports, but a statistically significant positive effect on U.S. FDI.  In addition, the results also indicated that less US exports flow to countries with weak imitative ability after they strengthen IPR protection.

The western US, especially California, dominates current production of both fresh and processed fruits and vegetables. Constraints in land and water resources in California suggest that some shifts in production could occur in the future if production is matched to self sufficiency. Opportunities exist for production to increase in the eastern half of the US where water is abundant, especially for processed products. Even regions with long winters, such as the northeast, could be self sufficient in fruits and vegetables. Past responses of agriculture to producing more healthy products include vegetable oils, low fat milk and greater production of poultry. Crop improvement programs have not included nutrition and health characteristics as a guiding principle and much potential to improve these traits in fruits and vegetables exists. Greater understanding of the effects of environmental and management factors on crop 'quality' is needed and strategies to produce nutritionally consistent products should be developed.";"Duxbury, J.M.

A Danish rural-urban perspective";"";"This paper introduces the concept of “spatial location satisfaction” and examines its relation to the individual demand for homeownership. Based on a Danish questionnaire survey carried out in a rural study area (N = 1,000) and in an urban study area (N = 1,015), a tenure choice model was estimated relating spatial location satisfaction to homeownership, while adjusting for control variables. The spatial location satisfaction variable was constructed from two questionnaire items asking respondents to state their actual and preferred place of settlement given five location type options: large city, medium-sized city, small town, village, and “in the countryside”. As hypothesised, the study shows a strong association between spatial location satisfaction and the individual demand for homeownership. This association is robust across study areas. Spatial location satisfaction is highest in the rural study area and explains about 6% of the rural-urban difference in homeownership rates. The identification of a positive association between spatial location satisfaction and homeownership adds credibility to population surveys that measure the correspondence between actual and preferred location type. This, in turn, provides increased impetus to use such survey data as one of the tools in formulating regional planning policies.";"Sørensen, Jens Fyhn Lykke";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301878538";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10901-010-9178-5";"";"";"";"313-330"
"AGRIS:US201301958070";"Irrigated land retirement";"";"Land retirement is ceasing irrigation with the goal of reducing load, in general, of dissolved constituents and, in particular, of trace elements, present in subsurface drainage generated from irrigated lands. Retirement is achieved through a process of goal setting, strategy development and determining effects, developing land selection criteria, implementation, and monitoring. In this study, effects of land retirement are evaluated using hydrologic,soil and economic models as well as results from a field demonstration study. From the modeling and field monitoring, a process is developed to meet the goals of a land retirement program in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Potential negative effects listed for land retirement included loss of agricultural productivity, perhaps permanently, and loss of revenue to surrounding communities. Uncertainties included those associated with reuse of retired lands as wildlife habitat, with retired-land maintenance including dust control, with potential preservation of retired lands in reserve for future re-introduction to irrigated or dry-land agriculture, and with institutional changes concerning repayment of federal and state water contracts. Benefits would accrue from economic return to the landowner from the sale of property, the sale or lease of irrigation water supply, the reduced cost of handling drainage, and allocation of freed-up water to beneficial uses, and the reduced risk of selenium exposure to fish and wildlife. A recommended sequential approach to select and manage retired land is to identify primary objectives; formulate and implement area-specific land retirement scenarios; measure biologic, hydrologic, soils and economic consequences in the short term and the long term and manage and monitor retired lands based on dynamic biologic, hydrologic and soil conditions.";"Wallender, W.

"AGRIS:US201500205350";"Simulating streamflow on regulated rivers using characteristic reservoir storage patterns derived from synthetic remote sensing data";"";"This study presents a method to estimate streamflow in rivers regulated by lakes or reservoirs using synthetic satellite remote sensing data. To illustrate the approach, the new reservoir routing method is integrated into the Hillslope River Routing model, and a case study is presented for the highly regulated river in the Cumberland River basin (46,400 km²). The study period is April–May 2000, which contains a significant flood event that occurred in 1–2 May 2000. The model is shown to capture storage/release characterises in eight reservoirs with a mean normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 20% for entire simulation period and 27% for the May flood event. These errors are 69 and 75%, respectively, less than the NRMSE if reservoirs are not included in the model. Given the limitations of satellite missions, the impacts of the revisit cycles and operational periods are quantified. We used 26 observation sets of satellite altimetry over Cumberland River basin that are generated by considering both repeat cycles and satellite operation periods. For the revisit cycles, increasing the interval of repeat cycle leads to a corresponding increase of mean NRMSE from 27 to 59% as a result of sampling fewer flood events and smoothing of the change in storage signal as a result of longer intervals between visits. For the operation periods, the impact of data periods is limited because of the strong seasonal pattern of reservoir operations. Overall, the results suggest that the generalized routing model derived from reservoir stage observations can be used to simulate reservoir operating conditions, which can be used in forecasting hydrologic impacts of land cover or climate change.

"AGRIS:US201500003733";"Simple models of carbon and nitrogen cycling in New Zealand hill country pastures: exploring impacts of intensification on soil C and N pools";"";"Concerns about climate change and water quality make it necessary to have a better understanding of the cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) within landscapes. In New Zealand, pastoral farming on hill country is a major land use, and there is little information available at a landscape level on the cycling of C and N within these systems, particularly the impacts of land use intensification. Published information on the individual components of C and N cycles in hill country pastoral systems was used to construct simple C and N models for two notional hill country paddocks with contrasting amounts of annual net herbage accumulation (NHA). These simple models of C and N cycling were used to explore the potential impacts of intensification on soil C and N pools. The C and N models constructed illustrate that both the C and N cycles in hill country pastoral farming are characterised by large fluxes in and out of the system and relatively small annual accumulations or depletions of their respective soil pools. The mechanisms by which these inward and outward fluxes are generated differ greatly between C and N. Most of the C cycling through the soil/plant/animal system in a year is sourced from the atmosphere through photosynthesis in that same year and the annual quantity of C ingested by grazing animals is only approximately 25% of that fixed annually. In contrast, the annual quantity of N ingested by grazing animals is 300–400% of that added to the system annually by fixation, and most of this ingested N (>80%) is returned to the soil in animal excreta. This contrasts with <25% of ingested C returned in animal excreta. Grazing animals, with their propensity to exhibit camping behaviour, are therefore much more influential in the spatial redistribution of N than C in hill country pastures. The simple C and N models presented in this paper indicate that while land use intensification results in increased inputs of both C and N to the soil, intensification is also likely to result in increased losses of C and N from the soil pool. Which of these processes dominates in a given situation determines whether intensification will result in an increase or decrease of soil C and N. Based on a simple C model, we postulate that if intensification increases NHA by one unit there is likely to be an increase in soil C unless at the same time increased grazing pressure results in at least a three-unit increase in dry matter eaten/harvested.";"Hoogendoorn, CJ

Widely used systems involving classifying optical satellite data can underestimate degradation, and by classifying the landscape ignore the natural heterogeneity of biomass.Aims: To assess the ability of repeat L-band radar to detect areas of small increases or decreases in above-ground biomass (AGB) across a Miombo woodland landscape.Methods: ALOS PALSAR L-band cross-polarised (HV) radar data from 2007 and 2009 were used to create maps of AGB, calibrated using 58 field plots. The change in AGB was assessed for land parcels with known landcover histories: (i) 500 ha of new agroforestry; (ii) 9500 ha of protected (REDD) areas; and (iii) 23 ha of land where degradation occurred between 2007 and 2009.Results: Increases in AGB were detected in both the agroforestry and REDD areas (0.4 and 1.1 Mg C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, respectively), while the degraded areas showed a decrease of 3 Mg C ha⁻¹ year⁻¹.Conclusions: PALSAR data can be used to detect losses and gains in AGB in woodland ecosystems.

Salinization is especially severe in the dry lowlands world-wide and in Central Asia where large amounts of salts accumulated in the soil profile, originating from shallow saline groundwater (GW). Analysis of the unique dataset of 2000 monitoring wells of GW table and salinity in lowland Khorezm region of Uzbekistan over the period of 1990 till 2006 showed shallow GW levels of 1.1–1.4m (±0.48–0.66m) at start of leaching periods and 0.9–1.4 (±0.43–0.63m) in July during the annual growing seasons. While leaching efficiency is decreased, shallow GW in July is far above the optimum levels of 1.4–1.5m. The effects of topography, soil texture, and irrigation and drainage networks were found to favor shallow GW forced by excessive water diversion. The drainage network, which is seen by many specialists as underdeveloped and its improvement necessary to arrest unacceptable GW levels, is being used under its full capacity. The solution to alleviate land degradation is not only an improved drainage, but better controlled and more flexible water management.";"Ibrakhimov, Mirzakhayot

The suitability of ecological conditions for sustaining the targets of conservation is an important consideration in evaluating candidate conservation sites. We constructed two fuzzy logic-based knowledge bases to determine the conservation suitability of land units in the interior Columbia River basin using NetWeaver software in the Ecosystem Management Decision Support application framework. Our objective was to assess the sensitivity of suitability ratings, derived from evaluating the knowledge bases, to fuzzy logic function parameters and to the removal of data layers (land use condition, road density, disturbance regime change index, vegetation change index, land unit size, cover type size, and cover type change index). The amount and geographic distribution of suitable land polygons was most strongly altered by the removal of land use condition, road density, and land polygon size. Removal of land use condition changed suitability primarily on private or intensively-used public land. Removal of either road density or land polygon size most strongly affected suitability on higher-elevation US Forest Service land containing small-area biophysical environments. Data layers with the greatest influence differed in rank between the two knowledge bases. Our results reinforce the importance of including both biophysical and socio-economic attributes to determine the suitability of land units for conservation.

"AGRIS:US201500179428";"Addressing the spatiotemporal sampling design of MODIS to provide estimates of the fire radiative energy emitted from Africa";"";"Satellite-based estimates of the fire radiative power (FRP) and energy (FRE) emitted from open biomass burning are affected by the spatiotemporal resolution of polar-orbiting and geostationary sensors. Here the impacts of the MODIS sampling design on estimates of FRE are characterized by superimposing the timing and extents of the Terra and Aqua granules onto the SEVIRI active fire product. Results for different land-cover types across Africa indicate that the FRE measured by SEVIRI during eight days is linearly related to the sum of FRP measured by SEVIRI within the MODIS granules. These relationships are least variable during the height of the fire season when diurnal cycles of FRP measured by SEVIRI are most consistent. Relationships between FRE and the sum of FRP developed using the SEVIRI active fire product are directly applied to the sum of FRP retrieved from the MODIS Terra and Aqua Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) fire products. Estimates of FRE from MODIS herein agree within 5% of those obtained from previously published methods, but remain a factor of 0.72 times those obtained by adjusting SEVIRI measurements of FRE to account for low spatial resolution detection biases. An examination of the MODIS scan geometry suggests that the latter underestimation is attributed to the coupling between a MODIS imaging artefact referred to as the “bow-tie” effect and the typical calculation used to retrieve the sum of FRP from the MODIS CMG fire products. Depending on the availability of MODIS scan angle information, we offer rigorous and simplified calculations to account for the bow-tie effect. Applying the simplified adjustment to the MODIS CMG fire products yields national estimates of monthly FRE that are 1.44 times greater than originally predicted.";"Freeborn, Patrick H.

We found that an increase in landowner ties to others, and specifically forestry professionals, was associated with greater application of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water quality, but may also increase landowners' perceived difficulty with the timber harvest process. Landowner enrollment in a forestry incentive program were noted; program enrollees tended to have larger networks, slightly higher BMP application ratings, and rated their process and overall perceptions of the harvest lower than non-program enrollees. We discuss the important contribution of understanding social networks surrounding private forest management decisions as relevant to sustainable forestry goals.

"AGRIS:US201500179421";"Hierarchical mapping of Northern Eurasian land cover using MODIS data";"";"The Northern Eurasian land mass encompasses a diverse array of land cover types including tundra, boreal forest, wetlands, semi-arid steppe, and agricultural land use. Despite the well-established importance of Northern Eurasia in the global carbon and climate system, the distribution and properties of land cover in this region are not well characterized. To address this knowledge and data gap, a hierarchical mapping approach was developed that encompasses the study area for the Northern Eurasia Earth System Partnership Initiative (NEESPI). The Northern Eurasia Land Cover (NELC) database developed in this study follows the FAO-Land Cover Classification System and provides nested groupings of land cover characteristics, with separate layers for land use, wetlands, and tundra. The database implementation is substantially different from other large-scale land cover datasets that provide maps based on a single set of discrete classes. By providing a database consisting of nested maps and complementary layers, the NELC database provides a flexible framework that allows users to tailor maps to suit their needs. The methods used to create the database combine empirically derived climate–vegetation relationships with results from supervised classifications based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The hierarchical approach provides an effective framework for integrating climate–vegetation relationships with remote sensing-based classifications, and also allows sources of error to be characterized and attributed to specific levels in the hierarchy. The cross-validated accuracy was 73% for the land cover map and 73% and 91% for the agriculture and wetland classifications, respectively. These results support the use of hierarchical classification and climate–vegetation relationships for mapping land cover at continental scales.";"Sulla-Menashe, Damien

"AGRIS:US201500179425";"Analysis of trends in the Sahelian ‘rain-use efficiency’ using GIMMS NDVI, RFE and GPCP rainfall data";"";"Rain-use efficiency (RUE; the ratio of vegetation productivity to annual precipitation) has been suggested as a measure for assessing land degradation in arid/semi-arid areas. In the absence of anthropogenic influence, RUE has been reported to be constant over time, and any observed change may therefore be attributed to non-rainfall impacts. This study presents an analysis of the decadal time-scale changes in the relationship between a proxy for vegetation productivity (ΣNDVI) and annual rainfall in the Sahel-Sudanian zone of Africa. The aim is to test the quality of data input and the usefulness of both the RUE approach and an alternative method for separating the effects on vegetation productivity of rainfall change and human impact. The analyses are based on earth observation of both rainfall (GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project), 1982–2007 and RFE (Rainfall Estimate) (1996–2007)) and ΣNDVI (AVHRR GIMMS NDVI dataset, 1982–2007). It is shown that the increase in ΣNDVI has been substantial in the Sahel-Sudanian zone over the 1982–2007 period, whereas for the period 1996–2007 the pattern of ΣNDVI trends is more complex. Also, trend analysis of annual rainfall from GPCP data (2.5° resolution) and RFE data (0.1° resolution) suggests that rainfall has increased over both periods. Further it is shown that RUE values are highly correlated to rainfall, undermining the use of earth observation (EO)-based RUE (using ΣNDVI) as a means of separating rainfall impacts from other factors. An alternative method identify temporal trends in residuals of ΣNDVI, after regressing it against annual rainfall, is tested, yet is shown to be useful only where a high correlation between ΣNDVI and annual rainfall exists. For the areas in the Sahel-Sudanian zone for which this condition is fulfilled, trend analyses suggest very limited anthropogenic land degradation in the Sahel-Sudanian zone.";"Fensholt, Rasmus

"AGRIS:US201500179426";"Ecosystem mapping at the African continent scale using a hybrid clustering approach based on 1-km resolution multi-annual data from SPOT/VEGETATION";"";"The goal of this study is to propose a new classification of African ecosystems based on an 8-year analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets from SPOT/VEGETATION. We develop two methods of classification. The first method is obtained from a k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier, which represents a simple machine learning algorithm in pattern recognition. The second method is hybrid in that it combines k-NN clustering, hierarchical principles and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The nomenclature of the two classifications relies on three levels of vegetation structural categories based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). The two main outcomes are: (i) The delineation of the spatial distribution of ecosystems into five bioclimatic ecoregions at the African continental scale; (ii) Two ecosystem maps were made sequentially: an initial map with 92 ecosystems from the k-NN, plus a deduced hybrid classification with 73 classes, which better reflects the bio-geographical patterns. The inclusion of bioclimatic information and successive k-NN clustering elements helps to enhance the discrimination of ecosystems. Adopting this hybrid approach makes the ecosystem identification and labelling more flexible and more accurate in comparison to straightforward methods of classification. The validation of the hybrid classification, conducted by crossing-comparisons with validated continental maps, displayed a mapping accuracy of 54% to 61%.";"Kaptué Tchuenté, Armel Thibaut

"AGRIS:US201400124996";"Property-Rights Approach to Understanding Regulations and Practices in Community-Based Forest Management: Comparison of Three Systems in the Philippines";"";"Decentralizing property rights from state control to user communities has encouraged people’s participation in forest management. Relatively few studies, however, examine the forest regulations required for exercising such property rights. To address this issue, Schlager and Ostrom’s ‘bundle of rights’ framework was used to examine various forms of property rights and regulations in three systems of community-based forest management. The field research was undertaken in the northern Philippines, using eight cases of community-based forest management at sites in the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Ifugao. Local communities were found to informally retain the authority to create locally crafted property rights and regulations in a central government-initiated program. While forest regulations and practices prescribed at the national level have improved forest conditions, the flow of forest benefits to communities has been limited because of decentralization without devolution of authority. A case study of a site initiated by a local government indicated that the transfer of responsibility from the central government to local government units can create more favourable conditions for the flow of forest benefits to communities. But due to a lack of clarity about devolution of cutting permits and about the locations of afforested critical watershed areas, authorized local users lose their authorization. When forest is managed traditionally, communities can have more assured rights than in government-initiated programs, particularly in relation to tree ownership. This is because individuals have the authority to devise collective-choice rights as well as operational rights.";"Hlaing, Ei Ei Swe

Yet integrated approaches to natural forest management remain elusive across the tropics. In this paper we examine one combination of uses: selective harvesting of timber and non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction. We analyze the current status of this combination and speculate on prospects and challenges regarding: (i) resource inventory, (ii) ecology and silviculture, (iii) conflict in the use of multipurpose tree species, (iv) wildlife conservation and use, (v) tenure, and (vi) product certification. Our conclusions remain preliminary due to the relative paucity of published studies and lessons learned on what has worked and what has not in the context of integrated management for timber and NTFPs. We propose at least three ways where further research is merited. One, in improving ‘opportunistic' situations driven by selective timber harvesting that also enhance NTFP values. Two, to explicitly enhance both timber and NTFP values through targeted management interventions. Three, to explicitly assess biophysical, social, regulatory and institutional aspects so that combined benefits are maximized. Interventions for enhancing the compatibility of timber and NTFP extraction must be scaled in relation to the size of the area being managed, applied timber harvesting intensities, and the dynamics of multi-actor, forest partnerships (e.g., between the private sector and local communities). In addition, training and education issues may have to be re-crafted with multiple-use management approaches inserted into tropical forestry curricula.";"Guariguata, Manuel R.

A model is proposed and fitted to annual data for seven European Union countries, 1984-1995.  We find strong impacts of both incentives and institutions on private agricultural R&D investment, and including institutional factors strengthens the story and in some cases changes greatly the results. In particular, we reject the hypothesis that quality of property rights does not matter.  We find that stronger contract enforcement, more efficient public bureaucracies, and stronger patent rights lead to larger aggregate private agricultural R&D investment, other things equal.  Furthermore, we show that the impact of a country's patent rights on private agricultural R&D investment is amplified by it also having a more efficient public bureaucracy and a larger stock of agricultural higher education capital.  We also find evidence of public R&D crowding-out private agricultural R&D, which does support recent privatization policies.  Inter-country private R&D spillins increase national agricultural R&D investment.";"Alfranca, Oscar

Sites located at increasing distances from livestock watering points showed greater degrees of landscape organization and soil productive potential. The depositional strata, where resources tended to accumulate, occupied a larger proportion of the landscape as distance increased. Physical and nutrient cycling soil properties improved. All soil chemistry variables except pH and electrical conductivity increased and the trend was most apparent in the top 1 cm of the soil. Increasing erosion closer to water was a key degrading process.

A few striking observations include: As a percentage of total farmland, cultivated land increased. The increase in cultivated land occurred at the expense of pasture and fallow and woodlot. The share of pasture and fallow decreased from 22% in 1990 to 14% in 2002 and woodlot decreased from 11% in 1990 to 7% in 2002. This trend of increasing cultivated land is apparent from the mid-eighties to today. These observations imply that land is being farmed much more intensively without much time to fallow and allow the soil to rejuvenate. Pasture and woodlot are also being cut down at the expense of cultivation. This has important potential implications for productivity as well as for the environment. Average calorie production per person per day in Rwanda is believed to have dropped significantly during the war period, and then has increased on average in 2002 to levels near those measured in 1984.

"AGRIS:US201400036511";"Birds, beasts and bovines: three cases of pastoralism and wildlife in the USA";"";"BACKGROUND: Pastoralism in the USA began coincidently with the initiation of profound ecological change resulting from colonization in the sixteenth century. Relationships between pastoralism and wildlife conservation in three different contexts of land tenure, environmental legacy, and geography are examined. RESULTS: On the federal rangelands of the Intermountain West, based on limited scientific information, wildlife policy has been interpreted to require separation of native bighorn sheep from livestock to prevent disease transmission. Ignored are the possible long term and broad scale impacts of removing grazing on the ecosystem and the ‘social disturbance’ to local communities. In southwestern deserts, the implementation of wildlife policy exemplifies the contradictions between conservation of individuals versus populations, and fire suppression and grazing removal as ‘inactions’ requiring no review versus grazing and burning as ‘actions’ requiring regulation and control. In California’s Mediterranean rangeland, wildlife policy under the Endangered Species Act is at once a regulatory burden and an opportunity for ranchers. The opportunities result from an evolving recognition that cessation of grazing can harm wildlife. CONCLUSIONS: In all three cases, the environment has changed and is changing due to ecosystem engineering that alters the resources available to wildlife and plant species. Grazing offers potential benefits as a management tool, and pastoralism a means of maintaining un-fragmented landscapes. Yet, absent adequate ecological information, the assumptions of innate conflict between livestock and wildlife, and that cessation of grazing is not an action, as well as the norms of a politically popular yet ecologically unsupportable discourse of restoration, fill in the gaps.";"Huntsinger, Lynn

The main objective was to identify areas with major symptoms of degradation, such as rills and gullies, and determine the main causal factor(s), whether cultivation or grazing. Thus, areas of varying intensity of cultivation and livestock grazing were delineated and detailed field investigations for evidence of degradation carried out. Three maps, population density, cultivation intensity and livestock grazing blocks were produced and examined in detail to establish the role of each in land degradation and a forth map, erosion intensity produced. The results obtained show more symptoms of degradation (78.26%) in the cultivated sites. It was therefore argued that in Adamawa State there is evidence of a reversal of the tragedy of the commons\' thesis, where farmlands, which are more privately and permanently owned than grazing lands, appeared more degraded. The implications of this two resources use policy formulation were highlighted.Key Words: Farmlands, grazing lands, land degradation, population growth and tragedy of the commons.

"AGRIS:US201500217623";"Considering the social dimension of invasive species: the case of buffel grass";"";"The status of many invasive plant species that are also of high commercial value is contentious. Management of negative impacts depends on the support and co-operation of people who regard the species as an asset. For example, buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) is highly prized by many pastoralists in Australia as an introduced pasture grass for livestock but it also has significant and deleterious environmental impacts. Identifying management strategies that minimise environmental impacts yet support production benefits is crucial for achieving sustainable outcomes. We present and operationalise a framework for assessing social and economic dependency on buffel grass and the capacity of pastoralists to change their buffel grass management. We interviewed 85 pastoralists across four diverse regions in Australian rangelands and found that pastoralists are dependent on buffel grass for a range of social and economic reasons and to varying degrees. These social and economic components of resource dependency were significantly correlated with the capacity to cope with, and adapt to, change and with attitudes towards managing buffel grass on grazing lands and on public land of high environmental value such as National Parks. Understanding how pastoralists identified the costs and benefits of buffel grass also enabled us to understand pastoralist perceptions of acceptable management strategies. Building strong social networks amongst buffel grass stakeholders will be a priority for the development of sustainable buffel grass management strategies. We argue that dealing with contentious environmental species will not be possible without considering the social dimension.";"Marshall, N.A.

Landscape pattern could be a significant driver in invasion processes in parallel with land-use legacy. Fragmentation of natural habitats combined with the availability of propagules from the surrounding matrix may enhance the invisibility of ecological communities. Based on multitemporal land cover maps (1954–2008) and a floristic database, we analyzed how habitat fragmentation, propagule pressure and land-use legacy have affected alien plants’ presence and richness on natural dune patches along the Lazio Coast (Central Italy). Floristic data were derived from an existing geo-database of random vegetation plots (64 m²). A set of landscape patch-based metrics, considered to be adequate proxies of the main processes affecting alien invasion and richness, was calculated. First, we fit a generalized linear model (GLM) with binomial errors to assess which landscape metrics are influencing patch invasion. Second, we extracted invaded patches and, with GLMs, we investigated how landscape metrics affect average alien species richness. Alien invasion and alien richness seem to be affected by different processes: although alien invasion of each patch is strongly associated with its land-use legacy, the richness of aliens is more affected by landscape fragmentation and by the propagule pressure to which patch is exposed. By integrating spatial and temporal landscape metrics with floristic data, we were able to disentangle the relations of landscape fragmentation, propagule pressure and land-use legacy with the presence and richness of alien plants. The methodological approach here adopted could be easily extended to other alien species and ecosystems, offering scientifically sound support to prevent the high economic costs derived from both the control and the eradication of aliens.";"Malavasi, Marco

"AGRIS:US201600126348";"critical re-evaluation of controls on spatial and seasonal variations in nitrate concentrations in river waters throughout the River Derwent catchment in North Yorkshire, UK";"";"Since mean nitrate concentration along single river channels increases significantly with percent arable land use upstream of sampling points and autumn/early winter flushes in nitrate concentration are widespread, it is generally concluded that farmers contribute most of the nitrate. For the River Derwent in North Yorkshire, the correlation between nitrate concentration and percent arable land use is much poorer when tributary data are included in the equation, because of greater variations in dilution by water draining upland areas and in other N input sources. For the whole river system therefore, percent upland moorland/rough grazing land cover is an appreciably better predictor than percent arable land use for nitrate concentration. Upland land use encompasses the higher precipitation and runoff in such areas, and the subsequent greater dilution downstream of both arable land runoff and effluent from treatment works, as well as an inverse correlation to percent arable land use. This is strongly supported by the observation that, for the Derwent, Meteorological Office rainfall data alone proved even better than percent moorland rough grazing for predicting nitrate concentration. The dilution effect is therefore substantial but highly seasonal; lower runoff and dilution in summer offset the lower leaching losses from arable land, and higher dilution and runoff in winter offset greater nitrate leaching losses from arable soils. Because of this, coupled to improved efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer use, seasonality trends in nitrate concentrations that were pronounced a decade ago now have all but disappeared in the catchment.";"Begum, Shaheen

The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) was higher in clear-cut land (Q10 = 6.7) than that in primary forest (3.7) and secondary forest (3.0), indicating that soil respiration in clear-cut land was more sensitive to temperature change. Annual soil respiration was 3330.2 g carbon dioxide (CO ₂) m ⁻² year ⁻¹, 2358.9 g CO ₂ m ⁻² year ⁻¹ and 4162.8 g CO ₂ m ⁻² year ⁻¹ for primary forest, secondary forest and clear-cut land, respectively. Our findings provided valuable information for understanding the effect of forest ecosystem change and land management on soil respiration in high-elevation subalpine ecosystems.";"Chen, Youchao

To understand these constraints, we characterized distributions of 15 herbivore species from water, locations of peak density and degree of clustering around the peaks using zero-inflated count data models and mapping census data collected in the Mara reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in Kenya during a wet and dry year. Herbivores followed a humped pattern (n� =� 46), suggesting constrained foraging in which they balance the benefits of proximity to water with the costs of foraging where food is depleted near water and travelling to more abundant food distant from water; an exponentially decreasing pattern (n� =� 11), indicating strong attraction to water or vegetation near water; or a uniform (n� =� 3) pattern. The details rather than the types of these patterns varied between years. Herbivores concentrated farther from water and more tightly around locations of their peak densities in the ranches than the reserve. Herbivores were more abundant and widely distributed from water in the wet than the dry year, and segregated along the distance-to-water gradient, presumably to minimize interspecific competition for food. Pastoralism compressed herbivore distributions and partially excluded some species (warthog, hartebeest, topi, wildebeest, zebra, eland, buffalo and elephant) from, while attracting others (Grant’s and Thomson’s gazelles, impala, giraffe) to the ranches, relative to the reserve. Regulating cultivation, fencing, settlements and livestock stocking levels in the ranches would allow continued wildlife access to water, reduce competition with, displacement or harassment of wildlife by people, livestock and dogs near water.";"Ogutu, Joseph O.

Declining by 98 percent since 1920, black farmers have suffered losses attributable to public policy, economic pressures, and racial oppression. All of these factors must be addressed if African-American farmers are to survive. In this paper, we use Census of Agriculture data and a follow-on survey in one Mississippi Delta county to review the current situation of black farmers. We introduce the concept of ""re-entering farmers"" to suggest that a significant number of black farmers, who are not defined as ""farmers"" by the Census, still own land and want to farm again. The first section of the paper provides a brief overview of the historical and current trends of black farmers in the United States. The second section discusses Delta County, drawing upon our survey and the Census of Agriculture. The third section discusses the implications of civil rights violations by the former Farmers Home Administration of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Finally, we conclude with a policy recommendation to slow the drastic decline of African-American farmers.";"Wood, Spencer D.

As biomass markets emerge, businesses will need to adapt to meet operational requirements. Logging businesses that supplied biomass for energy production in Virginia were surveyed regarding operations and attitudes. Results show that businesses across a broad range of total production levels (150 to 6250 tons/wk) harvested biomass and roundwood using integrated harvesting operations with whole tree chippers. Businesses had produced biomass an average of 6.8 years. Sixty-one percent of operations utilized a single loader at the landing for processing roundwood and biomass. Biomass accounted for an average of 28 percent of each respondents total reported production and was often produced with relatively large (median = 600 horsepower) chippers with an average age of 12.5 years. Characteristics of operations where business owners agreed they profited from biomass production were compared with those that were neutral or disagreed. Business owners that agreed they profited had an average investment of $188,500 in biomass production equipment, versus $377,143 for the neutral/disagree group (P = 0.02). Respondents indicated they were more likely to begin harvesting biomass to satisfy landowners and diversify operations rather than in response to encouragement from consuming facilities. Most owners viewed biomass harvesting positively and plan to continue production in the future.";"Barrett, Scott M.

These factors point to a need for loggers capable of profitably harvesting small parcels of timber. A series of in-person interviews were conducted with representatives of 15 Wisconsin logging firms previously identified as successful at harvesting small parcels of timber. Ninety-two percent of mechanized loggers had harvested parcels of 10 acres and smaller within the past year. Eighty-five percent of mechanized loggers were willing to harvest parcels as small as 5 acres assuming that only a short move (<5 mi) was required between timber sales. The average direct moving cost for mechanized loggers was $406 per move, versus an estimated $778 when the costs of idle employees and equipment are included. Seventy-seven percent of the participants in this study purchased at least half of the timber that they harvested, and 85 percent performed services other than timber harvesting, such as establishing food plots, as a procurement tool. This study demonstrates that properly equipped Wisconsin loggers are profitably harvesting small parcels of timber; however, loggers and other timber buyers must recognize the additional costs associated with these harvests and adjust stumpage rates to compensate for these costs.";"Conrad, Joseph L.

Although the project has generated substantial environmental benefits, such as erosion reduction, carbon sequestration and water quality improvements, the magnitude of these benefits has not yet been well quantified due to the lack of location-specific data describing the afforestation efforts. Remote sensing is well suited to detect afforestation locations, a prerequisite for estimating the impacts of the project. In this study, we first examined the practicability of using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product to detect afforestation locations; however, the results showed that the MODIS product failed to distinguish the afforestation areas of GGP. Then, we used a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series analysis approach for detecting afforestation locations, applying statistical data to determine the NDVI threshold of converted croplands. The technique provided the necessary information for location of afforestation implemented under GGP, explaining 85% of conversion from cropland to forestlands across all provinces. The coefficients of determination between detected afforestation and statistical areas at the most provinces were more than 0.7 which indicated the high performance. Moreover, more than 60% of GGP locations identified in all the provinces had a slope of over 25°, which was consistent with the main criterion of GGP. These results should enable wide application of the method to evaluate the impacts of the project on regional carbon budgets, water yield and soil erosion.";"Yuan, Wenping

To minimize this threat, it is critical to understand what factors are influencing plant extinction rates. We compiled plant extinction rate data for 22 cities around the world. Two-thirds of the variation in plant extinction rates was explained by a combination of the city's historical development and the current proportion of native vegetation, with the former explaining the greatest variability. As a single variable, the amount of native vegetation remaining also influenced extinction rates, particularly in cities > 200 years old. Our study demonstrates that the legacies of landscape transformations by agrarian and urban development last for hundreds of years, and modern cities potentially carry a large extinction debt. This finding highlights the importance of preserving native vegetation in urban areas and the need for mitigation to minimize potential plant extinctions in the future.";"Hahs, Amy K.

The Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest (UPAF) of South America still holds the world’s southernmost jaguar (Panthera onca) population. Our aims were: (i) to test several a priori hypotheses on the factors affecting jaguar persistence in this region, (ii) to map habitat suitability and identify areas with potentially conflicting habitat conditions, and (iii) to identify priority areas for management and improve the conservation initiatives for jaguars and the UPAF. Following an information-theoretic approach, we used presence records of jaguars and pseudo-absences in generalized linear models. We structured hypotheses into two groups which demand different management actions: land cover and human persecution. The best model of each group was used to develop a two-dimensional habitat model. Jaguar persistence was favoured by current and historical native forest cover, and hindered by human land uses. Protection favoured jaguar presence whereas human accessibility and high human population density had negative effects. The two-dimensional model suggests that <8% (20,670km²) of the landscape represents potential core areas for jaguars (good land-cover characteristics and low human persecution) and 11.8% (32,563km²) stands as potentially attractive sinks where good land-cover conditions conflict with high human persecution. Reduction of human persecution is urgently needed to increase the core areas for jaguars in this region, but improvement of land-cover conditions is important for sustaining the connectivity among jaguar populations that seem to be isolated in different areas of the UPAF.";"De Angelo, Carlos

The study contrasts nine watersheds in southern Maine, which has seen steady urban growth over the study period, with nine rural watersheds from northern Maine. Historical population data and current land cover data are used to develop an urbanization score for each watershed. Trends in watershed urbanization over the study period are compared to trends in ecologically relevant streamflow characteristics. The results indicate that trends in northern, rural watersheds are much more consistent than the trends in the southern watersheds. Additionally, trends in the southern watersheds are inconsistent with the hydrological characteristics observed in urban watersheds elsewhere, likely due to the comparatively low level of current urban development in Maine's urban watersheds. Our study suggests that urban areas in Maine have not yet reached an urbanization threshold where streamflow impacts become consistently detectable.Editor Z.W.

While markets for ecosystem services show potential for increasing forestland value, there is concern that the lack of an integrated program will simply add to the complexity of these services without generating significant public benefits. If not designed properly, these fragmented programs can result in the restoration of many small sites that lack ecological integrity and are unlikely to provide the benefits from protecting larger and more contiguous areas. An integrated approach that combines or bundles services and provides financial incentives for forest landowners may be more effective to achieving broad conservation goals, including enhancing fish and wildlife habitat, improving watershed health, sequestering carbon to mitigate climate change, and providing other ecosystem services at an ecologically relevant scale. We outline some of the policy and regulatory frameworks for some of the emerging markets for ecosystem services in the United States, and discuss the role that different regulatory agencies play for each of these services. We then assess the potential benefits for bundling different ecosystem services such as water quality, wetlands, species conservation, and carbon and describe an integrated accounting protocol for combining these services.";"Deal, Robert L.

Few studies, however, have focused on the circumstances under which mechanical wildfire hazard reduction treatments can yield positive net economic wildfire benefits for landowners and managers. This study describes an economic assessment tool built from a representative area sample frame inventory of hazardous and potentially treatable timberland in twelve western states of the U.S. Base case parameter assumptions about values at risk, timber product prices, stand re-growth following treatment and wildfire impacts enable an initial estimate of the amount of timberland with positive discounted expected net economic benefits under four policy scenarios. These assumptions are then varied in a Monte Carlo simulation to provide some bounds of uncertainty around base case levels. A policy that allowed optimal prescriptions and product sales and which incorporates wildfire costs and benefits would result in more than 25% of treated area with positive net benefits. This is reduced somewhat if wildfire reduction costs and benefits are not considered, and reduced again to 14% when large trees are excluded from product sales. A policy that prohibits sale of products from these treatments results in less than 1% of area with positive net benefits.";"Prestemon, Jeffrey P.

Good governance is often a prerequisite for the development of a REDD+ project. With the scope of determining the governance features for a successful REDD+ project, the research proposes a logical framework for REDD+ project governance assessment. Starting from the Governance of Forests Initiative Toolkit developed by the World Resource Institute, a set of REDD+ governance indicators are selected and applied in two Peruvian REDD+ field case studies. The methodology is then tested on REDD+ projects where no primary information is available.

Our objectives were to determine (i) if forests are encroaching into grasslands, (ii) if rate and extent of encroachment varies by region or with topographic setting, and (iii) if encroachment is related to climate change and variability. Dendroecological techniques were used to obtain dates of establishment for 1847 trees (trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss)) sampled from 28 sites divided between two different regions and three topographic settings. Generalized linear modeling was used to identify relationships between climate and tree establishment. Results show that encroachment of forest, particularly aspen trees, into grasslands has been nearly ubiquitous on flat terrain and on south-facing slopes in both regions over the last 60â80 years. In contrast, spruce-dominated ecotones on north-facing slopes experienced little change. Aspen establishment was positively associated with spring temperatures and precipitation, although evidence suggests that other factors such as soil moisture interact with climate to mediate the timing and rate of tree encroachment. These results indicate that transformation of grasslands to aspen-dominated forest is an additional, but previously unexplored, element of the widespread ecosystem changes currently being experienced in northwestern North America.";"Conway, Alexandra J.

We labeled the microbial biomass with ¹³C-glucose and followed the microbial ¹³C turnover into different SOM pools under the influence of three plant amendments (mature wheat, immature wheat, and vetch) in a laboratory incubation experiment using a soil with two different contents of organic C (0.9 and 1.3 %) owing to different soil management. At the end of incubation, more labeled glucose C was assimilated into microbial biomass in amended samples compared to an unamended control. The addition of plant residues also caused a positive priming effect, enhancing mineralization of soil organic C, which led to overall less glucose-derived C being incorporated into soil C pools. This was more pronounced in the soil with lower soil organic C content. Recovery of microbial C as recalcitrant C ranged between 6.0 and 7.1 %, with no significant effect of initial SOM content and addition of plant materials. Although the short-term fate of C present in microbial biomass was clearly affected by residue additions and initial native SOM, the extent to which it was stabilized as recalcitrant C during this time was not affected and must therefore be controlled by other factors than soil amendments and land management.";"Moreno-Cornejo, Jennifer

The group included representation from landowners, government agencies and scientists. The group was facilitated through an action research approach incorporating three phases: (1) awareness; (2) forecasting; and (3) implementation. The group identified a set of goals and indicators relevant to achieving a “well managed rural hill catchment” The indicators were used to (a) assess the current state of the catchment farm in relation to the goals; (b) evaluate a range of strategies for improving system performance and (c) evaluate progress toward the goals following land use changes implemented within the catchment farm. Key issues for the group included the availability of data and the setting of appropriate performance benchmarks. From both economic and environmental points of view, the existing farm system was failing to meet the goals set by the management group. Key factors driving these outcomes included the physical and productivity limitations of the soil resource, poor livestock performance and poor water quality. A mixture of research observations, decision support models and expert stakeholder knowledge indicated scope for improving performance through forestry, riparian management, erosion control and livestock intensification options. Based on their evaluation of the forecasting results, the group developed a new land use plan, which depended on significant capital investment in land use and enterprise change. Subsequent monitoring of soils, vegetation, water quality, animal production and financial results over four years showed marked improvement in a number of key performance indicators. In particular, sediment and phosphorus loads and faecal coliform levels decreased rapidly, native forest fragments showed early signs of restoration, lamb and beef productivity increased and the per hectare financial returns of the pastoral component increased. Better matching of land use to land capability has led to short-term improvement in some aspects of the economic and environmental performance of the catchment farm. Progress toward a more sustainable agricultural system was achieved, but at a substantial cost for transformation of the biophysical system, which has implications for the wider sector.";"Dodd, M.B.

The largeâscale dieâoff of New England salt marshes was triggered by overfishing and resulted from decades of runaway crab grazing. In 2009, however, cordgrass began to recover, decreasing dieâoff â¼40% by 2010. We used surveys and experiments to test whether plantâsubstrate feedbacks underlie marsh resilience. Initially, grazerâgenerated dieâoff swept through the cordgrass, creating exposed, stressful peat banks that inhibited plant growth. This desertification cycle broke when banks eroded and peat transitioned into mud with fewer herbivores, less grazing, and lower physical stress. Cordgrass reestablished in these areas through a feedback where it engineered a recovery zone by further ameliorating physical stresses and facilitating additional revegetation. Our results reveal that feedbacks can play a critical role in rapid, reversible ecosystem shifts associated with human impacts, and that the interplay of facilitative and consumer interactions should be incorporated into resilience theory.";"Altieri, Andrew H.

The common legal foundation of sovereign power over water resources departed once civil law jurisdictions leveled the demesne on ownership model, by introducing public ownership in the French codification of 1804, while common law jurisdiction developed a broader legal concept of property that includes even the rights to use res communes. The models led respectively to the establishment of administrative systems of water rights and markets of water rights. According to the first, public authorities’ power to manage and preserve water resources is grounded in a derogatory regime, whereby water rights, grounded on licenses or concessions, are neither transferable nor tradeable. On the contrary, environmental and social concerns in water market schemes must be enforced by means of regulation, thus limiting private property rights on water, in compliance with the constitutional and common law constraints set out to protect the minimum content of property as a fundamental human right.";"Roberto Cavallo Perin

Our study area included different land management settings that encapsulate three contrasting styles of management that have developed following European settlement in northern Australia: Decentralized fire management carried out by small Aboriginal communities widely dispersed across a large landscape. Centralized fire management carried out by park rangers and military land managers who implement a fire management plan based on a paradigm of hazard reduction burning. Pastoral properties with a specific management objective of improving cattle yield by protecting and improving pasture with fire. The lowland eucalypt savannas were the most burnt of any vegetation type, but within eucalypt savannas there were subtle differences in fire frequency. The highest fire frequencies were recorded in national park and military lands, intermediate frequencies on Aboriginal lands, and the lowest fire frequencies on pastoral properties. Aboriginal lands had an even distribution of fire throughout the dry season in contrast to the marked bias towards early dry season landscape burning on all Euro-Australian controlled lands. These findings illustrate the impact of different management paradigms and cultural decisions about fire on physical fire patterns.";"Petty, A.M.

Both niche‐based and neutral processes may produce a distance decay relationship; however, disentangling their relative influence requires simultaneous examination of multiple potential drivers. Parasites represent a unique opportunity in which to study distance decay because community dissimilarity may depend on environmental requirements and dispersal capability of parasites as well also those of their hosts. We used big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus and their intestinal helminths to investigate: 1) independent contributions of geographic and environmental distances on dissimilarity of intestinal helminth component communities between populations of big brown bats; 2) which environmental variables best explained variation in community dissimilarity; and 3) whether similar patterns of decay with geographic or environmental distance were observed for within‐host population and within‐individual host parasite communities. We used compositional measures of community dissimilarity to examine how parasite communities may change with geographic distance and varying environmental conditions. Non‐spatial variables strongly influenced compositional parasite community dissimilarity over multiple community scales, and we observed little evidence for spatial processes such as distance decay. Environment surrounding roost sites better predicted helminth community dissimilarity than any other class of variables and landcover classes representing anthropogenic modification consistently explained variation in community structure. Our results indicate that human disturbance drives significant patterns of parasite community dissimilarity, most likely by changing the presence or abundance of intermediate hosts in an area.";"Warburton, Elizabeth M.

In 99 nights, we surveyed 147.2 km and captured 185 animals during nocturnal transects inspection with headlamps. Overall, sex ratio was 1.00:1.01 female/male with significant differences by size/age class and year. Females were slightly larger in total length than males (115.1 Â± 56.9 cm-females, 105.4 Â± 71.8 cm-males). The encounter rate was calculated based on number of animals captured per km of surveyed transect. The C. acutus encounter rate per year was 1.8 ind/km (60 ind/33.5 km/12 places visited) in 2009, 1.0 ind/km (90 ind/87.4 km/18 places visited) in 2010, and 1.3 ind/km (35 ind/26.3 km/8 places visited) in 2012. Based on our spatial analysis, the animals showed a dispersed pattern in most sites on CNP. Captured C. acutus were found in 581.1 kmÂ² total area within 78% natural habitat, including mangroves and beaches, and 22% disturbed habitat on both the mainland and the islands. In addition, the spatial analysis showed reduction in natural land cover; crocodile habitat showed limited conversion to agricultural land use; and we found correlation between crocodile population size and protected areas. The differences between mainland and island populations regarding ecology suggest that a long-term monitoring program for American Crocodiles is necessary to distinguish between natural fluctuations and anthropogenic changes on population dynamics and conservation status.";"Venegas-Anaya, Miryam

"AGRIS:US201600183906";"Influence of Vertical and Horizontal Habitat Structure on Nationwide Patterns of Avian Biodiversity";"";"With limited resources for habitat conservation, the accurate identification of high-value avian habitat is crucial. Habitat structure affects avian biodiversity but is difficult to quantify over broad extents. Our goal was to identify which measures of vertical and horizontal habitat structure are most strongly related to patterns of avian biodiversity across the conterminous United States and to determine whether new measures of vertical structure are complementary to existing, primarily horizontal, measures. For 2,546 North American Breeding Bird Survey routes across the conterminous United States, we calculated canopy height and biomass from the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD) as measures of vertical habitat structure and used land-cover composition and configuration metrics from the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) as measures of horizontal habitat structure. Avian species richness was calculated for each route for all birds and three habitat guilds. Avian species richness was significantly related to measures derived from both the NBCD and NLCD. The combination of horizontal and vertical habitat structure measures was most powerful, yielding high RÂ² values for nationwide models of forest (0.70) and grassland (0.48) bird species richness. New measures of vertical structure proved complementary to measures of horizontal structure. These data allow the efficient quantification of habitat structure over broad scales, thus informing better land management and bird conservation.";"Culbert, Patrick D.

"AGRIS:US201600057822";"Automated integration of lidar into the LANDFIRE product suite";"";"Accurate information about three-dimensional canopy structure and wildland fuel across the landscape is necessary for fire behaviour modelling system predictions. Remotely sensed data are invaluable for assessing these canopy characteristics over large areas; lidar data, in particular, are uniquely suited for quantifying three-dimensional canopy structure. Although lidar data are increasingly available, they have rarely been applied to wildland fuels mapping efforts, mostly due to two issues. First, the Landscape Fire and Resource Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) program, which has become the default source of large-scale fire behaviour modelling inputs for the US, does not currently incorporate lidar data into the vegetation and fuel mapping process because spatially continuous lidar data are not available at the national scale. Second, while lidar data are available for many land management units across the US, these data are underutilized for fire behaviour applications. This is partly due to a lack of local personnel trained to process and analyse lidar data. This investigation addresses these issues by developing the Creating Hybrid Structure from LANDFIRE/lidar Combinations (CHISLIC) tool. CHISLIC allows individuals to automatically generate a suite of vegetation structure and wildland fuel parameters from lidar data and infuse them into existing LANDFIRE data sets. CHISLIC will become available for wider distribution to the public through a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service’s Wildland Fire Assessment System (WFAS) and may be incorporated into the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) with additional design and testing. WFAS and WFDSS are the primary systems used to support tactical and strategic wildland fire management decisions.";"Peterson, Birgit

"AGRIS:DJ2012091835";"Land management strategies for the long-term persistence of boreal woodland caribou in central Saskatchewan";"";"We investigated landscape changes and their potential effects on woodland caribou-boreal ecotype (Rangifer tarandus caribou) within a portion of the Smoothstone-Wapaweka Woodland Caribou Management Unit (SW-WCMU). The SW-WCMU is one of eight areas delineated by the Province of Saskatchewan for potential recovery planning efforts for boreal caribou, and is one of four management units located on the Boreal Plain Ecozone. The Prince Albert Greater Ecosystem (PAGE) study area was selected within the SW-WCMU for intensive study from 2004 - 2008. Studies focused on quantifying a suite of landscape and population parameters. This paper presents a summary of study results to date and recommends land management strategies intended to contribute to the long-term viability of boreal caribou in the central boreal plain ecoregion of Saskatchewan. The PAGE study area has undergone structural changes from an area that historically presented a lesser amount but well connected mature coniferous forest, to a currently larger amount of mature coniferous stands fragmented by a highly developed network of roads and trails. Movement data pointed to highly clustered use of the landscape by small groups of caribou and smaller home ranges when compared to 15 years ago. Calving sites were located within each individual home range in treed peatland and distant from hardwood/mixedwood forest stands, roads and trails access. Adult annual survival rates were low, averaging 73% over the course of the study. In order to ensure a self-sustaining population level, study results clearly point to the need for landscape restoration to reduce the level of anthropogenic disturbances in some key parts of the study area. Key strategies include retention of mature softwood forest interior proximate to local areas of caribou activity, protection of calving habitat, improving structural connectivity, planning disturbances (forest harvesting, fire salvage, resource exploration, access development) in ways to minimize the anthropogenic footprint, and recovery action planning integrated with other land-use planning initiatives.";"A.

"AGRIS:US201300875867";"Environmental Monitoring of Spatio-temporal Changes Using Remote Sensing and GIS in a Mediterranean Wetland of Northern Greece";"";"Loss and degradation of terrestrial and aquatic habitats and degraded water quality are major environmental concerns worldwide. Especially wetlands are sensitive ecosystems that are subject to stress from human activities. Remote sensing techniques have been primarily used to generate information on land cover/use changes. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing can be used to provide a rapid or a large-scale understanding of lake change and in developing lake management strategies. The principal objectives of this study are to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal changes in land cover/use by using GIS, and to determine the main environmental factors affecting these changes. This paper presents a case study for the application of integrated remote sensing and GIS data for the classification and monitoring of the spatial and temporal changes in land use types. The study was conducted in a small natural wetland of Lake Cheimaditida, located in the East Mediterranean region of Northern Greece. Data analysis was conducted using GIS software. During the past several decades Lake Cheimaditida wetland has been influenced by many anthropogenic activities. The variables chosen for the assessment included condition of wetland and lake areas, present extent of wetlands relative to historic area, cover of natural habitat, wetland disturbances, etc. These variables address catchments properties that are important for maintaining and improving wetland habitats and water quality and assessment of trends useful for environmental monitoring. Land cover/land use patterns were assessed and compared using aerial photographs taken in 1945, 1969, 1982, and 1996. Over this period, reed beds enormously increased by 1,655.19%, while open-water areas and peat lands decreased by 74.05 and 99.5%, respectively. The significance of the changes in land cover distribution within the Lake Cheimaditida wetland are discussed in relation to the historical pattern of reed beds colonization, the importance of Phragmites australis in the process and the implications for strategic management of freshwater wetland resources.";"Papastergiadou, E.

"AGRIS:US201500184021";"Modelling long-term water yield effects of forest management in a Norway spruce forest";"";"Intensive forest management is one of the main land cover changes over the last century in Central Europe, resulting in forest monoculture. It has been proposed that these monoculture stands impact hydrological processes, water yield, water quality and ecosystem services. At the Lysina Critical Zone Observatory, a forest catchment in the western Czech Republic, a distributed physics-based hydrologic model, Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), was used to simulate long-term hydrological change under different forest management practices, and to evaluate the comparative scenarios of the hydrological consequences of changing land cover. Stand-age-adjusted LAI (leaf area index) curves were generated from an empirical relationship to represent changes in seasonal tree growth. By consideration of age-adjusted LAI, the spatially-distributed model was able to successfully simulate the integrated hydrological response from snowmelt, recharge, evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, soil moisture and streamflow, as well as spatial patterns of each state and flux. Simulation scenarios of forest management (historical management, unmanaged, clear cutting to cropland) were compared. One of the critical findings of the study indicates that selective (patch) forest cutting results in a modest increase in runoff (water yield) as compared to the simulated unmanaged (no cutting) scenario over a 29-year period at Lysina, suggesting the model is sensitive to selective cutting practices. A simulation scenario of cropland or complete forest cutting leads to extreme increases in annual water yield and peak flow. The model sensitivity to forest management practices examined here suggests the utility of models and scenario development to future management strategies for assessing sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.

In this work is exposed a test of acorns germination of Quercus ilex L. subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp, in the North of Córdoba (Spain), under three environmental conditions corresponding to the most traditional land uses of the dehesa: grazing, cereal sowing and fallow, each one with a different vegetal cover. A fourth group of acorns was placed in a tree nursery under controlled conditions. The effect of the time of acorns placing (beginning of November, end of November and middle of December) was also evaluated. The results showed that both factors, land use and time of placing, had effect in germination of acorns.

El problema de la regeneración natural en las dehesas ha sido y continúa siendo objeto de numerosos estudios, dada la importancia ecológica y económica que tienen estos ecosistemas. En este trabajo se expone un ensayo de germinación de bellotas de Quercus ilex L. subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp, en el término de Pedroche (Córdoba), bajo tres condiciones ambientales propias de otros tantos usos tradicionales de la dehesa: pastoreo, siembra de cereal y barbecho, que presentan distinta cobertura vegetal, más un cuarto grupo que se colocó en un umbráculo bajo condiciones controladas. Al mismo tiempo se evaluó el efecto del momento de colocación (o caída) de la bellota: principio de noviembre; finales de noviembre y mediados de diciembre. Los resultados mostraron diferencias en la germinación de las bellotas colocadas en el umbráculo y las del campo, pero no entre estas últimas. El tipo de vegetación no afectó al proceso de germinación pero sí pudo influir en una mayor predación de las bellotas en la parcela de pastoreo.

"AGRIS:US201300816514";"Neutral models for testing landscape hypotheses";"";"Neutral landscape models were originally developed to test the hypothesis that human-induced fragmentation produces patterns distinctly different from those associated with random processes. Other uses for neutral models have become apparent, including the development and testing of landscape metrics to characterize landscape pattern. Although metric development proved to be significant, the focus on metrics obscured the need for iterative hypothesis testing fundamental to the advancement of the discipline. We present here an example of an alternative neutral model and hypothesis designed to relate the process of landscape change to observed landscape patterns. The methods and program, QRULE, are described and options for statistical testing outlined. The results show that human fragmentation of landscapes results in a non-random association of land-cover types that can be describe by simple statistical methods. Options for additional landscape studies are discussed and access to QRULE described in the hope that these methods will be employed to advance our understanding of the processes that affect the structure and function in human dominated landscapes.";"Gardner, Robert H.

Here, with the use of georeferenced centipede data, we explore the importance and contribution of bioclimatic variables and land cover, and predict distribution ranges and potential hotspots in Norway. We used a maximum entropy analysis (Maxent) to model species' distributions, aiming at exploring centres of distribution, latitudinal spans and northern range boundaries of centipedes in Norway. The performance of all Maxent models was better than random with average test area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.893 and True Skill Statistic (TSS) values above 0.593. Our results showed a highly significant latitudinal gradient of increased species richness in southern grid-cells. Mean temperatures of warmest and coldest quarters explained much of the potential distribution of species. Predictive modelling analyses revealed that south-eastern Norway and the Atlantic coast in the west (inclusive of the major fjord system of Sognefjord), are local biodiversity hotspots with regard to high predictive species co-occurrence. We conclude that our predicted northward shifts of centipedes' distributions in Norway are likely a result of post-glacial recolonization patterns, species' ecological requirements and dispersal abilities.";"Georgopoulou, Elisavet

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

This article analyses the situation. It identifies conditions in which the reservation of land for national parks increases total rateable unimproved property values in a local government area. The level of a local government’s receipts from rates tend to move in the same direction as the total value of rateable property in its local government area. Thus, even though national parks and similar natural areas are not rateable, it is possible that the reservation of some local government areas for such protection, can increase the receipts from rates of the local council concerned. However this is not always so and conditions for an increase in local government revenue are specified. Local governments may wish to maximise their income for discretionary expenditures rather than total receipts. Conditions are specified in which the reservation of` local areas for national parks fosters this objective, and other circumstances in which such reservation is in conflict with this objective. Depending upon the nature of the relevant functions, local government finances may benefit from the existence of national parks in a local government area or be adversely affected by their presence. As far as we are aware, the conditions for this have not been previously specified.";"Tisdell, Clement A.

Given the rapid development in this area of research, we performed a review of different approaches used to map ES, with a special focus on those that use social–ecological data. We used an analytical framework based on five criteria for analyzing and comparing the methodological approaches: the types of ES, availability of data sources, types of data sources, spatial scale, and methods used to model ES. We found that regulating services were the most commonly mapped, followed by provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. Secondary (readily available) data were used more frequently than primary data to map ES. Biophysical data (land-cover variables) and mixed sources (databases like global statistics) were the most commonly employed ones. Most studies were performed at the regional or at the national scale. The most commonly used method to model services was the development of models based on the well-known causal relationships between environmental variables, followed by the extrapolation of ES values from primary data to the total analyzed area frequently using land-cover maps. Our synthesis reveals that the majority of studies are based on secondary data, applied at broad scales, without validation techniques. There is an urgent need to develop methods for deepening our understanding of the social–ecological processes behind the supply of ES in order to improve our ability to map ES for decision making.";"Martínez-Harms, María José

"AGRIS:US201500082487";"Organic farming and heterogeneous landscapes positively affect different measures of plant diversity";"";"Increasing landscape heterogeneity and organic farming practices are known to enhance species richness in agroecosystems. However, little is known about the consequences of these management options on other biodiversity components such as community composition, phylogenetic structure and functional diversity which may be more closely linked to ecosystem functioning. We surveyed semi‐natural plant communities within the uncultivated field margins of 18 arable farms in Skåne, south Sweden. We investigated how taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity responds to landscape heterogeneity (presence of semi‐natural habitat) and farm management intensity (organic vs. conventional farming). Plant species richness and functional diversity metrics all responded positively to landscape heterogeneity, with the strongest effect occurring on conventional farms. Community composition differed with farm management, and mean phylogenetic relatedness, an indicator of phylogenetic structure, was significantly higher on the field margins of organic compared to conventional farms. Individual plant functional groups themselves responded in unique ways to land management and landscape heterogeneity. Synthesis and applications. Management strategies that promote the conservation of heterogeneous landscapes (i.e. a higher proportion of semi‐natural habitats) and organic farm management practices are important for maintaining plant phylogenetic, functional and taxonomic diversity in agroecosystems. Accommodating various forms of diversity is important to ensure that ecosystems have the greatest possible array of species ecologies’. Such measures will help to improve the capacity of these ecosystems to provide multiple ecosystem functions, including the sustaining and regulating services of benefit to people.";"Rader, Romina

"AGRIS:US2016217588";"Optimizing Voluntary Deforestation Policy in the Face of Adverse Selection and Costly Transfers";"";"As part of international climate change policy, voluntary opt-in programs to reduce emissions in unregulated sectors or countries have spurred considerable discussion. Since any regulator will make errors in predicting baselines, adverse selection will reduce efficiency since participants will self-select into the program. In contrast, pure subsidies lead to full participation but require large financial transfers; this is a particular challenge across countries. A global social planner facing costless transfers would choose such a subsidy to maximize efficiency. However, any actual policy needs to be individually rational for both the buying (industrialized) and selling (developing) country. We present a simple model to analyze this trade-off between adverse selection and infra-marginal transfers. The model leads to the following findings. First, extending the scale of voluntary programs both improves efficiency and reduces transfers. Second, the set of individually rational and Pareto efficient policies typically features a combination of credit discounting and stringent assigned baselines which reduce efficiency. Third, if the industrialized countries can be persuaded to be more generous, the feasible policy set can come close to the globally efficient policy to avoid deforestation.";"van Benthem, Arthur A.

Currently available models mainly focus on provisioning services and do not distinguish changes in the functioning of the ecosystem (Ecosystem Functions – ESFs) and human use of such functions (Ecosystem Services – ESSs). This limits the insight on the impact of global change on human well-being. We present a set of models for assessing ESFs and ESSs. We mapped a diverse set of provisioning, regulating and cultural services, focusing on services that depend on the landscape structure. Services were mapped using global-scale data sets. We evaluated the models for a sample area comprising Eastern Europe. ESFs are mainly available in natural areas, while hotspots of ESS supply are found in areas with heterogeneous land cover. Here, natural land cover where ESFs are available is mixed with areas where the ESSs are utilized. We conclude that spatial patterns of several ESFs and ESSs can be mapped at global scale using existing global-scale data sets. As land-cover change has different impacts on different aspects of the interaction between humans and the environment, it is essential to clearly distinguish between ESFs and ESSs in integrated assessment studies.";"Schulp, Catharina J.E.

However, extraction of comprehensive spatial features from high-resolution imagery is still challenging, leading to many misclassifications in various applications. To address the problem, a shape-adaptive neighbourhood (SAN) technique is presented based on human visual perception. The SAN technique is an adaptive feature-extraction method that not only considers spectral feature information but also the spatial neighbourhood as well as the shape of features. The distinct advantage of this approach is that it can be adjusted to different feature sizes and shapes. Assessment experiments on a Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) image were conducted to perform classification of land use/land cover. Results showed that improvement with SAN features is not significant for supervised classifiers due to the spectral confusion problem that resulted from similar spectral signatures between farmland and green areas, but a particularly significant improvement is observed for the unsupervised classifier. For the unsupervised classification, the SAN features noticeably improved the overall accuracy from 0.58 to 0.86, and the kappa coefficient from 0.45 to 0.80, indicating promise in the application of SAN features in the auto-interpretation of RS images.";"Zhang, Hongsheng

"AGRIS:US201400149701";"Improving change vector analysis by cross-correlogram spectral matching for accurate detection of land-cover conversion";"";"Time series of vegetation index (VI) information derived from remote sensing is important for land-cover change detection. Although traditional change vector analysis (TCVA) is an effective method for extracting land-cover change information from a time series of VI data, it has the disadvantage of being too sensitive to temporal fluctuations in VI values. The method tends to overestimate the changes and confuse the actual land-cover conversion with the land covers that have not been converted but experience significant VI changes. Cross-correlogram spectral matching (CCSM) can tell the degree of shape similarity between VI profiles and be used to detect land-cover conversion. However, this method may omit some land conversion in which the before and after land-cover types are rather similar in VI profile shape but differ significantly in absolute VI values. This article proposes a new approach that improves TCVA with an adapted use of CCSM. First, TCVA is employed for preliminary detection of land-cover changes. Second, the changes caused by temporal fluctuations of VI values are identified through the CCSM analysis and excluded to only keep the most likely land-cover conversions. Finally, classification is performed to map the different types of land-cover conversions. The improved change vector analysis (ICVA) was applied to detect land-cover conversions from 2000 to 2008, using a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced VI images for the Beijing–Tianjin–Tangshan urban agglomeration district, China. The results show that ICVA is able to detect land-cover conversion with a significantly higher accuracy (78.00%, κ = 0.56) than TCVA (64.00%, κ = 0.35) or CCSM (66.60%, κ = 0.27). The proposed approach is of particular value in distinguishing actual land-cover conversion from land-cover modifications resulting from phenological changes.";"He, Chunyang

"AGRIS:US201400149708";"Spatial–temporal patterns of urban anthropogenic heat discharge in Fuzhou, China, observed from sensible heat flux using Landsat TM/ETM+ data";"";"The urban heat island (UHI) effect is the phenomenon of increased surface temperatures in urban environments compared to their surroundings. It is linked to decreased vegetation cover, high proportions of artificial impervious surfaces, and high proportions of anthropogenic heat discharge. We evaluated the surface heat balance to clarify the contribution of anthropogenic heat discharges into the urban thermal environment. We used a heat balance model and satellite images (Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired in 1989 and 2001), together with meteorological station data to assess the urban thermal environment in the city of Fuzhou, China. The objective of this study was to estimate the anthropogenic heat discharge in the form of sensible heat flux in complex urban environments. In order to increase the accuracy of the anthropogenic heat flux analysis, the sub-pixel fractional vegetation cover (FVC) was calculated by linear spectral unmixing. The results were then used to estimate latent heat flux in urban areas and to separate anthropogenic heat discharge from heat radiation due to insolation. Spatial and temporal distributions of anthropogenic heat flux were analysed as a function of land-cover type, percentage of impervious surface area, and FVC. The accuracy of heat fluxes was assessed using the ratios of sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (L), and ground heat flux (G) to net radiation (Rₙ), which were compared to the results from other studies. It is apparent that the contribution of anthropogenic heat is smaller in suburban areas and larger in high-density urban areas. However, seasonal disparities of anthropogenic heat discharge are small, and the variance of anthropogenic heat discharge is influenced by urban expansion, land-cover change, and increasing energy consumption. The results suggest that anthropogenic heat release probably plays a significant role in the UHI effect, and must be considered in urban climate change adaptation strategies. Remote sensing can play a role in mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of UHIs and can differentiate the anthropogenic heat from the solar radiative fluxes. The findings presented here have important implications for urban development planning.";"Zhang, Youshui

"AGRIS:US201301610593";"Using occupancy models of forest breeding birds to prioritize conservation planning";"";"As urban development continues to encroach on the natural and rural landscape, land-use planners struggle to identify high priority conservation areas for protection. Although knowing where urban-sensitive species may be occurring on the landscape would facilitate conservation planning, research efforts are often not sufficiently designed to make quality predictions at unknown locations. Recent advances in occupancy modeling allow for more precise estimates of occupancy by accounting for differences in detectability. We applied these techniques to produce robust estimates of habitat occupancy for a subset of forest breeding birds, a group that has been shown to be sensitive to urbanization, in a rapidly urbanizing yet biological diverse region of New York State. We found that detection probability ranged widely across species, from 0.05 to 0.8. Our models suggest that detection probability declined with increasing forest fragmentation. We also found that the probability of occupancy of forest breeding birds is negatively influenced by increasing perimeter-area ratio of forest fragments and urbanization in the surrounding habitat matrix. We capitalized on our random sampling design to produce spatially explicit models that predict high priority conservation areas across the entire region, where interior-species were most likely to occur. Finally, we use our predictive maps to demonstrate how a strict sampling design coupled with occupancy modeling can be a valuable tool for prioritizing biodiversity conservation in land-use planning.";"De Wan, Amielle A.

We provide examples â in wildlife consumption, land management, and tolerance for releasing invasive species â where we suspect that such relativism has been influential.

We used the eddy-covariance technique to measure CO₂, water vapor and sensible heat fluxes above a three-year-old HP plantation on high productivity land near St Albert, Alberta. Measurements showed that the annual C balance of the plantation shifted from a C source of about 1.54 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in the 2nd year (2010) to a C sink of 0.80 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in the 3rd year (2011). Water use or evapotranspiration (E) for 1 June – 31 October increased from 272 mm in 2010 to 321 mm in 2011, and exceeded the respective values of total precipitation of 251 mm and 298 mm for the same period. Annual E in 2010 of 364 mm was less than annual precipitation of 398 mm. In 2011, annual E (442 mm) exceeded annual P (411 mm) by 31 mm; it also exceeded the annual plantation water use Ewb, estimated using a water balance method assuming no drainage from the root zone, by 40 mm. However, both courses of cumulative E and Ewb closely followed cumulative P. Monthly E increased with increasing net radiation and gross primary productivity. Growing season mean albedo increased from 0.16 in 2010 to 0.21 in 2011 and was consistent with the increase in broadband NDVI. Values of albedo during winter months (November–April) exceeded 0.80. The results suggested that as the plantation grows, growing season albedo, annual C sequestration, and annual water use will increase with the possibility that the latter may exceed annual precipitation. This emphasizes the need to study the long-term sustainability of HP plantations in relation to annual P and its temporal distribution, especially when HP plantations will likely be established on large contiguous areas to supply biomass feedstock for the expanding pulp and bioenergy industries in Western Canada.";"Jassal, Rachhpal S.

Due to its abundant marginal land resource and good meteorological conditions, Southwest China is the major region to develop JCL. With Southwest China being taken as the study area in this paper, multi-factor comprehensive analysis is used to identify marginal land resources suitable to JCL plantation and make suitability assessment, thus obtaining their spatial distribution, suitability degree and total amount. With life cycle analysis (LCA), the life cycle net energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction capacity of marginal land resources with different suitability degrees used to produce biodiesel are investigated. Based on the research results, the life cycle model is expanded to obtain the potentiality of total net energy production and greenhouse gas emission reduction of large-scale plantation of JCL in southwest China. The results show that the area of land resources suitable and moderately suitable for JCL plantation is 1.99 × 10⁶ ha and 5.57 × 10⁶ ha, respectively.

Our comparison of indigenous and settlers allows a better understanding of how societies develop different diversification strategies in similar ecological contexts and how the related socioeconomic aspects of diversification are associated with land cover change. Our results suggest that although indigenous people cause less deforestation and diversify more, diversification is not a direct driver of deforestation reduction. A multidimensional approach linking sociocognitive, economic, and ecological patterns of diversification helps explain this contradiction.";"Bottazzi, Patrick

"AGRIS:US201600100492";"Exploratory Landscape Metrics for Agricultural Sustainability";"";"Socioeconomic growth and urban change have been an increasing concern for decision makers in recent decades. The monitoring, mapping, and analysis of agricultural land use change, especially in areas where urban change has been high, is crucial. The collision between traditional economic activities related to agriculture in tourist areas such as the Algarve and current demand for tourism infrastructures in urban regions is also leading to loss of economic activity. This article uses a combined geographical information system approach with CORINE land cover datasets to perform a Shannon's diversity index quantifying changes in agricultural areas. The article then expands on the nature of the agricultural changes observed, and offers a multi-temporal assessment by means of landscape metrics in order to understand the shifting land use patterns for the Algarve in land use planning and regional economic equilibrium: a) forest regions become transformed into agricultural areas and agricultural areas become urban; b) areas that are initially agricultural become scattered residential regions created by economic investors; and c) agricultural land use changes have a cyclical nature in which—in the course of the economic recession—such dynamic effects brought about a decrease in tourism and focus on traditional sectors.";"Vaz, Eric

In this zone, humid climates, the dominant land use is ""veranada"", which consists of three annual steps of one type of livestock transhumance, based on the exploitation of natural grassland forage. Given the physiographic formation of these landscapes, there is in them a high propensity to develop geomorphological processes of erosion and landslides. Historical factors linked to the evolution of livestock activity in the region on both sides of the mountain axis, have been identified since the late nineteenth century, land use patterns characterized by excessive seasonal stocking. This organization of the activity involved, not just a deterioration of pastures, but also the break out and acceleration of geomorphic processes. The aim of this paper is to analyze the current problems, focusing biophysical processes, linked to social practices. In this sense, we describe and explain physiographic conditions in terms of degree of instability and deterioration of the land.

La cuenca del río Kilca es uno de los principales sistemas hidrográficos de la región antecordillerana, ubicada en el centro de la provincia de Neuquén. En esta zona, de clima subhúmedo, el uso de suelo dominante es el de ""veranada"", que consiste en una de las tres etapas anuales de un tipo de ganadería trashumante, basado en el aprovechamiento forrajero de pastizales naturales. Dada la constitución fisiográfica de estos paisajes, existe en ellos una gran propensión al desarrollo de procesos geomorfológicos de erosión y remoción en masa. Los factores históricos vinculados a la evolución de la actividad ganadera en la región a ambos lados del eje cordillerano, han determinado desde fines del siglo XIX, modalidades de uso de suelo caracterizadas por el exceso estacional de la carga ganadera. Esta organización de la actividad implicó, no sólo un deterioro de las pasturas, sino además el desencadenamiento y aceleración de los procesos geomorfológicos.

"AGRIS:US201400190188";"Land-cover change and human population trends in the greater Serengeti ecosystem from 1984–2003";"";"The growth of human populations around protected areas accelerates land conversion and isolation, negatively impacting biodiversity and ecosystem function, and can be exacerbated by immigration. It is often assumed that immigration around protected areas is driven by attraction in the form of economic benefits, but in many cases, people may be pushed from their areas of origin toward protected areas. Mitigating the effects of immigration around protected areas necessitates understanding the actual mechanisms causing it, which can be aided by analysis of patterns of land-cover change. Our goal was to identify the reasons for human population growth and land-cover change around the protected areas in the greater Serengeti ecosystem (henceforth “the park”), and to relate agricultural conversion from 1984–2003 to trends in human demography. We found that conversion of natural habitats to agriculture was greatest closer to the park (up to 2.3% per year), coinciding with the highest rates of human population growth (3.5% per year). Agricultural conversion and population growth were greatest where there was less existing agriculture, and population density was lowest. Lack of unfarmed land farther from the park, coupled with greater poverty near the park, suggest that movement away from areas with high population densities and land scarcity was likely driving immigration near the park, where arable land was available. Our results are essential for conservation planning for one of Africa’s hallmark ecosystems, and should encourage further examination of population growth and land-cover trends near protected areas throughout the developing world.";"Estes, Anna Bond

"AGRIS:US201400182364";"Robust prediction of time-integrated NDVI";"";"The time-integrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI) provides key remote-sensing-derived information on the interactions between vegetation growth, climatic and soil conditions, and land use. Using a time-series of Landsat imagery obtained for Queensland, Australia, it has been demonstrated how robust geostatistics can be used to predict iNDVI. This approach is novel because it explicitly quantifies the uncertainty of prediction and uses Winsorizing, a data-censoring method, to minimize the distorting effects of outliers. Robust prediction of iNDVI, as opposed to non-robust prediction, was justifiable in 79% of the study area, highlighting the need for methods that deal with outliers in time-series analysis of remotely sensed imagery. There was a strong coarse-scale association between Queensland’s bioregions and iNDVI, and also between bioregion and the rain-induced difference in iNDVI through time (effects that were significant at p < 0.001 in both cases). At a finer spatial scale, prediction of iNDVI also appeared to be a promising way to distinguish long-term cropping land from adjacent long-term grazing land (effect significant at p < 0.001). The method is tied to a set of assumptions concerning image radiometry, cloud detection, variogram estimation, and variable additivity. The first two are fundamental remote-sensing issues that can be improved with additional labour; the last two can be improved statistically but would greatly increase the processing time per pixel. Robust geostatistical analysis of time-series has immediate relevance to gap-filling of SLC-off Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery, and for generating novel covariates for digital soil mapping.";"Pringle, M.J.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use;grazing lands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400182364";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.782117";"";"";"";"4791-4811"

However, detailed information on local processing and changes is rare or lacking. A multi-temporal set of Landsat images was used to produce land-cover maps for the years 2000 and 2007 in a semi-arid region of Niger, where an anomalous vegetation trend was previously detected. Several supervised classification approaches were tested: spectral classification of single Landsat data, temporal classification of normalized difference vegetation index time series from Landsat images, and two-step classification integrating both these approaches. The accuracy of the land-cover maps obtained ranges between 80% and 90% overall for the two-step classification approach. Comparison of the maps between the two years indicates a stable semi-arid region, where some change in hot spots exists despite a generally constant level of rainfall in the area during this period. In particular, the Dallol Bosso fossil valley highlights an increase in cultivated land, while a decrease in herbaceous vegetation was observed outside the valley where rangeland is the predominant natural landscape.";"Nutini, F.

"AGRIS:US201500013788";"Organic carbon stocks in agricultural soils in Ireland using combined empirical and GIS approaches";"";"Substitution of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default methodology by country-specific activity data is recommended for improved estimation of baseline soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and their changes. In the Republic of Ireland (ROI), previous studies focused either predominantly on grassland or on all land cover types but were depth-limited. To improve the accuracy, Tier 2 approaches are proposed by the IPCC. This requires an analysis of high spatial resolution databases (such as the Irish NSDB – National Soil Database) and maps, collated for major land cover, soil types and land use areas in Ireland. In this study, data were overlaid using ArcGIS to derive information for disaggregated soil types and agricultural land use areas. Empirical models were developed using separate measurement data to estimate the NSDB-derived SOC concentrations for deeper layers, using a depth distribution function and the bulk density (ρd) using pedotransfer functions. The soil type specific models (R²=0.87–0.99) had an improved estimate of SOC densities when mineral and organic soils (peat) were treated separately. The estimated SOC densities for grasslands on mineral plus organo-mineral soils at the 0–10, 0–30, 0–50 and 0–100cm depths were 52.2, 127.1, 170.9 and 213.8t C ha⁻¹, respectively. For arable lands, the corresponding SOC densities were 29.9, 81.3, 117.6 and 167.5t C ha⁻¹. Nationally, for all soil types, the corresponding stocks (the products of SOC density and land cover area) were estimated to be 246.9, 608.1, 829.5 and 1079.3Tg for grassland, and 13.5, 36.7, 50.2 and 67.0Tg for arable lands in the three soil layers. The total national SOC stocks were estimated to be 888 at 0–30cm and 1832Tg at 0–100cm reference depths. For the complete soil profile, including peats >100cm depth, the national estimate was 2824Tg. The combined empirical models and Geographical Information System technique provide robust estimates of SOC stocks for disaggregated land covers and soil types, enabling Ireland to consider moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 accounting methodology. This improved national inventory of the ROI is important for estimates of the C stock related to the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) categories.";"Khalil, M.I.

Information about the characteristics of the landscape elements in terms of their structural functionality plays a central role in assessing their ecological quality. Statutory designation of sites plays a key role in conserving and maintaining valuable parts of the landscape. In this study, we investigated whether protection status influences functionality in case studies from the Czech Republic, representing three different landscape types. Landscape structure metrics derived from land cover maps, were used for the assessment of functionality in protected and unprotected regions of the landscape types. Mean functionality was calculated for six different functionality groups. We also focused on the level of protection status and its relationship to functionality. Our results showed that landscape functionality is higher in protected areas as opposed to unprotected areas. In addition, functionality was found to be high for the ‘valuable matrix’ and the ‘connecting corridors’ groups. The results also indicated that the more strictly protected areas tend to have higher functionality.";"Skokanová, Hana

"AGRIS:US201500083508";"Understanding landscape patterns of temporal variability in avian populations to improve environmental impact assessments";"";"It is recognized that wildlife populations exhibit spatial and temporal variability in patterns of species richness across heterogeneous landscapes. This phenomenon can prove problematic for environmental practitioners when attempting to complete comprehensive environmental assessments (EAs) with limited field surveys. A better understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns in population dynamics should enhance site-level decision-making. In this study, the variability of seasonal data across the Credit River Watershed, southern Ontario, is assessed for a hierarchy of conservation measures including species richness, and two conservation wildlife response guilds based on primary habitat and area sensitivity. Bird populations were monitored at 24 forest monitoring plots across the watershed by the authors twice a season from 2003 to 2010 following the protocol of Environment Canada's Forest Bird Monitoring Program. The monitoring plots are located within four land management zones identified as 1) urban, 2) transitional, 3) escarpment and 4) rural. Data from the monitoring program are used to compare species richness among plots across the watershed and among land management zones. In addition, the variability of records from each plot over the 8year period was determined by means of the Coefficient of Variation (CV) statistic. The mean variability of these records at each site within each land management zone was determined in order to assess whether the temporal variability of bird records might affect the integrity of short term assessments. Finally, a one-way ANOVA was applied to learn whether the result of short-term assessments may be further compounded by differences in the response of selected bird guilds to landscape heterogeneity. The results show that there is a significant difference in mean richness of forest birds among the four management zones. The ANOVAs indicate that significant difference is due to the temporal variability of a) breeding forest interior birds rather than edge birds or generalist species and b) breeding area sensitive species rather than area non-sensitive species. Recommendations are made that environmental assessments targeting forest interior bird populations need to plan sampling strategies that recognize this variability, especially for sites within the transitional and urban zones. Planning in the transition or urbanizing landscape should incorporate landscape ecology principles to sustain current levels of richness in forest species.";"Milne, Robert

"AGRIS:US2016212049";"Spillovers from Globalization on Land Use: Evidence from Madagascar";"";"The effect of globalization on the environment and natural resource use in developing countries is hotly debated. We contribute to this debate through the analysis of primary data collected with small contract farmers in Madagascar that produce vegetables for export to Europe. Strong spillover effects of these trade opportunities on land use exist. Using a matched plot sampling design, the productivity of rice - the main domestically consumed staple - is shown to be two thirds higher on those fields that were contracted during the off-season for the production of vegetables. This increase in yields is linked to an increase of soil fertility due to the application of fertilizer and compost which farmers would not use prior to the contracts. While agricultural output goes up significantly, labor productivity stays the same, suggesting that there is greater labor absorption on existing land and the diffusion of this type of technology contract farming at a larger scale throughout Madagascar would be expected to substantially decrease incentives to deforest by increasing wages and boosting productivity of existing lands relative to newly deforested ones.";"Minten, Bart

Even though the programme has gained wide acceptability among owners, compared to traditional conservation such as land acquisition, more owners need to be engaged. In this study, we examined how the new protection measures have diffused among forest owners. This analysis will help find means to promote the protection among owners who could but have not yet participated. The theoretical background is innovation diffusion. We focused on the communication channels and attributes of innovation that would be important for the rest of the adopters. Data were gathered from owners who have protected their forests in the eastern part of Finland. The results showed that the idea of protection has reached forest owners mainly via certain advisors of a regional Forestry Centre or via forestry magazines and newspapers. In the future, it is important that the advisors of local Forest Management Associations and employees of timber buying companies promote the programme more, since they are the most familiar forestry experts for many owners. In addition, it would be necessary to increase the role of peer forest owners and enhance the visibility of protected areas. Highlighting the rationality and ease of protection to potential adopters is important.";"Korhonen, Katri

"AGRIS:US2016212040";"Local Officials as Land Developers: Urban Spatial Expansion in China";"";"We investigate conceptually and empirically the role of economic incentives in the primary land allocation in China in recent years. A theoretical analysis demonstrates how recent fiscal and governance reforms give rise to land conversion decisions and long run urban spatial sizes much like those generated by competitive land markets with private land ownership. An econometric investigation of Shanghai and the provinces surrounding it demonstrates the presence of rent gradients, often used as an indication of the presence of land markets. It thus appears that economic forces have continued to exercise dominant influence over primary land allocations in spite of recent administrative restrictions on land conversion. These rent gradients are strongest in the most economically developed portions of the study region and weakest in the least economically developed. Urban land values exceed agricultural land values by a considerable margin, suggesting that rates of urbanization will continue to be rapid. The estimated rent gradients also suggest that much of this region will eventually become completely urbanized.";"Lichtenberg, Erik

Seeking toobtaining results, a case study was carried out and an input-product matrix was structured, using production values of a smallproperty (12 ha). As a result, the property was found to be inserted in three filières (soy, milk and swine production), demonstratingthe characteristic change of self-sufficiency for the integration in production chains. In the value aggregation (of total production)originating from the property (R$ 3.044.570), resulting in a final product of R$ 1.278.925, demonstrating that the other linksmultiplied the initial production of the property by 9,4. The participation of the property in the final product was important,contributing with 10,7% of that value. We can infer that this unit is inserted in the new production dynamics.";"Pelinski, Augusta

"AGRIS:US2016204865";"FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NORTH DAKOTA FARMS 2005-2006";"";"The performance of over 500 North Dakota farms, 2005-2006, is summarized using 16 financial measures.  Farms are categorized by geographic region, farm type, farm size, gross cash sales, farm tenure, net farm income, debt-to-asset, and age of farmer to analyze relationships between financial performance and farm characteristics. Five-year averages, 2001-2005, and farm financial trends for the 1997-2006 period are also presented. In 2006, median and average acreage per farm was 1,966 and 2,386, respectively. Median and average cash farm revenue was $281,751 and $361,418, respectively.Financial performance is volatile. Year-to-year changes in median net farm income within regions and farm types averaged 50 percent from 1997 to 2006. Median net farm income in 2006 was the lowest in five years, $35,980, and ranged from $83,970 in the Red River Valley to only $689 in the west region which was the lowest for any region over the 1997-2006 period. In 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004 the rate of return on equity exceeded the rate of return on assets, which indicates that debt capital was employed profitably. Interest expense as a percent of gross revenue improved from 1997-2004, but increased in 2005 and 2006 because of higher debt and interest rates.The Red River Valley and crop farms had stronger profitability, solvency and repayment capacity from 1997 to 2006 than other regions and farm types, respectively, except in 2005 when the south central region and livestock farms had better performance. Farms with sales less than $100,000 were over twice as likely to have debt-to-asset higher than 70 percent than were farms with sales greater than $500,000. Farms that own some crop land, but less than 40 percent are more likely to be crop farms, farm more acreage, have larger sales, and be more profitable. As expected, solvency and percent of crop land owned increased with farmer age.";"Swenson, Andrew L.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204865";"http://purl.umn.edu/9078";"";"";"";""

It enables us to identify the optimal crop structure for a specific piece of agri-cultural land, based on various target functions. Optimisation for different target functions was made necessary by the changing economic environment, especially the changes in the regulatory framework, to identify the most profitable option under the specific circumstances.

"AGRIS:US201600201107";"Plant-livestock-soil-hydrology interactions in the northeastern region of India";"";"In a multidisciplinary study, highly significant interactional effects were found among land use, livestock component, soil properties and rainfall. On an average, 16.2 to 82.2 tonnes of sediment yield kmâ2 and more than 90% of rainwater was retained in-situ in new land use systems as against 3621.3 tonnes of sediment and 66.3% rainwater retention in shifting cultivation, because of poor land cover. Good vegetation cover reduced the runoff load, resulting in significant reduction in the soil and nutrient erosion. The average sediment yield was only 0.44%, 2.68%, 1.47%, 0.31%, 0.73% and 2.27% in livestock based, forestry, agro-forestry, agriculture, agri-horti-silvi-pastoral and horticulture land use systems of that of shifting cultivation. Highest average sediment yield was 704.3 t kmâ2 when the annual rainfall was 2770 mm and minimum 405.4 t kmâ2 when the annual rainfall was 1992 mm. More in-situ retention of rainwater helped in the availability of adequate moisture from the soil to the succeeding crops when the rainy season receded. The sediment yield varied according to the rainfall received during a particular year and the nature of vegetation in a particular land use. There was sufficient fertility build-up in the watersheds where animals were kept and after ten years of start of the study, no need of inorganic sources of nutrients was required. The organic carbon, humus, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium and available phosphorus increased significantly in the new land use systems compared to shifting cultivation, however, the DTPA (Diethylene triamine penta acetic acid) extractable zinc, copper, iron and exchangeable aluminium decreased over the initial soil status. It showed that the vegetation in the new land uses had a smothering effect on the soil and increase in the elements had a favourable impact on the crop productivity.";"Sharma, Uttam

Academic research to evaluate the impact of P.A. 425 on communities executing such contracts had not been conducted. Therefore, the question of whether the Act had accomplished its intended objectives remained unanswered. Data were collected from 26 units of governments that executed P.A. 425 agreements since 1984. The methods used to gather information in the research were mail surveys and phone interviews. Descriptive statistics were used as the main tool of analysis in this research. The results obtained indicate that infrastructure is a precondition for economic development to occur. However, the analysis of the data also indicates that once infrastructure is built, economic development does not necessarily follow.";"Quinones, Alexander Rafael";"";"";"AGRIS";"1999-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012202408";"http://purl.umn.edu/10997";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201301686007";"Determinants of access to forest products in southern Burkina Faso";"";"There is an increasing understanding that forests and the forestry sector are key elements in poverty reduction strategies in Africa. However, issues of equity between various forest users are becoming a major challenge to environmental development, forest management and poverty reduction. This paper presents an analysis of household representatives' socio-economic determinants and other constraints on accessing forest products, based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 1865 respondents in seven districts of the Sissili province, southern Burkina Faso. Three logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of access to the forest for collecting fuelwood, grazing livestock and collecting non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The results showed that access to forest products is associated with individual characteristics. Age, ethnicity, occupation and sources of income were significant determinants of access to all types of forest products. Access to the forest for grazing livestock was further influenced by gender and household size, while access to NTFPs was influenced by gender, household size and education level of the respondents. The formal forest law that precludes grazing in the forest, and customary rules and regulations pertaining to land tenure, were reported to be serious constraints to forest access for women and migrant people. Understanding the factors influencing access to products from commonly-owned forest resources could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments that promote equitable access. Policies should particularly encourage the direct involvement of vulnerable and marginalized groups (women and migrants) in forest management activities.";"Coulibaly-Lingani, Pascaline

"AGRIS:US201500008388";"Development of a Watershed‐Based Geospatial Groundwater Specific Vulnerability Assessment Tool";"";"This study assesses and characterizes the vulnerability of unregulated groundwater systems to microbial contamination in 18 counties in the state of Georgia using a contamination risk screening strategy based on watershed characteristics and elements of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Wellhead Protection program. Environmental data sources analyzed include septic systems, elevation, land use and land cover data, soil, vegetation coverage, demographics, and livestock. A geospatial overlay/index modeling approach was developed to identify areas of higher vulnerability for groundwater pollution by taking into consideration watershed land use, hydrology, and topography (LHT). Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of model variables. The results of the model were validated by using field data and output from U.S. EPA's DRASTIC model, a widely used intrinsic vulnerability assessment tool. The validation showed a higher risk of microbial contamination for wells located in a high to medium LHT vulnerability zones. LHT provided a clear distribution of satisfactory and unsatisfactory wells in the three vulnerability zones; however, the majority of wells (>75%), with both satisfactory and unsatisfactory test results, are located in medium DRASTIC vulnerability zone. This difference between LHT and DRASTIC can be attributed to the microbial contamination specific factors incorporated into LHT index. It is concluded that although inclusion of potential contamination sources on adjacent land uses in the vulnerability assessment framework adds to the complexity of the processes involved in a vulnerability assessment, such inclusion provides a meaningful perspective to groundwater protection efforts as an effective screening tool.";"Baloch, Mansoor A.

"AGRIS:US201301686003";"Land-use and land-base patterns in non-industrial private forests: Factors affecting forest management in Northern Spain";"";"There is increasing worldwide interest in land-use allocation and management within the sphere of rural planning and development. The study of land-use patterns mainly focuses on understanding the practices and values of individuals involved, and no debate of this issue would be complete without taking into account non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership as a key component in most rural areas worldwide. This paper empirically explores and assesses NIPF owners' management in terms of analysing dynamics in farming and forestry practices (past conversions from forestland to meadow and from marginal meadow to woodland, and intentions to change the current productive forest species and to extend the area of woodland) and landholding attributes (size and degree of parcellation in productive forestland). Logistic regression models were also used to investigate the probabilities and influencing factors involved in transforming marginal meadows to woodland, and attempts on the part of NIPF owners to change the current productive forest species and increase productive forestland. For this, a total of 103 NIPF owners in Northern Spain were interviewed in person, in March 2004, about their commitment to and involvement in land management during 1999-2003. The models correctly explained 73.3%, 83.7% and 73.3% of the variability in having converted marginal meadow in woodland and of future intentions to change the productive forest species and increase the area of productive forestland, respectively. The results of the study indicate that forest management mainly responds to investment and increasing the productivity of the land as a capital asset, which is directly influenced by the size and degree of parcellation of the holding, and directly or indirectly related to the owner's interest in timber production. The results may be used by forest professionals, researchers and policymakers in order to design and execute successful forest policies related to land management and planning.";"Rodríguez-Vicente, Verónica

For this study, the WRJ-2 watershed falling under Narkhed and Katol Tahsils of Nagpur district, Maharashtra, India is investigated. Various thematic maps (i.e. drainage, geology, soil, geomorphology and land use/ land cover) have been prepared using the remote sensing and GIS techniques. Initially, differential weightage values are assigned to all the thematic maps as per their runoff characteristics. Subsequently, the maps are integrated in GIS environment to identify potential sites for water conservation measures like gully plugs, earthen check dams, continuous contour trenches, percolation tanks, cement bandhara, afforestration and farm ponds, etc. The study depicts that the GIS technique facilitates integration of thematic maps and thereby helps in an identification of micro-zones each with unique characters in-terms of hydrogeology, thus amenable to specific water conservation techniques. It is therefore concluded that, the GIS technique is suitable for an identification of water conservation structures.";"Varade, Abhay M.

"AGRIS:US201300866536";"Method For Landscape-Scale Vegetation Assessment: Application to Great Basin Rangeland Ecosystems";"";"The growth of landscape-scale land management necessitates the development of methods for large-scale vegetation assessment. Field data collection and analysis methods used to assess ecological condition for the 47165-h North Spring Valley watershed are presented. Vegetation cover data were collected in a stratified random design within 6 Great Basin vegetation types, and the probability of detecting change in native herbaceous cover was calculated using power analyses. Methods for using these quantitative assessment data are presented to calculate a departure index based on reference condition information from LANDFIRE (an interagency effort to map and model fire regimes and other biophysical characteristics at a mid-scale for the entire United States) Biophysical Setting models for the mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) vegetation type. For mountain big sagebrush in the North Spring Valley landscape, we found that the earliest successional classes were underrepresented and that mountain big sagebrush moderately invaded by conifers was more abundant than predicted by the LANDFIRE reference based on the historic range of variability. Classes that were most similar to the reference were mountain big sagebrush with the highest conifer cover and late development mountain big sagebrush with perennial grasses. Overall, results suggested that restoration or approximation of the historic fire regime is needed. This method provides a cost-effective procedure to assess important indicators, including native herbaceous cover, extent of woody encroachment, and ground cover. However, the method lacks the spatial information that would allow managers to comprehensively assess spatial patterns of vegetation condition across the mosaics that occur within each major vegetation type. The development of a method that integrates field measurements of key indicators with remotely sensed data is the next critical need for landscape-scale assessment.";"Forbis, T.A.

Continued productivity benefits all thestakeholders that are involved in the process. Unfortunately negative productivity levels havebeen reported in numerous South African land redistribution transfers in recent years. A gametheoretic perspective is adopted to argue that cooperation among key stakeholders, which couldbe enforced through long term contracts between a land buyer, sellers and new owners, wouldlead to higher productivity levels and other benefits. Additional benefits would, for example,include market related prices paid by a buyer. Sugarcane farm transfer cases from twomunicipality districts in KwaZulu Natal province are used to show that the productivity rates inpost transfer periods of cooperative land sales were more than 10% higher than the ratesobserved before such transfers. At the opposite end of the scale, the productivity rates in noncooperativeland sales dropped by 16% after land takeovers. Furthermore, the prices paid forfarms that became less productive after transfers were higher by more than 40% compared tothose paid for productive farms.

Because of the multiscale feature and diverse composition of land cover types found within the urban environment, the production of accurate urban land cover maps from high resolution satellite imagery is a difficult task. This paper demonstrates the potential of 8 bands capability of World View 2 satellite for better automated feature extraction and discrimination studies. Multiresolution segmentation and object based classification techniques were then applied for discrimination of urban and vegetation features in a part of Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. The study demonstrates that scale, colour, shape, compactness and smoothness have a significant influence on the quality of image objects achieved, which in turn governs the classified result. The object oriented analysis is a valid approach for analyzing high spatial and spectral resolution images.

We determined the differences in the amount of SOM mineralization and the temperature and moisture sensitivity of soils collected from six land-cover types, including an orchard, a cropland, and four forests, in subtropical southeastern China. The responses of SOM mineralization to temperature (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C) and moisture (30%, 60%, and 90% of water-holding capacity [WHC]) were investigated by placing soil samples in incubators. Soil C mineralization rate and cumulative C mineralization were higher in orchard and cropland soils than in other forest soils. With increasing temperature, soil C mineralization rates and cumulative C mineralization increased with the rise of WHC. The temperature sensitivity of soil C mineralization was not affected by land-cover type and incubation moisture. All soil temperature treatments showed a similar response to moisture. Cropland soil was more responsive to soil moisture than other soils.

An attempt has been made to provide an overview of important characteristics of marsh wetland. Classification was used to describe ecosystems and land cover patterns. Different spatial resolution images show different landscape characteristics. Several classification images were used to map and monitor wetland ecosystems of Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR) at a plant community scale. HNNR is a typical inland wetland and fresh water ecosystem in the North Temperate Zone. SPOT-5 10 m × 10 m, 20 m × 20 m, and 30 m × 30 m images and Landsat -5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were used to classify based on maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithms. In order to validate the precision of the classifications, this study used aerial photography classification maps as training samples because of their high accuracy. The accuracy of the derived classes was assessed with the discrete multivariate technique called KAPPA accuracy. The results indicate: (1) training samples are important to classification results.

Carbon stocks of the organic layer and the mineral topsoil (30� cm) were estimated on the basis of ca. 1.800 plots sampled from 1987 to 1992 and resampled from 2006 to 2008 on a nationwide grid of 8� ×� 8� km. Organic layer C stock estimates were attributed to surveyed forest stands and CORINE land cover data. Mineral soil C stock estimates were linked with the distribution of dominant soil types according to the Soil Map of Germany (1� :� 1� 000� 000) and subsequently related to the forest area. It appears that the C pool of the organic layer was largely depending on tree species and parent material, whereas the C pool of the mineral soil varied among soil groups. We identified the organic layer C pool as stable although C was significantly sequestered under coniferous forest at lowland sites. The mineral soils, however, sequestered 0.41� Mg� C� ha⁻¹� yr⁻¹. Carbon pool changes were supposed to depend on stand age and forest transformation as well as an enhanced biomass input. Carbon stock changes were clearly attributed to parent material and soil groups as sandy soils sequestered higher amounts of C, whereas clayey and calcareous soils showed small gains and in some cases even losses of soil C. We further showed that the largest part of the overall sample variance was not explained by fine‐earth stock variances, rather by the C concentrations variance. The applied uncertainty analyses in this study link the variability of strata with measurement errors. In accordance to other studies for Central Europe, the results showed that the applied method enabled a reliable nationwide quantification of the soil C pool development for a certain period.";"Grüneberg, Erik

Using GIS methods, it was determined that the fragmentation within the study area had increased slightly and the ecological stability of the landscape had decreased slightly between the years 1938 and 2006, although the latter remained on a fairly high level. The data reflect the anthropogenic conditionality of the floodplain forest ecosystem and show that an anthropogenically conditioned geobiocoenosis may attain a relatively high level of ecological stability, this being particularly characteristic of floodplain forest geobiocoenoses in Central Europe. The results of the study contribute to the documents that will be used in drawing up a management plan for the locality important at the European level which is a part of the Natura 2000 system.";"Machar, I.,Univerzita Palackeho, Olomouc (Czech Republic).

"AGRIS:QY2016100129";"Adoption of maize conservation tillage in Azuero, Panama";"";"An aggressive research and validation program launched in 1984 in Azuero, Panama, yielded a recommendation advocating zero tillage for maize production. Ten years later, maize farmers in Azuero use , land preparation methods: conventional tillage, zero tillage, and minimum tillage (an adaptation of the zero tillage technology). This study aimed to quantify the adoption of a zero and minimum tillage for maize in Azuero; identify factors influencing adoption of the different land preparation practices; and analyze the implications of the findings for future maize research and extension. Between 1985 and 1994, farmers in Region I of Azuero changed from conventional tillage to zero (33%) and minimum tillage (43%). In Regions II and III, most farmers still practiced conventional tillage in 1994, although 34 % had switched to minimum tillage. Across regions, adoption of conservation tillage was motivated by potential cost savings rather than longer term considerations such as reduced soil erosion. The factors that limit adoption of conservation tillage vary by region. In Region I, adoption of conservation tillage is limited by land rental rather than ownership and by lack of conservation tillage planting equipment. In Regions II and III, lack of information about conservation tillage technology limits the probability of adoption. Future research should examine soil compaction, a key variable for understanding differences between the adoption of minimum and zero tillage. Another area that merits further research is the link between weeds and conservation tillage: several farmers reported using the technology to obtain better weed control. The long-term effects of conservation tillage should also be assessed. Extension in Regions II and III should seek to accelerate adoption of conservation tillage. In Region I, extension should steer the change process from minimum to zero tillage.";"Pereira, A.

One use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) in urban planning is decision support, while the potential of the ecological footprint in GIS has not developed significantly. The smaller the spatial unit in GIS, the more accurate and flexible are the available GIS analyses. As urban planners are interested in showing sustainability at a local level and need accurate local data, the EF Housing component, of specific interest to planners is estimated here through a bottom up or component method to meet this need for a local measure. Average household energy use is purchased from local utilities companies in units of energy while the City Assessment department supplies dwelling size data for each household. Postal code areas approximating block faces are created for the City of Calgary in GIS and energy and household size is converted to GIS format allowing GIS analysis and map creation. A sample analysis is carried out that involves comparison between the sustainability of inner city single family Infill housing and older existing single family housing. This case study method involves a direct measure of housing energy and materials consumption, yet one that may be expressed in global hectares. Analytical output shows a net increase in the use of global hectares by Infill houses where improved building insulation standards and heating technology effecting gas consumption over time are more than offset by increased house size. Ecological footprint components, such as the Housing and perhaps Mobility, of specific interest to urban policy planners can be presented in GIS maps and tables to stimulate urban planner policy debate and potential decision-making support. GIS sourced household data while retaining units in EF global hectares makes sustainability analysis possible at a household scale. The GIS analysis here, which spatially and numerically shows the difference in sustainability between Infill housing and older existing housing, may allow planners to formulate effective policy. As well as the benefits of the land use measure and global data at a local level, the EF is effective in raising awareness, education and policy debate.

"AGRIS:US201400088571";"Implications of African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) denning on the density and distribution of a key prey species: addressing myths and misperceptions";"";"African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are often the least popular large carnivore among game ranchers because of their perceived impact on prey populations. Landowner perceptions include that wild dogs greatly deplete prey during their three-month denning period, take prey that could otherwise be sold for hunting and cause prey to move away from the vicinity of their den sites. Landowners’ tolerance towards African wild dogs could thus be improved with a more rigorous understanding of the actual impact of wild dogs on prey populations during the denning period. Using impala density data and wild dog denning records from Sango Ranch in the Savé Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe, we compared impala densities between pre-denning, denning and post-denning season and between inside and outside the denning home range. Our results indicate that wild dog denning does not cause a significant local reduction in prey around the den and does not cause prey to move away from denning areas. However prey species did occur in lower density inside the denning home ranges than outside, in all seasons. This result indicates that wild dogs select dens in areas of lower prey density, perhaps as an avoidance mechanism for lions. Accordingly, contrary to what landowners believe, wild dogs do not have a significant impact on prey populations during their denning season.";"Mbizah, Moreangels M.

"AGRIS:US201500170068";"Potential of five plants growing on unproductive agricultural lands as biodiesel resources";"";"Fossil fuels are being heavily depleted due to increasing anthropogenic activities worldwide, and burning them contributes to global climate warming and air pollution. Vegetable oils are one of the main feedstocks for biodiesel: they are non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Rising global population, decreasing arable lands and a decline in crop yields from desertification and salinization demands that biodiesel feedstock be grown on unproductive agricultural lands. To estimate whether five plants growing on such land in China could be used as energy plants, we determined their seed oil content (SOC) and relative fatty acid content, and estimated the cetane number (CN) of the biodiesel produced from these plant oils by a fitted regression between different C18 fatty acids and CN. Results showed that four plants can be developed as energy plants, including Datura candida (SOC = 22.9%, CN = 50.8), Xanthium sibiricum (SOC = 41.9%, CN = 46.5), Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (SOC = 18.6%, CN = 45.9) and Hibiscus trionum (SOC = 17.5%, CN = 46.9). The fifth plant, Rhus typhina, was not adapted as an energy plant because of its low SOC, 9.7%.

"AGRIS:US201600194527";"Are VegetationââEnvironment Relationships Different Between Herbaceous and Woody Groundcover Plants in Barrens with Shallow Soils?";"";"The extent to which woody vegetation exhibits more expansive community structures and different relationships with environmental variables than herbaceous plants is poorly understood in savannas and barrens worldwide, especially those with shallow soils. We explored this question in oak barrens, which are savanna habitats characterized by shallow soils, in southern Ohio, USA. Groundcover plant aerial cover and environmental data were collected using 75 randomly located 1-m2 quadrats in 3 barrens. A combination of non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and Î²Î²-flexible cluster analysis revealed 3 distinct herbaceous plant assemblages that varied in abundances of Câ and Câ graminoid species and several forbs. Herbaceous vegetation patterns were correlated with soil acidity, soil depth, plant available water, and especially soil organic matter and quadrat slope. By contrast, woody plants were more widely distributed than herbs, and woody vegetation patterns were strongly correlated only with soil organic matter, although they were weakly associated with quadrat slope and an index of tree influence. The expansion of woody plants into barrens is likely not restricted by most edaphic factors; thus, barrens are highly susceptible to woody plant encroachment that has been fostered by anthropogenic alterations to natural fire regimes (suppression, dormant season fires). We hypothesize that fires that are intended to mimic natural lightning fires during the growing season will be most effective in deterring woody plant encroachment.

Eligibility for payments includes regulations on the crops allowed to be grown on base acres, and there are restrictions on planting horticultural crops on such base acres. The fruits and planting restriction on base acres has potentially influenced the number of acres planted to fruits and vegetables over the past two decades. This research carefully examines the effects of planting restrictions applied to vegetables and program crops, using county-level datain the United States in 1982, 1987, 1992 and 1997. The paper employs the difference-indifference (DiD) approach to estimate acreage response to planting restrictions.

The soil profiles at these sites represent extreme examples of management, grazed meadow (site M) and extensive grazing beneath larch (site L) or naturally disturbed by avalanche and colonized by alder (site A) and the expected forest climax vegetation beneath fir (site F). Changes in labile pools of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were active at all sites at both temperatures during 14 days of laboratory incubation. Ammonium was the dominant inorganic form of total dissolved N (TDN), being equivalent to 1.8-9.8 g N m-² within the mineral horizon. Gross rates of ammonification were similar at the two temperatures but significantly (p<0.05) greater in soil from beneath fir than in the other three. Nitrification occurred in all soils and displayed a wide range in rates, from 2 to 85 mg N m-² day-¹, and was least in the two most acid soils, A and F. Immobilization of NH₄ ⁺ as microbial N was greater in the fir soil than in the other three. Also, the fir soil showed greatest gross ammonification and least accumulation of NO₃ - and greatest tendency to retain N. This high N retention capacity in the climax ecosystem contrasted with the managed systems characterized by higher nitrification rates and greater potential spring NO₃ - loss. Dissolved organic N ranged between 30 and 50% of the TDN, while dissolved organic P was greater than 70% of total dissolved P (TDP). The dissolved organic compounds were important components of the labile pool, in equilibrium with a large reserve of organic N, and may significantly contribute to the soil N availability at low temperatures.";"Freppaz, Michele

"AGRIS:US201400169130";"Suitability of short or long conservation contracts under ecological and socio-economic uncertainty";"";"Acquisition of land rights has become a primary tool used to protect terrestrial biodiversity. Fixed length contracts are often used when trying to secure conservation benefits on private land in agri-environment schemes and payment for environmental services schemes, but the duration of the conservation contracts used in different programmes varies. To date, very little research has been undertaken to determine the situations in which contracts of differing lengths are optimal or when conservation agencies or groups should use a portfolio of different contract lengths rather than relying on a single type. Using stochastic dynamic programming and related heuristic methods, we investigate how the choice between short or long conservation contracts is affected by uncertainty regarding the future availability of sites and their ecological condition. We also examine the benefits offered by using a portfolio of different contract lengths. Conservation agencies must pay private landowners a premium to secure longer agreements and because of this, shorter contracts are advantageous if sites are likely to remain available for conservation in the future. Long contracts are preferred when future site availability becomes more unlikely. In contrast to uncertainty over site availability, uncertainty over future ecological conditions has little effect on contract selection and only markedly influences the choice between short and long contracts when there is heterogeneity across sites in expected conservation outcomes and future availability of sites is also uncertain. Finally, when future site availability is unlikely, the use of a portfolio of short and long contracts would offer greater conservation gains than using either type in isolation, even though this option is not yet one that is commonly found in conservation practice.";"Lennox, Gareth D.

"AGRIS:US201500217558";"relevance of governance models for estuary management plans";"";"The latest theories on the governance of water resources point to the need to adopt integrated approaches, allowing the mediation of conflict between public and private interests by building consensus to include the participation of stakeholders and civil society in formulating and implementing policies, thereby ensuring their legitimacy. Models of governance have particular relevance in the context of estuaries, because of the complexity associated with them. Estuaries are areas where valuable, highly sensitive and diverse natural systems coexist, which are frequently threatened by the numerous human activities concentrated there. They are also areas where several organizations overlap, with their own jurisdictions and management instruments and where there is a wide range of users with distinct interests. At a time when the Planos de Ordenamento de Estuários (POE) (Estuary Land Use and Management Plan), a new tool for water resource management and planning, are being drawn up in Portugal, this paper discusses the specificities of the new Portuguese estuary plans, as well as associated potentials and constraints to further understand how water resources and land use policies may effectively be integrated in estuary contexts. It critically analyses the Portuguese legal framework established for these plans, arguing that, in spite of the novelty of the newly defined legal measures to better plan and manage estuaries, implementation of its ambitious objectives requires a robust governance model for plan preparation and implementation. Taking into account the main institutional features of complex estuaries with various agencies, stakeholders and users, as well as relevant governance principles, this paper proposes a governance model capable of enriching the implementation of estuary plans by contributing to a stronger involvement of all stakeholders and users in the construction of the plan, allowing conciliation of interests and participation in decision-making, within a framework of collaborative governance. Whilst the paper focuses on the Portuguese Law, the approach adopted is also of interest to other countries to assessing estuary planning regulations and associated collaborative measures.";"Carvalho, Teresa M.

Land covers were mapped into 20 categories from multitemporal Landsat TM images. Five landscape indices were calculated from these maps at the land cover patches level. It was found that fallow land decreased by 125,148 ha while grassland and woodland increased by 107,975 and 17,157 ha, respectively. Landscape heterogeneity, dominance and fractal dimension changed little during the 15-year period while landscape became more fragmented, with an index rising from 0.56 to 0.58. The major factors responsible for these changes are identified as the change in the government policy on preserving the environment, continued growth in mining, and urbanization.";"Zha, Yong

Due to low annual rainfall and the wide coverage of soils with low available water-holding capacities, flood irrigation of the 2400ha of flat land within the catchment is an important feature impacting on farm business profitability and stream health. Water quality variables and nutrient and sediment yield estimates are reported for a four-year period. This monitoring shows that some improvement in farm environmental performances would generally be desirable, with stream concentrations of nutrients (N and P), sediment and faecal bacteria regularly exceeding guidelines recommended for surface waters. Field measurements, farm management surveys and farm systems modelling have identified some land management practices that appear to be key sources of many of these pollutants. Border dyke irrigation runoff has a potentially large effect on a range of water quality parameters, due to both the excessive stream flows generated by over-watering and the entrainment of P, N and faecal bacteria in this flow as it passes from land to stream. Stock access to some of the remaining un-fenced lengths of the stream was also recognised as an important land management practice that needed to be addressed if some of the key catchment values identified by stakeholders, such as maintaining a healthy trout fishery and a stream suitable for recreational use, were to be protected. Assessments of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a number of potential mitigation practices identified that managements which targeted reducing irrigation runoff (e.g. by installing bunds or using appropriate watering times) and fencing and planting riparian margins showed the greatest potential to meet these key values with least cost to farm businesses. Other farm practices were also identified that incurred nil or minimal cost while also delivering small or moderate benefits to stream water quality.";"Monaghan, R.M.

The observations before and after the earthquake have been carried out in the full polarimetric mode. We observed the dominance of surface scattering of the three-component scattering model in the landslide areas and identified 11 of the 13 landslide areas. However, we also detected vacant pieces of land, pastures and other land bodies. The possible landslide areas are estimated for 102 patch areas, of which 36 correspond to the actual landslide areas. This method is useful to detect the landslide area when the land classification map or optical image taken before a disaster is available. We propose the use of σ⁰VH information to distinguish the landslide areas from the other areas. Since σ⁰VH is sensitive to the surface roughness of an area, vacant pieces of land and pastures, which have a relatively low surface roughness, can be distinguished from the landslide areas, which have a high surface roughness. By combining the surface scattering and the σ⁰VH filter, the number of possible landslide areas is reduced from 102 to 54, which include the actual landslide areas except for some small patch areas.";"Watanabe, Manabu

The primary objective of this study was to characterize the impact of grassland degradation on carbon and nitrogen budgets in Inner Mongolia, China. We investigated the changes of total carbon, organic carbon, inorganic carbon and total nitrogen that occur in a grassland ecosystem (including vegetation and top 30 cm soil layer) in the course of grassland degradation. Total carbon stored in the grassland ecosystem was reduced by up to 14%, depending on the severity of the degradation. Total nitrogen storage was reduced by almost 10% under severe degradation, but was slightly increased at light and intermediate degradation, indicating that grazing exclusion would not lead to an increase in nitrogen storage in the ecosystem. Over 98% of the total carbon and nitrogen stored in the grassland ecosystem was bound in the soil which provides the dominant and most stable carbon and nitrogen pool in the ecosystem. Most of the soil carbon and nitrogen storage was present in soil water-stable aggregates and was released as soil water-stable aggregates break in the course of grassland degradation. In conclusion, the carbon sequestration capacity of the vegetation decreased significantly, and substantial proportions of soil carbon and nitrogen were lost in the course of grassland degradation, resulting in unbalanced carbon and nitrogen budgets. Strategies to restore degraded grassland must be designed to increase the carbon and nitrogen storage potential of grassland ecosystems.";"Zhang, Guogang

Wells and pipelines were overlaid onto base maps of land cover, soil properties, vegetation assemblages, and hydrologic units. Changes to continuity of different ecoregions and supporting landscapes were assessed using the Landscape Fragmentation Tool (a third-party ArcGIS extension) as quantified by land area and continuity of core landscape areas (i.e., those degraded by “edge effects”). Results show decreases in core areas (8.7 %; ~33,290 ha) and increases in landscape patches (0.2 %; ~640 ha), edges (1.8 %; ~6940 ha), and perforated areas (4.2 %; ~16230 ha). Pipeline construction dominates landscape disturbance, followed by drilling and injection pads (85, 15, and 0.03 % of disturbed area, respectively). An increased potential for soil loss is indicated, with 51 % (~5790 ha) of all disturbance regimes occurring on soils with low water-transmission rates (depth to impermeable layer less than 50 cm) and a high surface runoff potential (hydrologic soil group D). Additionally, 88 % (~10,020 ha) of all disturbances occurred on soils with a wind erodibility index of approximately 19 kt/km²/year (0.19 kt/ha/year) or higher, resulting in an estimated potential of 2 million tons of soil loss per year. Results demonstrate that infrastructure placement is occurring on soils susceptible to erosion while reducing and splitting core areas potentially vital to ecosystem services.";"Pierre, Jon Paul

As APPs foram identificadas e mapeadas usando imagens do Landsat-7. O uso antrópico em áreas de preservação permanente tem sido freqüentemente relatado na literatura, para diferentes regiões do Brasil, com destaque para o uso agrícola. Tal fato também se observa na Bacia Mogi-Pardo, conforme se evidencia neste trabalho. A partir dos dados apresentados pode se observar, entretanto, que no período entre 1988 e 2002 houve aumento da cobertura florestal nas APPs da Bacia, provavelmente fruto do esforço de recomposição de matas ciliares, o que contribui para o efeito-escala negativo do uso antrópico nessas áreas de proteção. Nos locais das APPs onde vem ocorrendo o uso antrópico – desrespeitando-se a legislação vigente – evidencia-se o processo de substituição, pela cana-de-açúcar, de cultivos como os anuais de sequeiro, as pastagens, a silvicultura e, inclusive, a substituição da vegetação  ripária. O efeito-substituição se mostra positivo e de elevada magnitude para a cultura da cana-de-açúcar.

The PPAs were identified and mapped through Landsat-7 image classification. The anthropic use of PPA has been frequently reported in the literature, for different regions of Brazil, with emphasis on agricultural use. This fact also has been observed in Mogi-Pardo Watershed, as evidenced in this paper. The results have shown an increase of the forest cover in PPA areas, between 1988 and 2002, probably due to restoration efforts focused in riparian forests. This fact contributes to the negative scale effect of the anthropic use in these areas of protection. In places where the anthropic use has occurred – disregarding the environmental legislation – it was observed the replacement of annual crops, pasture, forest and the riparian vegetation by the sugar cane. The substitution effect is positive and with high magnitude for the sugar cane.

"AGRIS:US201600092295";"Resolving large‐scale pressures on species and ecosystems: propensity modelling identifies agricultural effects on streams";"";"Although agriculture is amongst the world's most widespread land uses, studies of its effects on stream ecosystems are often limited in spatial extent. National monitoring data could extend spatial coverage and increase statistical power, but present analytical challenges where covarying environmental variables confound relationships of interest. Propensity modelling is used widely outside ecology to control for confounding variables in observational data. Here, monitoring data from over 3000 English and Welsh river reaches are used to assess the effects of intensive agricultural land cover (arable and pastoral) on stream habitat, water chemistry and invertebrates, using propensity scores to control for potential confounding factors (e.g. climate, geology). Propensity scoring effectively reduced the collinearity between land cover and potential confounding variables, reducing the potential for covariate bias in estimated treatment–response relationships compared to conventional multiple regression. Macroinvertebrate richness was significantly greater at sites with a higher proportion of improved pasture in their catchment or riparian zone, with these effects probably mediated by increased algal production from mild nutrient enrichment. In contrast, macroinvertebrate richness did not change with arable land cover, although sensitive species representation was lower under higher proportions of arable land cover, probably due to greatly elevated nutrient concentrations. Synthesis and applications. Propensity modelling has great potential to address questions about pressures on ecosystems and organisms at the large spatial extents relevant to land‐use policy, where experimental approaches are not feasible and broad environmental changes often covary. Applied to the effects of agricultural land cover on stream systems, this approach identified reduced nutrient loading from arable farms as a priority for land management. On this specific issue, our data and analysis support the use of riparian or catchment‐scale measures to reduce nutrient delivery to sensitive water bodies.";"Pearson, Caitlin E.

"AGRIS:US201400181044";"Fire resistance of tree species explains historical gallery forest community composition";"";"Fire, climatic variability, and grazing by large herbivores have historically limited woody vegetation in the tallgrass prairie region of North America to gallery forests in protected areas along rivers and streams. Fire, in particular, has been a strong selective pressure against woody vegetation. Consequently, we expect that dominant tree species in these forests have developed mechanisms for tolerating periodic surface fires. Susceptibility of trees to fire damage depends in part on key properties of bark which influence heat transfer to the vascular cambium, including thickness, density, and moisture content. An historical (1983) survey of Konza Prairie Biological Station in northeast Kansas, USA indicated that gallery forests were co-dominated by Quercus macrocarpa and Quercus muehlenbergii, while Celtis occidentalis occurred as an important sub-dominant species. Populus deltoides, Gleditsia triacanthos, and Juniperus virginiana were relatively uncommon. To test the hypothesis that historically dominant gallery forest tree species are more resistant to fire damage than uncommon species, fire was applied to the bark of 10 individuals of each of these six species under conditions mimicking surface fires (400°C for 120s). Maximum temperature at the vascular cambium, bark thickness, bark moisture content, and bark density were measured. Trees were considered fire-resistant if the vascular cambium temperature remained below the thermal cell death threshold, 60°C, throughout the treatment. Using logistic regression, bark thickness was found to be a significant predictor of lethal cambium temperatures (P=0.002), while neither bark density nor moisture content were significantly related to lethal cambium temperature (P=0.279 and P=0.131, respectively). Across species, a minimum bark thickness of approximately 8.6mm was necessary to maintain the vascular cambium temperature below 60°C. Trees that produce thick bark quickly in juvenile size classes (P. deltoides, Q. macrocarpa, and Q. muehlenbergii) experienced lower temperatures at the vascular cambium than those which do not develop thick bark with increasing diameter (C. occidentalis, G. triacanthos, and J. virginiana). Ranking these tree species by either the DBH or age needed to develop the minimum protective bark thickness largely agreed with ranking based on historical relative importance. As fire frequency and intensity decrease in remnant tallgrass prairie of North America as a result of habitat fragmentation, fire suppression, and changing land management, fire-sensitive species may increase in relative importance in gallery forests because of increased juvenile survival.";"VanderWeide, Benjamin L.

"AGRIS:US201600184641";"Characteristics within and around stopover wetlands used by migratory shorebirds: Is the neighborhood important?";"";"Wetland stopover use by migratory shorebirds is concurrently influenced by habitat characteristics within a stopover site and characteristics related to the broader context surrounding the stopover site. To conserve wetland habitats essential for shorebird migration through the interior of North America, we need to understand how these dual scales influence stopover use. We surveyed >14,000 wetlands within 10 broad-scale landscapes in north-central Oklahoma from 2007 through 2009 to determine how characteristics within (intra) and surrounding (context) wetlands influence the density and species richness of migrating shorebirds at stopover sites. We used zero-inflated modeling and an information theoretic framework to separately examine and then compare the relative importance of intra-habitat variables and habitat context variables in explaining use of stopovers. We observed 38,288 migratory shorebirds of 29 species. Shorebirds were least likely to occur in isolated, small, steep-sided wetland habitats. Among intra-patch variables, shorebird density and richness were best explained by wetland habitat area, slope, and the cover and height of vegetation within a wetland. Shorebird density and richness were more than 2 times higher in large wetland habitats (i.e. >3.3 ha), and both decreased with increased vegetation and slope. The density of wetlands within 1.5 km of a stopover site had the greatest impact on shorebird density and richness among patch context variables. As habitat density increased from 0.07 to 1, shorebird abundance and richness increased by >200%. Shorebirds were positively related to grazing pressure but negatively related to forest/shrubland, urban/suburban development, and grassland land cover contexts. When compared to models with intra-habitat variables, models containing habitat context variables better explained migratory shorebird density and richness. We conclude that characteristics related to the broader context surrounding a wetland stopover sites strongly influence stopover use by migratory shorebirds. Conservation and management of shorebirds migrating through the continental interior should aim to provide large expanses of sparsely vegetated and shallow habitats within stopover sites and focus on open landscapes that contain high densities of stopover habitats.";"Albanese, Gene

An Assessment of Turtle Abundances";"";"Golf courses represent a common type of anthropogenically modified habitat in suburban environments. Golf courses may provide suitable habitat for semi-aquatic animals in suburban areas, yet studies comparing animal abundances in golf course ponds with other pond types in suburban environments are somewhat limited. In this study, we compared turtle abundances in golf course ponds with ponds found in residential areas and ponds found in rural (farm) areas and examined the relationship between turtle abundance and residential land-cover within individual golf courses. We captured turtles in 10 golf course ponds, 5 ponds surrounded by residential development, and 5 ponds located on farms. We estimated abundance and the effects of pond area, pond type (i.e., residential, golf, farm) and percentage of residential development within golf course boundaries. Using binomial mixture models and Bayesian inference, we found that ponds surrounded by residential development had lower abundances of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta) and Sliders (Trachemys scripta) than ponds located on golf courses and farms. Additionally, golf courses that have a greater amount of residential development within course boundaries had fewer turtles than courses that contained minimal residential development. Our results suggest that golf courses can offer suitable habitat for semi-aquatic turtles in suburban areas. However, residential development within golf course boundaries appears to have a negative effect on local abundances. Thus, if golf courses are to be seen as reserves for wetland-dependent animals, golf courses with low housing density should be considered as a more preferable option than courses associated with extensive residential development.";"Price, Steven J.

However, its simulation capability is sometimes influenced because of rapid land cover changes occurring in catchments. This paper investigates whether modification of a rainfall-runoff model, Xinanjiang, by the incorporation of dynamic remote sensing data (MODIS leaf area index (LAI) and albedo) can improve runoff estimates for four south-east Australian catchments which experienced severe bushfire impacts. The results show that incorporation of remote sensing LAI and albedo data into the modified Xinanjiang model can improve model performance in three wetter bushfire impacted catchments, compared to the modified model using mean annual vegetation data as model inputs. The improvement is indicated by a slight increase (0.01–0.07) in the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of daily runoff and noticeable decrease (3–11%) in volumetric errors. However, use of vegetation dynamics does not improve runoff time series simulation in a dry catchment for which mean annual runoff is only 38mm/yr. It indicates that incorporation of vegetation dynamic data into Xinanjiang model may show more benefits for catchments located in the wet regions";"Zhou, Yanchun

Annual rainfall increased significantly during the observed time period, explaining large parts of FAPAR variations at a regional scale. Locally, GEOV1 data reveals a heterogeneous pattern of vegetation change, which is confirmed by long-term ground data and site visits. The spatial variability in the observed vegetation trends in the Sahel area are mainly caused by varying tree- and land-cover, which are controlled by human impact, soil and drought resilience. A large proportion of the positive trends are caused by the increment in leaf biomass of woody species that has almost doubled since the 1980s due to a tree cover regeneration after a dry-period. This confirms the re-greening of the Sahel, however, degradation is also present and sometimes obscured by greening. GEOV1 as compared to GIMMS3g made it possible to better characterize the spatial pattern of trends and identify the degraded areas in the study region.";"Verger, Aleixandre

While much emphasis has been placed on understanding the uncertainty of watershed-scale nutrient load estimates in naturally drained systems, few studies have focused on artificially drained landscapes in the Midwestern US and Canada. The objective of this study was to quantify uncertainty in annual dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) load estimates from four tile drain outlets and two tile drained headwater watersheds in Ohio, USA and Ontario, Canada. High temporal resolution datasets of discharge (10 to 30 min) and nutrient concentration (2 hr to daily) were collected over a 1 to 2 year period at each site and used to calculate a ‘true’ nutrient load. Monte Carlo simulations were used to subsample the measured data to assess the effects of sample frequency, calculation algorithm, and compositing strategies on the uncertainty of load estimates. Results showed that uncertainty in annual DRP and NO3-N load estimates was influenced by both the sampling interval and the load estimation algorithm. Uncertainty in annual nutrient load estimates increased with increasing sampling interval for all of the load estimation algorithms tested. Continuous discharge measurements and linear interpolation of nutrient concentrations yielded the least amount of uncertainty, but still tended to underestimate ‘true’ load. Compositing strategies generally improved the precision of load estimates compared to discrete grab samples; however, they often reduced the accuracy. Based on the results of this study, we recommended that nutrient concentration be measured at least daily for DRP and every 3 to 7 days for NO3-N in tile drains and tile drained headwater watersheds to accurately (±10%) estimate annual loads.";"Williams, Mark R.

We used a multi‐taxa dataset from 335 sites and 36 heterogeneous landscapes in the Brazilian Amazon to examine the potential for landscape‐scale processes to modulate the cumulative effects of local disturbances. Biotic homogenization was high in production areas but much less in disturbed and regenerating forests, where high levels of among‐site and among‐landscape β‐diversity appeared to attenuate species loss at larger scales. We found consistently high levels of β‐diversity among landscapes for all land cover classes, providing support for landscape‐scale divergence in species composition. Our findings support concerns that β‐diversity has been underestimated as a driver of biodiversity change and underscore the importance of maintaining a distributed network of reserves, including remaining areas of undisturbed primary forest, but also disturbed and regenerating forests, to conserve regional biota.";"Solar, Ricardo Ribeiro de Castro

We utilize panel data set from field surveys which have been carried out from 1997 to 2007 in Red River Delta and Mekong Delta.We find no support for the hypothesis that small farmers in the north survey area have an advantage of efficiency in rice production. Since, although we confirm the inverse relationship between the land productivity and farm size, the average costs have increased rapidly as farm size have decreased. Some farmers, however, in the South have gradually cumulated in a middle-class of landholdings that has achieved the highest productivity, which implies efficient land allocation is realized.We also clarify the welfare impacts of these landholdings on sample households. In North, the declining farm size is driven by non-market transaction and inevitable. Then, small land endowments cause the diversification of income sources from agriculture to livestock and non-agriculture even if fermers realize high land productivity. In the South, estimation result shows positive relationship between total income and farm size while there is heterogeneity of welfare impact on households who sell their land.";"Goto, Jun

"AGRIS:US201600020601";"Sustainable agricultural residue removal for bioenergy: A spatially comprehensive US national assessment";"";"This study provides a spatially comprehensive assessment of sustainable agricultural residue removal potential across the United States for bioenergy production. Earlier assessments determining the quantity of agricultural residue that could be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at the regional and national scale faced a number of computational limitations. These limitations included the number of environmental factors, the number of land management scenarios, and the spatial fidelity and spatial extent of the assessment. This study utilizes integrated multi-factor environmental process modeling and high fidelity land use datasets to perform the sustainable agricultural residue removal assessment. Soil type represents the base spatial unit for this study and is modeled using a national soil survey database at the 10–100m scale. Current crop rotation practices are identified by processing land cover data available from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer database. Land management and residue removal scenarios are identified for each unique crop rotation and crop management zone. Estimates of county averages and state totals of sustainably available agricultural residues are provided. The results of the assessment show that in 2011 over 150 million metric tons of agricultural residues could have been sustainably removed across the United States. Projecting crop yields and land management practices to 2030, the assessment determines that over 207 million metric tons of agricultural residues will be able to be sustainably removed for bioenergy production at that time. This biomass resource has the potential for producing over 68 billion liters of cellulosic biofuels.";"Muth, D.J., Jr.

The theoretical literature suggests that higher taxes increase the time to development, although there is some disagreement in the literature. We present a simple theoretical model to motivate an empirical model that explores how land use change decisions are made over time.  A hazard model is used to predict factors that influence the time to development over an 11-year period in an urbanizing county in the Midwestern corn belt.  The results suggest that higher taxes slow development, as expected.  Over the 11-year period for our sample, we predict that 25% more agricultural land would have converted to development if taxes had not risen.  We also find, however, that the effects are not constant across different land qualities.  In particular, we find that higher taxes make higher quality agricultural land more susceptible to development.";"Sohngen, Brent

Both debates are examining two sides of the same phenomenon – the growing role of private financial investors in the global agri‐food value chains and the myriad consequences of it. The symposium moves beyond the identification of finance as an exogenous factor to the trends in the sector. It examines real‐life incarnations of finance in the sector by looking at investment arrangements, including connections with the state, and its (regional) variations. The symposium addresses three main themes. First, it explores the interplay of the state and private finance. It shows that the effect of regulation is limited in the face of increasingly mobile and complex investment flows. Second, it addresses the shifts and transfigurations of risk in the agri‐food sector due to financialization. Third, the symposium discusses to what extent, and how, the origins and identity of farmland investors still matters within an increasingly globalized financial sector. The paper concludes by identifying some related areas for further research.";"Visser, Oane

"AGRIS:US201600011314";"Foreignization, Financialization and Land Grab Regulation";"";"The global rush for land has provoked diverse policy responses from host countries. While some governments are facilitating ‘land grabs’ within their borders, others have restricted land acquisitions by foreigners. Drawing from the Brazilian case, I argue that such restrictive regulations may be limited in their effectiveness because they apply a state‐centric geopolitical logic to a threat that is largely de‐territorialized and financialized. The Brazilian government reacted to fears about land grabbing by reinstating a legal framework from the 1970s that focuses on the threat that foreigners pose to national sovereignty. This measure dampened international enthusiasm for Brazilian land, but it also triggered companies to begin searching for legal ways to get around the restrictions, often by exploiting the mismatch between the fungibility of global capital and the rigidity of the foreign/domestic dichotomy. I suggest that the semi‐permeability of the new restrictions may present an opportunity for the Brazilian government to balance its conflicting commitments to smallholder farmers and export‐oriented agribusiness. Regulations focused on foreign threats may be politically effective even as they impose an outdated conceptual framework on a far more complex reality.";"Fairbairn, Madeleine";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land acquisitions;land grabs;land grabbing;farmers";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600011314";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.12112";"";"";"";"581-591"

Methods and Results: A quantitative risk assessment based on the Source-Pathway-Receptor approach is developed. Central to the model is the estimation of the arithmetic mean concentration of BSE agent in sewage sludge. The main sources of uncertainty in the risk assessment are the degree to which sewage sludge treatment destroys BSE agent, whether there is a threshold dose for initiation of BSE infection in cattle, and most importantly, the amount of brain and spinal cord material which enters the sewer from the abattoir. Assuming 1% of brain and spinal cord is lost to the sewer from abattoirs, the model predicts a risk of BSE transmission of 7.1 x 10(-5) cow(-1) year(-1) for cattle grazing on land to which sewage sludge has been applied. Conclusions: The risks to humans through consumption of vegetable crops are acceptably low. Although the risks to cattle are higher, because of higher exposure to soil and greater susceptibility, the model demonstrates that sewage sludge alone cannot sustain the BSE epidemic in the UK cattle herd. Furthermore, the model suggests that recycling of BSE agent through sewage sludge will not sustain endemic levels of BSE in the UK cattle herd. Significance and Impact of the Study: The conclusions are consistent with the findings from epidemiological studies which so far have not detected horizontal transmission of BSE (which would include transmission from contaminated pastures). The model demonstrates the importance of containment of brain and spinal cord within the abattoir.";"Gale, P.

Deep understanding what determines land reallocation, whether and to what extent farm productivity and efficiency are affected by the frequency of land reallocation could help policy makers introduce better targeted rural development policies. The aim of this study is first to explore the determinants of land reallocation, and then analyze how land reallocation influences productivity and efficiency in agricultural production. This study is based on panel data set over 1995-2002 from rural households in Hubei and Yunnan provinces.Our results indicate that the likelihood of land reallocation is influenced by the opportunity of off-farm employment and the geographic characteristics and location of the village. The development of land rental market is substitute of land reallocation in optimizing the allocation of land resource.Average technical efficiency was found to be 72%. Farms with high variability in farm revenue were found to be more technically efficient than farms with low revenue variability. The predicted probability of land reallocation was statistically significant among factors affecting farm productivity and efficiency. In other words, we do find the systematic difference in farm productivity and technical efficiency between farmers have been reallocated land or not during the period of land tenure.";"Zhang, Yanjie

Focusing on the innovation of alienabile land rights in the West African Sahel, this microeconomic approach offers several contributions to the theory of institutional innovation. First, in contrast to the representative agent or aggregate benefit-cost approaches used to derive the demand for institutional innovation in much of the literature, this paper explores the heterogeneity of demand across agents.  Second, in contrast to prior studies of the evolution of land rights, this analysis shows that, in West Africa at least, the demand for private property rights in land is likely to rest on more than generalized land scarcity. Indeed, in terms of this paper's dynamic option value metric, the strongest demand for a land market emanates from the collapse of traditional risk management institutions and the desire of low wealth agents to use the market to buffer unmediated production risk. The demand for marketable rights, and indeed the appearance of some land transactions, may ultimately reflect a displaced demand for the innovation of contingency and other financial markets. In this second best environment, a policy of land privatization may be dominated by a policy that addresses those elements in the economic and institutional environment which create the sharp (displaced) demand for marketability rights.";"Zimmerman, Frederic

Using a two period model, this paper shows that for farms that are constrained in their access to liquidity, the investment demand effect will itself induce an increase in the endogenous shadow price of liquidity. Other things equal, this induced increase in the price of liquidity will discourage capital accumulation, and that the desired stock of expropriation-immune movable capital may decrease with tenure security. Empirical analysis of farm-level data from Paraguay corroborates this proposition and reveals that the underlying pattern of wealth-biased capital access creates a world in which property rights reform has differential effects across producer wealth classes and gets institutions ""right"" and agriculture moving for only for a wealthier subset of producers.";"Olinto, Pedro

An important aspect of data quality lies in its spatial resolution. It is unclear how finer scale land cover and land value information might further benefit biodiversity conservation. This paper aimed to assess the impacts of scale by modelling the conservation of endangered European wetland species and their corresponding habitats. Fine-scale datasets were derived by integrating existing geographical, biophysical and economic data. A habitat allocation model, based on principles from systematic conservation planning and economic theory, was developed to estimate area requirements and opportunity costs of habitat protection in Europe. Coarse-scale and fine-scale simulations were compared by inputting both resolutions into the model. Habitat locations were restricted either only by historical species occurrence data at UTM 50 resolution or additionally by explicit wetland data at 1-kmÂ² resolution. Coarse country-average land rents were contrasted with spatially detailed land rent estimates at a 5Ê¹ resolution. Costs of habitat protection and area requirements for reserves may be severely underestimated when conservation planning relies only on coarse-scale data, which may result in notable shortcomings in conservation target achievement. Improvements in conservation benefits far outweigh the additional costs of acquiring fine-scale data.";"JANTKE, KERSTIN

The Lake Habitat Survey (LHS) protocol provides a method for characterising and assessing the physical habitats of lakes and reservoirs. Two metrics were developed based on this method: the Lake Habitat Modification Score (LHMS) and the Lake Habitat Quality Assessment (LHQA), as measures of lake modification and habitat value, respectively. However, the use of these metrics to predict measures of ecological quality remains largely untested. Thus, we assessed the relationships between LHS metrics and the littoral macroinvertebrate community in 42 lakes across Europe. A significant relationship was found between littoral macrophyte descriptors and riparian natural land cover variables of the LHQA score and macroinvertebrate community composition in 2 out of 4 European regions. No relationship was found between macroinvertebrate community composition and the LHMS. Some significant correlations were found between selected macroinvertebrate metrics and the LHS scores, but this pattern was not consistent across regions, and no relationship was found with the overall LHMS or LHQA scores. This demonstrates that the LHS metrics do not consistently predict the quality of littoral macroinvertebrate communities across Europe, and a region specific approach may be necessary. However, we could demonstrate a relationship between the site specific LHS variables and the macroinvertebrate community at the site level, and in some cases at the regional level. Therefore, although the LHS metrics do not appear to be a useful for relating habitat quality and pressure to littoral macroinvertebrate communities, selected LHS variables may exhibit stronger relationships with the biota.";"McGoff, Elaine

In Lao PDR, a country facing rapid and multi-level land change processes, this hinders informed policy- and decision-making.

Instead of analyzing local land use combinations, we studied land cover mosaics at a meso-level of spatial scale and interpreted these in terms of human-environmental interactions. These landscape mosaics were then overlaid with population census data. Results showed that swidden agricultural landscapes, involving 17% of the population, dominate 29% of the country, while permanent agricultural landscapes involve 74% of the population in 29% of the territory.

The contribution of traditional knowledge to conservation and management is increasingly recognized, and implementation endeavours are underway in several countries. The current scale of ecosystem degradation underscores the need for restoration interventions. It is increasingly recognized that successful ecological restoration depends on effective coordination of science and traditional ecological knowledge. This paper synthesizes the literature to evaluate the present and potential contribution of traditional knowledge to ecological restoration. Despite a growing number of articles published on traditional knowledge, only a few have addressed its contributions to ecological restoration per se. The main contributions of traditional knowledge to ecological restoration are in construction of reference ecosystems, particularly when historical information is not available; species selection for restoration plantations; site selection for restoration; knowledge about historical land management practices; management of invasive species; and post-restoration monitoring. Traditional knowledge and science are complementary and should be used in conjunction in ecological restoration projects. Incorporation of traditional knowledge can contribute to build a strong partnership for the successful implementation of restoration projects and increase their social acceptability, economical feasibility, and ecological viability.";"Uprety, Yadav

The use of this system is demonstrated with an example from two lake watersheds, each one with different land-use, soil and topographic characteristics and also management regulations for natural resource protection. Lake pollution hazard is assessed as a function of two primary topics: hydrologic and soil conditions. This model shows the state of each evaluated subwatershed with respect to its potential contribution to lake pollution hazard based mainly on easily measurable and commonly used parameters: drainage density, hydraulic gradient, water table depth, soil media, land-cover and topography. Mapped outputs from the logic model allowed the identification of several subwatersheds in each lake system as the main water resource protection areas. La Brava Lake Watershed results reasonably fit the natural conditions of the watershed, identifying those subwatersheds with a moderate to high drainage density, high hydraulic gradient and extensive agricultural activities. Regarding Los Padres Lake Watershed, moderate to high drainage density, a high to a very high hydraulic gradient, shallow water depth, silt-loam soil texture and intensive agricultural and residential lands, contributed to a high lake pollution hazard. Results highlighted differences between both freshwater systems, being Los Padres Lake Watershed a more vulnerable ecosystem, requiring decision maker’s intervention based on accurate and up-to-date information.";"Romanelli, Asunción

"AGRIS:US201600110021";"Application of the state-and-transition approach to conservation management of a grazed Mediterranean landscape in Greece";"";"Traditionally, management of rangelands is based on the successional theory for vegetation developed by Clements. This approach, which came to be known as “the range succession model”, assumes a progressive change of vegetation towards the final (climax) stage and considers grazing as a primary driver of its dynamics. This model cannot be applied in Mediterranean rangelands, however, because they are largely modified plant communities and their final stage is usually a forest or dense woodland. Such “climax-type” vegetation is not necessarily best for conservation, nor does it serve the best management objective. In addition, rangelands are fragmented areas within Mediterranean landscapes requiring an integrated approach to their conservation and management. The “state-and-transition model” developed over the last 15 years seems to be more appropriate for Mediterranean rangelands, because it accommodates a broader spectrum of vegetation changes compared to the range succession model since, besides successional factors, several management factors are also considered. In this paper, a site-specific state-and-transition model is developed for a representative Mediterranean area of northern Greece after analyzing the socio-economic and land cover/use changes for a 33-year period. The model includes four states (arable lands, grasslands, evergreen shrublands, and deciduous oak forests) and seven transitions, all of them management-related. These transitions provide an adequate explanation of the vegetation changes that occurred in the study area and can serve as measures to confront the re-dominance of woody vegetation in the region. It is concluded that the state-and-transition approach provides an effective framework for conservation management of Mediterranean rangelands and landscapes.";"PAPANASTASIS*, VASILIOS P.

We surveyed birds using the point count method on 288 plots at a 50-m radius in three altitudinal landscapes with different rural character in spring and autumn. The results showed that bird species richness in the study area was high (74 species). High total species richness was found in the upland rural landscape characterized by mixed land use and high landscape diversity. The applied richness of total, resident and Sylviidae species illustrated a definite preference for villages with a low human population during the breeding season. Positive and significant correlations were found between rural settlements and Fringillidae, Sylviidae and total bird richness at both periods in the three landscapes. Finally, a clear dependence on the land use/land cover type was shown for the five recorded priority species.";"Plexida, Sofia G.

The main objective of this study is to produce landslide susceptibility maps at Safarood basin, Iran using two statistical models such as an index of entropy and conditional probability and to compare the obtained results. At the first stage, landslide locations were identified in the study area by interpretation of aerial photographs and from field investigations. Of the 153 landslides identified, 105 (≈70%) locations were used for the landslide susceptibility maps, while the remaining 48 (≈30%) cases were used for the model validation. The landslide conditioning factors such as slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, lithology, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), slope–length (LS), land use, and plan curvature were extracted from the spatial database. Using these factors, landslide susceptibility and weights of each factor were analyzed by index of entropy and conditional probability models. Finally, the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves for landslide susceptibility maps were drawn and the areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated. The verification results showed that the index of entropy model (AUC=86.08%) performed slightly better than conditional probability (AUC=82.75%) model. The produced susceptibility maps can be useful for general land use planning in the Safarood basin, Iran.";"Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza

Surrounding land cover was characterized at the 100, 250, 1,000 m, and watershed buffer scales. Tidal channel benthic diatom communities were characterized by high species richness, abundance of rare species, and an abundance of species characterized as meso-eutraphentic and eutraphentic. The number of species per site ranged between 21 and 60 (mean ± standard deviation 43.5 ± 9.4). Abundant and frequently occurring taxa included Planothidium delicatulum, Navicula gregaria, and Amphora coffeaeformis. The tidal channel benthic diatom community was most strongly correlated with variables related to human disturbance at all scales surrounding the wetland and not with any tidal channel water quality parameter, including salinity. Furthermore, developed and impervious surface land covers within the 100 and 250 m buffers were more strongly correlated with the diatom assemblage than these covers at larger spatial scales. Species richness and Shannon diversity index were both negatively correlated with the amount of wetland and mudflat surrounding the sites. Of secondary importance in structuring the diatom assemblage were sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in wetlands immediately surrounding the tidal channels. The sensitivity of the tidal creek benthic diatom assemblage to both wetland and landscape level factors indicates that it might be a useful bioindicator of human disturbance to tidal wetland ecosystems.";"Weilhoefer, Christine L.

"AGRIS:QL2012002280";"Water, women and local social organization in the Western Kenya highlands";"";"Safe water is widely recognized as both a fundamental human need and a key input into economic activity. Across the developing world, the typical approach to addressing these needs is to segregate supplies of water for domestic use from water for large-scale agricultural production. In that arrangement, the goal of domestic water supply is to provide small amounts of clean safe water for direct consumption, cleaning, bathing and sanitation, while the goal of agricultural water supply is to provide large amounts of lower quality water for irrigated agriculture. A new third use of water is now being given more attention by researchers: small amounts of water employed in selected household enterprises. This third use may be particularly important for women. There is a potential, therefore, that provision of modest amounts of water to smallholder farmers can enhance household economic production, save labor time for women and girls, and improve family health. This paper adds to the merger literature on the multiple values of improved water supplies  improved health, time savings, and small-scale production for individual farmers and collectives  for the case of a rural community in the western highlands of Kenya. With minimum external support, two groups in this community have managed to install and operate systems of spring protection and piped water to their members homesteads. A third group is in the process of replicating this success. The experience of this community also illustrates some of the challenges that must be faced for a community to effectively selforganize the investment and maintenance of a community-based water scheme. There are challenges of finance, gender relations, conflicts over scarce water supplies, group leadership, enforcement of community bi-laws, and policy. Data from a census of springs in the same area show that successful collective action for water management is unusual, but certainly not unique, in this region of Kenya. Although women emerge as the main beneficiaries of improved water management in the community, their substantial contributions are largely hidden behind social norms regarding gender roles and relations. Research methods need to carefully triangulate information sources in order to clarify the very substantial and active roles performed by women.";"Were, E.

This study evaluated socio-environmental changes in land use and land cover during 1985–2011. Screen digitization on remotely sensed data (i.e., Landsat images from 1985 to 2011) was performed to produce 10 classes of land use and land cover. Then, final land-use maps were prepared using a geographic information system following field verification and accuracy assessment. The drying of water bodies, including the prominent lakes Alemaya, Adele, and Tinike, had been the most important environmental change observed. Degraded land, marsh, perennial cropland, and residential areas increased by 37, 438, 42, and 190� %, respectively, whereas grassland, plantation, shrubland, and temporal cropland decreased by 64, 11, 63, and 29� %, respectively. The increase in land degradation (+37� %), the other major observed problem, has made large areas unsuitable for agriculture and has reduced crop productivity. These land-use and land-cover changes have affected both the environment and the livelihoods of local residents; especially the issue related to land degradation requires urgent attention.";"Meshesha, Derege Tsegaye

"AGRIS:US201500074343";"Microbial nitrogen dynamics in south central Chilean agricultural and forest ecosystems located on an Andisol";"";"The natural soil N supply in volcanic soils (Andisols) can be a significant source of plant-available N for agro-ecosystems. Nevertheless, intensive farming systems in south Chile apply high fertilization rates, which lead to high production costs and involve a risk for adverse ecosystem effects. In order to achieve sustainable land management, a better understanding of the processes that govern soil N availability and loss, and their external drivers, is required. In this study, we selected a winter-cropland, a summer crop-winter fallow rotation, and a forest, used as a reference ecosystem. Gross N transformations (15N isotope dilution) and microbial community structure (phospho-lipid fatty acid analysis) in the topsoil were determined. Gross N mineralization was about ten times lower in the agro-ecosystems than in the forest, while gross nitrification was low in all sites. Gross N immobilization equalized or exceeded the gross inorganic N production in all sites. Microbial biomass was 3–5 times more abundant in the forest than in the agro-ecosystems. A positive relationship between the ratio fungi/bacteria and total microbial biomass was observed in these Andisols. We suggest that the reduction in fungal biomass induced a lower extracellular enzyme production and limited soil organic matter depolymerisation in the agro-ecosystems. We conclude that soil N cycling was unable to provide a significant N input for the croplands, but also the risk for ecosystem N losses was low, even under fallow soil conditions. Current fertilization practices appropriately anticipated the soil N cycling processes, but further research should indicate the potential of alternative land management to reduce fertilizer cost.";"Huygens, Dries

"AGRIS:US201600069027";"Multiple SVM System for Classification of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data";"";"With recent technological advances in remote sensing sensors and systems, very high-dimensional hyperspectral data are available for a better discrimination among different complex land-cover classes. However, the large number of spectral bands, but limited availability of training samples creates the problem of Hughes phenomenon or ‘curse of dimensionality’ in hyperspectral data sets. Moreover, these high numbers of bands are usually highly correlated. Because of these complexities of hyperspectral data, traditional classification strategies have often limited performance in classification of hyperspectral imagery. Referring to the limitation of single classifier in these situations, Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) may have better performance than single classifier. This paper presents a new method for classification of hyperspectral data based on a band clustering strategy through a multiple Support Vector Machine system. The proposed method uses the band grouping process based on a modified mutual information strategy to split data into few band groups. After the band grouping step, the proposed algorithm aims at benefiting from the capabilities of SVM as classification method. So, the proposed approach applies SVM on each band group that is produced in a previous step. Finally, Naive Bayes (NB) as a classifier fusion method combines decisions of SVM classifiers. Experimental results on two common hyperspectral data sets show that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy in comparison with the standard SVM on entire bands of data and feature selection methods.";"Bigdeli, Behnaz

"AGRIS:US201600202697";"Global food supply: land use efficiency of livestock systems";"";"PURPOSE: Livestock already use most global agricultural land, whereas the demand for animal-source food (ASF) is expected to increase. To address the contribution of livestock to global food supply, we need a measure for land use efficiency of livestock systems. METHODS: Existing measures capture different aspects of the debate about land use efficiency of livestock systems, such as plant productivity and the efficiency of converting feed, especially human-inedible feed, into animal products. So far, the suitability of land for cultivation of food crops has not been accounted for. Our land use ratio (LUR) includes all above-mentioned aspects and yields a realistic insight into land use efficiency of livestock systems. LUR is defined as the maximum amount of human-digestible protein (HDP) derived from food crops on all land used to cultivate feed required to produce 1Â kg ASF over the amount of HDP in that 1Â kg ASF. We illustrated our concept for three case systems. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The LUR for the case of laying hens equaled 2.08, implying that land required to produce 1Â kg HDP from laying hens could directly yield 2.08Â kg HDP from human food crops. For dairy cows, the LUR was 2.10 when kept on sandy soils and 0.67 when kept on peat soils. The LUR for dairy cows on peat soils was lower compared to cows on sandy soils because land used to grow grass and grass silage for cows on peats was unsuitable for direct production of food crops. A LUR <1.0 is considered efficient in terms of global food supply and implies that animals produce more HDP per square metre than crops. CONCLUSIONS: Values <1.0 demonstrate that livestock produce HDP more efficiently than crops. Such livestock systems (with a LURâ";"van Zanten, Hannah H. E.

Species that depend on specific habitats are at risk of extinction when these habitats are degraded or lost. Designing robust methods to evaluate landscape composition will assist decision- and policy-making in emerging landscapes. This paper describes a rapid assessment methodology aimed at evaluating land-cover quality for birds, plants, butterflies and bees around seven UK Natura 2000 sites. An expert panel assigned quality values to standard Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land-cover classes for each taxonomic group. Quality was assessed based on historical (1950, 1990), current (2000) and future (2030) land-cover data, the last projected using three alternative scenarios: a growth-applied strategy (GRAS), a business-as-might-be-usual (BAMBU) scenario, and sustainable European development goal (SEDG) scenario. A quantitative quality index weighted the area of each land-cover parcel with a taxa-specific quality measure. Land parcels with high quality for all taxonomic groups were evaluated for temporal changes in area, size and adjacency. For all sites and taxonomic groups, the rate of deterioration of land-cover quality was greater between 1950 and 1990 than current rates or as modelled using the alternative future scenarios (2000â2030). Model predictions indicated land-cover quality stabilized over time under the GRAS scenario, and was close to stable for the BAMBU scenario. The SEDG scenario suggested an ongoing loss of quality, though this was lower than the historical rate of c. 1% loss per decade. None of the future scenarios showed accelerated fragmentation, but rather increases in the area, adjacency and diversity of high quality land parcels in the landscape.";"VOGIATZAKIS, I. N.

"AGRIS:US201400066871";"Spatially-explicit modelling of grassland classes – an improved method of integrating a climate-based classification model with interpolated climate surfaces";"";"Spatially-explicit modelling of grassland classes is important to site-specific planning for improving grassland and environmental management over large areas. In this study, a climate-based grassland classification model, the Comprehensive and Sequential Classification System (CSCS) was integrated with spatially interpolated climate data to classify grassland in Gansu province, China. The study area is characterised by complex topographic features imposed by plateaus, high mountains, basins and deserts. To improve the quality of the interpolated climate data and the quality of the spatial classification over this complex topography, three linear regression methods, namely an analytic method based on multiple regression and residues (AMMRR), a modification of the AMMRR method through adding the effect of slope and aspect to the interpolation analysis (M-AMMRR) and a method which replaces the inverse distance-weighted approach for residue interpolation in M-AMMRR with an ordinary kriging approach (I-AMMRR), for interpolating climate variables were evaluated. The interpolation outcomes from the best interpolation method were then used in the CSCS model to classify the grassland in the study area. Climate variables interpolated included the annual cumulative temperature and annual total precipitation. The results indicated that the AMMRR and M-AMMRR methods generated acceptable climate surfaces but the best model fit and cross validation result were achieved by the I-AMMRR method. Twenty-six grassland classes were classified for the study area. The four grassland vegetation classes that covered more than half of the total study area were ‘cool temperate-arid temperate zonal semi-desert’, ‘cool temperate-humid forest steppe and deciduous broad-leaved forest’, ‘temperate-extra-arid temperate zonal desert’, and ‘frigid per-humid rain tundra and alpine meadow’. The vegetation classification map generated in this study provides spatial information on the locations and extents of the different grassland classes. This information can be used to facilitate government agencies’ decision-making in land-use planning and environmental management, and for vegetation and biodiversity conservation. The information can also be used to assist land managers in the estimation of safe carrying capacities, which will help to prevent overgrazing and land degradation.";"Liu, Xiaoni

"AGRIS:US201500200125";"Extraction of hydrological proximity measures from DEMs using parallel processing";"";"Land surface topography is one of the most important terrain properties which impact hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological processes active on a landscape. In our previous efforts to develop a soil depth model based upon topographic and land cover variables, we derived a set of hydrological proximity measures (HPMs) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as potential explanatory variables for soil depth. These HPMs are variations of the distance up to ridge points (cells with no incoming flow) and variations of the distance down to stream points (cells with a contributing area greater than a threshold), following the flow path. The HPMs were computed using the D-infinity flow model that apportions flow between adjacent neighbors based on the direction of steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets constructed in a 3 × 3 grid cell window using the center cell and each pair of adjacent neighboring grid cells in turn. The D-infinity model typically results in multiple flow paths between 2 points on the topography, with the result that distances may be computed as the minimum, maximum or average of the individual flow paths. In addition, each of the HPMs, are calculated vertically, horizontally, and along the land surface. Previously, these HPMs were calculated using recursive serial algorithms which suffered from stack overflow problems when used to process large datasets, limiting the size of DEMs that could be analyzed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a message passing interface (MPI) parallel approach designed to both increase the size and speed with which these HPMs are computed. The parallel HPM algorithms spatially partition the input grid into stripes which are each assigned to separate processes for computation. Each of those processes then uses a queue data structure to order the processing of cells so that each cell is visited only once and the cross-process communications that are a standard part of MPI are handled in an efficient manner. This parallel approach allows efficient analysis of much larger DEMs than were possible using the serial recursive algorithms. The HPMs given here may also have other, more general modeling applicability in hydrology, geomorphology and ecology, and so are described here from a general perspective. In this paper, we present the definitions of the HPMs, the serial and parallel algorithms used in their computation and their potential applications.";"Tesfa, Teklu K.

People are relocated from uninhabitable areas to immigrant areas, resulting in land use changes, which would significantly impact the ecological environment. Therefore, it urgently needs quantitative evaluation and analysis of the trends of ecological change in these immigrant areas. We selected Luanjingtan, which is the largest ecological immigrant area in Alxa, Inner Mongolia, as our case. In this case, we chose ecological carrying capacity (EC) and ecosystem services value as indicators to evaluate the ecological changes from 1992 to 2011. Due to the expansion of cropland and grassland, the total EC increased from 320.0 gha in 1992 to 86,214.6 gha in 2011, and the total ecosystem services value increased from 570.0 million yuan in 1992 to 963.1 million yuan in 2011. The expansions of cropland and grassland were closely related to agricultural development and a project for returning grazing land to pasture in Luanjigntan. These measures provided a livelihood as well as alleviated the grazing pressure. Therefore, creating a sustainable long-term industry to address the conflict between environmental protection and the needs of those affected by the plan is one of the most important considerations in a grassland ecological migration project.";"Song, Yuqin

"AGRIS:US201500200123";"automated land subdivision tool for urban and regional planning: Concepts, implementation and testing";"";"Simulation of the land subdivision process is useful in many applied and research areas. Planners use such tools to understand potential impacts of planning regulations prior to their implementation. While the credibility of both land-use change and urban growth models would be enhanced by integrating capabilities to simulate land subdivision, such research is lacking in the published literature. Of the few subdivision tools that exist, most are either not fully-automated or are unable to generate realistic subdivision layouts. This limits their applicability, particularly for high resolution land-use change models. In this paper, we present a fully-automated land subdivision tool that uses vector data and is capable of generating layouts with both lot and street arrangements for land parcels of any shape. When the new streets are generally parallel to each other and lots are of approximately the same size, the simulation’s output very closely resembles observed subdivision patterns in our southeastern Australia study area. From this, we identify opportunities to improve the subdivision tool for a next version. Future research will also explore how this subdivision tool could be used in conjunction with a land-use change model for urban and regional planning.";"Wickramasuriya, Rohan

A general model is developed to estimate NSLR from the NSSR for cloudy skies with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.16 W m⁻² compared with in situ data. The model is applied to AmeriFlux data. The results show that the mean error and RMSE are –2.31 W m⁻² and 29.25 W m⁻², respectively, compared with the measurement of AmeriFlux. To examine the significance of the influence of seasons on the estimated NSLR, the model is proposed as a function of seasonal variation. The results show a slight improvement for winter and spring, whereas a larger error is found for autumn compared with the results obtained by the general model. The influences of land cover and elevation on the model are also investigated. The results show that the model is slightly sensitive to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the elevation. The RMSE of the model decreases from 23.16 W m⁻² to 21.04 W m⁻² when the NDVI and the elevation are considered in the model.";"Zhou, Xiao-Ming

Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the types of community’s forest dependency and to identify the effects of community’s forest dependency towards forest resources and wildlife abundance. The data were collected using the self-administered questionnaire, involving 204 community members in Bau District, Sarawak. The results show that the common types of forest dependency are private land ownership, land area of less than 10 acres, less than 50 meters of house distance to forest, land utilization for house site and agriculture purposes, and estimated income and expenditure of less than RM 1000. The land use–paddy field, forest resources–handicraft and forest resources–water source significantly predict the abundance of forest cover. The land use–house site, house distance to forest and forest resources–hunting significantly predict the wildlife abundance. The forest resources–house material and forest resources–water source significantly predict the water source quality. The community’s forest dependency needs to be revisited to further understand the community’s needs and how this dependency can be made more sustainable, while less destructing the forest. Hence, a sustainable framework involving all stakeholders is needed to manage the community’s forest dependency.";"Nelson, Julia

The objective of this paper was to demonstrate a simple technique to visualize and quantify the change in mangrove area using a 3-year dataset of Landsat TM images acquired in 1989, 2003 and 2009. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated to determine high and low vegetation biomass in each image. Each NDVI extracted by Landsat image in 1989, 2003 and 2009 was assigned to red, green and blue (RGB) color, respectively, and then combined to make color composites. Additive color theory was applied to interpret mangrove changes within the MNR area on the RGB-NDVI color composite. Changed areas were quantified by performing an unsupervised classification on the RGB-NDVI image with 45 classes that were grouped into eight major mangrove change categories. An Indonesian land cover map was used to assess the accuracy of the classified image. The result showed that 77.13% of the MNR area was unchanged and 22.87% of the MNR area changed over 20 years (1989–2009).";"Pujiono, Eko

Indirect land use is a change from non-cropland to cropland (e.g. deforestation) that may occur in response to increasing scarcity of cropland.  As farmers worldwide respond to higher crop prices in order to maintain the global food supply and demand balance, pristine lands are cleared and converted to new cropland to replace the crops for feed and food that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels production.

The objective of this study was to reveal the spatially explicit land surface change by minimizing the confounding factors of weather variability, seasonal offset, topography, land cover, and drainage. In a pilot study of the Yukon River Basin of interior Alaska, we retrieved Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, and land surface temperature (LST) from a postfire Landsat image acquired on August 5th, 2004. With a Landsat reference image acquired on June 26th, 1986, we reconstructed NDVI, albedo, and LST of 1987–2004 fire scars for August 5th, 2004, assuming that these fires had not occurred. The difference between actual postfire and assuming-no-fire scenarios depicted the fires and succession impact. Our results demonstrated the following: (1) NDVI showed an immediate decrease after burning but gradually recovered to prefire levels in the following years, in which burn severity might play an important role during this process; (2) Albedo showed an immediate decrease after burning but then recovered and became higher than prefire levels; and (3) Most fires caused surface warming, but cooler surfaces did exist; time-since-fire affected the prefire and postfire LST difference but no absolute trend could be found. Our approach provided spatially explicit land surface change rather than average condition, enabling a better understanding of fires and succession impact on ecological consequences at the pixel level.";"Huang, Shengli

These were selected for a comparison of rocky desertification and land use cover. Based mainly on 5� m resolution Spot 5, remote sensing images, topographic maps (1:10,000) and land use maps, the intensity and extent of rocky desertification, and slope characteristics of the two areas were interpreted. Spatial overlay analysis was used to compare the land use/land cover (LULC) and rocky desertification within each. The results were compared using the concepts of rocky desertification occurrence (RDO) among LULC classes and the structure value of desertification land (SVDL). The results demonstrated that (1) the landforms and extent of rocky desertification in the two areas are significantly different and the proportion of very steep slopes is one of the reasons leading to large areas of rocky desertification; (2) the RDO and SVDL show significant differences between the two areas; also rocky desertification intensity in various LULC classes cannot be measured in terms of RDO. High RDO may occur in low-intensity desertification land, and vice versa; (3) the structural characteristics of rocky desertification among various LULC are consistent among the woodland, “bare land” and “other grassland” land use classes in the two areas, but sequence slight� >� moderate� >� intense is not consistent between the areas. For the rocky desertification control, the present authors consider that the spatial distribution differences of rocky desertification and LULC among areas with different landform types area combined with the intensity of rocky desertification should be used in designing appropriate measures for control of desertification and rehabilitation of land.";"Ying, Bin

"AGRIS:US201301959959";"Effects of long-term soil and crop management on soil hydraulic properties for claypan soils";"";"Various land management decisions are based on local soil properties. These soil properties include average values from soil characterization for each soil series. In reality, these properties might be variable due to substantially different management, even for similar soil series. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that for claypan soils, hydraulic properties can be significantly affected by long-term soil and crop management. Sampling was conducted during the summer of 2008 from two fields with Mexico silt loam (Vertic Epiaqualfs). One field has been under continuous row crop cultivation for over 100 years (Field), while the other field is a native prairie that has never been tilled (Tucker Prairie). Soil cores (76 × 76 mm [3.0 × 3.0 in]) from six replicate locations from each field were sampled to a 60 cm (24 in) depth at 10 cm (3.9 in) intervals. Samples were analyzed for bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat)), soil water retention, and pore-size distributions. Values of coarse (60 to 1,000 μm [0.0024 to 0.039 in] effective diameter) and fine mesoporosity (10 to 60 μm [0.00039 to 0.0024 in] effective diameter) for the Field site (0.044 and 0.053 m3 m−3 [0.044 and 0.053 in3 in−3]) were almost half those values from the Tucker Prairie site (0.081 and 0.086 m3 m−3 [0.081 and 0.086 in3 in−3]). The geometric mean value of K(sat) was 57 times higher in the native prairie site (316 mm h−1 [12.4 in hr−1]) than in the cropped field (5.55 mm h−1 [0.219 in hr−1]) for the first 10 cm (3.9 in) interval. Differences in K(sat) values were partly explained by the significant differences in pore-size distributions. The bulk density of the surface layer at the Tucker Prairie site (0.81 g cm−3 [50.6 lb ft−3]) was two-thirds of the value at the Field site (1.44 g cm−3 [89.9 lb ft−3]), and was significantly different throughout the soil profile, except for the 20 to 30 cm (7.9 to 12 in) depth. These results show that row crop management and its effect on soil loss have significantly altered the hydraulic properties for this soil. Results from this study increase our understanding of the effects of long-term soil management on soil hydraulic properties.";"Mudgal, A.

Distance from water can be considered like a surrogate of grazing pressure being high near the water and low away from it. The main aim of this study is to investigate overgrazing effects on acceptability of fodder plants along a grazing gradient around three natural watering points. To achieve this goal, we classified spontaneous plants according to their acceptability degree and we followed their cover, richness and density as well as the grazing value along a grazing gradient around these wells, using phyto-ecological studies during the spring 2004 and 2006. Main results show that very palatable plants (mainly constituted by annuals) are more dominant in both the closed and the more disturbed transect areas around wells. The unpalatable plants dominate sites with moderate disturbance around wells. Ligneous palatable species obviously have a lower degree of disturbance. During the studied seasons the grazing gradient around wells 1 and 2, the oldest ones, seemed to exert a feedback upon the grazing intensity.";"Tarhouni, Mohamed

"AGRIS:US201400165315";"Phosphorus saturation of a tropical soil and related P leaching caused by poultry litter addition";"";"Phosphorus deficiency is well known as a major agronomic constraint in the highly weathered Oxisols of Brazil and reasonable economic returns are not possible without application of high rates of phosphorus. Poultry litter, which is enriched in P, is increasingly being used in organic management of cultivated lands. Due to the great P fixing capacity of these soils, any limit to the soil sink of P is not recognized. The study was undertaken to evaluate the risk of P loss due to increase in phosphorus sorption saturation (PSS) from land application of poultry litter and to establish a relationship between PSS and water soluble phosphorus. No till corn-fallow rotation was followed for three years with annual application of 0, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100Mgha⁻¹ of poultry litter in a highly weathered clayey dystrophic red-yellow Argisol of Brazil. The effect of poultry litter application on soil was evaluated and Mehlich-3 P (PM₋₃) concentrations increased 3–134 times over control after three years of poultry litter application. Poultry litter application increased pH and decreased the concentration of exchangeable Al; whereas concentrations of K⁺, Na⁺, Zn²⁺, Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ increased substantially over control. Increase in soil pH and total organic carbon due to poultry litter application reduced the P sorption capacity of soils and P sorption. The PSS increased considerably at higher rates of poultry litter application (>10Mgha⁻¹) and strongly increased the amount of desorbable P. Total water extractable P was mostly accounted for by reactive P forms and increased with poultry litter rates. In a plot of dissolved reactive P (DRP) against PSS, a change point was observed at 22.7% PSS corresponding to a dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentration of 0.92mgkg⁻¹ soil after which a sharp increase in DRP was observed. P concentration >0.1mgL⁻¹ was observed in soil solution at 60cm soil depth with increasing rates of poultry litter application, thus providing evidence of P leaching. In the absence of an environmental soil test criteria for P, the break point PSS of 22.7% could be used to practically monitor whether soils have reached a level of P loading that constitutes an environmental risk of P losses from soil to surface and ground waters.";"Abdala, Dalton Belchior

"AGRIS:US201400165314";"Drivers of songbird productivity at a restored gravel pit: Influence of seasonal flooding and rainfall patterns and implications for habitat management";"";"The restoration of riparian sites following aggregate extraction frequently aims to expand the wetland habitat, and enhance the wetland wildlife community. However, aggregate extraction sites, typically on river flood plains, are subject to unpredictable flooding along with climate variability and other factors beyond the control of local management that may be equally important in determining the success or failure of a restoration project. Here we report on an 18-year study tracking songbird productivity and changes in the avian community following the restoration of a gravel pit on the flood plain of the River Great Ouse, Cambridgeshire. As part of the British Trust for Ornithology's Constant Effort Site ringing scheme, the productivity (ratio of young: adult captured) of 5 migrant and 6 resident species was measured systematically. Capture data along with environmental variables pertinent to the flood plain habitat were analysed using generalised linear models. For some migrant species (e.g. willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus and reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus) breeding success was predicted by maximum winter flood. The productivity of resident species (e.g. dunnock Prunella modularis) was predicted not only by the overall amount of rain (positively related to production) but also the extent of spring downpours (negatively related to production). We expected that a major influence on the avian community would be the passage of time and associated vegetation succession. However, winter flood was found to be particularly important, as to a lesser extent was spring rain and unseasonal cold snaps. Detrended correspondence analysis of the total numbers of birds captured (adults+young) for 16 species showed that the changing avian community was shaped by winter floods more than by patterns in precipitation. It would appear that the avian community is influenced by patterns of habitat change, shaped as much by climate variability as local land management.";"Harrison, Nancy

"AGRIS:US2016218961";"INVESTMENT IN SOIL CONSERVATION IN NORTHERN ETHIOPIA: THE ROLE OF LAND TENURE SECURITY AND PUBLIC PROGRAMS";"";"Soil erosion seriously threatens the future agricultural productivity of Ethiopia's highlands. In analyzing the determinants of soil conservation investments there, this study goes beyond the conventional physical factors to examine institutional, social capital and public program effects.  The double hurdle statistical analysis from 250 farms in the Tigray region reveals different causal factors for soil conservation adoption versus intensity of use.The determinants of adoption of soil conservation measures vary sharply between stone terraces and soil bunds. Physical propensity toward erosion (e.g., slope, slope shape and soil texture) and land suitability for conservation helped determine conservation investments in all cases.  But institutional and social determinants of investment differed importantly between bunds and terraces.  Long-term investments in stone terraces were associated with secure land tenure, labor availability, proximity to the farmstead, and learning opportunities via the availability of food-for-work projects.  By contrast, short-term investments in soil bunds were strongly linked to insecure land tenure and the absence of food-for-work projects.  Farm beneficiaries of public soil conservation programs were less likely to invest privately in either type of conservation practice.  Social capital, as measured by farmer perception of community pressure to curb soil erosion, did not contribute significantly to either kind of conservation investment.The intensity of stone terrace adoption (measured as meters of terrace per hectare) was determined by expected returns but not by capacity to invest.  Higher intensity of stone terrace construction was favored by fertile-but-erodible silty soils in (rainy) highland settings that offered valuable yield benefits from soil conservation.  Intensity of terracing was also greater in remote villages where limited off-farm employment opportunities made construction costs relatively low.Previous research has highlighted the need for public policy interventions to supplement private incentives to make soil conservation investments in erosion-prone mountain areas.  Our results highlight the importance of the right kind of public interventions.  Direct public involvement in constructing soil conservation structures on private lands appears to undermine incentives for private conservation investments.  When done on public lands, however, public conservation activities may encourage private soil conservation by example.  Secure land tenure rights clearly reinforce private incentives to make long-term investments in soil conservation.";"Gebremedhin, Berhanu

"AGRIS:LV2016024454";"Designing management options to reduce surface runoff and sediment yield with farmers: An experiment in south-western France";"";"To preserve the quality of surface water, official French regulations require farmers to keep a minimum acreage of grassland, especially bordering rivers. These agro-environmental measures do not account for the circulation of water within the catchment. This paper examines whether it is possible to design with the farmers agri-environmental measures at field and catchment scale to prevent soil erosion and surface water pollution. To support this participatory approach, the hydrology and erosion model STREAM was used for assessing the impact of a spring stormy event on surface runoff and sediment yield with various management scenarios. The study was carried out in collaboration with an agricultural committee in an area of south-western France where erosive runoff has a major impact on the quality of surface water. Two sites (A and B) were chosen with farmers to discuss ways of reducing total surface runoff and sediment yield at each site. The STREAM model was used to assess surface runoff and sediment yield under current cropping pattern at each site and to evaluate management scenarios including grass strips implementation or changes in cropping patterns within the catchment. The results of STREAM simulations were analysed jointly by farmers and researchers. Moreover, the farmers discussed each scenario in terms of its technical and economical feasibility. STREAM simulations showed that a 40 mm spring rainfall with current cropping patterns led to 3116 m(3) total water runoff and 335 metric tons of sediment yield at site A, and 3249 m(3) and 241 metric tons at site B. Grass strips implementation could reduce runoff for about 40% and sediment yield for about 50% at site A. At site B, grass strips could reduce runoff and sediment yield for more than 50%, but changes in cropping pattern could reduce it almost totally. The simulations led to three main results: (i) grass strips along rivers and ditches prevented soil sediments from entering the surface water but did not reduce soil losses, (ii) crop redistribution within the catchment was as efficient as planting grass strips, and (iii) efficient management of erosive runoff required coordination between all the farmers using the same watershed. This study shown that STREAM model was a useful support for farmers' discussions about how to manage runoff and sediment yield in their fields.";"Furlan, Adriana

"AGRIS:US201600079515";"Social network effects on the adoption of sustainable natural resource management practices in Ethiopia";"";"Soil loss, nutrient depletion and land degradation contribute to the skimpy performance of smallholder agriculture and pose serious policy challenges in developing countries. Surprisingly, natural resource management practices that enhance sustainability while improving productivity have not been fully adopted despite continuous efforts of promotion. Using data collected from 2901 farm households in the Farmers Innovation Fund (FIF) of the World Bank, this study examines factors delaying adoption of resource management and farming practices from the perspective of social learning and network size. Specifically, the study aims at identifying the extent to which differences in network structure matter in providing opportunities to learn about new ways of sustainable resource management practices using regression analysis. The result confirms that social network size plays a significant role in enhancing adoption of natural resource management practices. Moreover, external sources of information such as extension provision play a crucial role in enhancing adoption of resource management practices. Thus, future endeavours should link extension services to informal networks to enhance adoption of sustainable natural resource management practices.";"Wossen, Tesfamicheal

Several co-investment efforts have been implemented to combat land degradation and increase agricultural production in the Ethiopian highlands. Nevertheless, these co-investment activities have not been documented. Moreover, the impacts of these activities have not been evaluated. This study presents a co-investment initiative for sustainable land management in the Galessa watershed in Ethiopia. It documents successful co-investment activities that trigger farmers to carry out land management practices, and assesses the impact of these activities on farmers’ land management investments. The most important co-investment activities that trigger farmers to invest in land management are co-investments in awareness creation , water provision , technology , and governance. Of these activities, co-investing in water provision is most successful, because it directly solves one of the basic needs of farmers in the watershed. Results reveal that the experimental group of farmers (participants in the co-investment initiative) – compared to the control group (nonparticipants) – invested significantly more in land management practices such as soil bunds, composting, and tree planting. This article concludes that use of multiple co-investment activities are crucial to trigger farmers to invest in land management in Ethiopia.";"Adimassu, Zenebe

The update cycle of the NLCD product is infrequent; NLCD 2001 was the first update since the release of NLCD 1992, and was not yet fully completed as of late 2006. Consequently, FIA field data collected as recently as 2005 are being poststratified with land cover data collected more than a decade before. In addition, NRS-FIA has performed its own land cover classification of remotely sensed imagery for use in the stratification of some States, a time-consuming process. Alternative sources of information need to be evaluated both to eliminate the temporal mismatch between land cover data and FIA plot information and to reduce the amount of analyst time required to perform the stratification process. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, in conjunction with the Foreign Agricultural Service, produces the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) using satellite imagery. The product, updated yearly for multiple States, includes detailed classification of crop type and also a ""Woodland"" category. In this study, the CDL was compared to the NLCD 1992 data set for Wisconsin. This comparison included two components: (1) county-level, pixel-derived estimates of forest land area relative to each other and to plot-based FIA estimates and (2) variance reduction produced by each layer when used in postsampling stratification of FIA plots for estimating primary FIA attributes (forest area, number of trees, timber volume, and tree biomass). Results indicate poor agreement between CDL pixel-based area estimates and FIA plot-based estimates; however, when used for poststratification, the CDL produces similar estimates of primary FIA attributes to those of the NLCD at the State level and higher relative efficiency at the FIA survey-unit level.";"Liknes, Greg C.

II: Economic assessment of CO2 abatement through the use of phytoremediation crops for renewable energy production";"";"Phytoremediation could be a sustainable remediation alternative for conventional remediation technologies. However, its implementation on a commercial scale remains disappointing. To emphasize its sustainability, this paper examines whether and how the potential economic benefit of CO2 abatement for different crops used for phytoremediation or sustainable land management purposes could promote phytotechnologies. Our analysis is based on a case study in the Campine region, where agricultural soils are contaminated with mainly cadmium. We use Life Cycle Analysis to show for the most relevant crops (willow (Salix spp), energy maize (Zea mays), and rapeseed (Brassica napus)), that phytoremediation, used for renewable energy production, could abate CO2. Converting this in economic numbers through the Marginal Abatement Cost of CO2 (€ 20 ton−1) we can integrate this in the economic analysis to compare phytoremediation crops among each other, and phytoremediation with conventional technologies. The external benefit of CO2 abatement when using phytoremediation crops for land management ranges between € 55 and € 501 per hectare. The purpose of these calculations is not to calculate a subsidy for phytoremediation. There is no reason why one would prefer phytoremediation crops for renewable energy production over “normal” biomass. Moreover, subsidies for renewable energy already exist. Therefore, we should not integrate these numbers in the economic analysis again. However, these numbers could contribute to making explicit the competitive advantage of phytoremediation compared to conventional remediation technologies, but also add to a more sustainably funded decision on which crop should be grown on contaminated land.";"Witters, N.

Two methodological approaches, remote sensing and botanical field surveys, were applied. Historical (1949, 1970, 1990) and contemporary (2006) aerial photographs were analysed to determine land cover. Landscape configuration and structure were analysed using eight landscape metrics selected in advance to measure spatio-temporal changes and the fragmentation of the lake ecosystem and its corresponding buffer zone. The species diversity, abundance and distribution of true aquatic macrophytes were surveyed eleven times in five survey stretches between 1973 and 2007. At the landscape level, a decrease in the area covered by floating-leaved macrophytes, as well as an increase in open water surface and fragmentation of the land cover classes in the lake ecosystem, were recorded from 1949 to 2006. Overall, 30 true aquatic macrophytes were found from 1973 to 2007. Species richness did not change considerably, but the abundance of aquatic species fluctuated over the years. Three groups of true aquatic vegetation, based on common structural characteristics, were found in 1973–1983, 1989–2002, and 2004–2007 over the last 34years. The landscape metrics NP, PD, LPI, and SHDI, which all express patterns of landscape fragmentation mostly indicate temporal changes in floating-leaved macrophytes.";"Oťaheľová, Helena

"AGRIS:US201400104314";"Seasonality of Soil Erosion Under Mediterranean Conditions at the Alqueva Dam Watershed";"";"The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6� MJ� mm� ha⁻¹� h⁻¹), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9� t� ha⁻¹), contributing 65� % of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1� t� ha⁻¹) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6� MJ� mm� ha⁻¹� h⁻¹). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1� t� ha⁻¹, and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314� ×� 10³� kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices. This model will be integrated with World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies methods to support decision-making in that watershed, and it will involve collaboration with both local people and governmental institutions.";"Ferreira, Vera

One of the main causes for the conversion of land is the rapid expansion of the oil palm sector. Land use change involves a progressive loss of forest cover, with major impacts on biodiversity and global CO₂ emissions. Ecosystem services have been proposed as a concept that would facilitate the identification of sustainable land management options, however, the scale of land conversion and its spatial diversity pose particular challenges in Indonesia. The objective of this paper is to analyze how ecosystem services can be mapped at the provincial scale, focusing on Central Kalimantan, and to examine how ecosystem services maps can be used for a land use planning. Central Kalimantan is subject to rapid deforestation including the loss of peatland forests and the provincial still lacks a comprehensive land use plan. We examine how seven key ecosystem services can be mapped and modeled at the provincial scale, using a variety of models, and how large scale ecosystem services maps can support the identification of options for sustainable expansion of palm oil production.";"Sumarga, Elham

"AGRIS:US201500078326";"new LandscapeDNDC biogeochemical module to predict CH4 and N 2O emissions from lowland rice and upland cropping systems";"";"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Replacing paddy rice by upland systems such as maize cultivation is an on-going trend in SE Asia caused by increasing water scarcity and higher demand for meat. How such land management changes will feedback on soil C and N cycles and soil greenhouse gas emissions is not well understood at present. METHODS: A new LandscapeDNDC biogeochemical module was developed that allows the effect of land management changes on soil C and N cycle to be simulated. The new module is applied in combination with further modules simulating microclimate and crop growth and evaluated against observations from field experiments. RESULTS: The model simulations agree well with observed dynamics of CH₄emissions in paddy rice depending on changes in climatic conditions and agricultural management. Magnitude and peak emission periods of N₂O from maize cultivation are simulated correctly, though there are still deficits in reproducing day-to-day dynamics. These shortcomings are most likely related to simulated soil hydrology and may only be resolved if LandscapeDNDC is coupled to more complex hydrological models. CONCLUSIONS: LandscapeDNDC allows for simulation of changing land management practices in SE Asia. The possibility to couple LandscapeDNDC to more complex hydrological models is a feature needed to better understand related effects on soil-atmosphere-hydrosphere interactions.";"Kraus, David

However, little is known about how maintaining habitat connectivity for one species or species group may also act as an umbrella for other species. We evaluated the degree to which predicted connected habitat for each of 144 different hypothetical organisms expressing range of dispersal abilities and ecological responses to elevation, roads and land cover function as an indicators of connected habitat for the others in the U.S. Northern Rocky Mountains. We used resistant kernel modeling to map the extent of the study area predicted to be connected by dispersal for each species. At relatively large dispersal abilities there was extensive overlap between connected habitat for most organisms and much of the study area is predicted to provide connected habitat for all hypothetical organisms simultaneously. In contrast, at low to medium dispersal abilities there was much less intersection of habitat connected by dispersal. We found that habitat specialists with limited dispersal ability are weak indicators of others, and likewise are weakly indicated by others. We evaluated the effectiveness of three carnivores as connectivity umbrellas for many species. All three carnivore species performed significantly worse as connectivity umbrellas than the average across the simulated species. These species are associated with high elevation forested habitats. It is the low elevation and non-forest habitats that are most at risk of habitat loss and fragmentation in the study area, suggesting that a carnivore umbrella may miss many species most at risk.";"Cushman, Samuel A.

"AGRIS:US201500217602";"Land claims and the pursuit of co-management on four protected areas in South Africa";"";"Successful land claims on protected areas by previously disenfranchised communities often result in co-management agreements between claimant communities and state conservation agencies. South Africa, in particular, has pursued co-management as the desired outcome of land claims on its protected areas. We review four cases of co-management on protected areas in South Africa, and reflect on the appropriateness of the pursuit of co-management as the preferred outcome of land claims. Despite promises of pro-poor, democratically informed management, the practical experience of co-management has seen the continuation of the status quo in terms of conservation, with very few material benefits for claimant communities and limited sharing of responsibilities and decision-making functions. The findings underscore two deep challenges facing co-management in cases of land claims worldwide. First, during land claims negotiations in cases involving protected areas, the state cannot be expected to represent the best interests of its citizens (the land claimants), while simultaneously seeking to meet national and international obligations for protected area coverage. Second, the concept of democratic co-management may sit uncomfortably beside the realities of managing loss-making protected areas with ever-shrinking conservation budgets. Where co-management agreements have already been signed, ensuring that new landowners do indeed have a say in management should form the driving focus for co-management practice going forward.";"Cundill, G.

Moreover, land cover data are one of the primary inputs to many geospatial models. In South-East Asia's cities where the houses are interspersed with small trees, bare land and grassland are difficult to detect in multispectral Landsat ETM+ images because its 30 × 30 m spatial resolution is likely to capture a variety of land cover within each pixel, particularly in urban areas. Although other medium resolution multispectral satellites such as ALOS, SPOT, IRS, and so on have higher spatial resolution than Landsat ETM+, it is sometimes difficult to extract the built-up or human settlement areas because of the lack of shortwave infrared bands, which are very useful for distinguishing between soil and vegetation. In this article, we generated land cover data from both Landsat ETM+ multispectral and pansharpened images by applying the same training areas but using different spectral properties. We differentiated between two classified images visually, spectrally, and spatially. Our results showed that 65% of the total area had similar land cover and 35% had dissimilar land cover. Although dense urban areas, forest, agricultural land, and water were almost the same in the classified images, sparse urban areas and grassland were quite different. Much of the sparse urban areas were detected using the pansharpened classified imagery. This is important in South-East Asian cities where many houses are mixed with trees or grassland. Accurate delineation of human settlement area plays a critical role in population estimation, socio-economic studies, disaster management, and regional development planning.";"Lwin, Ko Ko

This policy note provides a preview of key findings of the OECD's agricultural policy review for South Africa.Over the last 15 years, with the abolition of apartheid, South Africa has experienced fundamental change led by dramatic policy reforms aimed at creating a more open and market-oriented economy. As a part of the democratization process, the South African government has directed its macroeconomic policy towards stabilizing the economic environment, attaching high importance to the confidence of domestic entrepreneurs and the international community.South Africa defines its agricultural policy objectives in the context of broad economic reforms. The government's vision for the sector entails sustainable and profitable participation in the South African agricultural economy by all stakeholders. It recognises the importance of maintaining and developing commercial production and strengthening international competitiveness, and at the same time it stresses the need to address the historical legacies and biases of apartheid. Agricultural and rural development play a critical role in contributing to this broad economic growth and macroeconomic stability.Agriculture in South Africa is highly dualistic with a small number of commercial operations run predominately by white farmers and large numbers of subsistence farms run by black farmers. The dismantling of apartheid signified a strong commitment to develop a new class of black farmers and to integrate them into a market economy. Small holder farming, still located mostly in the former homelands, is an impoverished sector, dominated by low-input, labour-intensive production.";"Polcyn, Tania

"AGRIS:US201400048950";"Understanding Landscape Stewardship – Lessons to be Learned from Public Service Economics";"";"We argue that public service economics provides a new perspective on landscape stewardship by explaining it as human‐to‐human transfer of partial property rights. These mutually linked exchanges involve rights to use, to access, or to control and allocate land, labour, skills or information. From the perspective of public service economics, we identify the actors involved in landscape stewardship and distinguish entrepreneurial strategies for service provision based on resource orientation, user orientation or competiveness orientation. The difficulties in evaluating the quality of services in general and landscape stewardship in particular result in substantial uncertainty. Three types of contracts that cope differently with this uncertainty can be distinguished: contracts focusing on the technical process, on the intended outcome or on the choice of suppliers based on trust and features of their performance potential. We conclude that a service economics perspective can add to the understanding of landscape stewardship. Due to the fact that ‘public service’ is already a well‐known and broadly acknowledged concept in society, public service economics could possibly provide more rapid progress towards a better co‐ordination of supply and demand for landscape qualities than other more novel concepts.";"Penker, Marianne

"AGRIS:US201600100534";"Linking Farmers’ Knowledge, Farming Strategies, and Consequent Cultivation Patterns into the Identification of Healthy Agroecosystem Characteristics at Local Scales";"";"In order to identify sustainable management solutions for small-scale farmer agroecosystems, a better understanding of these dynamic forest–farmland systems, existing farming and forestry strategies, and farmer perspectives is important. We examined the relationship between agricultural land use patterns and farmers’ practices and identified existing and potential characteristics of healthy agroecosystems at local scale in the context of village communities in Zanzibar, Tanzania. With in-depth household survey and participatory mapping, five distinct cropping patterns were identified and their relation to land cover elucidated. Consequences of the diverse local farming strategies to field level cultivation patterns are dynamic. However, long-term adaptation of the local farmers to prevailing edaphic site conditions and resource-poor circumstances create fragmented but fairly stable land use patterns at landscape level. By integrating local expert knowledge and realities with scientific knowledge, we identified sustainable agroecosystem characteristics and farming practices, which are knowledge-intensive, alternative and adaptable to local conditions. Some of these practices are already a part of the local farming strategies and some require training and higher level support to reach healthier agroecosystem and better food security. They also offer potential opportunities for forest conservation since their tree-based nature provide forest products to the communities.";"Eilola, Salla

"AGRIS:US201600195460";"Land usage classification: a hierarchical neural network approach";"";"The classification of land usage in mountain grassland bovine areas is important for the management of forage production and grazing in grass-based livestock systems. The present paper proposes a novel, hierarchical neural network-based approach towards the classification of land usage in these areas. A survey of 72 farms was conducted in the Massif Central (France). Information was gathered on geographical characteristics and cutting and/or grazing practices on three general groups of fields: cut only, cut and grazed and grazed only fields. To classify land usage, the data were clustered and visualized in a hierarchical fashion. This was done by using a novel method for the analysis and classification of data based on growing hierarchical self-organizing maps (GHSOM). Self-organizing maps (SOM) have been shown to be successful for the analysis of highly dimensional input data in data mining applications as well as for data visualization. Moreover, the hierarchical architecture of the GHSOM is more flexible than a single SOM in the adaptation process to input data, capturing inherent hierarchical relationships among them. Experimental results show the utility of this approach.";"PALOMO, E. J.

A közelmúltban erősödött a magyarországi földpiac megmozdulását várók tábora, a 2011 májusában lejáró derogáció miatt. A szakemberek optimisták, mert a lejáró derogációval kiszélesedhet a vásárlói kör. A hazai agrárgazdaság egyik legnagyobb gondja a tőkehiány, ami akadályozza a technikai és technológiai fejlesztést, az ágazat versenyképessé és jövedelmezőbbé tételét. A földpiac megnyitása becslések szerint ezer milliárd forintot hozhatna az ágazatba, hatalmas lökést adhatna az innovációnak és ugrásszerűen javíthatna az agrárgazdaságból közvetve vagy közvetlenül élők helyzetén. A fő kérdés véleményem szerint nem az, vehetnek-e külföldiek termőföldet, hanem az, milyen feltételrendszerrel lehet egyrészt megakadályozni a spekulánsok beáramlását, másrészt ösztönözni a magyar gazdálkodók földszerzését? Véleményem szerint nem kell kizárni a külföldieket a vásárlásból, mert úgy alakítható a szabályozás, hogy a magyar gazdák kerüljenek előtérbe, amire számos jó példa található tőlünk nyugatra. ---------------------------------------------------- Although land prices have increased in the recent years, the significant price jump and increased sales activities in the land market, expected to be caused by Hungary’s accession to the EU, did not come to pass. No major turn occurred in rent levels either. Recently, a growing number of people have begun to expect to see stirring in the Hungarian land market due to the expiry of the derogation in 2011 May. Specialists are optimistic, because the end of the derogation could cause the widening of the customer base. One of the greatest problems for Hungarian agro-economy is the lack of capital, which prevents technical and technological improvement or the strengthening of competitiveness and profitability. Opening of the land market is estimated to bring a thousand billion Forint into the sector, could boost innovation and greatly improve the situation of people living off agriculture either directly or indirectly. In my opinion, the key question is not whether foreigners should be allowed to buy agricultural land but the conditions which could effectively prevent the inflow of speculators and could also promote the land acquisition of Hungarian farmers. I do not think that foreigners should be barred from purchasing land; on the other hand, regulations should favour Hungarian farmers. There are several good examples of similar regimes in the West.";"Kurucz, Adrienn";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016220948";"http://purl.umn.edu/99140";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016207158";"Mitigating Land Use Changes From Biofuel Expansion: An Assessment of Biofuel Feedstock Yield Potential in APEC Economies";"";"The emerging biofuel sector has drawn great interest as an alternative source of fuel for transportation. The expansion of biofuels greatly impacts world agricultural markets, since currently, the primary feedstocks for ethanol and biodiesel production are field crops and their derived products. There is great interest in the potential of countries to expand their biofuel sectors through increased production of feedstocks. The long-term potential for developing first-generation biofuels in many countries depends on a large and constant supply of feedstocks. This may be achieved in two ways: land extensification and/or land intensification. However, expansion of land area comes with a number of environmental challenges highlighted by the recent debate on indirect land use change brought about by biofuel expansion (Searchinger et al., 2008; Fargione et al., 2008). Therefore, land intensification through yield growth, and production of second-generation biofuel feedstocks, such as crop residues and perennial grass on marginal land, are generally seen as critical factors for sustainable development of biofuels as well as mitigation of land use changes. In this context, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the yield trends and the future yield potential of biofuel feedstocks to help determine the impact of biofuel expansion on agricultural markets. Therefore, the aim of this analysis is to review and analyze historical and projected trends of crop yields, particularly for crops used in biofuel production. One of our major interests is the impact of crop prices on yields in the long run, given that the increased production of biofuels from crops has created a perceived permanent increase in crop prices. Based on this analysis, we draw conclusions regarding the yield potential of biofuel feedstocks. We focus our analysis on APEC economies because of their rapidly growing interest in biofuel development and the diversified agricultural production among member countries. Comparing average annual growth in crop yields across APEC economies and across crops, we find that the crop yield growth rates vary significantly. Corn ranks among the crops with the largest yield improvement in a significant number of the APEC economies, mostly due to increased fertilizer use and biotechnology. The analysis also reveals that sugarcane yields have been fairly stable with the exception of significant growth in China, Philippines and Thailand. One of the highest soybean yields is seen in the United States, which is a major producer. Soybean yields in China and Indonesia are lower relative to the United States, but show much lower variability over time. In the past decade, palm oil yields have increased dramatically in Indonesia. Further analysis reveals that an economy, like the United States, which already has high yield levels for the majority of crops, experiences relatively lower yield growth rates relative to other economies. On the other hand, economies like Philippines and Malaysia have relatively lower corn yields but high yield growth rates, which indicate a higher potential for increasing crop production through yield increases rather than land expansion. Yield growth rates for most crops in most APEC economies fall in the lower to medium range although there is significant variance in yields among the economies. This variation could be due to the fact that some economies have adopted mechanization and new technologies in their crop production, whereas other economies rely heavily on labor and basic inputs. Hence, economies with high technical advantage have the potential to improve crop yields by continuous development in biotechnology. In contrast, economies with less technological resources may enhance crop yields through increasing input utilization including more capital intensive inputs. We also compute yield elasticities with respect to a time trend variable for the major crops in APEC economies. For most but not all APEC economies, the coefficient estimates are statistically significant. There is wide variation in the magnitude of the elasticities among economies and crops, some even with a negative elasticity. When comparing among crops, we see that corn yields show relatively higher elasticities with respect to time trend. Across APEC economies, China shows consistent yield response over time for all crops. Across crops, sorghum has the highest elasticity in China, corn in the Philippines, sugar beet in Canada, wheat in New Zealand, rice in Indonesia, and sugarcane in Malaysia. In addition to the increased production in primary crops, yield growth would also translate to an increase in available crop residues. According to Milbrandt and Overend (2008), ethanol from currently available crop residues could potentially displace about 33% of gasoline consumption in the APEC region, assuming that cost-competitive technologies for production of ethanol from second-generation lignocellulosic feedstocks can be deployed. Thus, given average yield growth projections for certain crops in APEC economies, our calculations show that the United States could potentially displace an additional 2% of gasoline from corn residue, Australia an additional 9% of gasoline from wheat residue, and Thailand an additional 3.5% from sugarcane residue, without increasing land for biofuel production.The analysis concludes that in terms of first-generation biofuels, yield growth is imperative for the long-term potential of biofuel expansion if land extensification is to be minimized. Biofuel expansion may imply increased land use for feedstock production in the medium term, but growth in feedstock yields will tend to mitigate the impact on crop prices and land use over the longer term. Additionally, long-term expansion of biofuels may have to rely on the economic viability of production from lignocellulosic feedstocks. Based on the data analysis, APEC economies have the capability and the capacity to increase feedstock yields for biofuel production, particularly the economies that have relatively lower yield levels and are further away from their yield plateau levels. However, this requires targeting yield-enhancing activities including investments in agricultural R&D, better farm practices, and increased input use. Some of the practices that already have resulted in yield improvements in some countries, such as extension services and fertilizer subsidies, could be transferred to other economies. Countries could also provide incentives, such as tax reductions or government payments, which have proven to be successful in inducing farmers to invest in yield-improving technologies. However, it is crucial that each economy should identify its own advantage in terms of productivity improvements for its agricultural commodities. To achieve yield growth, countries should create an environment conducive to technological change and diffusion of new technology through public R&D and incentives for private R&D investments.

However, microbial activities vary greatly in time and space as well as with land management. The goal of this study was to address the seasonal role of microbial activity in soil C and N storage and cycling in harvested prairie and corn ecosystems. We measured extracellular enzyme activity, microbial biomass, extractable soil C and N, and total soil C and N at monthly intervals across two growing seasons in fertilized and unfertilized planted tallgrass prairie and compared them with a continuous Zea mays (corn) row-crop agroecosystem. Prairie systems supported greater microbial biomass and enzyme activity compared with corn systems; fertilized prairie systems had greater microbial activity than unfertilized prairies. The magnitude, and in some cases direction, of differences in response variables among the three managed systems changed seasonally. Overall, microbial biomass and enzyme activity were stimulated by increased C inputs (roots) in prairies and were further enhanced with N additions in fertilized prairies. Furthermore, seasonal fluctuation in microbial activity underscores the importance of considering when soils are sampled to estimate and predict patterns in microbially driven C and N cycling at the ecosystem level.";"Bach, Elizabeth M.

A three-phase sampling strategy was used (i) to tie ground plot AGB to airborne profiling lidar metrics and (ii) to link the airborne estimates of AGB to ICESat-GLAS lidar measurements such that (iii) GLAS could be used as a regional sampling tool. We estimated the AGB of the North American boreal forest at 21.8 Pg, with relative error of 1.9% based on 256 GLAS orbits (229â086 pulses). The distribution of AGB was 46.6% for western Canada, 43.7% for eastern Canada, and 9.7% for Alaska. With a single exception, relative errors were under 4% for the three regions and for the major cover types and under 10% at the ecoregion level. The uncertainties of the estimates were calculated using a variance estimator that accounted for only sampling error, i.e., the variability among GLAS orbital estimates, and airborne to spaceborne regression error, i.e., the uncertainty of the model coefficients. Work is ongoing to develop robust statistical techniques for integrating other sources of error such as ground to air regression error and allometric error. Small ecoregions with limited eastâwest extents tended to have fewer GLAS orbits and a greater percent sampling error. AGB densities derived from GLAS agreed closely with the estimates derived from both forest inventories (<17%) and a MODIS-based interpolation technique (<26%) for more southern, well-inventoried ecoregions, whereas differences were much greater for unmanaged northern and (or) mountainous ecoregions.";"Margolis, Hank A.

Environmental protection efforts should therefore be implemented at the relevant catchment-scale in order to support river biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Therefore, freshwater management can greatly benefit from tools that enable spatially-explicit predictions of water quality across heterogeneous landscapes. To this end, we investigated the relationships between the biological quality of running waters (expressed by the Italian Extended Biotic Index, EBI) and surrounding topographic and land cover matrices in central Italy. To do so, we adopted a spatial approach based on generalized linear models (GLM) that allowed us to identify the catchment features influencing the EBI values, and to produce a map of expected water quality in the region. A gap-analysis was then performed to assess the overlap between the existing regional protected areas and the modelled water quality map. Our findings provide suitable support for the identification of certain land uses in order to preserve riverine biodiversity and hopefully restore lotic ecosystems in Mediterranean catchments.";"Manfrin, Alessandro

Kuntze) is a globally important crop and is unusual because it both requires and acidifies the soil in which it grows. In spite of the low pH, high nitrate () accumulates in tea soils, resulting in a great potential for diffuse pollution. Nitrification in tea soils remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate net and gross nitrification in three tea soils with varying productivity, their adjacent forest and vegetable soils. The results showed that neither net nor gross nitrification rates were significantly related to soil pH. The net nitrification rate increased with increasing tea production, and when soils were incubated with ammonium sulfate. The ammonium () added to the vegetable soil was immediately and completely nitrified, but that in the tea and forest soils was nitrified more slowly. About 60–80% of the in the tea and forest soils was nitrified during 35 d of incubation, indicating nitrifiers do exist in these soils. Significantly higher gross nitrification rates were observed in vegetable and tea soils with high and medium production than in forest and tea soils with low production. Microbial consumption (immobilization and nitrate respiration) accounted for 30 to 70% of the mineralized nitrate nitrogen (−N) with the lowest in the forest soil, and no significant difference between the tea and vegetable soils. Nitrogen fertilizer stimulated soil nitrification. In conclusion, the types of land use and their management are more important than soil pH for soil nitrification. High nitrogen application rate is the main cause of accumulation in tea soils and should be reduced to minimize pollution of water resources.";"Han, Wen-Yan

Soil erosion is one of the main environmental problems for European Mediterranean agro-forestry systems, making soil erosion prevention a key ecosystem service to monitor and assess. Here, we present a spatially and temporally explicit assessment of the provision of soil erosion prevention by vegetation in Mediterranean Europe between 2001 and 2013, including maps of vulnerable areas. We follow a recently described conceptual framework for the mapping and assessment of regulating ecosystem services to calculate eight process-based indicators, and an ecosystem service provision profile. Results show a relative increase in the effectiveness of provision of soil erosion prevention in Mediterranean Europe between 2001 and 2013. This increase is particularly noticeable between 2009 and 2013, but it does not represent a general trend across the whole Mediterranean region. Two regional examples describe contrasting trends and illustrate the need for regional assessments and policy targets. Our results demonstrate the strength of having a coherent and complementary set of indicators for regulating services to inform policy and land management decisions.";"Guerra, Carlos A.

The role of determinants such as agricultural development, population growth, and urban sprawl is recognised as important but still ambiguous and thus needs further studies. Based on these findings, policy responses aimed at mitigating LD and thus reducing desertification risk are discussed and methodological proposal are presented.";"Luca Salvati

Nevertheless, 10-year monitoring data indicate mixed success in meeting the ecological goals of the plan. We used the ecosystem management decision-support model to evaluate terrestrial and aquatic habitats across the landscape on the basis of ecological objectives of the Northwest Forest Plan, which included maintenance of late-successional and old-growth forest, recovery, and maintenance of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and viability of Northern Spotted Owls. Areas of the landscape that contained habitat characteristics that supported these objectives were considered of high conservation value. We used the model to evaluate ecological condition of each of the 36, 180 township and range sections of the study area. Eighteen percent of the study area was identified as habitat of high conservation value. These areas were mostly on public lands. Many of the sections that contained habitat of exceptional conservation value were on Bureau of Land Management land that has been considered for management-plan revisions to increase timber harvests.

"AGRIS:US201500208601";"Evolution of ecosystem services in the Chinese Loess Plateau under climatic and land use changes";"";"Due to the lengthy historic land use by humans and the climate change characterized by warming and drying, the Loess Plateau has been plagued by ecosystem degradation for a long time. A series of ecological conservation projects launched since the 1970s altered the land use pattern greatly, and exerted a profound influence on the ecosystem services. Based on the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) and Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA) models, we assessed the historical fluctuation of sediment control, water yield, and net primary production (NPP) in the Loess Plateau. The results showed that sediment retention was greatly consolidated indicated by the sharp decrease of sediment export. Water yield decreased at first and increased later. Both sediment export and water yield showed an increasing ‘spatial homogenization’ tendency during the period. NPP was steady between 1990 and 2000, and then increased greatly after 2000. Ecosystem services are interlinked closely and complexly. Correlation analyses indicated a positive relationship between the difference in sediment export and water yield (r²=0.776⁎⁎) from 1975 to 2008, with negative correlations between the difference of NPP and water yield (r²=−0.422⁎⁎)/sediment export (r²=−0.240⁎) from 1990 to 2008. This, to some extent, implies that there are tradeoffs between the services of water yield and sediment control/NPP, and there is synergy between sediment control and NPP. Climatic and land use changes are the major drivers on ecosystem services fluctuation. Correlation analyses showed that the decrease of precipitation significantly hindered water yield (r²=0.980⁎⁎) and sediment export (r²=0.791⁎⁎). The increase of temperature exerted a slight negative influence on water yield (r²=−0.350⁎⁎). A spatial concordance existing between the ‘cropland to grass/woodland’ area and the high sediment control (r²=0.313⁎⁎)/NPP (r²=0.488⁎⁎) area indicated that the land use change from cropland to woodland/grassland significantly consolidated sediment control and NPP production. The observed spatio-temporal variation of ecosystem services and their correlations provide an operable criterion for land use management policies.";"Su, Changhong

Policies that encourage the use of more efficiency irrigation technology are often viewed as effective, politically feasible methods to reduce the consumptive use of water for agricultural production. Despite their widespread use, these policies have not been subject to empirical evaluation. In this article, we evaluate the effect on groundwater extraction of a widespread conversion from traditional center pivot irrigation systems to higher efficiency dropped-nozzle center pivot systems that has occurred in western Kansas. State and national cost-share programs subsidized the conversion. We find that the programs have not had the intended effect; the shift to more efficient irrigation technology has not decreased the amount of water applied to a given crop, and has actually increased groundwater extraction through changing cropping patterns.

The growing demographic decline in rural areas and, particularly, in inner areas of Galicia has led to a decrease in the economic interest of forest resources. The complexity of the different management modes or levels of organization of forest communities cannot be explained through a homogeneous interpretation. The objective of this paper is to determine the types, distribution and sources of conflicts, and to describe the role of conflicts as catalysts or barriers for common land management. For that purpose, local, provincial and regional newspaper reports about forest communities were compiled from libraries and the conflicts reported in the media were defined and classified. Spatial analyses, descriptive statistics and statistical classification methods were used to find correlations between the different social, economic or environmental variables involved. Our results reveal a very uneven spatial distribution of conflicts over common land and a stronger impact of social and environmental factors over economic factors. In addition, this paper discusses the interpretation of the higher or lower degree of conflict as a positive or negative contribution to the management of privately owned common land and explains how factors such as the demographic situation in the area, the relationship with the Forest Administration and the incorporation of new actors in the region account for the current situation and the changes in management models.

Los Montes Vecinales en Mano Común (MVMC), son una forma específica de tenencia de la tierra comunal con una categoría jurídica singular en Galicia. El declive demográfico cada vez mayor en las zonas rurales particularmente en las zonas interiores de Galicia ha ocasionado una disminución en el interés económico de los recursos forestales. Los diferentes métodos de gestión y niveles de organización de las comunidades muestran una realidad compleja que no puede ser explicada a través de una interpretación única. El objetivo de este trabajo es determinar los tipos, la distribución y las fuentes de origen de los conflictos, para describir su papel como catalizadores o barreras para la gestión. Para ello, fueron recopilados informes de los periódicos locales, provinciales y regionales acerca de las comunidades forestales, y las noticias de conflictos se definieron y clasificaron de acuerdo a un análisis espacial, estadística descriptiva y métodos de clasificación numéricos, encontrándose correlaciones entre las variables sociales, económicas o ambientales. Nuestros resultados muestran una distribución espacial muy desigual y un mayor impacto de los factores sociales y medioambientales sobre los factores económicos en los conflictos en la tierra comunal. Además, se discute la interpretación del mayor o menor grado de conflictividad como contribución positiva o negativa a la gestión de tierras comunales de propiedad privada y explican factores tales como la situación demográfica en la zona, la relación con la Administración Forestal y la incorporación de nuevos actores representan la situación actual y los cambios en los modelos de gestión.";"Marey Pérez, M.F., Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Lugo (España).

The benefits are estimated using choice modelling and the costs are based on project expenditure and forgone agriculturalproduction. A comparison of the benefits and costs yields a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of4.45, which implies that the benefits outweigh the costs. However, variation in theunderlying assumptions reveal significant sensitivity to the uncertainty associated with the maturation of native tree plantings and the successful establishment of a significant population of birds within the native vegetation. The Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is dominated by the benefit derived from protection of the native species (i.e. the Regent Honeyeater) which in turn depends on these two uncertainties. By expanding the total area of land being revegetated and reducing the fragmentation amongst individualplantings these uncertainties can be reduced.

"AGRIS:US2016213504";"NEW TENSION ON THE HORIZON BETWEEN THE FOOD AND BIOFUEL INDUSTRIES?";"Újabb feszültség a láthatáron az élelmiszer- és bioüzemanyag-ipar között?";"Az élelmiszerárak növekedése 2006–2008 között a világ egyes térségeiben zavargásokhoz és a politikai stabilitás megrendüléséhez vezetett. Különösen fejlődő országokban súlyos a helyzet, ahol a legszegényebb rétegek jövedelmük döntő hányadát élelmiszerekre költik. Az agrárpiacokon a kereslet vált meghatározóvá, mennyiségi (humáncélú és ipari felhasználás rohamos növekedése) és minőségi értelemben (élelmiszer-fogyasztás szerkezetének változása). Árkilengések persze korábban is előfordultak, de a 2007/2008-as gazdasági évben tapasztalt ársokkot számos tényező együttesen idézte elő, első helyen a világ gabona- és olajosmag-készleteinek megcsappanása. Az élelmezésbiztonságban fontos a fizikai kínálat, mert az emberek rettegnek attól, hogy nem jutnak élelemhez, még akkor sem, ha van elegendő pénzük az élelmiszerek vásárlásához, vagyis az élelmiszerhez való hozzájutás kockázatáról van szó. A várható újabb élelmiszerválság elsődleges oka a kereslet növekedése és a kínálat fluktuációja lesz, mivel az élelmiszer iránti kereslet jövedelemrugalmassága cse¬kély. Az élelmiszer-kínálat változását elsősorban a vízhiány határozza meg. A spekuláció fontos szerepet tölt be a piaci likviditásban, ugyanakkor növelheti az árak volatilitását is. A növekvő olajárak miatt egyre inkább előtérbe kerül az energiabiztonság kérdése, ami a bioüzemanyag-gyártás további növeléséhez vezet. A bioüzemanyag-gyártás egyelőre elsősorban a belső piac igényeit elégíti ki. A világ két legnagyobb bioüzemanyag-piaca az USA és Brazília, a nemzetközi beruházások fő kedvezményezettjei pedig Brazília és Európa. Brazília azért vonzó befektetői célpont, mert bőséges nyersanyaggal és feldolgozói kapacitással, valamint potenciális exportpiaccal rendelkezik. Az USA és Brazília komoly nettó exportőr a bioüzemanyag-gyártásban felhasznált nyersanyagokból, ezzel szemben az EU, a világ első számú biodízel-gyártója pedig nettó importőr olajnövényekből és növényolajból. Az összes üzemanyag-fogyasztáson belül tovább nő a gázolaj már amúgy is magas, közel 65%-os aránya. Ebből következik, hogy az EU dízelolajból is egyre nagyobb importra szorul, benzinből viszont egyre nagyobb exportra kényszerül. A paradox helyzetet mutatja, hogy a nettó gabonaexportőri pozíció az etanoltermelésnek kedvezne, de az üzemanyag-fogyasztáson belül a benzin csökkenő aránya a biodízelhez képest relatíve kevesebb etanol bekeverését jelenti.Az USA-ban a gabona 30%-a, az EU-ban 3%-a és Kínában 1,5%-a szolgálta az üzem-anyagcélú etanoltermelést. Az etanolgyártásban felhasznált nádcukor és cukorrépa aránya meghaladja az éves globális termelés 10%-át. Ennek ellenére az etanolgyártás szerény mértékben befolyásolja a cukor világkereskedelmét, ugyanis Brazíliában a kombinált cukor- és etanolgyártással foglalkozó üzemek arányától és termelési döntésétől függ, hogy éppen mennyi cukrot, illetve etanolt állítanak elő. Mivel az etanol- és cukortermelésre egyaránt alkalmas feldolgozók aránya viszonylag kicsi, ezért csak néhány százalékban változhat a cukornád felhasználása etanol- és cukorgyártásra. A biodízel-gyártás hatása a globális növényolajpiacra már sokkal jelentősebb, mert 2009-ben a világszerte előállított növényolaj 11%-ából készült biodízel. Az EU-27-ben az összes növényolaj-termelés kétharmadát teszi ki a biodízel nyersanyag¬szükséglete. Észak- és Dél-Amerikában az elmúlt években többszörösére nőtt a növényolaj biodízelcélú felhasználása, ami az összes termelés már több mint 10%-át jelenti.Összességében aligha lehet szó komoly konfliktusról az élelmiszer- és energiatermelés között.A második generációs bioüzemanyagok kiterjedt piaci bevezetése még várat magára. Egyelőre még csak korlátozott mértékben használnak fel cellulózalapú nyersanyagokat a bioetanol-gyártásban, illetve állati zsírokat és használt sütőolajat a biodízel-gyártásban. A 2007/2008-as gazdasági évben kialakult feszültség az élelmiszer- és bioüzemanyag-előállítás között újra napirendre kerül(het), amikor a globális gabona- és olajosmag-készletek csökkenésével párhuzamosan újra emelkednek az árak. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Between 2006 and 2008 the apparently endless increase of food prices led to unrest and political instability in some parts of the world. The situation is especially grave in the developing countries, where the poorer groups of society spend the majority of their income on food. Agricultural markets have become demand-led markets, not only in terms of quantity (quick increase in demand for both human consumption and industrial processing) but also in terms of quality (the structure of food consumption is changing). There had of course been extreme low and high prices before, but the price shock experienced in the 2007/2008 business year was the combined result of several factors. The primary factor was a reduction in the global stocks of cereals and oilseeds.From the aspect of food security, physical supply is important. People are terrified that they cannot obtain food even if they have sufficient money to buy it, i.e. it is about the risk of access to food. The primary cause of the expected new food crisis is the increase in demand and the fluctuation of supply, as demand for food does not readily adapt to peoples’ income levels. Changes in food supply are primarily determined by trends in water insufficiency. Speculation has an important role in sustaining market liquidity, but may contribute to the volatility of prices. Increasing oil prices are putting the issue of energy security in the limelight, which further boosts biofuel production. In line with the country’s national energy policy, biofuel production so far addresses the demands in the domestic market. In recent years, however, an increase in foreign investments could also be seen. The USA and Brazil are the two largest biofuel markets in the world, while the main recipients of international investments are Brazil and Europe. The attractiveness of Brazil lies in the fact that it has plenty of raw materials and processing capacity, as well as export potential. The US and Brazil are serious net exporters of raw materials used in biofuel production. The EU – the world’s number one biodiesel producer –, on the other hand, is a net importer of oil crops and vegetable oil. The ratio of diesel oil to all fuels consumed is already high at nearly 65% and continues to increase. Consequently, the EU needs to import increasing quantities of diesel oil and is forced to increase its gasoline export. Paradoxically, the region’s position as a net exporter of cereals would be conducive to ethanol production, but the decreasing ratio of gasoline to all fuels consumed means that compared to biodiesel, less ethanol can be mixed.The corresponding figure is 30% in the US, 3% in Europe and 1.5% in China. The amount of cane sugar and sugar beet used for ethanol production exceeds 10% of the annual global production. Still, ethanol production influences the world trade of sugar only mildly, as the ratio and production decisions of combined sugar-and-ethanol plants in Brazil determine how much sugar and ethanol they produce at any given time. As the ratio of processing plants capable of producing both ethanol and sugar is relatively low, the ratio of sugar cane quantities used for ethanol production and for sugar production varies only be a few per cents. The effect of biodiesel production on the global market of vegetable oils is much more significant, as 11% of all vegetable oil produced worldwide was turned into biodiesel in 2009. In the EU-27, two thirds of all vegetable oil produced are used as raw material for biodiesel production. In North and South America, the volume of vegetable oils used for biodiesel production has multiplied over the recent years, now exceeding 10% of the total production.Extensive introduction of second generation biofuels to the market is delayed. The processing of cellulose-based raw materials in bioethanol production, as well as the processing of animal fats and used frying oil for biodiesel production, remains limited. The tension between food and biofuel production, which emerged in the 2007/2008 business year, could resurface when prices begin to rise again in parallel with the reduction in global cereal and oilseed stocks.";"Popp, Jozsef

A case study is presented that examines agroecosystem vulnerability to climate change within an Australian multifunctional rural landscape adjacent to the city of Adelaide. The dominant neoliberal governance approach is struggling to account for the levels of risk apparent in the region, even though there is considerable evidence that changes in policy and practice are required. Land use planning mechanisms can explicitly and implicitly support adaptation to risk within vital agroecosystems by defining spaces of complexity and experimentation. A review of French land use policy suggests that appropriate classifications can facilitate support for local diversity and broaden the capacity of farming systems to adapt to risk. Such classifications of spaces valuable for socio-ecological resilience and innovation could become vital tools to integrate into neoliberal governance systems to support anticipatory adaptation to future socio-ecological risk.";"Bardsley, Douglas K.

We used our data to assess the effectiveness of conservation actions that involved local, state, and federal authorities and community members (e.g., local landowners and private and civil organizations) in one of the world's most iconic protected areas. From 2001 through 2012, 1254 ha were deforested (i.e., cleared areas had <10% canopy cover), 925 ha were degraded (i.e., areas for which canopy forest decreased), and 122 ha were affected by climatic conditions. Of the total 2179 ha of affected area, 2057 ha were affected by illegal logging: 1503 ha by large‐scale logging and 554 ha by small‐scale logging. Mexican authorities effectively enforced efforts to protect the monarch reserve, particularly from 2007 to 2012. Those efforts, together with the decade‐long financial support from Mexican and international philanthropists and businesses to create local alternative‐income generation and employment, resulted in the decrease of large‐scale illegal logging from 731 ha affected in 2005–2007 to none affected in 2012, although small‐scale logging is of growing concern. However, dire regional social and economic problems remain, and they must be addressed to ensure the reserve's long‐term conservation. The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) overwintering colonies in Mexico—which engage in one of the longest known insect migrations—are threatened by deforestation, and a multistakeholder, regional, sustainable‐development strategy is needed to protect the reserve.

Boreal forests are also economically important, but forest harvesting and management become increasingly difficult when one moves from south to north in boreal environments. An approach was thus developed to assess the suitability of land units for timber production in a sustainable forest management (SFM) context in the northern boreal forest of Quebec (Canada). This area includes all of Quebecâs spruce â feather moss bioclimatic domain (closed forest), as well as the southern portion of the spruceâlichen bioclimatic domain (open woodland). Four criteria specific to the biophysical aspects of SFM were evaluated in 1114 land districts: physical environment, timber production capacity, forest vulnerability to fire (e.g., probability that it reaches maturity), and conservation of biodiversity. Indicators and acceptability cutoff values were determined for each selected criterion, and a sequential analysis was developed to evaluate if a land district has the potential to be sustainably managed. This analytical process led to the classification of land districts into three categories: slightly sensitive (SFM possible); moderately sensitive (SFM possible under certain conditions); and highly sensitive (SFM not possible). The results show that 354 land districts were highly sensitive, 62 due to physical constraints (7.5% of the area), 130 due to insufficient potential productivity (15.4% of the area), 92 due to insufficient potential productivity to account for the fire risk (13.8% of the area), and 70 due to an insufficient proportion of tall and dense forest habitats (7.7% of the area â biodiversity criterion). This work provides scientific background to proposing a northern limit for forest management activities in Quebec. The developed approach could be useful in other jurisdictions to address similar issues.";"Jobidon, Robert

"AGRIS:US201400065748";"Optimism and Challenge for Science‐Based Conservation of Migratory Species in and out of U.S. National Parks";"";"Public agencies sometimes seek outside guidance when capacity to achieve their mission is limited. Through a cooperative agreement and collaborations with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), we developed recommendations for a conservation program for migratory species. Although NPS manages ∼36 million hectares of land and water in 401 units, there is no centralized program to conserve wild animals reliant on NPS units that also migrate hundreds to thousands of kilometers beyond parks. Migrations are imperiled by habitat destruction, unsustainable harvest, climate change, and other impediments. A successful program to counter these challenges requires public support, national and international outreach, and flourishing migrant populations. We recommended two initial steps. First, in the short term, launch or build on a suite of projects for high‐profile migratory species that can serve as proof to demonstrate the centrality of NPS units to conservation at different scales. Second, over the longer term, build new capacity to conserve migratory species. Capacity building will entail increasing the limited knowledge among park staff about how and where species or populations migrate, conditions that enable migration, and identifying species’ needs and resolving them both within and beyond parks. Building capacity will also require ensuring that park superintendents and staff at all levels support conservation beyond statutory borders. Until additional diverse stakeholders and a broader American public realize what can be lost and do more to protect it and engage more with land management agencies to implement actions that facilitate conservation, long distance migrations are increasingly likely to become phenomena of the past.

Differences in soil fertility parameters between 1981 and 2006 in Jingzhou County, China were investigated, with the changes of land management and agricultural practices. The results showed that, from 1981 to 2006, soil pH and organic matter decreased by 3.35% and 32.2%, while total nitrogen (TN), available N (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) increased by 0.4 g kg⁻¹, 21 mg kg⁻¹, 8 mg kg⁻1, and 32 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. The above presumably resulted from more application of inorganic fertilizers (especially acid and/or physiologically-acid fertilizers), less application of organic fertilizers, little growing of green manure, and removal of crop residues and straws. Balanced application of organic and inorganic fertilizers is urgent to improve organic matter, soil pH, and soil fertility in this area";"Liu, Jinshan

Their predominant use is extensive livestock production by pastoralists and ranchers. But rangelands are characterized by ecological, economic, and political marginality, and higher-value, more intensive land uses are impinging on rangelands around the world. Earth Stewardship of rangelands must address both livestock management and the broader socioecological dynamics that promote land-use changes, fragmentation, and degradation. We identify specific gradients on which human-rangeland systems can be arrayed, including issues of variability, adaptation to disturbance, commercialization, land use change, land tenure security and effective governance, and we illustrate the gradients' interactions and effects in sites worldwide. The result is a synthetic framework to understand how rangeland Earth Stewardship can be achieved in the face of marginality, globalization and climate change.";"Sayre, Nathan F.

Accepting this and understanding processes of landscape change are prerequisites for the maintenance and development of specific landscape- or ‘natural’ values. This paper discusses the relevance of landscape historical information and insights to the management of landscape change. The focus is on the Netherlands, especially the Pleistocene inland part of the country and on the period 1000BP - present. Two dominant (seemingly contradictory) long-term processes of landscape change can be distinguished: drowning and ‘desertification’ (severe land degradation). Both will be outlined. The first of these historical processes, ‘drowning’, is also highly relevant to one of today’s most pressing topics: how to cope with the consequences of climate change. Long-term studies of landscape formation processes and the associated landscape dynamics can provide essential contributions to the formulation of historically acceptable solutions to current challenges and problems, and to the dissociation of processes of policy making, planning and decision from current fashions. Linking the so-called ‘Landscape Development Plans’ to research guided by the concept of ‘landscape biography’ proves to be an effective strategy to achieve this. Insight into the long-term history of people and landscapes can effectively inspire and shape future developments, especially on a regional and local level.";"Groenewoudt, B.J.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"climate change;desertification;land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NLD";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500210213";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.07.015";"";"";"";"125-135"
"AGRIS:US201600090628";"Past landscape explains forest periphery‐to‐core gradient of understorey plant communities in a reforestation context";"";"AIM: To disentangle whether long‐range periphery‐to‐core gradient of forest understorey plants could be attributed to past forest landscape and/or to current environmental filtering processes. We investigated (1) whether species response to past land use (ancient versus recent forest) was consistent with species response to distance to present forest edge (core versus periphery) (2) what life‐history traits explained plant response to distance to present edge and past land use (3) whether distance to past forest edge explained current species distribution better than distance to present forest edge. LOCATION: Temperate forests in the northern half of France (80,000 km²). METHODS: Local climate, soil and stand characteristics, past land use, and present and past landscape metrics were collected on 11,936 plots using National Forest Inventory data and historical maps from 1831. Logistic regressions were applied to determine the response patterns of 181 species to present and past landscape, while controlling for local habitat quality (soil, climate and stand). RESULTS: Species response to distance to present edge very well matched response to past land use. Plant traits related to colonization capacity explained species response to present edge and past land use. The spatial distribution of 42 species was better explained by distance to forest edge in 1831, 37 species were better explained by distance to present edge and 24 species were better explained by distance to present edge and past land use. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Two mechanisms were responsible for the long‐range periphery‐to‐core gradient: (1) past landscape and colonization processes and (2) present edge‐related mechanisms. This suggests that plant community differences between periphery and core zones are thus related to dispersal limitation and not only to environmental filters. Our results underline the need to combine landscape ecology and history and have important implications for forest plant dynamics and conservation in the context of climate change.";"Bergès, Laurent

"AGRIS:US201500210211";"3D modelling of geological and anthropogenic deposits at the World Heritage Site of Bryggen in Bergen, Norway";"";"The landscape of many historic cities and the character of their shallow subsurface environments are defined by a legacy of interaction between anthropogenic and geological processes. Anthropogenic deposits and excavations result from processes ranging from archaeological activities to modern urban development. Hence, in heritage cities, any geological investigation should acknowledge the role of past and ongoing human activities, while any archaeological investigation should be conducted with geological processes in mind. In this paper it is shown that 3D geological and anthropogenic models at different scales can provide a holistic system for the management of the subsurface. It provides a framework for the integration of other spatial and process models to help assess the preservation potential for buried heritage. Such an integrated framework model is thus contributing to a decision support system for sustainable urban (re)development and regeneration in cities, while preserving cultural heritage. A collaborative approach is proposed to enhance research and implementation of combined geological and archaeological modelling for sustainable land use planning and heritage preservation, using York and Bryggen as prime examples. This paper presents the status of 3D framework modelling at Bryggen in Norway as an example.";"de Beer, Johannes

Ensuring that our responses are effective requires us to first consider what we aim to achieve: why do we care about agricultural emissions? This paper responds to this fundamental inquiry, and argues that New Zealanders‟ diverse individual motivations can be grouped under three headings: one, concern about the direct impacts of climate change on New Zealand and the world; two, pressure from others based on their concern about climate change; three, complementary goals. This framework is useful in setting out how our underlying motivations should shape our responses, and highlights the importance of choosing responses that will be robust to future uncertainties.";"McDonald, Hugh J.

The supply of regulating ecosystem services in, for instance, parks can differ as parks vary in their land cover composition. A comprehensive ecosystem service assessment approach also needs to reflect land use to consider the demands placed on ecosystem services, which are mostly neglected by current research yet important for urban planning. For instance, if a sealed surface is no longer used, it could be unsealed to improve ecosystem service supply. Because of these scientific shortcomings, this article argues for a conceptual framework for the non-monetary assessment of urban ecosystem services at the site scale. This paper introduces a standardized method for selecting representative sites and evaluating their supply of and demand on ecosystem services.

"AGRIS:US201400191398";"Satellite multispectral data for improved floodplain roughness modelling";"";"Riparian vegetation plays a crucial role on affecting the floodplain hydraulic roughness, which in turn significantly influences the dynamics of flood waves. This paper explores the potential accuracies of retrieving vegetation hydrodynamic parameters through satellite multispectral data. The method is focused on estimation of vegetation height (hg) and flexural rigidity (MEI) for herbaceous patterns and of plant density (M), tree height (h), stem diameter (Ds), crown base height (cbh) and crown diameter (Dc) of high-forest (hf) and coppice (cop) consociations for arboreal and shrub patterns. The method is organized in four sequential steps: (1) classification procedure of riparian corridor; (2) land cover-based Principal Component Analysis of spectral channels; (3) explorative analysis of correlation structure between principal components and biomechanical properties and (4) model identification/estimation/validation for floodplain roughness parameterization. To capture the hydrodynamic impacts of stiff/flexible vegetation, a GIS hydrodynamic model has been coupled with a flow resistance external routine that estimates the hydraulic roughness by using simulated water stages and the remote sensing-derived hydrodynamic parameters. The procedure is tested along a 3-km reach of the Avisio river (Trentino Alto Adige, Italy) by comparing extended field surveys and a synchronous SPOT-5 multispectral image acquired on 28/08/2004. Results showed significant correlation values between spectral-derived information and hydrodynamic parameters. Predictive models provided high coefficients of determination, especially for mixed arboreal and shrub land covers. The generated structural parameter maps represent spatially explicit data layers that can be used as inputs to hydrodynamic models to analyze flow resistance effects in different submergence conditions of vegetation. The hydraulic modelling results showed that the new method is able to provide accurate hydraulic output data and to enhance the roughness estimation up to 73% with respect to a traditional look-up table approach, with higher improvements for low flow conditions and over shrub covers.";"Forzieri, Giovanni

Ninety-nine tree species were identified that they utilize, plant, or protect on their land, the majority of which are native to Panama. The farmers had diverse reasons for maintaining trees, including improving the environment, providing food and shade for cattle, and generating a source of wood for construction, furniture, and firewood. Most of the trees mentioned in the study provide multiple uses and values and the majority of farmers wanted to plant additional trees. Some differences in species preferences and motivations for planting and protecting trees were seen between sites, thereby suggesting that land restoration and tree planting projects should be site specific. Our data indicate that there are ample opportunities to increase native tree cover in our study sites and highlight the need to incorporate farmer input into project design, implementation, and evaluation as a necessary and continuous feature throughout projects.";"Garen, Eva J.

"AGRIS:US201400175905";"Recovery of saturated hydraulic conductivity under secondary succession on former pasture in the humid tropics";"";"Landscapes in the humid tropics are undergoing a continuous change in land use. Deforestation is still taking its toll on forested areas, but at the same time more and more secondary forests emerge where formerly agricultural lands and pastures are being abandoned. Regarding soil hydrology, the extent to which secondary succession can recover soil hydrological properties disturbed by antecedent deforestation and pasture use is yet poorly understood. We investigated the effect of secondary succession on saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) at two soil depths (0–6 and 6–12cm) using a space-for-time approach in a landscape mosaic in central Panama. The following four land-use classes were studied: pasture (P), secondary forest of 5–8 years of age (SF5), secondary forest of 12–15 years of age (SF12) and secondary forest of more than 100 years of age (SF100), each replicated altogether four times in different micro-catchments across the study region. The hydrological implications of differences in Ks in response to land-use change with land use, especially regarding overland flow generation, were assessed via comparisons with rainfall intensities. Recovery of Ks could be detected in the 0–6cm depth after 12 years of secondary succession: P and SF5 held similar Ks values, but differed significantly (α=0.05) from SF12 and SF100 which in turn were indistinguishable. Variability within the land cover classes was large but, due to sufficient replication in the study, Ks recovery could be detected nonetheless. Ks in the 6–12cm depth did not show any differences between the land cover classes; only Ks of the uppermost soil layer was affected by land-use changes. Overland flow – as inferred from comparisons of Ks with rainfall intensities – is more likely on P and SF5 sites compared to SF12 and SF100 for the upper sample depth; however, generally low values at the 6–12cm depth are likely to impede vertical percolation during high rainfall intensities regardless of land use. We conclude that Ks can recover from pasture use under secondary succession up to pre-pasture levels, but the process may take more than 8 years. In order to gain comprehensive understanding of Ks change with land use and its hydrological implications, more studies with detailed land-use histories and combined measurements of Ks, overland flow, precipitation and throughfall are essential.";"Hassler, Sibylle K.

"AGRIS:US201400175904";"Restoration of dry tropical forests in Central America: A review of pattern and process";"";"Much information on restoration and management exists for wet tropical forests of Central America but comparatively little work has been done in the dry forests of this region. Such information is critical for reforestation efforts that are now occurring throughout Central America. This paper describes processes of degradation due to land use and provides a conceptual framework for the restoration of dry tropical forest. Most of this forest type was initially harvested for timber and then cleared for cattle in the last century (1930–1970). Only 1.7% remains largely restricted to infertile soils and remote areas on the Pacific coastal side of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Mexico. These cleared areas are again in a state of transition due to a combination of decreasing land productivity, and land speculation for tourism development. Some farms have been sold to new landowners who are interested in reforesting to increase biodiversity and forest cover. Attempts have therefore been made to reforest by protecting the land from fire and cattle, by supplementing natural regrowth with enrichment planting, or through use of tree plantations. Experimental studies have demonstrated the ability of these lands to grow back to forests because of native species ability to sprout after cutting, and the capacity of remnant trees in field and riparian zones to provide seeds and to moderate edge environment for seed germination and seedling establishment. However, research also shows that on sites with long histories of land clearance, species diversity will remain low with functional groups missing unless some active management occurs. Under-planting with late-successional native tree species can add structure and diversity; enrichment planting with large-fruited shade-intolerant species can initiate new islands of more diverse regeneration beneath their canopies; and plantings of fast-growing, nitrogen-fixing trees that provide light canopy shade can moderate the environment below, promoting regeneration establishment of late-successional species. Plantations are the only option for lands that have lost almost all remnants of native forest, and where soils and vegetation have changed to new states of structure and function. Conversion of pastures to tree plantations that can facilitate natural regeneration beneath them is appropriate when pastures are prone to fire and/or lack immediate seed sources nearby. After the grasses have been shaded out, natural recruitment can slowly occur over a 10–15 years period. Under-planting of shade-tolerant late-successional species can supplement species composition and structure.";"Griscom, Heather P.

"AGRIS:US201600190480";"Projecting alternative urban growth patterns: The development and application of a remote sensing assisted calibration framework for the Greater Dublin Area";"";"Land use change models are powerful tools that allow planners and policy makers to assess the long-term spatial and environmental impacts of their decisions. In order for these models to produce a realistic output, they should be properly calibrated. This is usually achieved by comparing simulated land-use maps of dates in the past to reference land-use maps of a corresponding date. As land-use data are often not readily or frequently available, we propose a two-stage calibration framework that includes existing land-use maps as well as remote sensing derived maps of the urban extent. Urban growth patterns for the Dublin area represented by remote sensing based maps were compared to simulated growth using spatial metrics in order to fine-tune the calibration of the MOLAND urban growth model of Dublin. We then used the calibrated model to forecast future urban growth according to four urban planning scenarios that have been defined for the Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Greater Dublin Area. We examined a selection of spatial metrics in order to determine their sensitivity to differences in spatial patterns between simulated and remote sensing derived data. We also investigated whether these metrics are useful to characterise future changes in the urban spatial structure that ensue from the planning scenarios. We found that with the exception of some metrics that strongly respond to differences in the amount of urban land, most metrics showed similar trends for simulated and remote sensing derived maps. Most metrics were also able to distinguish the growth patterns induced by the different spatial planning scenarios. The âbusiness as usual scenarioâ in particular showed a clearly distinct trend compared to the other scenarios. We could also conclude that the urban growth pattern of Dublin as observed from both the remote sensing derived maps and the simulated maps of future land use seems to confirm the theory of alternating phases of diffusive growth and coalescence.";"Van de Voorde, Tim

Most of these issues need to be addressed at several scales simultaneously, ranging from local to global. They require action at the scale of large landscapes given that the geographic scope of the issues often transcends the legal and geographic reach of existing jurisdictions and institutions. No single entity has the authority to address these types of crossâboundary issues, resulting in gaps in governance and a corresponding need to create formal and informal ways work more effectively across administrative boundaries, land ownerships, and political jurisdictions. In response to this challenge, numerous models of ânetwork governanceâ are emerging. These approaches vary in terms of purpose, spatial scale, composition, organization, and complexity.

"AGRIS:US201500163325";"Can biodiversity monitoring schemes provide indicators for ecosystem services?";"";"Recently, the science and policy agenda on biodiversity moved to include ecosystem services assessments and it is recognised that for determining the effectiveness and progress of policy frameworks monitoring is crucial. Within European monitoring schemes, data is collected following different sampling protocols for a range of biodiversity or context related aspects; from EU-wide general land cover mapping to red list species within Annex I habitats. In this paper, we analysed field instructions of seven monitoring schemes on the extent to which they can provide data on the provision of ecosystem services and what additional information may be needed for future monitoring of ecosystem services. We compared seven monitoring schemes (i.e. CORINE Land Cover, Land Use Cover Area Survey (LUCAS), European Biodiversity Observation Network (EBONE), biodiversity monitoring on organic and low-input farming systems (BioBio), National Inventory of the Landscape of Sweden (NILS) and Pan-European Common Birds Monitoring (PECBM) and UK Butterfly monitoring (UK-BM)) by scoring the quality of recorded parameters and the adequacy of sampling protocols for ecosystem service monitoring. All the examined schemes were able to provide some parameters on ecosystem services, but the quality of the parameters on average did not exceed the level of qualitative data. Additionally, the divergence between the sampling designs of the schemes and the spatial characteristics of ecosystem services reduced the potential monitoring value of all schemes. Monitoring schemes including a range of sampling methods, scales and included the recording of data on habitats, such as EBONE, BioBio and NILS, provided the best data on the provision of ecosystem services. We conclude that improvement of the monitoring of ecosystem services is hindered by several knowledge gaps: (1) a robust definition and conceptual framework of ecosystem services; (2) the linkage between biodiversity and ecosystem services; and (3) the interpretation of monitoring data. In addition to ecosystem service monitoring, biodiversity monitoring unremittingly remains very important, at least to identify trade-offs between the management for services and the resulting biodiversity status.";"Geijzendorffer, Ilse R.

"AGRIS:US201500163324";"national approach for mapping and quantifying habitat-based biodiversity metrics across multiple spatial scales";"";"Ecosystem services, i.e., services provided to humans from ecological systems have become a key issue of this century in resource management, conservation planning, and environmental decision analysis. Mapping and quantifying ecosystem services have become strategic national interests for integrating ecology with economics to help understand the effects of human policies and actions and their subsequent impacts on both ecosystem function and human well-being. Some aspects of biodiversity are valued by humans in varied ways, and thus are important to include in any assessment that seeks to identify and quantify the benefits of ecosystems to humans. Some biodiversity metrics clearly reflect ecosystem services (e.g., abundance and diversity of harvestable species), whereas others may reflect indirect and difficult to quantify relationships to services (e.g., relevance of species diversity to ecosystem resilience, cultural value of native species). Wildlife habitat has been modeled at broad spatial scales and can be used to map a number of biodiversity metrics. In the present study, we present an approach that (1) identifies mappable biodiversity metrics that are related to ecosystem services or other stakeholder concerns, (2) maps these metrics throughout a large multi-state region, and (3) compares the metric values obtained for selected watersheds within the regional context. The broader focus is to design a flexible approach for mapping metrics to produce a national-scale product. We map 20 biodiversity metrics reflecting ecosystem services or other aspects of biodiversity for all vertebrate species except fish. Metrics include species richness for all vertebrates, specific taxon groups, harvestable species (i.e., upland game, waterfowl, furbearers, small game, and big game), threatened and endangered species, and state-designated species of greatest conservation need, and also a metric for ecosystem (i.e., land cover) diversity. The project is being conducted at multiple scales in a phased approach, starting with place-based studies, then multi-state regional areas, culminating into a national-level atlas. As an example of this incremental approach, we provide results for the southwestern United States (i.e., states of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado) and portions of two watersheds within this region: the San Pedro River (Arizona) and Rio Grande River (New Mexico). Geographic patterns differed considerably among metrics across the southwestern study area, but metric values for the two watershed study areas were generally greater than those for the southwestern region as a whole.";"Boykin, Kenneth G.

Two particular features were studied in the sample sites: forest connectivity for wildlife and areas burnt by wildfires. 191 Squares, each 4km×4km, were selected from the SISPARES (the monitoring framework designed to evaluate the trends in the structure of Spanish rural landscapes) environmental strata. Aerial photographs from 1956, 1984, 1998 and 2008 were interpreted and 11 land cover categories mapped and checked in the field, using a minimum mapping area of one hectare. The Equivalent Connected Area Index was used to assess forest connectivity over the sampling period. Social and economical factors were assessed using indicators of farm intensiveness. The Spanish forest connectivity has improved in the last five decades although two different trends can be identified: the first 40 years are characterized by positive rates of growth whereas the 10 last years are characterized by their stability. Nevertheless the area of burnt land was higher along the first 25 studied years and decreased significantly over the last decade. Our results show the climate is the main driver in the evolution of forest connectivity and burnt area in the forest landscapes, playing a direct role on forest biomass production and wildfire ignition and propagation, as well as an indirect role by keeping vertical and horizontal forest continuity through the landscape spatial pattern. Social and economic factors are very important drivers as well: Rural population density and farm size average have been tested as good indicators of landscape artificiality, highly correlated to wildfire hazard and forest connectivity. Finally, we have pointed out the evolutionary path followed by SISPARES framework as a tool for monitoring rural landscapes. It emphasises on the requirement of a 30 years time window for building-up reliable dynamic multifunctional model.";"Martín-Martín, Carmen

Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using a chronological series of remote sensing data. Impacts of landscape change on local livelihoods were investigated in seven villages through interviews with various stakeholders. The study reveals that the complex mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However, over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways can be maintained.";"Castella, Jean-Christophe

"AGRIS:US201600190835";"indicator framework for assessing progress in land and marine planning in Colombia and Cuba";"";"Achievement of environmental management goals and objectives in coastal areas, including how to measure success, remains a significant subject for discussion among scholars and practitioners, meanwhile four distinct management efforts potentially converge within the coastal zone: land-use planning (LUP), river basin management (RBM), marine spatial planning (MSP) and integrated coastal management (ICM). This paper examines the general lack of attention being paid to overlapping spatial boundaries within the landward and marine areas and proposes an indicator-based framework to measure the effectiveness of the individual planning instruments, as opposed to specific initiatives, in achieving management goals. The six indicators used in the framework (planning; participation; communication; integration; responsibility and balance) are based on a modified version of the Coastal Sustainability Standard methodology described by Gallagher (2010). The framework provides for four scenarios of progress in three geographical dimensions (river, municipality and marine area) to be assessed. For this study, the Caribbean coast of Colombia and Cuba were identified as the areas to test the feasibility and relevance of the indicator framework to monitor progress in the different management approaches established to achieve coastal sustainability. Several key observations and lessons from the indicator-based framework are discussed in order to analyze the overlapping of the four space-based instruments, identify areas for targeted intervention and improve their integration.";"Botero, C.M.

Farm financial trends for the 1994-2003 period are also presented.Financial performance in 2003 was the highest of the 1994-2003 period because of a good wheat and barley crop, strong crop prices, and improved livestock profit. Median net farm income was $49,181 in 2003, $38,079 in 2002, and $27,729 in 2001.Financial performance for the 1994-2003 period was poorest in 1997 and 1998 when over one-half of farms could not make scheduled term debt payments with the year's income. A strong improvement occurred in 2000 and 1999 because of extraordinary government and crop insurance payments, record yields for some crops, and improved beef cattle prices. All 16 financial performance measures declined in 2001, except interest expense ratio, because of lower government subsidies, higher costs, and continued low commodity prices.

"AGRIS:US201500093009";"Historical distribution and host-vector diversity of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, in Ukraine";"";"BACKGROUND: Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is a zoonotic agent that remains across much of the northern hemisphere, where it exists in enzootic cycles. In Ukraine, tularemia has a long history that suggests a need for sustained surveillance in natural foci. To better characterize the host-vector diversity and spatial distribution of tularemia, we analyzed historical data from field collections carried out from 1941 to 2008. FINDINGS: We analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of bacterial isolates collected from field samples. Isolates were characterized by source and dominant land cover type. To identify environmental persistence and spatial variation in the source of isolation, we used the space-time permutation and multinomial models in SaTScan. A total of 3,086 positive isolates were taken from 1,084 geographic locations. Isolation of F. tularensis was more frequent among arthropods [n = 2,045 (66.3%)] followed by mammals [n = 619 (20.1%)], water [n = 393 (12.7%)], and farm produce [n = 29 (0.94%)], respectively. Four areas of persistent bacterial isolation were identified. Water and farm produce as sources of bacterial isolation were clustered. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the presence of long-standing natural foci of F. tularensis in Ukraine. Given the history of tularemia as well as its environmental persistence there exists a possibility of (re)emergence in human populations. Heterogeneity in the distribution of tularemia isolate recovery related to land cover type supports the theory of natural nidality and clusters identify areas to target potential sources of the pathogen and improve surveillance.";"Hightower, Jake

This paper examines the case of the 2,000-year old Ifugao SES in the northern Philippines and the contemporary challenges they now face. Five observations can be drawn. First, the Ifugao case does not fit some of the conventional theoretical explanations for the collapse or survival of SES. Second, the Ifugao’s primogeniture system of property rights along with the their customary laws and practices have played important roles in maintaining the robustness of their SES through their effects on ecological integrity. Third, the Ifugao SES today is faced with contemporary challenges with varying effects on its robustness: integration into a post-colonial social order, the effects of tourism and agricultural development, migration, urbanization and the introduction of Christianity and mass education. Fourth, despite these changes, it is not a certainty that the Ifugao will shift to a new domain of attraction that cannot support a human population, or that will induce a transition that causes long-term human suffering. Finally, the Ifugao case study adds to our understanding of robust SES.";"Araral, Eduardo";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"urbanization;property rights";"Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"PHL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400182099";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-013-9617-5";"";"";"";"859-870"

Increasing consumer demand for organic products has created a need for certified organic research sites. Our objective is to discuss the lessons learned from evaluating alternate cropping systems to establish a certified site in western Iowa. Oat (Avena sativa L.), 'Kelson' snail medic [Medicago scutelata (L.) Mill.] or 'Polygraze' burr medic (Medicago polymorpha L.), triticale (xTriticosecale spp.), sweet corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], rye (Secale cereale L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) or red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) were evaluated in five crop sequences as transition strategies for converting no-till corn and soybean land for certified organic production. Five models for managing organic research sites were developed and are discussed to help researchers and producers become aware of the different roles, goals, and management challenges faced when developing a certified organic research site. A ""shared management model"" (Type 3) best described our project involving a transitioning grower and researchers. Maintaining annual profit throughout the transition period was our most important factor, so potential returns to land, labor, and management were calculated to compare the various transition strategies. Only two of the cropping systems incurred a positive return to management. They used either a high-value crop such as sweet corn (provided it was marketable) or low-cost crops (i.e., oat and alfalfa). We conclude that learning from our experiences will enable others to develop certified organic research sites and become involved with on-farm research studies with much less stress than that encountered by our farmer cooperator, technical staff, land owner, and research team.";"Karlen,D.L.

It surveys three Anishinaabe/Ojibwe communities’ recent use of geographical techniques to communicate their own territorial claims and counter the competing claims of others. In a 21ˢᵗ century context characterized by urgent extractive-industrial threats to indigenous landbases and lifeways, the cases presented here demonstrate that counter-mapping can serve as a powerful positive tool. Yet because the prevailing methods available to safeguard land-based self-determination also have the potential to undermine it, I conclude by considering some of the pitfalls that complicate counter-mapping’s ability to promote the sovereignty process. I suggest that indigenous people who choose to enact their sovereignty in this manner are indeed empowered, but only within an existing—and inequitable—socio-political system.";"Willow, Anna J.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land ownership";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400182091";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-013-9593-9";"";"";"";"871-884"
"AGRIS:US201300771403";"Eco-hydrological controls on summertime convective rainfall triggers";"";"Triggers of summertime convective rainfall depend on numerous interactions and feedbacks, often compounded by spatial variability in soil moisture and its impacts on vegetation function, vegetation composition, terrain, and all the complex turbulent entrainment processes near the capping inversion. To progress even within the most restricted and idealized framework, many of the governing processes must be simplified and parameterized. In this work, a zeroth-order representation of the dynamical processes that control convective rainfall triggers - namely land surface fluxes of heat and moisture - is proposed and used to develop a semianalytical model to explore how differential sensitivities of various ecosystems to soil moisture states modify convective rainfall triggers. The model is then applied to 4 years (2001-2004) of half-hourly precipitation, soil moisture, environmental, and eddy-covariance surface heat flux data collected at a mixed hardwood forest (HW), a maturing planted loblolly pine forest (PP), and an abandoned old field (OF) experiencing the same climatic and edaphic conditions. We found that the sensitivity of PP to soil moisture deficit enhances the trigger of convective rainfall relative to HW and OF, with enhancements of about 25% and 30% for dry moisture states, and 5% and 15% for moist soil moisture states, respectively. We discuss the broader implications of these findings on potential modulations of convective rainfall triggers induced by projected large-scale changes in timberland composition within the Southeastern United States.";"JUANG, JEHN-YIH

Can species distribution model (SDM) outputs be enhanced using such indicators? What are the data requirements and optimal parameter values of potential indicators? Location: Indicator framework: unspecified. Case study: Kiskunság, Hungary. Methods: (1) We define a general framework for handling adaptation in ecological climate change impact assessments based on IPCC definitions. (2) As a part of this general framework, we propose an indicator framework consisting of two specific indicators (landscape connectivity and landscape diversity index) to estimate adaptive capacity of ecosystems to climate change. (3) Using old-field regeneration as a proxy process, we test the proposed indicators, perform sensitivity analysis to optimize them and detect limits of their applicability. Results: Landscape metrics could provide significant information on regeneration success of old-fields. A combination of large-scale connectivity and local diversity had the highest explanatory power, with connectivity being clearly superior. The tested indicator framework can be applied on the basis of commonly available land-cover data sets. Ecological factors (like dispersal distances) are more important determinants of indicator performance than technical parameters or data resolution, provided minimum data quality is given. The dispersal distance of characteristic species of the Kiskunság forest-steppe region was approximately 1 to 8 km during the last one to four decades. Conclusions: The results convincingly show that relatively simple and tractable metrics can effectively indicate the landscape-specific capacity of ecosystems to adjust to climatic changes. We argue that the use of adaptive capacity indicator frameworks consisting of simple but ecologically meaningful indicators should accompany every policy-oriented SDM study.";"Czúcz, Bálint

We also used a historical dataset to compare historical and recent habitat suitability predictions for forecasting variations in species' responses to regional climate warming. LOCATION: The Cantabrian Range (Iberian Peninsula, south‐western Europe). METHODS: During 2007–09 we sampled bumblebees in 37 localities and developed generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict species' occurrence and abundance in relation to environmental variables. We extracted independent variables at different spatial scales for each locality, based on topoclimatic (slope, temperature and rainfall patterns) and land‐cover (habitat configuration and composition) variables. We also used historical (1988–89) bumblebee data (23 localities) to both calibrate recent distribution models and determine the current environmental factors underlying the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming (0.8� °C) over two decades. RESULTS: Occurrence and abundance patterns of species were best predicted by models combining topoclimatic and land‐cover variables. Our findings revealed three groups of species, distinguished on the basis of the realized response of individual species to regional climate warming: one comprising six species with climate‐based tracking behaviour, a second with three species tracking suitable landscape composition and configuration regardless of climatic conditions, and a third comprising one species showing no apparent tracking behaviour. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Topoclimate and land cover determined the occurrence and abundance patterns of bumblebee species in mountainous landscapes, even at fine spatial extents. Both environmental variables, however, differentially influenced bumblebees, thereby providing relevant clues for determining the current environmental factors underlying species' distributions and their susceptibility to changing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore suggest that determining habitat suitability can be used as a baseline approach for understanding species‐specific responses to climate warming and for developing vulnerability assessments for conservation‐focused management planning.";"Herrera, José M.

"AGRIS:US201600185624";"Evaluating the environmental impact of payments for ecosystem services in Coatepec (Mexico) using remote sensing and on-site interviews";"";"Over the last decade, hundreds of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been initiated around the world, but evidence of their environmental benefits remains limited. In this study, two PES programmes operating in the municipality of Coatepec (Mexico) were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in protecting the region's endangered upland forests. Landsat satellite data were analysed to assess changes in forest cover before and after programme implementation using a difference-in-differences estimator. Additionally, surveys and interviews were conducted with local residents and a subset of PES programme participants to evaluate the programmesâ social and environmental impacts, particularly the effect of the programmes on landowner behaviour. The remote-sensing data show that deforestation was substantially lower on properties receiving PES payments compared to properties not enrolled in the programmes, but the programmes did not prevent the net loss of forests within Coatepec. Moreover, the on-site interviews suggest that the payments may have had little impact on deforestation rates, and that other factors contributed to the conservation of forests in PES properties. These findings suggest that risk-targeted payments, robust monitoring and enforcement programmes, and additional conservation initiatives should be included in all PES schemes to ensure environmental effectiveness.";"SCULLION, JASON

To reveal their current potential habitats, the effects of climate change and their future distribution in various areas of Iran we used maximum entropy modeling (Maxent). To produce the models, samples were collected from 218 areas of Iran resulting in discovering 271 points where the nabids were found. The accuracy and performance of distribution models were also evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and jack‐knife analysis. In the Maxent model, the climatic, elevation and land cover layers were the major bases for the current models. In modeling future distribution, the land cover layer was excluded. The distribution of N. pseudoferus was independent of the type of vegetation while the distribution of N. palifer varied according to differences in type of vegetation. Using jack‐knife analysis, the land cover and precipitation were the most effective predictors driving the two Nabis species range expansion. From 2013 to 2050 the impacts of climate change on N. pseudoferus distribution was predicted to have a negative impact but have a positive effect on N. palifer range expansion. Results could be used in preparation of predators' conservation, translocation and reintroduction programs and application in pest management strategies.";"Solhjouy‐Fard, Samaneh

This paper presents a general equilibrium analysis of the optimal allocation of land to be preserved as natural habitat for conservation and recreation. Following Anas (1988) we model the natural habitat as both a congestible public good due to recreation visits and a pure public good due to option and existence values. Following Fullerton and Kinnaman (1995) we analyze the use of tax instruments to achieve the first best outcome in a private competitive market. First we present the scenario where the public good, the environment, is provided by a government or conservation agency.  We show that a per unit lump sum tax on the environment similar to Anas (1988) combined with a recreation tax or a wage subsidy can achieve the first best allocation. Given the difficulty of charging a lump sum tax we next show that combining the wage or recreation tax with a utility maximizing conservation agency achieves the first best outcome. Next we present the scenario where the public good, the environment, is privately provided. We show that a subsidy on the private land set aside for the environment combined with a recreation or wage tax can achieve the first best outcome. Given the growing interest in ecosystem service markets and in providing ecosystem services this analysis highlights that tax instruments can be used to provide the optimal amount of land devoted to the environment.

Presently most of the waste generated is either disposed of in an open dump in developing countries or in landfills in the developed ones. Landfilling as well as open dumping requires lot of land mass and could also result in several environmental problems. Land application of urban/municipal solid waste (MSW) can be carried out as it is rich in organic matter and contains significant amount of recyclable plant nutrients. The presence of heavy metals and different toxics substances restricts its land use without processing. Vermicomposting of MSW, prior to land application may be a sustainable waste management option, as the vermicast obtained at the end of vermicomposting process is rich in plant nutrients and is devoid of pathogenic organism. Utilization of vermicast produced from urban/municipal solid waste in agriculture will facilitate in growth of countries economy by lowering the consumption of inorganic fertilizer and avoiding land degradation problem. Vermicomposting of urban/MSW can be an excellent practice, as it will be helpful in recycling valuable plant nutrients. This review deals with various aspects of vermicomposting of MSW.";"Singh, Rajeev Pratap

"AGRIS:US2016209915";"Analysis of Environmental and Economic Efficiency: Application of the Overseer model and simulated data";"";"New Zealand’s success in raising agricultural productivity has been accompanied by higher input use, leading to adverse effects on the environment. Until recently, analysis of farm performance has tended to ignore such negative externalities. The current emphasis on environmental issues has led dairy farmers to target improvements in both environmental performance and productivity. Therefore measuring the environmental performance of farms and integrating this information into farm productivity calculations should assist informed policy decisions which promote sustainable development. However this is a challenging process since conventional environmental efficiency measures are usually based on simple input and output flows but nitrogen discharge is a complex process which depends on climate variability, pasture and cow physiology and geophysical variability. Furthermore the outdoor, pastoral nature of New Zealand farming means that it is difficult to control input and output flows, particularly of nitrogen. Therefore this paper proposes a novel approach to measure environmental and economic efficiency of farms using the Overseer nutrient budget model and a spatially micro-simulated virtual population data. Empirical analysis is based on dairy farms in the Karapiro catchment, where nitrogen discharge from dairy farming is major source of nonpoint pollution.";"Ramilan, Thiagarajah

"AGRIS:US201600066083";"Evaluating the potential of concentrating solar power generation in Northwestern India";"";"To accelerate the decarburization in the Indian power sector, concentrating solar power (CSP) needs to play an important role. CSP technologies have found significant space in the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of the Indian government in which 20,000MW grid connected solar power projects have been targeted by 2022 with 50% capacity for CSP. In this study a preliminary attempt has been made to assess the potential of CSP generation in the Northwestern (NW) regions of India; which seems a high potential area as it has the highest annual solar radiation in India, favorable meteorological conditions for CSP and large amount of waste land. The potential of CSP systems in NW India is estimated on the basis of a detailed solar radiation and land resource assessment. The energy yield exercise has been carried out for the representative locations using System Advisor Model for four commercially available CSP technologies namely Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC), Central receiver system (CRS), Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) and Parabolic Dish System (PDS). The financial viability of CSP systems at different locations in NW India is also analyzed in this study. On the basis of a detailed solar radiation and land resource assessment, the maximum theoretical potential of CSP in NW India is estimated over 2000GW taking into accounts the viability of different CSP technologies and land suitability criteria. The technical potential is estimated over 1700GW at an annual direct normal incidence (DNI) over 1800kWh/m² and finally, the economic potential is estimated over 700GW at an annual DNI over 2000kWh/m² in NW India. It is expected that in near future locations with lower DNI values could also become financially feasible with the development of new technologies, advancement of materials, economy of scale, manufacturing capability along with the enhanced policy measures etc. With an annual DNI over 1600kWh/m² it is possible to exploit over 2000GW CSP in the NW India.";"Purohit, Ishan

"AGRIS:US2016209919";"Does Land Use Patterns Matter for Bt-Maize: The Case of Maize Farming System in Kenya";"";"Population pressures and the need to optimize the use of limited available land has led to increasing cropping affluence levels within the maize agro-ecologies in Kenya, and a shift from large to smallholder intensification and multiple cropping patterns. Using a geographic information system, this study relates cropping patterns, by area share, maize productivity and household incomes across maize agro-ecologies, with the purpose to establish a decision support system for optimizing land allocation and in priority setting for introduction of new technologies such as Bt maize varieties. Results show that land use patterns and maize productivity in maize farming systems differ between agroecological zones. The high potential areas experience high maize yields, with maize grown alongside major cash crops such as tea and coffee. In contrast, lowland coastal strip and lake Victoria region tend to grow drought tolerant tuber crops (such as cassava and sweet potatoes) alongside maize in appreciable land sizes. Similarly the dry areas grow drought tolerant legumes such as pigeon pea alongside maize. These low potential areas thus concentrate on meeting their subsistence food self-sufficiency needs, pointing at risk management strategies against drought and pests such as stem borer, unlike high potential areas with high value cash crops. Maize breeders should therefore consider insertion of Bt- genes in maize varieties that would achieve high production and which are also capable of safely growing side by side with crops that meet different food security conditions in different agro-ecological zones in Kenya.";"Muhammad, Lutta

Characteristics of local land cover inputs could impact the regional carbon estimates but the effect has not been fully evaluated in the past. Within the North American Carbon Program Mid-Continent Intensive (MCI) Campaign, three models were developed to estimate carbon fluxes on croplands: an inventory-based model, the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, and the General Ensemble biogeochemical Modeling System (GEMS) model. They all provided estimates of three major carbon fluxes on cropland: net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and soil organic carbon (SOC) change. Using data mining and spatial statistics, we studied the spatial distribution of the carbon fluxes uncertainties and the relationships between the uncertainties and the land cover characteristics. Results indicated that uncertainties for all three carbon fluxes were not randomly distributed, but instead formed multiple clusters within the MCI region. We investigated the impacts of three land cover characteristics on the fluxes uncertainties: cropland percentage, cropland richness and cropland diversity. The results indicated that cropland percentage significantly influenced the uncertainties of NPP and NEP, but not on the uncertainties of SOC change. Greater uncertainties of NPP and NEP were found in counties with small cropland percentage than the counties with large cropland percentage. Cropland species richness and diversity also showed negative correlations with the model uncertainties. Our study demonstrated that the land cover characteristics contributed to the uncertainties of regional carbon fluxes estimates. The approaches we used in this study can be applied to other ecosystem models to identify the areas with high uncertainties and where models can be improved to reduce overall uncertainties for regional carbon flux estimates.";"Li, Zhengpeng

We developed habitat suitability models at multiple spatial scales for a threatened freshwater turtle, Emydoidea blandingii, in Ontario as a case study. We also explored the effect of background data selection and modelling algorithm selection on habitat suitability predictions. We used sighting records, high-resolution land cover data (25m), and two SDM techniques: boosted regression trees; and maximum entropy modelling. The area under the receiver characteristic operating curve (AUC) for habitat suitability models tested on independent data ranged from 0.878 to 0.912 when using random background and from 0.727 to 0.741 with target-group background. E. blandingii habitat suitability was best predicted by air temperature, wetland area, open water area, road density, and cropland area. Habitat suitability increased with increasing air temperature and wetland area, and decreased with increasing cropland area. Low road density and open water increased habitat suitability, while high levels of either variable decreased habitat suitability. Robust habitat suitability maps for species at risk require using a multi-scale and multi-algorithm approach. If well used, SDM can offer insight on the habitat requirements of species at risk and help guide the development of management plans. Our results suggest that E. blandingii management plans should promote the protection of terrestrial habitat surrounding residential wetlands, halt the building of roads within and adjacent to currently occupied habitat, and identify movement corridors for isolated populations.";"Millar, Catherine S.

Motivating landowners to contribute to landscape-level wildfire protection requires an understanding of factors that underlie landowner behaviour regarding wildfire. We developed a conceptual framework describing landowners’ propensity to conduct fuel reduction as a function of objective and subjective factors relating to wildfire risk. We tested our conceptual framework using probit analysis of empirical data from a survey of non-industrial private forest landowners in the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) region of eastern Oregon (USA). Our empirical results confirm the conceptual framework and suggest that landowners’ perceptions of wildfire risk and propensity to conduct fuel treatments are correlated with hazardous fuel conditions on or near their parcels, whether they have housing or timber assets at risk, and their past experience with wildfire, financial capacity for conducting treatments and membership in forestry and fire protection organisations. Our results suggest that policies that increase awareness of hazardous fuel conditions on their property and potential for losses in residential and timber assets, and that enhance social networks through which awareness and risk perception are formed, could help to encourage fuel reduction among private forest landowners.";"Fischer, A.

The model reflects on a large class of institutions and natural resources for which complete enclosure by a sole owner may be desirable, but is often institutionally impractical. When a sole owner is granted ownership of only a fraction of the spatial domain of the resource and the remainder of the resource is competed for by an open access fringe, interesting spatial externalities arise. We obtain sharp analytical results regarding partial enclosure of the commons including: (1) While second best, it always improves welfare relative to no property rights, (2) all resource users are made better off, (3) positive rents arise in the open access area, and the resource will maintain higher abundance. Under spatial heterogeneity, we also characterize spatial regions that are ideal candidates for partial enclosure - typically, society should seek to enclose those patches with high ecological productivity and high self-retention, but whether high economic parameters promote or relegate a patch may depend on one’s objective. These results help inform a burgeoning trend around the world to partially enclose the commons.";"Costello, Christopher

It uses an operationalized approach based on production ecological concepts, and the application of the simulation model EPIC for the case of Ansai County in the Loess Plateau. Based on four criteria, i.e. suitable land units, crop rotations, production situations, and agro-techniques for water and soil conservation, we identified 548 cropping systems. The yield potentials and efficiencies in terms of soil and nutrient conservation were quantitatively evaluated for each of the cropping systems. The results indicated that the low productivity, and serious soil and water losses in current cropping systems may be greatly alleviated by increasing nutrient inputs and use of soil conservation measures, such as growing crops in rotations with alfalfa, using crop residues as mulch, and furrow-ridging tillage. For most crops, the current yield may be at least doubled by good soil and crop management with appropriate inputs. The study suggests a range of crop rotations that satisfy food production, soil and water conservation and economic objectives to different extent. The results of this study can serve two purposes. First, they may help setting an agenda for empirical and experimental research aimed at the testing and improving of cropping systems, and second, the cropping systems can be input for an integrated land use study that weighs objectives at regional scale and reveals potential and strategic land use options.";"Lu, C.H.

"AGRIS:US201300744359";"Effects of set-aside management on birds breeding in lowland Ireland";"";"Farmland birds have suffered a severe decline in recent years throughout Europe including Ireland. Agricultural intensification is believed to be the main cause and this has led to the introduction of agri-environmental schemes, of which set-aside is a part. Bird abundance and diversity were compared between set-aside and adjacent tillage or grassland at 18 locations. The set-aside sites were also assigned to one of four management types: rotational set-aside, non-rotational set-aside, first year set-aside that was productive grassland in the previous year, and long-term set-aside that was grazed by animals in winter. Species diversity and the abundances of skylark, meadow pipit and woodpigeon were significantly greater in set-aside sites. Species diversity was not significantly different between set-aside management types and meadow pipit, skylark, pheasant, house sparrow, magpie, snipe and starling were closely associated with non-rotational set-aside, which also contained significantly larger numbers of these species compared to the other set-aside types. This study shows that set-aside does enhance bird diversity and abundance and that, in Ireland, the most effective form of set-aside is non-rotational. It also shows that the most appropriate form of set-aside will vary from situation to situation and that a one size fits all view should not be taken in the development of agri-environmental schemes.";"Bracken, F.

"AGRIS:US201400143237";"Characterizing temporal vegetation dynamics of land use in regional scale of Java Island, Indonesia";"";"Improving the understanding of land use and land cover is a major research challenge for the human-environmental sciences and is essential for many aspects of global environmental research. Considering seasonal vegetation dynamics or phenological dynamics in multi-year series leads to a broader view of land use and land cover. This study is based on the hypothesis that a pixel representing a complex but consistent land use has a typical, distinct and repeated temporal pattern of vegetation index inter-annually, which can be used as characteristic signatures for land use classification. Considering the seasonal events and climatic variability in Indonesia, we characterized the temporal vegetation dynamics of long-term land use by using multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index 16-day composite data from 2001 to 2007, and then generated a land use map using those characteristics. Accuracy assessment of the results showed the need to evaluate such methods for land use types that do not have a consistent yearly pattern. On the other hand, the identification of the intensive agriculture lands, such as paddy rice and upland, was satisfactory. Although the mixed pixel issue is quite problematic when using MODIS data, the results indicate that MODIS data offer great promise for characterizing seasonal as well as multi-year variation at large scales. Indeed, the methodology proposed in this research distinguished among many specific land use classes based on temporal land cover information properties. Characterization of temporal vegetation dynamics patterns would provide sufficient, significant and useful information regarding the patterns of land use; consequently it should be possible to consider the actual, subtle nature of inter-annual land use change as well as overall land use.";"Setiawan, Yudi

Roughly a third of NB and ME’s forested land is owned by private, non-industrial owners [sometimes called family forests or woodlot owners]. The choices of thousands of individual parcel owners of forest land determine the fate of these ecosystems. Ownership of forest land implies a social contract between the landowners and the rest of society. Previous research has focused on utilitarian conceptions of land use such as landowner rights and motivations. This study contributes to the discussion by inviting small-scale forest landowners in NB and ME to articulate their notions of landowner responsibilities. Through qualitative methods, this study ascertains participants’ self-reported behaviors that indicate their overall attitudes about the responsibility of forestland ownership. Respondents from both NB and ME expressed strong sentiments toward using and/or managing their land in ways they considered beneficial to both themselves and to the ecosystems in which they are embedded, or as Leopold (A sand county almanac: and sketches here and there.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

Subsequently, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to classify the risk factors into four major categories, and Expert Choice software was used to weight them. Based on the obtained results, Physicochemical ; Biological ; Economic, Social, and Cultural; and Health and Safety risks were rated by the weights of 0.124, 0.080, 0.048, and 0.021, respectively. Among the physicochemical risks, Erosion and Sedimentation weighted 0.061 and 0.047, respectively, were identified as the most serious risks. Among the biological risks, the highest negative impact was assigned to Land Cover with the weight of 0.189. In the third category, the most important risk was Population Displacement , weighted 0.114. Workers’ Falls with the weight of 0.109 was also determined as the highest risk in the last category.

"AGRIS:US201600202758";"Cheatgrass Percent Cover Change: Comparing Recent Estimates to Climate ChangeâDriven Predictions in the Northern Great Basin";"";"Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) is a highly invasive species in the Northern Great Basin that helps decrease fire return intervals. Fire fragments the shrub steppe and reduces its capacity to provide forage for livestock and wildlife and habitat critical to sagebrush obligates. Of particular interest is the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an obligate whose populations have declined so severely due, in part, to increases in cheatgrass and fires that it was considered for inclusion as an endangered species. Remote sensing technologies and satellite archives help scientists monitor terrestrial vegetation globally, including cheatgrass in the Northern Great Basin. Along with geospatial analysis and advanced spatial modeling, these data and technologies can identify areas susceptible to increased cheatgrass cover and compare these with greater sage grouse priority areas for conservation (PAC). Future climate models forecast a warmer and wetter climate for the Northern Great Basin, which likely will force changing cheatgrass dynamics. Therefore, we examine potential climate-caused changes to cheatgrass. Our results indicate that future cheatgrass percent cover will remain stable over more than 80% of the study area when compared with recent estimates, and higher overall cheatgrass cover will occur with slightly more spatial variability. The land area projected to increase or decrease in cheatgrass cover equals 18% and 1%, respectively, making an increase in fire disturbances in greater sage grouse habitat likely. Relative susceptibility measures, created by integrating cheatgrass percent cover and temporal standard deviation datasets, show that potential increases in future cheatgrass cover match future projections. This discovery indicates that some greater sage grouse PACs for conservation could be at heightened risk of fire disturbance. Multiple factors will affect future cheatgrass cover including changes in precipitation timing and totals and increases in freeze-thaw cycles. Understanding these effects can help direct land management, guide scientific research, and influence policy.";"Boyte, Stephen P.

Ebben sok minden közrejátszott, de mindenekelőtt az, hogy a rendszerváltozáshoz ziláltan érkezett az agrárgazdaság, a vidék, s a földek reprivatizációja helyett kárpótlásra került sor, elmaradt a parasztság rehabilitációja, s főleg hogy egyetlen kormány sem foglalkozott stratégiai, szociális, környezetfenntartó súlyának megfelelően a vidékkel, a mezőgazdasággal. Ugyan 2001-ben lépéseket kezdeményeztek a családi gazdaságok felkarolására, de ez nem folytatódott. Nem jött létre korszerű üzemi szerkezet, a gazdák tőke- és tudáshiánnyal küszködnek, és összefogás, hatásos érdekképviselet, érdekérvényesítő képesség híján kiszolgáltatottak a közvetítő és más kereskedőknek, feldolgozóknak.Okulva az elmúlt két évtized mulasztásaiból, a kétharmados parlamenti többség lehetőségeire és felelősségére támaszkodva remélni lehet, hogy a kormány vidékbarát agrárpolitikájában irányt mutat a termőföld tulajdonlásán túlmenően annak fenntartható hasznosításáról, a vidék, a mező-erdőgazdaság fejlődési irányairól, koncepciójáról, megoldási feltételeiről. A jövőképben kulcsfontosságú annak megjelölése, hogy a döntéshozók milyen szerepet várnak a vidéktől, a vidéki településektől, a mező-erdőgazdaságtól az élelmiszer-biztonságban (mennyiségben és minőségben), a foglalkoztatásban, a külkereskedelmi egyensúlytöbbletben, a vidék elnéptelenedésének, szegényedésének, öregedésének csökkentésében, a környezetfenntartó, közjavakat szolgáltató tevékenységben, a kívánatos üzemi struktúrában és termé¬szetesen mindezek szellemi-pénzügyi-anyagi-műszaki feltételeiben.

The causes are many, but include especially the dishevelled state of the agricultural sector at the time of the change of political regime, the fact that an indemnification process took place instead of the re-privatisation of land, that the rehabilitation of the farmer class never took place, and especially that none of the governments have paid as much attention to the countryside and to agriculture as would have befitted their role in strategy, social issues and the preservation of the environment. There were some attempts to aid family farms in 2001, but they came to an end. No modern farm structure has evolved, and the farmers struggle with lack of capita. In the absence of cooperation and efficient advocacy activities, they are at the mercy of middle-men and other traders and processing businesses.Learning from the omissions of the last two decades and relying on the opportunities and responsibility of its two-thirds majority, it can be hoped that the Government adopts a countryside-friendly agricultural policy which sheds light not only on the resolution of land ownership issues but also sustainable land use, the lines and concepts of development as well as solutions for rural areas, forestry and agriculture. In the future it will be essential to indicate what role decision-makers assign to the countryside, rural settlements as well as forestry and agriculture in ensuring food supply and food quality, employment, a positive balance in foreign trade, in reducing migration from, impoverishment of and aging of the rural areas, in the preservation of the environment and the supply of public goods, in the desired farm structure, and, naturally, in the related intellectual, financial, physical and technical conditions. As part of this effort it would be urgent to define farm in the appropriate legal regulations, to focus on the ignored work of farm regime and market tasks. The most important thing, however, is to take the actual situation into consideration.";"Csete, Laszlo

"AGRIS:US201500015191";"Spatiotemporal characterization of land surface temperature in Mount Kilimanjaro using satellite data";"";"Mount Kilimanjaro is considered the highest free-standing mountain in the world and a symbol of the African continent. Steep slopes and high altitudes are on the backdrop of unique biophysical characteristics, in which changes between savannas, tropical cloud forests, and subalpine vegetation can be observed in relatively small distances. In the context of this complex and heterogeneous landscape, describing the interactions between climatic variables and ecosystem functions is crucial for understanding the drivers of biodiversity. However, the characterization of climatic variables, especially surface temperature, still remains a critical bottleneck for a comprehensive understanding of habitats in Kilimanjaro. This study applies satellite-based estimates of land surface temperature (LST), from 2001 to 2011, to delineate a thorough characterization of the spatiotemporal patterns of surface temperature in Mount Kilimanjaro. The ample spatial coverage and continuous observations provided by the satellite measurements allowed the detailed description of characteristics so far poorly understood or not yet described in the literature. We demonstrate that the spatial patterns of LST in this region are rather complex, in the sense that it is characterized by non-linear behaviors and strong interactions with land cover and topography. Daytime observations (measured at 10:30 am) were shown to be strongly influenced by land cover characteristics, which is responsible for defining not only the spatial patterns (e.g., lapse rate) but also the seasonal signature of LST. At nighttime measurements (10:30 pm), the influence of land cover virtually disappears and the spatial patterns are mostly driven by altitude. Moreover, this study provides a brief assessment of LST trends observed within the analyzed period.";"Maeda, Eduardo Eiji

"AGRIS:US201400132779";"Nutrient delivery from the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico and effects of cropland conservation";"";"Excessive nutrients transported from the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) have created a hypoxic zone within the Gulf of Mexico, with numerous negative ecological effects. Furthermore, federal expenditures on agricultural conservation practices have received intense scrutiny in recent years. Partly driven by these factors, the USDA Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) recently completed a comprehensive evaluation of nutrient sources and delivery to the Gulf. The modeling framework used in the CEAP Cropland National Assessment, or Cropland CEAP, consists of the Agricultural Policy/ Environmental eXtender (APEX) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. This CEAP modeling framework was successfully calibrated for flow, sediment, and nutrients at 38 sites and validated at an additional 17. Simulation results indicated that cultivated cropland was the dominant source of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to both local waters and the Gulf, but this was not true for each water resource region within the MRB. In addition, the results showed that point sources remain significant contributors of P loads, especially in the Tennessee and Arkansas/Red River basins where point source P loads exceeded those from cultivated cropland. Similarly, urban nonpoint sources were significant nutrient sources. The Upper Mississippi, Lower Mississippi, and Ohio basins contributed the largest amounts of nutrients delivered to the Gulf. The high delivery areas near the Mississippi River main stem, from which 87% of N and 90% of P was predicted to reach the Gulf, also coincided with elevated nutrient yields to local waters. Conservation practices established on agricultural lands within the MRB were predicted to have reduced nutrient loads to the Gulf by 20% as compared with a no conservation condition. The results indicate the importance of targeted implementation of conservation practices and consideration of local water and/or Gulf impacts depending on program goal(s). The present application illustrates the value of the Cropland CEAP modeling framework as a useful, science-based tool to evaluate pollutant sources and delivery and effects of agricultural conservation practices.";"White, Michael J.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"MEX";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400132779";"http://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/59490";"";"";"";"26-40"

Here we used remote sensing data and landscape metrics to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in two large Chinese cities, Chengdu (1978–2010) and Chongqing (1976–2010). Results suggested that urban land in both cities experienced a significant growth and became 9.8 and 6.3 times larger than the initial for Chengdu and Chongqing, respectively. The edge-expansion was the major urban growth form for both cities, accounting for more than 40� % of total three types (i.e., edge-expansion, infilling, and outlying) although fluctuating during the whole period. Both cities started a spurt growth in the 1990s although the starting times were different (1992 and 1996 for Chengdu and Chongqing, respectively) because of different policies. Spatial distribution of the newly developed urban lands was largely constrained by topography. Landscape analysis not only revealed an increasing fragmentation and complexity in the study area under the impact of urbanization, but also tested the hypothesis on urbanization patterns.";"Qu, Wenyuan
