"AGRIS:CO2013006019";"Rural development in the European Union: the concept and the policy";"";"Rural areas are key elements that underpin the social and economic European territory and shape its landscape. The rural setting is a dynamic concept, able to distinguish three stages on how the European Union (EU) understands ""rural"": rural as image, rural as local, and rural as a social construction. The evolution of the concept is reflected in the need to adapt the approach used to address rural issues, and consequently the political design for rural development. Thus, under the term Rural Development, the EU has included and mixed very different issues, supporting measures and equally heterogeneous financial instruments. For the purpose of supporting the European rural world the two main EU policies have come together: the agricultural and the regional policies. So, Rural Development in the EU has been navigating between the sectorial policy and the territorial policy. At a time of redefinition of European priorities and policies for 2013, territorial cohesion, rural/urban articulation, social partnership, institutional cooperation, environmental sustainability, and governance (flexible and multilevel) are the fundamental elements upon which a policy should rest that is addressed to ensure the existence of a living countryside, inhabitable and friendly environment. Key Words: rural, rural territories, territorial development, rural development policies.

El medio rural es un elemento fundamental que vertebra social y económicamente el territorio europeo y configura su paisaje. Los intensos cambios que pueden observarse en la consideración de lo rural en la Unión Europea (UE) permiten afirmar que la ruralidad es un concepto en evolución, pudiéndose diferenciar tres etapas: lo rural como imagen, como localidad y como construcción social. La evolución del concepto tiene su reflejo en la necesaria adaptación del enfoque utilizado para abordar la problemática rural, y como consecuencia en el diseño político de apoyo a estos territorios. Bajo el término de Desarrollo Rural la UE ha ido incluyendo asuntos muy dispares, apoyándolos con medidas e instrumentos financieros igualmente heterogéneos. Para el objetivo de apoyar al mundo rural han confluido las dos grandes políticas: la agraria y la regional, por lo que la Política de Desarrollo Rural ha venido navegando entre lo sectorial y lo territorial. En un momento de redefinición de las prioridades políticas europeas a partir del 2013, cohesión territorial, articulación rural/urbana, concertación social, cooperación institucional, sostenibilidad ambiental y gobernanza, son elementos fundamentales para una política que se plantee garantizar la continuidad de un medio rural vivo, habitable y respetuoso con el medio ambiente. Palabras clave: rural, territorios rurales, desarrollo territorial, política de desarrollo rural.";"Rosa Gallardo Cobos";"";"Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá. Colombia.

"AGRIS:US201600200229";"spatial patterns of anthropogenic disturbance in the western Canadian boreal forest following oil and gas development";"";"Resource development can have significant consequences for the distribution of vegetation cover and for species persistence. Modelling changes to anthropogenic disturbance regimes over time can provide profound insights into the mechanisms that drive land cover change. We analyzed the spatial patterns of anthropogenic disturbance before and after a period of significant oil and gas extraction in two boreal forest subregions in Alberta, Canada. A spatially explicit model was used to map levels of anthropogenic forest crown mortality across 700â000 ha of managed forest over a 60-year period. The anthropogenic disturbance regime varied both spatially and temporally and was outside the historical range of variability characterized by regional fire regimes. Levels of live forest crown within anthropogenic disturbances declined and edge density increased following oil and gas development, whereas patch size varied regionally. In some places, anthropogenic disturbance generated profoundly novel landscapes with spatial patterns that had no historical analogue in the boreal system. The results illustrate that a shift in one sector of the economy can have dramatic outcomes on landscape structure. The results also suggest that any efforts to better align cumulative anthropogenic disturbance patterns with the historic baseline will almost certainly require a concerted and collaborative effort from all of the major stakeholders.";"Pickell, Paul D.

"AGRIS:US201400052080";"half-century analysis of landscape dynamics in southern Québec, Canada";"";"We studied landscape dynamics for three time periods (<1950, 1965, and 1997) along a gradient of agricultural intensity from highly intensive agriculture to forested areas in southern Québec. Air photos were analyzed to obtain long-term information on land cover (crop and habitat types) and linear habitats (hedgerows and riparian habitats) and landscape metrics were calculated to quantify changes in habitat configuration. Anthropogenic areas increased in all types of landscapes but mostly occurred in the highly disturbed cash crop dominated landscape. Perennial crops (pasture and hayfields) were largely converted into annual crops (corn and soybean) between 1965 and 1997. The coalescence of annual crop fields resulted in a more homogeneous agricultural landscape. Old fields and forest cover was consistently low and forest fragmentation remained stable through time in the intensive agriculture landscapes. However, forest cover increased and forest fragmentation receded in the forest-dominated landscapes following farm abandonment and the transition of old fields into forests. Tree-dominated hedgerows and riparian habitats increased in areas with intensive agriculture. Observed changes in land cover classes are related to proximate factors, such as surficial deposits and topography. Agriculture intensification occurred in areas highly suitable for agriculture whereas farm abandonment was observed in poor-quality agriculture terrains. Large-scale conversion of perennial crops into annual crops along with continued urbanization exerts strong pressures on residual natural habitats and their inhabiting wildlife. The afforestation process occurring in the more forested landscapes along with the addition of tree-dominated hedgerows and riparian habitats in the agriculture-dominated landscapes should improve landscape ecological value.";"Jobin, Benoît

"AGRIS:US201500015427";"All-in-Auctions for water";"";"This paper proposes a novel mechanism for reallocating temporary water flows or permanent water rights. The All-in-Auction (AiA) increases efficiency and social welfare by reallocating water without harming water rights holders. AiAs can be used to allocate variable or diminished flows among traditional or new uses. AiAs are appropriate for use within larger organizations that distribute water among members, e.g., irrigation districts or wholesale water agencies. Members would decide when and how to use AiAs, i.e., when transaction costs are high, environmental constraints are binding, or allocation to outsiders is desired. Experimental sessions show that an AiA reallocates more units with no less efficiency that traditional two-sided auctions.";"Zetland, David";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"water rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500015427";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.11.010";"";"";"";"78-86"
"AGRIS:US201400178832";"Experiences in monitoring and assessment of sustainable land management";"";"Although sustainable land management (SLM) is widely promoted to prevent and mitigate land degradation and desertification, its monitoring and assessment (M&A) has received much less attention. This paper compiles methodological approaches which to date have been little reported in the literature. It draws lessons from these experiences and identifies common elements and future pathways as a basis for a global approach. The paper starts with local level methods where the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) framework catalogues SLM case studies. This tool has been included in the local level assessment of Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) and in the EU-DESIRE project. Complementary site-based approaches can enhance an ecological process-based understanding of SLM variation. At national and sub-national levels, a joint WOCAT/LADA/DESIRE spatial assessment based on land use systems identifies the status and trends of degradation and SLM, including causes, drivers and impacts on ecosystem services. Expert consultation is combined with scientific evidence and enhanced where necessary with secondary data and indicator databases. At the global level, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) knowledge from the land (KM:Land) initiative uses indicators to demonstrate impacts of SLM investments. Key lessons learned include the need for a multi-scale approach, making use of common indicators and a variety of information sources, including scientific data and local knowledge through participatory methods. Methodological consistencies allow cross-scale analyses, and findings are analyzed and documented for use by decision-makers at various levels. Effective M&A of SLM [e.g. for United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] requires a comprehensive methodological framework agreed by the major players";"Schwilch, G.

"AGRIS:US201600132261";"Evaluation of the distribution of fecal indicator bacteria in a river system depending on different types of land use in the southern watershed of the Baltic Sea";"";"The aim of the study was to determine the effects of land use management on changes in the fecal contamination of water in the Łyna River, one of the main lowland watercourses in the southern watershed of the Baltic Sea (northern Poland). A total of 120 water samples were collected in different seasons of 2011 and 2012 at 15 sites where the river intersected forest (FA), agricultural (AA), and urbanized (UA) areas. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), the counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli, total bacterial counts (TBCs), and domain Bacteria (EUB338) were determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Temperature, pH, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, orthophosphate, and total phosphorus were also determined. The lowest bacterial counts were noted in water samples collected in FA, and the highest in samples collected in UA. Statistically significant differences were determined between bacterial populations across the analyzed land use types and in different sampling seasons. Significant correlations were also observed between the populations of FIB and physicochemical parameters. The results indicate that land use type influenced FIB concentrations in river water. The combined use of conventional and molecular methods improves the accuracy of fecal contamination analyses in river ecosystems.";"Gotkowska-Płachta, Anna

"AGRIS:US201301819387";"Who owns feral camels? Implications for managers of land and resources in central Australia";"";"This paper reviews the legislation relating to ownership of feral camels in Australia. We find that, as a general proposition, a feral camel is owned by neither the landowner nor the Government (the Crown), unless State or Territory legislation provides otherwise. This occurs in two limited situations and only for New South Wales and South Australia. Relevant State and Territory legislation can prescribe that feral camels cannot be taken or used without a relevant licence or permit, but only Western Australia and Queensland appear to do this. Lack of legislative certainty about ownership of camels has resulted in a clear market failure whereby there is also little or no private incentive to exercise control. This should be corrected by identifying explicitly that ownership is vested in the Crown. Legal analogues exist with respect to disease control and water management that could form the basis of an appropriate legislative framework.";"Garnett, Stephen T.

In this study, we have monitored land cover using the PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) full polarimetric data based on incoherent target decomposition. Supervised classification technique has been applied on Cloude–Pottier decomposition, Freeman–Durden three component, and Yamaguchi four component decomposition for accurate mapping of different types of land cover classes. Based on confusion matrix derived from the predicted and defined pixels, the evergreen and sparsely deciduous forests have shown high producer's accuracy by Freeman–Durden three component and Yamaguchi four component classifications. The overall accuracy of Maximum Likelihood Classification by Yamaguchi four component is 94.1% with 0.93 kappa coefficient as compared to the 90.3% with 0.88 kappa coefficient by Freeman–Durden three component and 89.7% with 0.88 kappa coefficient by Cloude–Pottier decomposition. High accuracy of classification in a forested area using full polarimetric PALSAR data may have been because of high penetration of L-band SAR. The content of this study could be useful for the forest cover mapping during cloudy days needed for proper implementation of REDD policies in Cambodia.";"Avtar, Ram

"AGRIS:DJ2012091564";"Developing an ecologically and economically more stable semi-domestic reindeer management - a Finnish point of view";"";"In arctic and sub-arctic regions semi-domestic reindeer management forms an important livelihood which should be able to provide enough income for herders. Reindeer management has natural limits of growth. Consequently it should be managed to optimise both the use of reindeer pastures and herder income. Reindeer pastures should be grazed at the economic carrying capabity level. This gives the maximum sustained harvest from reindeer stock and also the maximum sustained foraging from pastures. How is this to be accomplished? First, reliable knowledge about reindeer pastures in time and place is necessary: to estimate the quantity and quality of specific reindeer pastures within each management district, as well as the productive capacity and the changes in condition and productivity of those pastures. Secondly, data is needed on the accurate productivity of reindeer stock and the production costs for each management district. Thirdly, study the relationships between pasture resources and productivity of reindeer stock together with the effects of long-term reindeer densities on pasture condition and productivity. Finally, knowledge is needed about the effects of herd structure on reindeer stock productivity as well as the factors which restrict the use of reindeer pastures. Models based on adequate data could provide a useful tool for optimising the use of reindeer pastures and herder income. First the economic carrying capacity of reindeer pastures should be studied. Subsequently the economy of reindeer husbandry could be modelled with respect to reindeer stock density. Also the economy of reindeer husbandry based on different levels of feeding, and the effects of this husbandry practice on pastures, should be modelled. Models should be accurate and flexible enough to use when looking for solutions to practical questions and challenges in reindeer management.";"Jouko Kumpula";"";"";"AGRIS";"1999-04-05";"";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012091564";"http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1604";"";"";"";"111-120"

Two scales of analysis, a sectional watershed and a buffer, offered a local and a global investigation of the sources of stream pollutants. Model accuracy, measured by R² values, fluctuated according to the scale, season, and regression method used. While most wet season water quality parameters are associated with urban land covers, most dry season water quality parameters are related topographic features such as elevation and slope. GWR models, which take into consideration local relations of spatial autocorrelation, had stronger results than OLS regression models. In the multiple regression models, sectioned watershed results were consistently better than the sectioned buffer results, except for dry season pH and stream temperature parameters. This suggests that while riparian land cover does have an effect on water quality, a wider contributing area needs to be included in order to account for distant sources of pollutants.";"Pratt, Bethany

However, the success of restoration programs is often focused on biological or ecological criteria. The situation is no exception in Bangladesh, which houses the world's largest mangrove plantations. This study has been undertaken in a south-central estuarine island (Nijhum Dwip) of the Bangladesh coast and aims to understand societal perception on the achievements of a plantation program. Through 110 household interviews and seven group discussions, an assessment was conducted of peoples' perception about major flora and fauna of the mangrove ecosystem, benefits derived from the forest, present condition of the forest, causes of degradation, and ways to improve the situation. Around one-fourth of the respondents mentioned that they were highly dependent on the ecosystem. The most important perceived benefits were: provision of raw materials, prevention against natural disasters, climate regulation and soil retention. However, the majority (>80%) of the respondents perceived the ecosystem to be degrading. Encroachment and illicit felling were identified as the main causes of such degradation. In order to arrest the continued degradation allowed by conventional forest management flaws, adaptive co-management has been recommended to conserve this ecosystem in a more equitable way.";"Iftekhar, M.

We examined spatial distribution influenced by land cover, anthropogenic disturbance and invasive hare presence, and analysed temporal activity patterns and dietary composition. If competitive exclusion accounts for carnivore coexistence in this system, we predicted segregation would occur in one or more of these aspects as a mechanism for coexistence. We performed camera trapping in Nahuel Huapi National Park, from February to May 2012 and January to April 2013. Using camera detections, we analysed spatial patterns with co‐occupancy modelling and temporal patterns by fitting kernel density estimates and measuring overlap. We performed a dietary meta‐analysis using available literature and performed a discriminant function analysis of diet categories between species. We observed high spatial and temporal overlap between Geoffroy's cats and culpeo foxes. We found no evidence of segregation in relation to land cover occupancy, anthropogenic disturbance, invasive hare occurrence or activity patterns. Though both species consumed predominantly small and medium mammals, Geoffroy's cats consumed more birds, reptiles and amphibians, and culpeo foxes consumed more large mammals, carrion and plant material; coexistence between these two carnivores in this Patagonian protected area appears to be facilitated by diet segregation.";"Gantchoff, M.

We evaluated the richness and diversity of perennial plant species maintained in AFS through vegetation sampling of 14 agricultural plots and compared their composition with that of natural forests (14 plots of 500� m² each). We examined the situations among communities of Náhuatl, Ixcatec and Cuicatec people, documenting through interviews the management practices of plant species and the whole system, reasons why people maintain vegetation cover within AFS, and factors influencing changes in decisions favouring agriculture intensification. In the AFS studied we recorded a total of 79 species of trees and shrubs, 86� % of them being native species and representing 43� % of all species of trees and shrubs recorded in the sampling of the natural forests the AFS derive from. People leave standing on average a total of 40 individual trees and shrubs per agricultural plot. Reasons for leave plant species standing were more frequently associated with their use as fruit trees, firewood, shade, beauty, respect to nature and other environmental benefits. Water availability for irrigation, land tenure, and dependence on agriculture and forest for peasant's subsistence were main decision factors influencing AFS variation in their composition. AFS in temperate zones are important reservoirs of biodiversity and biocultural heritage and should be keystones for conservation policies in the Tehuacán–Cuicatlán Valley.";"Vallejo, Mariana

Cultivated land area, population, grain output, sowing area and other factors in years 1997-2007, which affect the cultivated land pressure in arid and semi-arid areas, are analyzed and estimated, as well as the temporal variations of minimum cultivated area per capita and pressure index of cultivated land. Pressure index of cultivated land in Jiuquan City is calculated and the pressure situation of cultivated land at present is analyzed. Based on the construction of demand function of cultivated land, demand of cultivated land, that is, the protected area of basic farmland and cultivated land, is finally obtained so as to achieve the goal of food security in Jiuquan City at the stage of comprehensive construction of a well-off society in the year 2020. Considering the food security of China, we use PSR Model and find out that it is necessary to strengthen government’s macro-control functions, to protect the fragile ecological environment, to improve the land intensive and economical use during the process of urbanization, and to reduce the pressure of cultivated land in arid and semi-arid region, and to provide theoretical basis for the policy making of cultivated land protection in this region.";"Fu, Shi-bo

Additionally, the decreasing profitability of agricultural production caused farmers, who are able to freely decide on land turnover, to be interested in land sale for non-agricultural purposes. At the same time, Polish counties received the status of self-governments, which then imposed their will upon local economic development. In this way, counties became responsible for land management as well, and started supporting the process of land conversion, perceived as a factor of the above development. Such implications have created the following situation: decentralisation and the extension of private control over land has led to the loss of rural landscapes in Poland, because farmers, county self-governments and rural society in general gain from the conversion of agricultural to housing land. Therefore, field research has been exercised at the county level. For the investigation, two counties, located in regions differentiated by economic growth, were selected.

The contribution of this investigation is to make use of a unique household, mail/internet survey data set collected in 2007 in the Southwestern United States (Region 3 of the U.S. Forest Service). With over 5,800 survey responses to a set of 25 Public Land Value statements, canonical correlation analysis is able to identify 7 statistically distinct environmental attitudinal groups. We also examine the effect of expected changes in regional demographics on overall environmental attitudes, which may help guide in the development of socially acceptable long-term forest management policies. Results show significant support for conservationist management policies and passive environmental values, as well as a greater role for stakeholder groups in generating consensus for current and future forest management policies.";"Prera, Alejandro J.

"AGRIS:US2012204486";"Provision of Environmental Goods on Potentially Abandoned Land- The White Carpathians Protected Landscape Area";"";"At the beginning of the transition, the economic decline of agriculture partially relaxed the pressure on the wildlife. However, the policy continued to concentrate on regulating the intensity of production rather then creating incentives to produce environmental qualities. The structural adjustment process in agriculture caused the low return (poor) land to be released from production, especially, in protection zones with severe environmental restrictions. Land abandonment resulted in a rapid degradation of wildlife and landscape in places where these natural values were legally protected. 

The article examines the organisation of the provision of landscape and wildlife in the White Carpathians protected landscape area after 1997, when the new agricultural legislation and policy recognised compensations for restrictions and has gradually introduced incentives to cultivate potentially abandoned land. It was found that there was more than one governance structure, and that these were not necessary supporting each other. Our investigation concluded that solving the conservation problem is not separable from the rural development problem of the region, and therefore, that there is a need for participation of local community in terms of contributing producers but mainly consumers of high natural values.";"Krumalova, Veronika

"AGRIS:US2012204485";"Institutional Options for the Protection of Open Space: Evidence from Poland";"";"This paper seeks to contribute to the development of institutional options for the management of public goods in Central and Eastern Europe. It assesses the potential of different governance structures, including administrative hierarchies, market approaches, and efforts at local non-market co-ordination. The paper examines the management of public goods in Central and Eastern Europe through a study of open space management and urban sprawl in a semi-urban county near Warsaw, Poland. The protection of open space poses significant challenges to semi-urban land management, as its benefits cannot be captured by individual entities and accrue as much to urban residents as to local people. The concrete institutional options investigated comprehend the use of land registers for monitoring land conversion, establishment of land trusts in part financed by a development gains tax, and technical and organisational support for local environmental organisations. The evaluation of options builds on an analysis of causes underlying rapid land conversion in the past decade. The causal analysis demonstrates that privatization and decentralisation have evoked the radical changes in land use. The demand for housing land motivated farmers to sell semi-urban land, as the state could not enforce its legal oversight over land use. Land conversion was driven by local alliances of farmers eager to ""cash in"" on their newly acquired rights of alienation, a broader rural society primarily interested in economic development, and local authorities lured by increasing tax revenues.";"Wasilewski, Adam

"AGRIS:US201300825360";"Determinants of the biogeographical distribution of butterflies in boreal regions";"";"We explored the relative contributions of climatic and land-cover factors in explaining the distribution patterns of butterflies in a boreal region. Finland, northern Europe. Data from a national butterfly atlas survey carried out during 1991-2003, with a 10-km grain grid system, were used in these analyses. We used generalized additive models (GAM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) to explore the main environmental correlates (climate and land-cover) of the realized niches of 98 butterfly species. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was validated by resubstitution and cross-validation approaches, using the area under the curve (AUC) derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Predictive accuracies of the 98 individual environment-butterfly models varied from low to very high (cross-validated AUC values 0.48-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The results of both the GAM and HP analyses were broadly concordant. Most of the variation in butterfly distributions is associated with growing degree-days, mean temperature of the coldest month and cover of built-up area in all six phylogenetic groups (butterfly families). There were no statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy among the different butterfly families. About three-quarters of the distributions of butterfly species in Finland appear to be governed principally by climatic, predominantly temperature-related, factors. This indicates that many butterfly species may respond rapidly to the projected climate change in boreal regions. By determining the ecological niches of multiple species, we can project their range shifts in response to changes in climate and land-cover, and identify species that are particularly sensitive to forecasted global changes.";"Luoto, M.

"AGRIS:US201400088159";"pattern of distribution and diversity of avifauna over an urbanizing tropical landscape";"";"An investigation was done to determine the occurrence and composition of avian fauna community in the urbanizing city of Nairobi, Kenya. We conducted bird counts in sample sites randomly distributed over the Nairobi landscape within a two-year period. The proportion of seven different land cover types derived from within a 500� m radius of classified satellite image described the habitat condition of each sample site. Multivariate analysis of the site and species data indicated that savannah vegetation, forest and agriculture land cover types were the main environmental gradients that differentiated the sample sites. Four clusters of sample sites occurred on the ordination plane according to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). From 50 families of birds observed, species related to bush and scrub habitats occurred at a rate of about 31� %, followed by grassland species at 20� % and forest species at about 16� % rate. Out of CCA, five functional groups of birds were distinguishable. The proportion of sites occupied by birds per functional group and mean count of individual birds declined significantly, p < 0.0001, as groups of birds changed from being urban-related to savannah and then to forest-related species. One cluster comprised birds marked as having conservation concern status and related mainly to savannah vegetation of scrub and grasslands. In this landscape context, features such as native savannah vegetation and woodland accompanied by a process of controlled land use, could greatly mitigate negative impacts of ecosystem degradation on the sensitive tropical urban bird biodiversity.";"Njoroge, John Bosco

We quantified the distribution and abundance of both native and non‐native plant species along a habitat gradient representing four management zones: managed agroecosystem, the agroecosystem boundary, ecotone, and neighbouring native forest for two land uses: kiwifruit orchards and neighbouring grassland agroecosystems. Native plant species diversity was highest in forest zones, and declined significantly with increasing non‐native plant diversity across all management zones. The negative relationship between native and non‐native plant species richness and diversity across all management zones was surprising, and contrasts with most ecological literature. Further, non‐native plant species that have the largest ecological or ecosystem impacts were most abundant in ecotones, but were largely absent from managed zones and their margins. Our results suggest that agroecosystems and neighbouring vegetation can harbour native species, but can also be a source of non‐native invasive weeds. These results highlight that agricultural margins contain both native plant diversity and environmental weeds, and that management of these margins affects diversity both on and off the farm.";"Peltzer, Duane A.

On each of the three chronosequences, exotic pine forests had been converted to intensive dairy pastures 2–11 years before sampling and samples were also taken from remaining pine forests and long-term pastures (40–80 years old). The primary objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that surface-soil δ15N would increase over time following conversion of forest to pasture, due to greater N inputs and isotope-fractionating N losses (e.g. ammonia volatilisation) in pasture systems. Results supported our hypothesis, with linear regression revealing a significant (P<0.001) positive correlation between log-transformed pasture age (log10[pasture age+1]) and surface-soil δ15N. There was also a positive correlation (P<0.001) between pasture age and total soil C and N, and a negative correlation of pasture age with C:N ratio. Surface-soil δ15N was also positively correlated (P<0.001) with total soil N, and negatively correlated with C:N ratio when C:N was <13.6. These results suggested that as soils became more N-‘saturated’, isotope-fractionating N loss processes increased. Surface-soil δ15N in the pine forests was significantly less than subsoil δ15N, but there was no significant difference between the surface and subsoil in the long-term pastures, due to 15N enrichment of the surface soil. The difference in δ15N between the surface soil and subsoil may be a useful indicator of past land management, in addition to absolute δ15N values of surface soils.";"Mudge, P. L.

To achieve this objective, the hypothesis is empirically tested that a land value tax encourages more development closer to preexisting development than farther from preexisting development. Specifically, the marginal effects of a land value tax on the probability of land development is hypothesized to be greater in areas around preexisting development than in areas more distant from preexisting development. The findings show that the marginal effects of a land value tax on the probability of developing parcels that neighbored previously developed parcels was greater than the probability of developing parcels that did not neighbor previously developed parcels. This finding suggests that land value taxation could be used to design compact development strategies that address sprawling development.";"Cho, Seong-Hoon

"AGRIS:US201500199432";"Vegetation cover reduces erosion and enhances soil organic carbon in a vineyard in the central Spain";"";"Land degradation, and soil and nutrient loss, are significant environmental problems in semi-arid agricultural environments in the Mediterranean Basin. One land use that is particularly associated with the highest rates of erosion in Spain is extensive vineyards. We examined the effectiveness of two cover crops for improving soil physical properties and reducing erosion in a vineyard located in the Henares River basin southeast of Madrid, Spain. We assessed erosion from three replicate plots of 2m² each with three treatments that comprised: traditional tillage, permanent cover of Brachypodium distachyon and spring-mown crop of Secale cereale. Erosion plots under traditional tillage yielded substantially more erosion (5.88tha⁻¹yr⁻¹) than Brachypodium (0.78tha⁻¹yr⁻¹) or Secale (1.27tha⁻¹yr⁻¹). While the concentration of SOC in sediments was greater for the cover crops, the mass-corrected loss of SOC was greater under tillage (0.06tha⁻¹yr⁻¹) than under Brachypodium or Secale (0.02tha⁻¹yr⁻¹). Root biomass was two- to four-times greater under the vegetation treatments. Our measure of aggregate stability for the tillage treatment remained between 7.9 and 5.4 drops over the four years of study and values for both cover crops exceeded that for Tillage by the end of the second year. The vegetation cover treatments increased SOC by 1.2% and intrapedal SOC by 10–60% compared with Tillage. By the end of the study, steady-state infiltration in the cover treatments was 45% greater than that under tillage, with the largest increase under Brachypodium. We attribute the greater infiltration on cover treatments to a greater abundance of larger pores on vegetated compared with tilled plots. Our study reinforces the notion that there are considerable benefits of using cover crops in rainfed vineyards, not only for prevention of soil erosion, but to enhance soil condition and potentially reduce the heavy reliance on industrial fertilisers.";"Ruiz-Colmenero, M.

The aim of this article is (i) to review the state of the use of high-resolution remote sensing for ecological studies in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) and (ii) to suggest further potential avenues of research in the region using this technology. It has been recognized that the recent improvements in remote sensing have enabled researchers to categorize and spatially map species and communities and to detect vegetation types based on ecological gradients and environmental drivers. Across the globe, the use of current high-resolution imagery in vegetation studies is increasing due to their improved efficiency, as fine-scale vegetation information is needed for both theoretical understanding of the processes involved and conservation towards the maintenance of ecological functions of natural ecosystems. Remote sensing is particularly useful in the IHR, where field-based mapping of forest vegetation and land cover using conventional techniques is a cost- and time-intensive effort. Mapping fine-scale patterns of tree species using high-resolution remote-sensing data has important implications for the understanding and monitoring of ecosystem function and biodiversity patterns in forests.";"Gairola, Sanjay

"AGRIS:US201400133198";"integrated approach to grazingland ecological assessments and management interpretations";"";"The status of grazinglands in the USA is increasingly dynamic with large areas being converted to cropland in response to demands for increased crop production. Here we focus on two types of grazinglands: rangelands and pasturelands. Rangelands are usually defined as natural ecosystems in which the native vegetation is predominantly grasses, grass-like plants or shrubs, and are generally used for grazing livestock and wildlife. Pasturelands are areas specifically managed for the production of forage (native or introduced) for grazing livestock. In the USA, rangelands and pasturelands have traditionally been assessed using different methods and indicators. These differences in assessment methods limit the ability to consistently apply land evaluations to land management across geographic boundaries and in areas undergoing land use change. Resource allocation and decision making at the national scale needs to be based on comparable metrics. We used a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate the potential for an integrated grazingland assessment approach based on common indicators. Comparisons of rangeland and pastureland assessment indicators suggested that there are significant relationships between many of the indicators in rangeland health and pasture condition scoring methods. However, there were differences, both in the indicators used and in assessments of seemingly common indicators. We suggest the need for a unified approach that captures the best from both the rangeland and pastureland assessment methods while taking into account ecosystem attributes and management objectives of the grazinglands where these methods are usually applied. The Interpreting Indicators for Rangeland Health protocol provides a way to assess and interpret soil and site stability, biotic integrity, and hydrologic function attributes based on ecological potential at a site. The Pasture Condition Scoring protocol provides a framework that could potentially be used to formalize management interpretations at a site based on ecological potential and based on management practices that could exceed the productive potential at a site. We propose that the strengths of the two protocols be integrated using a consistent framework to gather and interpret data, which will provide comparable metrics across all grazinglands.";"Toledo, David

To gain improved understanding of relationships among LULC, soil drainage, and dissolved nitrate-N dynamics within the Calapooia River Basin in western Oregon, we selected 44 watersheds ranging in size between 3 and 33 km2 for monthly synoptic sampling of surface water quality between October 2003 and September 2004. Seasonal associations were examined between dissolved nitrate-N and proportion of woody vegetation or poorly drained soils at differing scales (10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 150, 300 m, and entire watershed), which we defined as influence zones (IZs), surrounding stream networks. Correlations between nitrate-N and proportion woody vegetation or poorly drained soil at each IZ were analyzed for differences using the Hotelling-Williams test. We observed negative correlations (r = -0.81 to -0.94) between nitrate-N and proportion of woody vegetation during winter and spring. Poorly drained soils had positive correlations (r = 0.63-0.87) with nitrate-N. Altering the scale of analysis significantly changed correlations between nitrate-N and woody vegetation, with IZs <150 m being stronger than the watershed scale during winter. However, absolute differences in correlation values were small, indicating minimal ecological consequence for significant differences among scales. In contrast, nitrate-N correlations with poorly drained soil were stronger at the watershed scale than the 10- through 90-m IZs during winter and spring, and absolute differences were sufficient to suggest that scale is ecologically important when determining associations between dissolved nitrate-N and poorly drained soils.";"Floyd, William C.

In this study, quadrapole Radarsat-2 data have been utilized for mapping geological elements in Archaean terrain based on their geophysical parameters preserved in the four polarization channels of Radarsat-2 data. The study illustrates how single-look complex polarimetric data can be processed to extract information on lithology, geological structure, and land covers (i.e. soil type, etc.) preferentially developed over each rock type. The study revealed that C-band polarization power images can be used indirectly to delineate lithounits provided each unit has characteristic surface roughness and moisture resulting from the surface cover or exposure pattern developed over each lithounit. Moreover, polarimetric data (inclusive of phase and amplitude) provide complementary information when we compare this information with the information derived from simple polarization composites, derived from the backscattered image of each polarization channel. It is also observed that structural imprints are enhanced in co-polarized (HH, VV) data, whereas the cross-polarized channel (HV, VH) provides information on land cover.";"Guha, Arindam

"AGRIS:US201400133190";"Coupling landscape water storage and supplemental irrigation to increase productivity and improve environmental stewardship in the US Midwest";"";"Agriculture must expand production for a growing population while simultaneously reducing its environmental impacts. These goals need not be in tension with one another. Here we outline a vision for improving both the productivity and environmental performance of agriculture in the US Corn Belt. Mean annual precipitation has increased throughout the region over the past 50 years, consistent with climate models that attribute it to a warming troposphere. Stream gauge data indicate that higher precipitation has been matched or exceeded by higher stream flows, contributing to flooding, soil loss, and excessive nutrient flux to the Gulf of Mexico. We propose increasing landscape hydrologic storage through construction of ponds and restoration of wetlands to retain water for supplemental irrigation while also reducing flood risks. Primary productivity is proportional to transpiration, and analysis shows that in the US Midwest both can be sustainably increased with supplemental irrigation. This will reduce interannual yield variability by limiting losses due to transient drought, while facilitating adoption of cropping system modifications, such as inclusion of companion crops and winter cover crops, that “perennialize” the landscape to take advantage of the full potential growing season. When implemented in concert, these practices would reduce the riverine nitrogen export that is a primary cause of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Erosive sediment losses would also be reduced through the combination of enhanced hydrologic storage and increased vegetative cover. Successful implementation would require watershed-scale coordination among producers and landowners. An obvious mechanism to encourage this is governmental farm policy.";"Baker, John M.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

The study is based on data from the National Survey of Household Living Conditions and Agriculture of 2011 (ECVMA-2011) analyzed within the framework of multivariate Probit model. The results show that there are unobservable interdependences between the decisions on farmland management practices. Furthermore, several types of factors related to access to physical, human, financial and biophysical capitals as well as infrastructure and services seem to play an important role.

"AGRIS:US201600189712";"ecological condition of geographically isolated wetlands in the southeastern United States: The relationship between landscape level assessments and macrophyte assemblages";"";"Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are common features of the Dougherty Plain physiographic region in southwestern Georgia. Due to lack of protection at the state and federal levels, these wetlands are threatened by intensive agricultural and silvicultural land uses common in the region. Recently, the ecological condition of such GIWs was assessed for the southeastern United States using the Landscape Development Intensity Index (LDI), a practical assessment tool that relies on remotely sensed land use and land cover (LULC) data surrounding isolated wetlands to rapidly predict wetland condition. However, no assessments have been attempted for GIWs in the Dougherty Plain specifically. Our goal was to develop a framework to guide and refine remote assessment of wetland condition within this agriculturally intense region of the southeastern USA. In this study, we characterized human disturbances associated with isolated wetlands in the Dougherty Plain, and paired the rapid assessment of GIWs using LDI with an intensive assessment of wetland plant communities. Specifically, we: (1) examined how macrophyte assemblages and vegetation metrics vary across a human disturbance gradient in the Dougherty Plain; (2) compared multiple condition assessment outcomes using variations of the LDI method that differed in spatial extent and resolution of LULC categories; and (3) determined the predicted condition of GIWs in the Dougherty Plain as indexed by LDI and compared with region-wide assessments of GIWs of the southeastern USA. Generally, the relationship between wetland plant communities and surrounding land use supported the assumptions of the LDI index in that wetlands surrounded by agricultural land use classes featured distinct plant communities relative to those surrounded by forested land use classes. Our results indicated that finer spatial resolution of LULC data improved the predictive ability of LDI. However, based on incongruence between wetland vegetation composition and LDI scores in some forested landscapes, this study identified limitations of the LDI assessment method, particularly when applied in regions in which prescribed fire is an important ecological driver of vegetation and habitat. Thus, we conclude that LDI may be biased toward an overestimation of reference condition GIWs, even though the habitat may be functionally degraded by the absence of natural processes such as fire. Regardless, relative to the assessment of the entire southeastern US, a greater proportion of total GIWs of the Dougherty Plain were identified as impaired due to the intensity of irrigated agricultural land use.";"Stuber, O.

However, adequate assessment on the current status of CLI becomes necessary for the development and its evolution among smallholder farmers. This article presents a basic and multi-objective linear programming (LP) model to determine enterprise combinations of crop and livestock activities that maximize total gross margin (TGM) among small farms in the Eastern Cape Province. Optimization modeling results and trade-off analysis showed 122.61% increase and 58% decreases, respectively, compared with the average TGM per livestock unit (LU). Smallholder CLI farmers can optimally maximized profit, but fail to optimally maximize home consumption with profit maximization objectives at present resource level. The results further revealed that resources such as land, livestock enterprises were (loose resources) not efficiently used. Efficient and capital use and compact arrangement of crop-livestock integration are suggested instead of free access grazing practice in the study area.";"Hosu, Sunday

Unfortunately, traditional classification procedures are very labor intensive and subjective because of the required human interaction. Based on the strategy of updating land cover data only for the changed area, we proposed an integrated, automated approach to update land cover maps without human interaction. The proposed method consists primarily of the following three parts: a change detection technique, a Markov Random Fields (MRFs) model, and an iterated training sample selecting procedure. In the proposed approach, remotely sensed data acquired in different seasons or from different remote sensors can be used. Meanwhile, the approach is completely unsupervised. Therefore, the methodology has a wide scope of application. A case study of Landsat data was conducted to test the performance of this method. The experimental results show that several sub-modules in this method work effectively and that reasonable classification accuracy can be achieved.";"Chen, Xuehong

"AGRIS:XS2006560111";"Diversity of the land resources in the Amazonian State of Rondônia, Brazil";"";"Conflicting opinions are recorded in the literature concerning the suitability of Amazon lands for sustainable agriculture following deforestation. This article has been written to shed light on this question by summarizing climate, landform, soil and vegetation features from the findings of a land resource study of the Brazilian state of Rondônia in south-west Amazonia. The work, which followed the World Soils and Terrain Digital Database (SOTER) methodology, was financed by the World Bank. During the course of the survey special emphasis was given to studying soils; 2914 profiles were analyzed and recorded. The study identified a complex pattern of land units with clear differences in climate, landform, soils and native vegetation. Forested areas mosaic with lesser areas of natural savannas. The latter occur on both poorly-drained and well-drained, albeit nutrient deficient sandy soils. The tallest and most vigorous forests or their remnants were seen growing on well-drained soils formed from nutrient-rich parent materials. Many of these soils could, or are being used for productive agriculture. Soils developed on nutrient-poor parent materials support forests that are significantly lower in height, and would require large lime and fertilizer inputs for agriculture. Low forests with high palm populations and minor areas of wet land savannas cover the poorly drained soils. It is evident that forest clearing in the past was indiscriminant; this cannot be condoned. The diversity of land conditions found throughout Rondônia would suggest that many past studies in the Amazon have simply been too broad to identify significant soil differences.

Opiniões divergentes são encontradas na literatura com respeito ao uso de terras da Amazônia para agricultura sustentável apos desmatamento. Este artigo busca clarificar a questão com um resumo dos resultados de um estudo dos recursos naturais (clima, atributos de solos e terrenos, e vegetação) do estado de Rondônia. O trabalho seguiu a metodologia do World Soils and Terrain Digital Database (SOTER) e foi financiado pelo banco mundial. Durante a fase de investigação no campo, concentrou-se no estudo de solos onde 2914 perfis de solos foram analisados. O estudo mostra que Rondônia tem um mosaico complexo de unidades de terra com diferenças claras em clima, terrenos, solos e vegetação nativa. Observa-se a combinação de florestas, que originalmente predominaram na região, com savanas naturais mal drenadas e outras savanas bem drenadas mas pobres em nutrientes. As florestas mais altas e vigorosas podem ou podiam ser encontradas crescendo em solos bem drenados derivados de materiais paternos ricos em minerais. Muitos desses solos podem ser, ou estão sendo, utilizados para agricultura produtiva. Solos derivados de materiais paternos pobres em nutrientes suportam bosques baixos e requerem grandes quantidades de cal e fertilizante para agricultura. Por outro lado, bosques baixos com altas populações de palmeiras e pequenas áreas de savanas úmidas cobrem solos mal drenados. É evidente que o desmatamento da floresta no passado foi indiscriminado e isto não pode ser justificado. A variabilidade de solos encontrados em Rondônia indica que os estudos de terrenos e solos realizados na Amazônia ate o momento têm sido muito gerais para que se possa detectar variações significativas nos solos.";"Cochrane, T.T.(University of Canterbury Department of Civil Engineering College of Engineering)

"AGRIS:US201400189805";"Energy intensity in livestock operations – Modeling of dairy farming systems in Germany";"";"The world’s population and food consumption are increasing drastically while natural resources are decreasing. In particular, energy use is an important component of reaching sustainability in agricultural production processes because of its shortage as resource, its influence on air pollution and its role in the economics of production. This study used system modeling to examine interactions between crop and livestock procedures and between levels of different input factors and their effects on yields in order to determine agricultural energy intensity. A method based on direct and indirect energy inputs within the livestock operation and plant production is used. A sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the influence of site conditions on the energy intensity of milk production and to highlight recommendations for management practices in livestock operations to reduce the energy use on dairy farms in Germany. An uncertainty analysis is used to evaluate the results of this study. Plant production, which consists of feed-supply and diet composition, constitutes the main influence on energy intensity in dairy farming. The energy intensity of feed-supply is strongly dependent on the quality of land and its management. An increasing use of concentrate in the dairy diet leads to a higher energy intensity for the process. Livestock operation accounts for one third of the energy intensity in milk production. The rearing period of a heifer at a dairy farm requires an energy input of 13–16GJ. The share of the energy intensity of the rearing period of the heifer per kg of milk changes, depending on the service life of the dairy cow. The service life of the cow increases, while the share of the energy intensity of the process section replacement decreases. Noting the influence of the energy intensity of machines and technical facilities in dairy farming is useful for overall energy use reduction. Here, also, the pasture is shown as a possibility for reducing the fossil energy input on-farm. The animal houses influence the energy intensity only marginally. Based on the sensitivity analysis of farm management and land quality, the energy intensity varies between 3.0 and 3.6MJkg⁻¹ energy corrected milk for an average milk yield of 8000kg ECM cow⁻¹ year⁻¹. Increasing milk yields lead to a reduction of the energy intensity per kg ECM. But this effect is reduced with rising milk yields because of higher energy inputs needed for the feed-supply, due to a higher share of concentrate and a typically higher replacement rate for the herd.";"Kraatz, Simone";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"farming systems;land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"DEU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400189805";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2012.03.007";"";"";"";"90-106"

Studies concerning changes in farmland use in mountainous areas are of considerable significance in China. Here, we analyzed marginalization characteristics of farmland in Renhuai city from 2005 to 2011 and driving factors using land information systems, surveys of farmer households and statistical data. Our results indicate that from 2005 to 2011, 3095.76 hm² of farmland was converted to forest land and natural reserve, accounting for 5.45% of the total farmland area. This suggests significant marginalization of farmland. Marginalization of farmland in mountainous areas was affected by topography, labor forces and effectiveness of land management. Farmland with a greater slope gradient was more likely to be abandoned; among marginalized land in Renhuai, a slope greater than 15° accounted for 62.26%. A high non-agricultural employment rate of rural labor force and annual income per capita of farmer households in mountainous areas were consistent with high speed farmland marginalization. Low land management benefits were the key reason for farmland marginalization. Although farmland marginalization was advantageous for eco-environment protection and sustainable development in mountainous areas, it resulted in inefficient land resource utilization. A win-win model for the exploitation and utilization of sloping farmland should be explored for production development and environmental protection.";"Yuluan, Zhao

Taking into account the essential significance of fluvial environments for the Amazonian biota, we propose that an enhanced understanding of the Amazonian riverscape will provide new insight for biogeographical studies in the region and contribute to the understanding of these megadiverse tropical lowlands. An area of 2.2 million km² covering the Western Amazonian lowlands of the Andean foreland region, i.e. the upper reaches of the Amazon river system. Areas in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil and Bolivia between longitudes 83 °W and 65 °W and latitudes 5 °N and 12 °S are included. A mosaic of 120 Landsat TM satellite images was created with 100-m resolution, and water areas of over 1 ha in size or c. 60 m in width were extracted using a simple ratio threshold applicable to a large set of data. With this method, 99.1% of the water areas present in 30-m imagery were mapped with images with 100-m resolution. Water pixels of distinct river segments were assigned to river classes on the basis of their channel properties, and islands and lakes were distinguished separately and classified. Measures of water patterns such as structure, composition, richness and remoteness were provided for various spatial units. Riverine corridors were computed from the open-water mask by outer limits of active channels and floodplain lakes. Analytical results are shown as both thematic maps and statistics. A total of 1.1% of Western Amazonia is covered by open-water bodies over 1 ha in size or 60 m in width. River-bound waters comprise 98% of the total water surface. Whilst isolated lakes are scarce, river-bound oxbow and backchannel lakes are plentiful, comprising 17.5% of all waters. They are particularly frequent along meandering channels, which dominate both in area and length. The riverine corridors including active channels and floodplain lakes cover 17% of the land area. The average distance from any point of land to the nearest water is 12 km. Geographically speaking, the distribution of waters is uneven across the region, and the detailed characteristics of the riverscape are geographically highly variable. Three major, fluvially distinct regions can be identified: central Western Amazonia, the south, and the north-east. The proportional surface areas of the riverine corridors, numbers of lakes, sizes of islands and their distributions depend largely on the types and sizes of the rivers. Our results support the notion of Western Amazonia as a dynamic, highly fluvial environment, highlighting and quantifying considerable internal variation within the region in terms of fluvial patterns and the processes that they reflect and control. Biogeographically, the variety of types of fluvial environments and their characteristics are important constituents of what influences the distribution of species and dynamics of terrestrial habitats. Spatially consistent riverscape data can serve as a consistent and scalable source of relevant information for other biogeographical approaches in the region.";"Toivonen, Tuuli

This study estimated the effect on US timber and primary forest product markets of hypothetical timber set-aside scenarios where US forest landowners would be paid to forego timber harvests for 100 years to increase carbon storage on US timberland. The scenarios featured payments to landowners of $0 (business-as-usual (BAU)), $10, and $15 per each additional metric ton (t) of carbon dioxide equivalent (COâe) sequestered on the set-aside timberlands, with maximum annual expenditures of $3 billion. For the set-aside scenarios, reduction in timberland available for harvest resulted in increased timber prices and changes in US domestic production, consumption, net export, and timber market welfare. Economic analyses indicated that the scenario with more area set aside and the largest carbon mitigation benefit (lower carbon price, $10/t COâe) would result in the largest decrease in market welfare, suggesting that climate change mitigation policies and programs would need to consider such impacts when evaluating the costs and benefits of climate change mitigation strategies in the forest sector.";"Nepal, Prakash

"AGRIS:US201600014067";"politics of water in rural China: a review of English-language scholarship";"";"Politics is about access and power, and access to freshwater resources in rural China is complicated and understudied. China's massive size and diverse climate make it hard to generalize about freshwater resources in rural areas of the country. On balance, China is not water-scarce, yet geographic and temporal variations in water availability are dramatic, with China's driest areas receiving far less precipitation than the wettest areas. Rural areas are the locus of competition among freshwater users including agriculture, power companies, industry, households and ecosystems. Additionally, while peasants may hold usage rights (not title) to farmland, it is not a given that they will hold rights to water that will guarantee the productivity of that farmland in areas where precipitation is low. Finally, water quality is, unfortunately, an increasingly important factor affecting the availability of ‘fresh’ water, as is evident in the notion of quality-induced scarcity (shuizhixing queshui). This contribution reviews a small but important body of scholarship on rural water politics in China, identifying existing themes and suggesting new directions where scholarship is currently lacking.";"Magee, Darrin";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"water rights;farmland;rural areas";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014067";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.860135";"";"";"";"1189-1208"

"AGRIS:US201400153253";"Afforestation with Norway spruce on a subalpine pasture alters carbon dynamics but only moderately affects soil carbon storage";"";"There is a strong trend toward reforestation of abandoned grasslands in alpine regions which may impact the carbon balance of alpine ecosystems. Here, we studied the effects of afforestation with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) on an extensively grazed subalpine pasture in Switzerland on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling and storage. Along a 120-year long chronosequence with spruce stands of 25, 30, 40, 45, and >120� years and adjacent pastures, we measured tree biomass, SOC stocks down to the bedrock, natural ¹³C abundances, and litter quality. To unravel controls on SOC cycling, we have monitored microclimatic conditions and quantified SOC decomposability under standardized conditions as well as soil respiration in situ. Stocks of SOC were only moderately affected by the afforestation: in the mineral soil, SOC stocks transiently decreased after tree establishment, reaching a minimum 40–45� years after afforestation (−25� %) and increased thereafter. Soils of the mature spruce forest stored the largest amount of SOC, 13� % more than the pasture soils, mainly due to the accumulation of an organic layer (23� t� C� ha⁻¹). By comparison, C accumulated in the tree biomass exceeded the SOC pool by a factor of three in the old forest. In contrast to the small impact on C storage, afforestation strongly influenced the composition and quality of the soil organic matter (SOM). With increasing stand age, δ¹³C values of the SOM became consistently more positive, which can be interpreted as a gradual replacement of grass- by spruce-derived C. Fine roots of spruce were enriched in ¹³C, in lignin and had a higher C/N ratio in comparison to grass roots. As a consequence, SOM quality as indicated by the lower fraction of readily decomposable (labile) SOM and higher C:N ratios declined after the land-use change. Furthermore, spruce plantation induced a less favorable microclimate for microbial activity with the average soil temperature during the growing season being 5� °C lower in the spruce stands than in the pasture. In situ soil respiration was approximately 50� % lower after the land use conversion, which we primarily attribute to the colder conditions and the lower SOM quality, but also to drier soils (−25� %) and to a decreased fine root biomass (−40� %). In summary, afforestation on subalpine pastures only moderately affected SOC storage as compared to the large C sink in tree biomass. In contrast, SOC cycling rates strongly decreased as a result of a less favorable microclimate for decomposition of SOM, a lower C input by roots, and a lower litter quality.";"Hiltbrunner, David

In this regard, support vector machines (SVMs) have recently received increasing attention. However, small number of training samples remains a bottleneck to design suitable supervised classifiers. On the other hand, adequate number of unlabeled data is available in remote sensing images which can be employed as additional source of information about margins. To fully leverage all of the precious unlabeled data, integration of filtering in a transductive SVM is proposed. Using two labeled image datasets of small size and two large unlabeled image datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is explored. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves average overall accuracies of around 4.5–7.8%, 0.8–2.6% and 0.9–2.2% more than the standard inductive SVM (ISVM), progressive transductive SVM (PTSVM) and low density separation (LDS) classifiers, respectively on larger domains in case of labeled datasets.

The research is based on data from 309 respondents to a mail survey of landowners in 32 southern Indiana counties. The research objectives were 1) to determine what factors influence policy preferences among family forest owners and 2) to make recommendations to policymakers regarding what policy approaches are best suited to differing landowner types. Regression analyses identify landowner attitudes as significant predictors of policy preferences and also identified both absentee and riparian forest owners as more supportive of private forest policies.

"AGRIS:US2016207298";"The Influence of Asset and Access Poverty on Crop Production and Land Degradation in Uganda";"";"This study investigated the linkages between poverty, agricultural productivity and land degradation in Uganda. Results show that farmers in the study region of Uganda deplete about 1.2% of the nutrient stock stored in the topsoil per year, leading to a predicted 0.2% annual reduction in crop productivity. Replacing the depleted nutrients using the cheapest inorganic fertilizers would cost about 20% of farm income on average. Land investments such as soil and water conservation structures and agroforestry trees were found to increase agricultural productivity and reduce land degradation. We observed an inverse farm size  crop productivity relationship. Larger families are more productive but use more erosive practices in crop production. Participation in agricultural extension, especially the new National Agricultural Advisory Services program, and access to credit and markets are associated with increased productivity but have insignificant impacts on land degradation. Education is associated with greater productivity, but also with more soil nutrient depletion. Access to roads is associated with less soil nutrient depletion. We find no significant differences in crop productivity associated with differences in land tenure systems, though land degradation is greater on mailo than freehold land. Our results show that promotion of agricultural modernization through technical assistance and credit programs, investments in infrastructure and education can improve agricultural productivity. However, they also show that many of these investments do not necessarily reduce land degradation, and some may contribute to it. Thus, investing in agricultural modernization should be complemented by greater efforts to address land  degradation.";"Nkonya, Ephraim M.

The area under study was the city of São Carlos, state of São Paulo, Brazil (urban and expansion area). The data presented here were obtained from earlier studies, photointerpretation and geological engineering mapping. The Envi 4.1 software package was used to prepare the digital orthophotos that served as a reference base for the information. Orthorectification of the Ikonos image (PSM, 1 m) was done and compared with other orthophotos from studies of environmental degradation in urban areas. The evolution of land degradation processes was analyzed based on the photointerpretation of aerial photographs taken on different dates and using Ikonos image. This study allowed to conclude that most of the degradation occurring in the city has been caused by unplanned land occupation, in disregard of environmental conditions, resulting in environmental degradation and thus impacting the quality of life of the urban population.";"Pons, Nívea Adriana Dias

"AGRIS:US2016200391";"A FÖLBÉRLETI DÍJ ÉS A FÖLD ÁRÁNAK ALAKULÁSA";"THE EVOLUTION OF LAND RENTAL FEES AND LAND PRICES";"A Gyöngyösi Kistérségben végzett felmérés tapasztalatai azt mutatták, hogy élénkült a kistérség földpiaca. A földbérleti díjak és árak egyaránt emelkedő tendenciát mutattak, szélsőséges ingadozások mellett. A vizsgált időszakban ér-tékesítettek termőföldet hektáronként 80 ezer forintért és 4,5 millió forintért is. Egyszerre van jelen a földtől való mindenáron való szabadulás és a vétel szándé-ka. A jövőre nézve a földár és a haszonbérleti díj növekedése várható, de ez az EU átlag alatt alakul hosszabb távon is. A föld birtoklása – helyzetétől függően – a jövőben kimagasló hozamot biztosíthat, és várhatóan meghaladja a lekötött bankbetétek hozamát, sőt esetenként extraprofit is elérhető. A termelőeszközök közül ma már csak a földingatlan és a munkaerő alulértékelt Magyarországon. Ezért – véleményünk szerint – a földingatlan kínálkozik utolsó befektetési lehetőségként extraprofit eléréséhez.    -  The evaluation conducted in the Gyöngyös small region shows that the small region’s land market is picking up. Land rental fees and land prices both show a rising tendency, coupled with extreme fluctuations. In the period under examination, agricultural land was sold for 80,000 forints per hectare, as well as for 4.5 million forints/ha. Both the desire to be rid of land and the intention to purchase exists simultaneously. In the future, both land prices and tenancy fees can be expected to rise, while remaining below the EU average even in the longer-term. Land ownership – depending on location – can guarantee high returns in the future, probably exceeding the returns on fixed bank deposits; in fact, in some cases it can produce extra profit. In Hungary, only land and labour are currently undervalued as tools of production. Therefore, in our opinion, land offers the final investment opportunity for achieving extra profit.It can be stated, based on the investigations conducted in the Gyöngyös small region, that the following have all played a part in the measured growth of land prices and rents: sector profitability; simultaneous supply and demand; fragmented estate structures; the high ratio of common tenancies; the ban on land purchase by capital rich foreign buyers and by national partnerships; significant land left fallow; the aims of land purchase and its later utilisation; advantageous locations; longer rental contracts; the appearance of regionally based government subsidies and their annual growth; the “life annuity for land” programme; and the land rental fee utilised by the National Land Fund (NFA).";"Marsalek, Sandor

Potential effects on streamflow due to climatic and land management changes were evaluated by comparing volumetric changes in the hydrologic budget before and after 1970. Increases in precipitation do not fully account for the increase in baseflow, which appears to be offset by a volumetric decrease in stormflow. This suggests that factors that influence the partitioning of precipitation into overland runoff or infiltration have changed. A transition from relatively more intensive to relatively less intensive agricultural land use is generally associated with higher infiltration rates, and likely influences partitioning of flow. Changes in agricultural land management practices in the Driftless Area, which began in the mid-1930s, do not coincide with the abrupt increase in baseflow around 1970. Instead, the timing of hydrologic change appears to coincide with changes in precipitation, whereas the magnitude of the change in baseflow and stormflow was likely amplified by changes in agricultural land management.";"Juckem, Paul F.

Statistical studies conducted between 2007 and 2011 show a significant variation in the groundwater depth in the Luoyang area. This depth variation clearly affected the groundwater environment in the soil system. This study uses field data to investigate the effects of water table fluctuation on the nitrate content of groundwater. Hydrogeological information and land management data are collected from five monitoring points in Luoyang. The significance of and correlation between the environmental indicators of groundwater depth and soil–water systems are then analyzed using SPSS and Origin software. The results show that the redox potential (E ₕ) and nitrate nitrogen content are strongly correlated with groundwater depth. Significantly negative correlations were found between nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen concentration, between E ₕand ammonium nitrogen concentration, and between pH and nitrate nitrogen concentration. These results indicate that water table fluctuation affects the soil–water physicochemical properties and further exerts a significant effect on nitrate movement across soil sola.";"Li, Xiang

"AGRIS:US201301816185";"How widespread is woody plant encroachment in temperate Australia? Changes in woody vegetation cover in lowland woodland and coastal ecosystems in Victoria from 1989 to 2005";"";"Encroachment or densification by woody plants affects natural ecosystems around the world. Many studies have reported encroachment in temperate Australia, particularly in coastal ecosystems and grassy woodlands. However, the degree to which published studies reflect broad-scale changes is unknown because most studies intentionally sampled areas with conspicuous densification. We aimed to estimate changes in woody vegetation cover within lowland grassy woodland and coastal ecosystems in Victoria from 1989 to 2005 to determine whether published reports of recent encroachment are representative of broad-scale ecosystem changes. All lowland grassy woodland and coastal ecosystems (c. 6.11 x 10⁵ ha) in Victoria, Australia. Four major ecosystems were analysed: Plains woodlands, Herb-rich woodlands, Riverine woodlands and Coastal vegetation. Changes in woody vegetation cover from 1989 to 2005 were assessed based on state-wide vegetation maps and Landsat analyses of woody vegetation cover conducted by the Australian Greenhouse Office's National Carbon Accounting System. The results show changes in woody cover within mapped patches of native vegetation, rather than changes in the extent of woody vegetation resulting from clearing and revegetation. When pooled across all ecosystems, woody vegetation increased by 18,730 ha from 1989 to 2005. Woody cover within Riverine woodlands and within Plains woodlands each increased by >7000 ha. At the patch scale, the mean percentage cover of woody vegetation in each polygon increased by >5% in all four ecosystems: Riverine woodlands (+9.2% on average), Herb-rich woodlands (+7.6%), Plains woodlands (+6.7%) and Coastal vegetation (+5.9%). Regression models relating degree of encroachment to geographic and climatic variables were extremely weak (r² [less-than or equal to] 0.026), indicating that most variation occurred at local scales rather than across broad geographic gradients. At the scale of observation, woody vegetation cover increased in all lowland woodland and coastal ecosystems over the 16-year period. Thus, published examples of encroachment in selected coastal and woodland patches do appear to reflect widespread increases in woody vegetation cover in these ecosystems. This densification appears to be associated with changes in land management rather than with post-fire vegetation recovery and is likely to be ongoing and long-lasting, with substantial implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services.";"Lunt, Ian D.

"AGRIS:US201600191195";"Mapping technological and biophysical capacities of watersheds to regulate floods";"";"Flood regulation is a widely valued and studied service provided by watersheds. Flood regulation benefits people directly by decreasing the socio-economic costs of flooding and indirectly by its positive impacts on cultural (e.g., fishing) and provisioning (e.g., water supply) ecosystem services. Like other regulating ecosystem services (e.g., pollination, water purification), flood regulation is often enhanced or replaced by technology, but the relative efficacy of natural versus technological features in controlling floods has scarcely been examined. In an effort to assess flood regulation capacity for selected urban watersheds in the southeastern United States, we: (1) used long-term flood records to assess relative influence of technological and biophysical indicators on flood magnitude and duration, (2) compared the widely used runoff curve number (RCN) approach for assessing the biophysical capacity to regulate floods to an alternative approach that acknowledges land cover and soil properties separately, and (3) mapped technological and biophysical flood regulation capacities based on indicator importance-values derived for flood magnitude and duration. We found that watersheds with high biophysical (via the alternative approach) and technological capacities lengthened the duration and lowered the peak of floods. We found the RCN approach yielded results opposite that expected, possibly because it confounds soil and land cover processes, particularly in urban landscapes, while our alternative approach coherently separates these processes. Mapping biophysical (via the alternative approach) and technological capacities revealed great differences among watersheds. Our study improves on previous mapping of flood regulation by (1) incorporating technological capacity, (2) providing high spatial resolution (i.e., 10-m pixel) maps of watershed capacities, and (3) deriving importance-values for selected landscape indicators. By accounting for technology that enhances or replaces natural flood regulation, our approach enables watershed managers to make more informed choices in their flood-control investments.";"MogollÃ³n, Beatriz

However, with regard to spatial patterns, little is known about (i) how they develop; (ii) how they are influenced by grazing; or (iii) the extent to which intraspecific interactions dictate them. We addressed these questions by quantifying changes in the spatial distribution of Prosopis velutina (mesquite) shrubs over 74 years on grazed and protected grasslands. Livestock are effective agents of mesquite dispersal and mesquite has lateral roots extending well beyond its canopy. We therefore hypothesized that mesquite distributions would be (a) random on grazed areas and clustered on protected areas; and (b) that clustered or random distributions at early stages of encroachment would give way to regular distributions as stands matured and density-dependent interactions intensified. Assessments in 1932, 1948 and 2006 supported the first hypothesis, but we found no support for the second. In fact, clustering intensified with time on the protected area and the pattern remained random on the grazed site. Although shrub density increased on both areas between 1932 and 2006, we saw no progression toward a regular distribution indicative of density-dependent interactions. We propose that processes related to seed dispersal, grass-shrub seedling interactions, and hydrological constraints on shrub size interact to determine vegetation structure in grassland-to-shrubland state changes with implications for ecosystem function and management.";"Browning, Dawn M.

Therefore, in order to provide guidelines for environmental management at the regional scale and thus reverse the trend in degradation, transformations of natural remnants into anthropogenic land uses must be identified and quantified. This study examines LULC transitions from 1987 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2009 in two adjacent watersheds located in the Espinal, one of the least protected ecoregions of Argentina. We detected a 20% loss in ecosystems for the period analyzed and, in particular, 60% of native forests were lost. Changes were mainly driven by the expansion of croplands, which directly transformed wetlands and also acted as an underlying cause of the displacement of ranching activities, which in turn replaced Espinal forests. We developed a conceptual model of observed LULC changes for the study area, which we then complemented by proposing an alternative scenario that reconciles agriculture and biodiversity conservation. These results have implications for provincial land use planning and could contribute to the participatory processes demanded by the recent national legislation sanctioned for the protection of native forests.";"Guida Johnson, Bárbara

The baseline scenario involved multiple cropping seasons and a combination of crops on 0.9 ha land-holdings, livestock husbandry, and exploitation of common property resources. With capital costs of Rs.128,180 (US$2293) and annual operating costs of Rs.37,290 (US$667), the net benefit generated (excluding depreciation) was Rs.70,250 (US$1257) annually. The pay-back period was 1.8 years, and the internal rate of return (IRR) was 53.7% over 10 years. Allocation of 20 days annually to fishing increased the net benefit to Rs.75,030 (US$1342) and IRR to 56.5% with minimal added costs and risks. Adopting the system of rice intensification (SRI) for paddy cultivation on 0.35 ha increased the IRR to 61.1%, while reducing agrochemical and inorganic fertilizer use. Including small-scale fish culture in a 0.1 ha pond integrated in the irrigation scheme for SRI cultivation resulted in an IRR of 77.3% and reduced the pay-back period to 1.3 years. Some risks to biodiversity are apparent with each scenario; however, with appropriate safeguards, sustainable agricultural intensification and livelihoods diversification could bolster agrobiodiversity and social-ecological resilience of highland communities, while alleviating pressure on biodiversity.";"Bunting, Stuart W.

"AGRIS:US2016208071";"PERCEPTIONS OF LEAFY SPURGE AND EVALUATION OF THE TEAM LEAFY SPURGE PROJECT BY PUBLIC LAND MANAGERS, LOCAL DECISION MAKERS, AND RANCH OPERATORS--SUMMARY";"";"Leafy spurge is an exotic, noxious, perennial weed which is widely established in the north central United States and is an especially serious problem in the northern Great Plains (Bangsund et al. 1999).  In 1997, the Agriculture Research Service and Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, initiated a major Integrated Pest Management (IPM) research and demonstration project to develop and demonstrate ecologically based IPM strategies that can produce effective, affordable leafy spurge control.  In 1998 and 1999, a survey of ranchers and public land managers was conducted to evaluate managerial, institutional, and social factors that might affect the rate and extent of implementation of various control strategies.  In 2001, a second survey of the same ranchers and public land managers was conducted to (1) assess any changes in land managers' perceptions of weed problems, control alternatives, and related issues, and (2) evaluate the impact of the TEAM Leafy Spurge project on the respondent's weed control practices.  The impacts of noxious weeds on grazing operations, specifically leafy spurge, are not abating, and ranchers seem more aware than ever of the severity of the problem.  A slightly larger percentage of respondents in 2001 view leafy spurge as a major problem and the most serious problem for grazing operations than in 1998 and 1999.  Heightened awareness among landowners may also be linked to TEAM Leafy Spurge's efforts to inform landowners of the problem and offer affordable, effective weed management techniques.  While the use of biological control methods, specifically flea beetles, has grown, herbicides continue to be the control practice of choice.  While slightly fewer respondents reported using herbicides in 2001 than in 1998 and 1999, the vast majority of landowners plan to continue to use herbicides.  Over 50 percent of respondents are using biological control, and over 76 percent of respondents indicated flea beetles were either somewhat or very effective in controlling leafy spurge.  Nearly half of the respondents had heard of TEAM Leafy Spurge, and all TEAM Leafy Spurge demonstration sites, events, and publications were favorably rated.  A large majority of the respondents agreed that the program had been effective in demonstrating and communicating leafy spurge treatment and control options.  Based on the results of the 2001 survey, it would appear that the program has indeed made progress in communicating the type of information landowners need to address what continues to be a significant issue for grazing operations in the Midwest.";"Leistritz, F.

"AGRIS:DJ2012085945";"'The Finn line' - a historical curiosity or a juridicial rality? The Sami reindeer herders' land rights in southern Sami areas evaluated from land consolidation practice (In Norwegian with Summary in English)";"";"Attitudes towards the land rights of Sami reindeer herders have changed considerably during the last 100 years. So, too, has consideration of how such rights should be treated by Land Consolidation Courts. This paper reviews changes in attitudes to the Sami land rights with respect to how these are considered in Land Consolidation Courts in southern Sami areas in Norway. The review also considers changing attitudes regarding the competence of Land Consolidation Courts to deal with such matters. There were several cases in the 20th Century in which Land Consolidation Courts treated Sami land rights in a restricted and unfortunate manner. Legal practice, however, was not always like that, evidenced by the so-called 'Finn line' (Norwegian: 'finnelinja' -'Finn' is an archaic name for Sami). This boundary was established during a land consolidation case in 1873 and was confirmed in 1883. At that time, Sami land rights were evidently accepted as appurtenant right in privately owned mountain pasture and the Sami were treated in the same way as others who enjoyed rights of usufruct on it. The regulation of 1883 included rules governing compensation for grazing damage on farming land. In particular, responsibility for grazing damage was divided between owners and the reindeer herders, providing these looked after their animals properly, 'The Finn line' subsequently achieved wider importance. The case of 18731883 has been referred to several times as a valuable and valid precedent for a way in which to organize grazing conflicts in other Sami areas. It was used in 1964 as evidence of the special rights of Sami reindeer people in the Brekken common land case. The Sami won this case in 1968 and, in its judgement, the Norwegian Supreme Court of Justice emphasised the importance of the line (Rt. 1968, p. 394). Although, owing to changes in land use practices, the 'Finn line' no longer has any practical significance, its juridical significance remains because it settles the principle that the rights of Sami reindeer herders' have to be considered in the same way as the rights of farming land owners. The ruling of 1873-1883 makes it clear that reindeer herders stand to gain important concessions, with respect to access to pasture, in land consolidation cases. The degradation of Sami land rights from the end of the 19th Century was a consequence of political manipulation and had no basis in law. Attitudes have now changed and, consequently, there is a need to revise recent legislation, such as the 1978 Reindeer Husbandry Act with regard to rules for compensation for grazing damage on farming land, and the 1979 Land Consolidation Act concerning rules of land use.";"Øyvind Ravna";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-04-19";"";"land consolidation";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012085945";"http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1736";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400155157";"Unsupervised and supervised classification of hyperspectral imaging data using projection pursuit and Markov random field segmentation";"";"This work presents a classification technique for hyperspectral image analysis when concurrent ground truth is either unavailable or available. The method adopts a principal component analysis (PCA)-based projection pursuit (PP) procedure with an entropy index for dimensionality reduction, followed by a Markov random field (MRF) model-based segmentation. An ordinal optimization approach to PP determines a set of ‘good enough projections’ with high probability, the best among which is chosen with the help of MRF model-based segmentation. When ground-truth is absent, the segmented output obtained is labelled with the desired number of classes so that it resembles the natural scene closely. When the land-cover classes are in detailed level, some special reflectance characteristics based on the classes of the study area are determined and incorporated in the segmentation stage. Segments are evaluated with training samples so as to yield a classified image with respect to the type of ground-truth data. Two illustrations are presented: (i) an AVIRIS-92AV3C image with concurrent ground truth – for both supervised and unsupervised cases and (ii) an EO-1 Hyperion sensor image with concurrent ground-truth at detailed level classes. Provided with the illustrations are comparisons of classification accuracies and computational times of other approaches with those of the proposed methodology. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides high classification accuracy and is not computationally intensive.";"Sarkar, A.

The experimental design had three different altitudes (0- 400 m, 400-800 m and over 800 m) and in two geographical sites (north and south) was determined according to sampling method with no plots. Thirty eight shrub species were found in 18 different research locations chosen on different altitudes and sites. The distribution of species showed a variation depending on the altitudes. Twenty species were identified between 0-400 meters, while 31 and 21 species were found between 400-800 m and 800+ meters, respectively. The distribution of species also showed a variation according to sites and the most kind of species had been found on north-facing slope.

The present study has been performed in the frame of the WAD (new World Atlas of Desertification) initiative. The objective of the paper is to test a structured procedure to identify relevant indicators for an effective representation of complex global LDD issues, based on available data sets (both geo-spatial and statistical), and conform to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) requirements. Available indicators and data sets were reviewed and the collected information was organized through a database (DB). The proposed selection procedure is semi-quantitative and based on expert ranking decisions made within the relational DB environment, which allows for transparent definition and iterative refinement of the selection rules. The procedure was operationally tested on a concrete case study (“deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa”) by using available global data sets. Questions related to global data availability and to major conceptual aspects such as the concept of “minimum indicator set”, the indicator frameworks, the ranking and selection criteria are raised and discussed.";"Zucca, C.

"AGRIS:US201400084797";"new approach to ecological land classification for the Canadian boreal forest that integrates disturbances";"";"Traditional approaches to ecological land classification (ELC) can be enhanced by integrating, a priori, data describing disturbances (natural and human), in addition to the usual vegetation, climate, and physical environment data. To develop this new ELC model, we studied an area of about 175,000� km² in the Abies balsamea–Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana-feathermoss bioclimatic domains of the boreal forest of Québec, in eastern Canada. Forest inventory plots and maps produced by the Ministère des Ressources naturelles du Québec from 1970 to 2000 were used to characterize 606 ecological districts (average area 200� km²) according to three vegetation themes (tree species, forest types, and potential vegetation-successional stages) and four sets of explanatory variables (climate, physical environment, natural and human disturbances). Redundancy, cluster (K-means) and variation partitioning analyses were used to delineate, describe, and compare homogeneous vegetation landscapes. The resulting ELC is hierarchical with three levels of observation. Among the 14 homogeneous landscapes composing the most detailed level, some are dominated by relatively young forests originating from fires dating back to the period centered on 1921. In others, forest stands are older (fires from the period centered on 1851), some are under the influence of insect outbreaks and fires (southern part), while the rest are strongly affected by human activities and Populus tremuloides expansion. For all the study area and for parts of it, partitioning reveals that natural disturbance is the dominant data set explaining spatial variation in vegetation. However, the combination of natural disturbances, climate, physical environment and human disturbances always explains a high proportion of variation. Our approach, called “ecological land classification of homogeneous vegetation landscapes”, is more comprehensive than previous ELCs in that it combines the concepts and goals of both landscape ecology and ecosystem-based management.";"Grondin, Pierre

"AGRIS:US201400084791";"Agricultural expansion: land use shell game in the U.S. Northern Plains";"";"Land area planted to row crops has expanded globally with increased demand for food and biofuels. Agricultural expansion in the Dakota Prairie Pothole Region (DPPR), USA affects a variety of agricultural and non-agricultural land-use types, including grasslands and wetlands that provide critical wildlife habitat and other ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to quantify recent changes in rural land cover/land use, analyze trends, and interpret results in relation to climate, agronomic practice, and ethanol production. The primary data sources were 1980–2012 statewide cropland data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the USDA Cropland Data Layer, produced annually for the DPPR from 2006 through 2012. Area planted to corn or soybean row crops increased, and small grain (e.g., wheat, barley) area decreased significantly over the analysis period. Corn and soybean expanded by 27� % in the DPPR between 2010 and 2012 alone, an areal increase (+15,400� km²) larger than the U.S. state of Connecticut. This expansion displaced primarily small grains and grassland (e.g., pastures, haylands, remnant prairies). Grassland regularly exchanged land with corn and soybean, small grains, and wetlands and water. Corn and soybean had high inter-annual self-replacement values (68–80� %), and continuous corn/soy row cropping was the second most common combination over a three-year period, ranking after continuous grassland. Small grain self-replacement values were only 22–35� %, indicating frequent relocation in the landscape. Temporary gains in wetland and grassland area were attributed to unusually wet climatic conditions and late snowfalls that prevented crop planting. Nearly all of the region’s ethanol refineries were located where corn and soybean crops constituted 50� % or more of the land area. Quantification of grassland losses in the U.S. Northern Plains requires evaluation of all land uses that interact with grasslands, and a longer term perspective that incorporates grassland as part of a normal land-use rotation.";"Johnston, Carol A.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400084791";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-013-9947-0";"";"";"";"81-95"

Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and additional formal survey studies on 315 households were conducted over three consecutive years (1998–2000) in the Sidama, Wolaita and Hadiya ethnic regions of southern Ethiopia to assess traditional cultivation methods, analyse the production systems, and evaluate farm-based enset biodiversity. The regions differ in terms of cultural background, resources, farming systems, population density, and agro-ecology. Furthermore, the methods for initiating suckers and the frequency of transplanting vary among the three regions. Diverse enset landraces were identified in the Sidama (52), Wolaita (55) and Hadiya (59) regions. Sidama farmers had the highest number of landraces per farm, 57% and 21% more than found on Wolaita and Hadiya farms respectively. In all three regions, landrace diversity was influenced by household resources, cultural background, population pressure, and agro-ecology. There were significant differences in the average number of enset landraces and livestock between rich and poor households in the three regions. Rich farmers had more land and manure-producing livestock, and they planted more enset landraces than did poor farmers. In all three regions, women proved to be more experienced than men in identifying enset landraces. The number of enset landraces per farm was significantly correlated with other household characteristics for resource-rich Sidama farmers and with the number of livestock and area of farmland for resource-rich Hadiya farmers. This suggests that middle-income or poor farmers concentrate on annual crops, rather than on growing the perennial enset plant. More research is needed to identify, characterize and conserve genetic diversity, and to improve the cultivation practices for enset. The cultural, socio-economic, and gender-associated aspects of enset cultivation need to be assessed to understand the dynamics of enset biodiversity.";"Tsegaye, A.

We derived LST data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images acquired from four different seasons. We used three LULC datasets: (1) 0.6� m resolution land cover data; (2) 30� m resolution land cover data (NLCD 2001); and (3) 30� m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data derived from the same ETM+ images (though from different bands) used for LST calculation. We developed ten models to evaluate effects of spatial and thematic resolution of LULC data on the observed relationships between LST and LULC variables for each season. We found that the directions of the effects of LULC variables on predicting LST were consistent across seasons, but the magnitude of effects, varied by season, providing the strongest predictive capacity during summer and the weakest during winter. Percent of imperviousness was the best predictor on LST with relatively consistent explanatory power across seasons, which alone explained approximately 50� % of the total variation in LST in winter, and up to 77.9� % for summer. Vegetation related variables, particularly tree canopy, were good predictor of LST during summer and fall. Vegetation, particularly tree canopy, can significantly reduce LST. The spatial resolution of LULC data appeared not to substantially affect relationships between LST and LULC variables. In contrast, increasing thematic resolution generally enhanced the explanatory power of LULC on LST, but not to a substantial degree.";"Zhou, Weiqi

Az emberiség egyre jobban ráébredt arra, hogy az erdő az emberiség létfeltételeinek elengedhetetlen része. Ebben nagy jelentősége volt a Római Club állásfoglalásának a növekedés határairól. A Stockholmban rendezett első környezetvédelmi világértekezlet, majd a Brundtland Bizottság közös jövőnkről készített jelentését követően az 1992. évi riói Föld csúcson fogadták el a fenntartható (tartamos) erdőgazdálkodás alapelveit (Forest Principles), miután nem sikerült egyetértést elérni az erdők védelméről szóló egyezmény elfogadását illetően! Előrelépést jelentett, hogy az ENSZ keretében megalakult az Erdőkkel Foglalkozó Kormányközi Testület, amely később ENSZ Fórumként foglalkozott a fenntartható erdőgazdálkodás témájával. A FAO 1985-ben hirdette meg először az erdők évét, majd az erdők, az erdőgazdálkodás fontossága miatt 2011-et ismét az erdők évének szentelte. A „Gazdálkodás” nemcsak az agrárszakemberek tájékozottsága, általános műveltsége miatt foglalkozik a témakörrel, hanem azért is, mert az erdők léte és „szolgáltatásai” szorosan összefüggenek az emberi lét minőségével, a természeti környezettel, az élővilággal, a mezőgazdálkodással.  ------------------------------------------ “A wraith walks in Europe and North America: the wraith of forest decline.” This dramatic sentence starts the chapter of the 1986 volume of World Resources on forests. This was a global cry of pain triggered by the extensive decline of forests which started in the seventies. It echoed the cry “Save the forests of the Earth – as long as it is not too late, as long as we have something to save and preserve!” International scientific forums and global social platforms addressed the issue of forests. It became ever clearer for humankind that forests are an essential part of what makes this world livable for us. This realisation was greatly urged by the position of the Club of Rome on the limits of growth. Following the first world meeting on the environment in Stockholm and then the report of the Brundtland Committee on our common future, the principles for sustainable forestry (the Forest Principles) were adopted at the Earth Summit held in Rio in 1992 – after no agreement could be reached on the adoption of a treaty on the protection of forests! It was a step forward when the UN Intergovernmental Body on Forests was created, which later addressed the issue of sustainable forestry as a UN Forum. FAO designated 1985 the ‘Year of Forests’ for the first time. The importance of forest and forestry has prompted it to designate 2011 a ‘Year of Forests’ again. “Gazdálkodás” addresses this field not only for the sake of providing general information and education to agricultural specialists but also because forests and the ‘services’ they provide are closely interrelated with the quality of human life, the natural environment, wildlife and agriculture.";"Solymos, Rezso";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-04-31";"hu";"";"";"";"150;021";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016202862";"http://purl.umn.edu/119895";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201300778816";"Can Basin Land Use Effects on Physical Characteristics of Streams Be Determined at Broad Geographic Scales";"";"The environmental setting (e.g., climate, topography, geology) and land use affect stream physical characteristics singly and cumulatively. At broad geographic scales, we determined the importance of environmental setting and land use in explaining variation in stream physical characteristics. We hypothesized that as the spatial scale decreased from national to regional, land use would explain more of the variation in stream physical characteristics because environmental settings become more homogeneous. At a national scale, stepwise linear regression indicated that environmental setting was more important in explaining variability in stream physical characteristics. Although statistically discernible, the amount of variation explained by land use was not remarkable due to low partial correlations. At level II ecoregion spatial scales (southeastern USA plains, central USA plains, and a combination of the western Cordillera and the western interior basins and ranges), environmental setting variables were again more important predictors of stream physical characteristics, however, as the spatial scale decreased from national to regional, the portion of variability in stream physical characteristics explained by basin land use increased. Development of stream habitat indicators of land use will depend upon an understanding of relations between stream physical characteristics and environmental factors at multiple spatial scales. Smaller spatial scales will be necessary to reduce the confounding effects of variable environmental settings before the effects of land use can be reliably assessed.";"Goldstein, Robert M.

Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to obtain and analyse different types of thematic information relating to urban growth and soil resources (soil class, land use capability, and physiographic classes). Map algebra techniques were employed to assess patterns of land occupation by urban growth and to compare maps of urban areas obtained from satellite imagery in 1978, 1992, 2001 and 2005 with thematic maps showing ancillary soil resources. Three different patterns of land occupation were identified in Elche: concentric growth outwards from the city of Elche (1978-1992), dispersed urban growth onto highly productive agricultural soils (1992- 2001), and coastal urbanization (2001-2005). Soils with high land capacity for agricultural use were the ones most severely affected by soil sealing as a result of urban growth. Land use planning should therefore adopt measures to minimize the impact of soil sealing in agricultural areas in orsure the complete environmental functionality of the soil and guarantee food production. Este trabajo analiza el crecimiento urbano durante tres décadas del municipio costero mediterráneo de Elche (Alicante, España), con la finalidad de evaluar el impacto sobre el recurso suelo que ha tenido el sellado del suelo por el crecimiento urbano. Para llevar a cabo el estudio se emplearon métodos combinando un sistema de información geográfica y teledetección para obtener y analizar diferentes fuentes de información temática relativa al crecimiento urbano y al recurso suelo, tales como: clase de suelo, capacidad de usos y clases fisiográficas. Se emplearon técnicas de álgebra de mapas para detectar patrones de ocupación del territorio por el crecimiento urbano, comparando mapas de zonas urbanas obtenidos a partir de imágenes de satélite para 1978, 1992, 2001 y 2005, respecto a mapas temáticos del recurso suelo disponibles. Se identificaron tres patrones diferentes de ocupación del territorio en el municipio de Elche: crecimiento concéntrico desde el núcleo original de la ciudad de Elche (1978-1992), dispersión urbana ocupando áreas de suelo agrícola altamente productivas (1992-2001) y urbanización de la franja litoral (2001-2005). Los suelos con alta capacidad de uso agrícola fueron los más severamente afectados por el sellado del suelo en el crecimiento de las zonas urbanas. Resulta necesario considerar en la planificación territorial medidas para minimizar el impacto del sellado del suelo en las zonas agrícolas con la finalidad de garantizar la funcionalidad ambiental del suelo y la producción de alimentos.

Foram identificados três padrões diferentes de ocupação do território no município de Elche: crescimento concêntrico do núcleo original da cidade de Elche (1978-1992), expansão urbana ocupando terrenos agrícolas altamente produtivos (1992-2001) e urbanização do litoral (2001-2005). Os solos com alta capacidade de uso agrícola foram os mais gravemente afectados pela impermeabilização do solo decorrente do crescimento das áreas urbanas.

At first, a landslide inventory map was prepared using aerial photographs, high resolution satellite images and field survey. A total 220 landslides were mapped and an inventory map was prepared. Then the landslide inventory was randomly split into a testing dataset 70% (153 landslides) and remaining 30% (67 landslides) data was used for validation purpose. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors such as slope, aspect, curvature, altitude, surface roughness, lithology, distance from faults, ndvi (normalized difference vegetation index), land cover, distance from drainage, distance from road, spi (stream power index), soil type, precipitation, were used as thematic layers in the analysis. The Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence model was applied to prepare the landslide susceptibility maps. The validation of the resultant susceptibility maps were performed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC). The validation results show that the area under the curve for the evidential belief function (the belief map) model is 0.82 (82%) with prediction accuracy 0.75 (75%). The results of this study indicated that the EBF model can be effectively used in preparation of landslide susceptibility maps.";"Althuwaynee, Omar F.

The visual interpretation of Landsat (1986, 1991, 1996 and 2001) and IRS-P6 (2005) was used to map land use/land cover and analyse urban sprawl. The saturation of urban areas within municipal limits, along with pressure from the growing population, resulted in the densification of the core urban areas within Dhanbad and Jamshedpur. Comparatively, Ranchi exhibited a very high rate of built-up growth with a reducing population density, indicating a low density of built-up development. The development of built-up land at the expense of agricultural land in Ranchi Urban Agglomeration indicates poor land-transformation practices. An area of 103.6 km² (165.66% growth) was transformed to built-up land in these cities during 1986–2005.

"AGRIS:US2016215256";"Measuring the Welfare Loss to Landowners of Future Geographic Shifts In the Suitable Habitat for Vegetation Due to Climate Change";"";"Scientists predict that global warming will cause suitable habitat ranges to shift for many plant species, including blue oak in California.  If proximity to particular land cover types significantly affects human welfare, any such shifts will affect household welfare, resulting in an indirect cost that is currently unaccounted for in the climate change literature.  Using a hedonic pricing model, the marginal values of blue oaks and the land cover types most likely to replace them are estimated at multiple spatial scales using single family residences sold in Kern County from 1997 to 2003.  In addition to the common identification problems of specification error and omitted variable bias, the variables measuring the degree of proximity of a property to land cover types are endogenous.  To identify the marginal values of land cover types at multiple spatial scales using two-stage least squares, instrumental variables are developed using soil data.  The results show that the value of blue oaks and other land cover types capitalize at different spatial scales, and these values differ at these various scales.  The overall welfare effect of a marginal loss of blue oaks depends on the spatial distribution of the surrounding population, its spatial relationship with respect to blue oaks, and the type of vegetation that replaces blue oaks.  With respect to the goal of maximizing social welfare, these results suggest that blue oaks should be preserved from agricultural and urban development in some, but not all, situations.";"Howard, Peter H.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-05-02";"en";"climate change;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016215256";"http://purl.umn.edu/103640";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500192552";"Space and time dynamics of urban water demand in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona";"";"Critical to effective urban climate adaptation is a clearer understanding of the sensitivities of resource demand to changing climatic conditions and land cover situations. We used Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) stochastic procedures to estimate temperature and precipitation at the very small scale of urban Census Block Groups (CBGs) in Phoenix, Arizona and Portland, Oregon, and then compared average household water use patterns by climate conditions and land cover characteristics between and within the two cities. Summer household water use was positively related to maximum temperatures and dense vegetation cover in terms of grass cover and trees and shrubs; it was negatively related to precipitation amounts in both cities. Water use was more sensitive to maximum temperature, precipitation levels, and vegetation cover in Phoenix than in Portland. There was substantial intra-city variation with greater sensitivity in urban water use associated with higher densities of trees and shrubs in both cities, but in Phoenix, the highest sensitivities to maximum temperatures occurred in CBGs with the most grass cover while in Portland, high sensitivity was associated with CBGs with the least grass cover. Many of the latter are in highly built-up downtown areas of Portland where artificial irrigation is required to maintain landscapes during the hot summer season. Take-home messages are: (1) BME space/time statistics provide efficient estimates of missing precipitation and temperature data to create continuous high resolution meteorological data that improve water demand analysis and (2) use of landscaping for urban climate adaptation will have differing impacts on water use, depending on local climate conditions, urban layout, and the type of vegetation cover.";"Lee, Seung-Jae

We used data collected during fall 2008 and 2009 by 16 WSR-88D radars in the northeastern U.S. to quantify the spatial distribution of landbirds during migratory stopover. We geo-referenced estimates based on radar reflectivity, of the density of migrants aloft at their abrupt evening exodus from daytime stopover sites, to the approximate locations from which they emerged. We classified bird stopover use by the magnitude and variation of radar reflectivity across nights; areas were considered âimportantâ stopover sites for conservation if bird density was consistently high. We developed statistical models that predict potentially important stopover sites across the region, based on land cover, ground elevation, and geographic location. Large areas of regionally important stopover sites were located along the coastlines of Long Island Sound, throughout the Delmarva Peninsula, in areas surrounding Baltimore and Washington, along the western edge of the Adirondack Mountains, and within the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia and West Virginia. Locally important stopover sites generally were associated with deciduous forests embedded within landscapes dominated by developed or agricultural lands, or near the shores of major water bodies. Preserving or enhancing patches of natural habitat, particularly deciduous forests, in developed or agricultural landscapes and along major coastlines could be a priority for conservation plans addressing the stopover requirements of migratory landbirds in the northeastern U.S. Our maps of important stopover sites can be used to focus conservation efforts and can serve as a sampling frame for fieldwork to validate radar observations or for ecological studies of landbirds on migratory stopover.";"Buler, Jeffrey J.

"AGRIS:US201400163609";"Can “fragile states” decide to reduce their deforestation? The inappropriate use of the theory of incentives with respect to the REDD mechanism";"";"The originality of the REDD proposal is its incentives-based mechanism designed to reward the governments of developing countries for their performance in reducing deforestation as measured against a baseline. This mechanism is founded on the hypothesis that developing countries ‘pay’ an opportunity cost to conserve their forests and would prefer other choices and convert their wooden lands to other uses. The basic idea is, therefore, to pay rents to these countries to compensate for the anticipated foregone revenues. The reference to the theory of incentives (in its principal–agent version) is implicit but clear. In this REDD-related framework, the Government is taken as any economic agent who behaves rationally i.e. taking decisions after comparing the relative prices associated to various alternatives, then deciding to take action and implementing effective measures to tackle deforestation and shift the nation-wide development path. Such an approach ignores the political economy of the state, especially when dealing with “fragile” or even “failing” states facing severe but chronicle institutional crises, which are often ruled by “governments with private agendas” fuelling corruption. Two assumptions underlying the REDD proposal are particularly critical: (i) the idea that the government of such a state is in a position to make a decision to shift its development pathway on the basis of a cost–benefit analysis that anticipates financial rewards, and (ii) the idea that, once such a decision has been made, the “fragile” state is capable, thanks to the financial rewards, to implement and enforce the appropriate policies and measures which could translate into deforestation reduction. The first sections of the article discuss the pertinence of applying such a REDD version of the theory of incentives to Governments, and particularly to Governments in fragile states, with respect to the historical patterns and the practical way those states work. The last sections discuss the possibility of alternative architecture for REDD, focusing on policies and measures targeting the drivers of deforestation, and investments for intensifying agriculture, reforming land tenure and enhancing the functioning of the judicial system. We will show why incentive mechanisms should be used at another scale, for the benefits of local economic agents (companies, rural households, communities, etc.), and how a scaling down is likely to alleviate some of the constraints faced by incentives when dealing at Government level.";"Karsenty, Alain

Bulgaria is particularly interesting because of theprominence of the co-ownership problem (about half of all land plots are co-owned),because of the strong fragmentation of land, and because of legislation providing aninstrument to separate out chosen (endogenous) versus forced (exogenous) forms of coownership.We find that land in co-ownership is much more likely to be used by lessefficient farm organizations or to be left abandoned, and that it leads to significantwelfare losses.";"Vranken, Liesbet

"AGRIS:US201400184072";"paradox of keystone species persecuted as pests: A call for the conservation of abundant small mammals in their native range";"";"Small mammals, such as European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) and prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), traditionally have been perceived as pests and targeted for control within their native ranges, where they perform essential ecosystem roles and are considered keystone species. These species can reach high densities, and have been subjected to eradication campaigns because of their putative negative impact on natural habitats and agriculture and their competition with livestock for forage. Eradication programmes have been a main factor causing sharp declines of these species in their natural ranges. Paradoxically, they are keystone species where they are abundant enough to be perceived as pests. The term “pest” is usually a social perception that is rarely supported by scientific data, whereas there is considerable scientific evidence of the key ecological roles played by these species. We call for the conservation of these species and present a conceptual model regarding the management of their populations. Where they occur at high numbers, and hence their effects on biodiversity are still of crucial importance, the persecution of these species should be avoided and their natural habitats preserved. In areas with high conservation value, but where these species occur at low densities, management efforts should aim to increase their density. In areas of high commercial value, managers ideally should consider changing prioritization of the area to high conservation value by purchasing the land or obtaining conservation easements. In situations with high commercial value and demonstrable low conservation concern, small mammals could be reduced humanely.";"Delibes-Mateos, Miguel

"AGRIS:US201300767640";"Potential and sustainability for carbon sequestration with improved soil management in agricultural soils of China";"";"Arable land soils generally have lower organic carbon (C) levels than soils under native vegetation; increasing the C stocks through improved management is suggested as an effective means to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. China's arable lands, accounting for 13% of the world's total, play an important role in soil C sequestration, but their potential to enhance C sequestration has not yet been quantitatively assessed. The C sequestration by agricultural soils is affected by many environmental factors (such as climate and soil conditions), biological processes (crop C fixation, decomposition and transformation), and crop and soil management (e.g. tillage and manure application). Estimation of the C sequestration potential requires the quantification of the combined effects of these factors and processes. In this study, we used a coupled remote sensing- and process-based ecosystem model to estimate the potential for C sequestration in agricultural soils of China and evaluated the sustainability of soil C uptake under different soil management options. The results show that practicing no-tillage on 50% of the arable lands and returning 50% of the crop residue to soils would lead to an annual soil C sequestration of 32.5 Tg C, which accounts for about 4% of China's current annual C emission. Soil C sequestration with improved soil management is highly time-dependent; the effect lasted for only 20-80 years. Generally, practicing no-tillage causes higher rate and longer sustainability of soil C sequestration than only increasing crop residue into soils. The potential for soil C sequestration varied greatly among different regions due to the differences in climate, soil conditions and crop productivity.";"Yan, H.

"AGRIS:US201400062000";"performance of nature reserves in capturing the biological diversity on Hainan Island, China";"";"Purpose The performance of nature reserves depends on the degree to which they represent a region's full biodiversity. Here, we conducted a study on Hainan Island, China, to assess how well Hainan's biodiversity features were captured by existing nature reserves. We also explored the driving forces behind the current protection pattern so as to provide guidelines for improving the island's conservation system. Methods We integrated the information on nature reserves, ecological variables, and human activities into a spatial database, then assessed the performance of nature reserves in representing natural variation, vegetation types, and species, and examined the impacts of human activities and land ownership on the current protection pattern. Results About 8.4% of Hainan Island was protected by nature reserves; the coverage was geographically biased toward its central mountainous areas with higher elevation, rugged terrain, and fertile soils. We found that 60% of the environmental units and 39.4% of the natural vegetation types had more than 10% of their area protected, respectively. Lowlands tended to have higher animal species richness, and the protection for endangered species was less efficient. Nature reserve coverage was negatively correlated with amount of converted habitats, human population density, and road density, and 82.4% of the total reserved area was allocated on state-owned land. Conclusions Nature reserve coverage was not enough to capture lowlands biodiversity features. The current protection pattern was significantly driven by several major conservation targets, human development, planning methods, and land ownership. To improve its conservation system, Hainan should enhance protection in the north and northeast plains and coastal regions, implement systematic planning approaches to define clear visions for guiding future conservation actions, and develop flexible management and funding mechanisms toward sustainable use of natural resources.";"Wu, Ruidong

In Uganda, improved germplasm from the cassava breeding program has generated new varieties that are increasingly being grown by farmers. Although considerable success has been achieved in adoption of these varieties in general, there is increasing pressure on breeding and technology dissemination programs to improve the targeting of their efforts. This paper identifies the specific cassava varieties adopted thus far and their desirable and undesirable attributes. In addition, it determines the adoption rates of these varieties and the factors that have influenced the speed of adoption of the most adopted variety. Results show that NASE 1, NASE 2, NASE 3, NASE 4, NASE 10 and NASE 12 are the varieties adopted so far. Farmers consider, inter alia, disease resistance, maturity period, taste and dry matter content in their decision to adopt new cassava varieties. From the Negative Binomial model, speed of adoption of NASE 3 was positively influenced by age of household head, household size and access to extension services. However, it was negatively influenced by number of hoes owned by a household. We conclude that there is need to continue breeding for adaptability to biotic stresses while improving on attributes that influence palatability and nutritive value of the crop. Strengthening the link between farmers and agricultural extension agents/service providers and improving the targeting of extension services will enhance the adoption of new cassava varieties.";"Abele, Steffen

"AGRIS:US201500183553";"GIS-based model to analyze the spatial and temporal development of oil palm land use in Kuala Langat district, Malaysia";"";"In Malaysia, areas under oil palm plantations have increased dramatically since the early twentieth century and have resulted in multiple conversions of land change. This paper presents a spatial and temporal model for simulation of oil palm expansion in the Kuala Langat district, Malaysia. The model is an integration of cellular automata (CA), multi-criteria evaluation (MCE), and Markov chain (MC) analysis while MCE provides transition rules of CA iterations and MC analysis assigns a transition probability to each single pixel at the time steps. Evaluation criteria consist of constraints and nine suitability factors indicating environmental and socio-economic issues of oil palm development. In the first simulation, changes of six land-cover classes were projected to the year 2008 based on transitions between 1997 and 2002. Two measures of quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement were adopted to validate model outcome. The simulation of land-cover change of the year 2020 was done based on the transition observed between 1997 and 2002 regarding the satisfactory agreement of the projection and the reference data at the first simulation. The results, based on five landscape metrics, indicated continuous spatial patterns of oil palm plantations but more fragmented spatial patterns of other land classes by the year 2020.";"Nourqolipour, Ramin

"AGRIS:LV2016024886";"Landscape economics: the road ahead";"";"The aims of this paper are to delineate some important topics in landscape economics, and also to put landscape policy in the perspective of the sustainable development. The research issue is about the relationships between the development paths and landscape changes, paved with examples of consensus, controversies, and conflicts. Landscape is a polysemic term, many approaches and definitions exist for it, and as a consequence, economists should adopt or elaborate their own landscape definition or concept (the most suitable to their general methodology, and related to their most familiar concepts). Landscape appears to be a local public good. That definition correspond to the property rights market failure arising from the co-visibility. Co-visibility makes it difficult in general to identify precisely the link between each owner action and the agregate landscape outcome. As a consequence, landscape ownership appears to be scattered into a multiplicity of actors of various nature (individual, communal, statal…). How to exploit that analogy with non point source pollution is a challenge for landscape economics research. Each actor has his own objective and management criteria, either for agricultural, forestry, industrial or residential activities. Moreover, there are multiple public policies aimed at sustaining each activity. Inevitably, public policies failures arise, and so the need for coordination actions aimed at landscape maintenance and preservation. Because the local public good nature of the landscape, it’s worth to look at the models of public good joint production. How to agregate actions from different land owners into a resulting landscape, or how to coordinate actions scattered among multiple landowners in order to get a specific desired outcome is a real challenge ? In some case, the responsability of changes is concentrated in the hand of few decision makers, in some others, the responsability is more diffuse, and the non point production function of the landscape could be approximated by an additive function. The issue of the agregation of actions is closely related to the one of preferences heterogeneity and agregation. Because a specific landscape project could be appreciated as beneficial or detrimental by different people, it’s necessary to separate the stage of evaluation, the stage of decision making and the stage of implementation. Issues of coordination of actions arising at the implementation stage should take for granted the landscape objectives and the social value of the project. Eventually, the design of Institutional arrangements to manage landscape should take onto account his nature of common pool resource. The paper is organized so as to take stock from the contributions of the research community in Landscape economics, and also to signal some missing links and promising paths. Naturally, our paper does not exhaust all the topics, we will concentrate on three topics : preferences definition and evaluation, joint production, and governance.";"Lifran, Robert";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Reports & Research";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=LV2016024886";"http://prodinra.inra.fr/record/35833";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500067148";"Performance of the SWEEP model affected by estimates of threshold friction velocity";"";"The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) is a process-based model and needs to be verified under a broad range of climates, soils, and land management practices. Occasional poor performance of the WEPS erosion submodel (Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program, or SWEEP) in simulating small amounts of erosion of loessial soils, which contribute to poor air quality in the Columbia Plateau region of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, has been partly attributed to overestimation of threshold friction velocity (u*t). Few studies have been conducted to improve the poor performance of the SWEEP in this region. Therefore, the objective of this study was to test the performance of the SWEEP in simulating the occurrence of erosion when the simulated u*t (SWEEP u*t) was replaced with measured values of u*t or with estimates of u*t derived from algorithms used in the Lu and Shao model, Shao model, Texas Tech Erosion Analysis Model (TEAM), and Wind Erosion on European Light Soils (WEELS) model. The occurrence of erosion from agricultural lands was better estimated by the SWEEP when SWEEP u*t was replaced with the u*t algorithm used in the Lu and Shao model. However, soil loss was better estimated by the SWEEP when using SWEEP u*t rather than the measured u*t or other u*t algorithms. Since prediction of both the occurrence and magnitude of wind erosion is important to overall model performance, there is a need to further improve the SWEEP in the Columbia Plateau and other regions where small amounts of erosion can impact soil resources and environmental quality.";"Pi, H.

Further, we are interested in whether political institutions moderate this relationship. We first offer a conceptualization of integrative nature conservation in forests and how to measure its implementation in law, ordinances and private agreements for a sample of European national and sub-national jurisdictions (Austria, Croatia, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Flanders, Baden-Württemberg and Piedmont). We subsequently try to assess the implementation of these rules and to relate them both to the structural characteristics of forestry and to an appraisal of pluralism in forest policy. Our qualitative analysis reveals that among the jurisdictions with a more centralized and corporatist forest policy, integrative nature conservation in forests tend to be less formally implemented the more corporatism dominates decision-making. It also confirms the expectation that among the more consensual jurisdictions with a strong forestry sector, rules tend to be less formally implemented. Further, the suspicion prevails that in the latter case, such rules are either complemented with exceptions for private forests or higher compensation. A more in-depth comparative examination is needed to further corroborate these findings.";"Schulz, Tobias

Post-Hurricane Mitch organizational practices and reconstruction policies in Northeastern Honduras afforded women access to joint property titles and participation. Yet the practices and processes through which women gained new rights reproduced certain exclusionary gender structures and created new barriers to women's participation. These contradictory consequences speak to recent feminist assessments of women's land rights under neo-liberal land titling programmes and a resurgence of policies addressing agrarian reform, and reveal the broader stakes of struggles for women's land rights. In so doing, they underline the importance of attending to spatial connections and historical articulations between the present and the past, and thus the past and the future.";"CASOLO, JENNIFER";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land reform;land rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"HND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301652742";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2009.00217.x";"";"";"";"392-420"
"AGRIS:US201301712385";"Structural Conservation Practices in US Wheat Production: A Cost-Function Technology Adoption Approach";"";"Based on 2004 CEAP-ARMS Phase II data, higher-sales farms not participating in a conservation programme adopted farmland conservation structures much more intensively on wheat fields than did any other farm-size type among conservation programme participants or non-participants. Survey results suggest that wheat farms not participating in a conservation programme more frequently adopted infield conservation structures, while conservation programme participants more often installed field perimeter conservation structures. Wheat producers, particularly those not participating in a conservation programme, recognize productivity and profitability benefits of infield structures as sufficient to promote their adoption without programme incentives. However, for field perimeter structures, programme incentives may be needed to encourage their adoption because benefits are more commonly off-site. To supplement univariate comparisons between conservation programme participants and non-participants, we used a cost-function based acreage allocation model to examine adoption of structural conservation practices, including such practices as strip cropping, terraces, grassed waterways, field borders, and stream-side herbaceous buffers. To accurately assess the potential environmental impacts of conservation programmes, it is important to account for the variability in on-site field, farm, and environmental conditions influencing producer adoption decisions. Econometric models suggest that not accounting for factors such as field, farm, operator, and environmental attributes will likely under- or overestimate adoption of conservation structures with respect to input and commodity prices, regardless of programme participation status.";"Schaible, Glenn D.

"AGRIS:US201500208688";"Response of evapotranspiration and water availability to changing climate and land cover on the Mongolian Plateau during the 21st century";"";"Adequate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial to assess how climate change and land cover change (LCC) interact with the hydrological cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. The Mongolian Plateau plays a unique role in the global climate system due to its ecological vulnerability, high sensitivity to climate change and disturbances, and limited water resources. Here, we used a version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model that has been modified to use Penman–Monteith (PM) based algorithms to calculate ET. Comparison of site-level ET estimates from the modified model with ET measured at eddy covariance (EC) sites showed better agreement than ET estimates from the MODIS ET product, which overestimates ET during the winter months. The modified model was then used to simulate ET during the 21st century under six climate change scenarios by excluding/including climate-induced LCC. We found that regional annual ET varies from 188 to 286mmyr⁻¹ across all scenarios, and that it increases between 0.11mmyr⁻² and 0.55mmyr⁻² during the 21st century. A spatial gradient of ET that increases from the southwest to the northeast is consistent in all scenarios. Regional ET in grasslands, boreal forests and semi-desert/deserts ranges from 242 to 374mmyr⁻¹, 213 to 278mmyr⁻¹ and 100 to 199mmyr⁻¹, respectively; and the degree of the ET increase follows the order of grassland, semi-desert/desert, and boreal forest. Across the plateau, climate-induced LCC does not lead to a substantial change (<5%) in ET relative to a static land cover, suggesting that climate change is more important than LCC in determining regional ET. Furthermore, the differences between precipitation and ET suggest that the available water for human use (water availability) on the plateau will not change significantly during the 21st century. However, more water is available and less area is threatened by water shortage in the Business-As-Usual emission scenarios relative to level-one stabilization emission scenarios.";"Liu, Yaling

While a lot has been done in terms of understanding the micro-determinants of farmers decisions in land and water conservation, there is little attempt to understand the broad macro-institutional and organizational issues that influence land and water management decisions. The objective of the study was to assess institutional arrangements and challenges for improved land and water management in the Ethiopian part of the Blue Nile Basin (Tana and Beles subbasins). Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were held in Amhara and Benishangul Gumuz regions with important stakeholders such as the bureaus of Agriculture and Rural Development, Water Resources Development, Environmental Protection and Land Use Administration (EPLUA), National Agricultural Research Systems, and important NGOs, operating in the area of land and water management, and selected community members. As the major findings in this study, we outlined major land and water-related institutional arrangements that are currently in place and their design features, in order to identify those institutions related to superior performance. We highlighted major institutional and policy gaps and actions that are required to respond to emerging issues of environmental degradation, upstream/downstream linkages and climate change. Such analysis of institutions and their design features provides useful insights and contributes to the debate on institutional reform for improved land and water management in the Blue Nile Basin, in general.

"AGRIS:US201400008757";"Demonstration of an integrated watershed assessment using a three-tiered assessment framework";"";"Watersheds are useful templates for wetland protection and land use planning because they integrate cumulative effects that better inform site-specific management decisions. The goal of this study was to demonstrate application of a three-tiered assessment paradigm in the San Gabriel watershed (Los Angeles County, California) that incorporates monitoring at varying spatial scales and intensities. Data on wetland extent and distribution, habitat condition using rapid assessment, and intensive site monitoring were used to show how different levels of assessment can be used together to provide a deeper contextual understanding of overall wetland condition. Wetland sites in the less developed portions of the watershed were of higher overall condition compared to sites located in the more urbanized portions of the watershed. GIS analysis revealed that percent impervious surface is a useful landscape-scale indicator of riverine wetland condition. Furthermore, rapid assessment metrics were significantly correlated with stressors found at sites. Significant correlations also existed between riverine habitat condition, water chemistry, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities across streams in this watershed. This study highlights the following key concepts: (1) application of a multiple indicator approach at different spatial scales and sampling intensities promotes a better understanding of the causal relationships between land use, wetland condition, and anthropogenic stress, (2) a multi-tiered monitoring approach can provide a cost-effective means of integrating wetland status and trends assessments into routine watershed monitoring programs, and (3) a three tiered approach to monitoring provides wetland managers with an effective organizational tool that can be used to prioritize management activities.";"Solek, Christopher W.

In this paper, land use and cover change (LUCC) in the Inner Mongolia grassland and the consequent change in net primary productivity (NPP) were studied by combining the land use data of the study area for 2001 and 2009 derived from the MODIS global land cover product and the CASA (Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach) model driven with MODIS-NDVI data. The results indicate that the area of Inner Mongolia grassland had a net increase of 77,993km² during the study period, which was mainly attributed to the conversion from desert and cropland. The total NPP of Inner Mongolia grassland increased by 29,432.71GgCyr⁻¹ during 2001–2009, of which the human activities and climate change were responsible for 80.23% and 19.77%, respectively. Land conversion and improved management increased grassland NPP directly, and the ecological restoration conducted by large-scale conservation programs could be the intrinsic driving force for this change.";"Mu, Shaojie

The Raccoon River watershed, which covers approximately 9400 km2 of prime agriculture land and represents a typical Midwestern corn-belt region in west-central Iowa, was found to have three stream segments impaired by nitrate-N. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to this watershed to facilitate the development of a TMDL. The modeling framework integrates SWAT with supporting software and databases on topography, land use and management, soil, and weather information. Annual and monthly simulated and measured streamflow and nitrate loads were strongly correlated. The watershed response was evaluated for a suite of watershed management scenarios where land use and management changes were made uniformly across the watershed. A scenario of changing the entire land to row crop resulted in an increased nitrate load of about 12% over the baseline condition at the watershed outlet. Results from the 15 nitrate load reduction strategies were found to reduce nitrate from <1% to about 85%, with the greatest potential reduction associated with changing the row crops to grassland. This research demonstrated the use of a modeling system to facilitate the analyses of TMDL implementation strategies, including the ability to target the most efficient allocation of alternative practices on a subwatershed basis.";"Jha, Manoj K.

Early maturing oat (79Ab382 (TX) (80SA95); 79CP84 (Coker SR. res) 80SA130; SRCP X 80Ab2806; C7512/SRCP X 80Ab 2252 and CO X SRCP X 80Ab2291) and common vetch (Acc. No. 2490; Acc.

Following forage harvest, chickpea and grass pea were planted on all plots and control fallow plot (farmers’ practice). A randomized complete block design with three replicates was used. Vigor (potential growth), plant height, herbage yield of forage crops, and grain yields of chickpea and grass pea varied across years. Higher average herbage yield (3.36 t ha –¹) was obtained from oat–common vetch mixtures compared to a fallow system (1.11 t ha –¹).

Dry sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition was modelled with the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange (FRAME) model using a roughness length value calculated specifically for birchwoods. Two scenarios were investigated for an acid-sensitive area in Scotland where broadleaf woodland expansion, mainly as birchwood, is occurring: (1) 2002 emissions and broadleaf woodland cover of 5.6%; (2) 2020 projected emissions and broadleaf cover of 29%. The roughness length calculated for birch with Raupach’s simplified drag-partition model was 0.73m, lower than the value of 1.0m for conifers which is the default for forest land cover in FRAME. Modelled dry S and N deposition increased between 2002 and 2020 from 8.7 to 29×10⁻³keqha⁻¹year⁻¹ of H⁺. However, modelled total dry and wet non-marine S and N deposition decreased during the same period from 1070 to 682×10⁻³keqha⁻¹year⁻¹ of H⁺ due to the lower projected emissions in 2020 and the dominance of wet deposition in the remote and upland study area (mean annual rainfall 2275mm). The modelled total non-marine S and N deposition was used to calculate streamwater critical loads exceedance with the First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) model for five catchments in the study area. The modelled deposition for both the 2002 and 2020 scenarios was less than the calculated streamwater critical loads so the catchments were not considered at risk of streamwater acidification under the projected future emissions and increased broadleaf woodland cover. Nevertheless, broadleaf expansion could pose a greater risk of acidification in acid-sensitive areas with lower rainfall, closer to pollutant sources, where dry deposition accounts for a higher proportion of total S and N deposition.";"Gagkas, Z.

Unfortunately, the analysis of changes in land-use carried out through the use of traditional data sources allows a relatively rough estimation of this phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a procedure quantifying over time the soil sealing rate at the country scale. Italy was chosen as the study area due to its spatially-complex urbanization patterns. The procedure was based on the visual interpretation of aerial photographs and high-resolution topographic maps taken at four points in time (1956, 1994, 1999, 2006) in a random sample of field plots homogeneously distributed across the country. Results indicate that soil sealing continuously increased in Italy over the investigated period with the highest absolute and per-capita growth rate of sealed areas being observed respectively in northern and southern Italy. Compared to past, per-capita soil sealing was higher in the most recent period (1999–2006).";"Munafò, Michele

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides.

"AGRIS:US201500125830";"Exercising multidisciplinary approach to assess interrelationship between energy use, carbon emission and land use change in a metropolitan city of Pakistan";"";"Population of two cities in Pakistan has already crossed the 10-million figure and for the rest of the areas in the country populations are also increasing rapidly. Urbanization has boosted the use of energy in the cities and so is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but the ground situation as to the extent, vulnerability, past trends and future scenarios are not unveiled for the cities of Pakistan. Dearth of data in Pakistan is a huge hindrance to the investigation of energy use and actual GHG emissions. We dared to take steps in addressing this case and put preliminary efforts in compiling baseline sectoral breakdown of energy use, carbon emission and land cover/land use. Furthermore, the relationship of CO₂ source and sink is also explored. This study mainly tries to achieve three objectives. The results illustrate that industrial and residential sectors are vibrant consumers of energy and CO₂ emitters among all other sectors of the city. Sparse trees in the city and reduced agriculture areas by more than one-half in 2009 compared with those in 1975 are the main reasons for increased energy use and reduced CO₂ emissions from agriculture sector as well. However, all the other sectors have increased their CO₂ emissions in an escalating trend. The forecast analysis portrays the same trend too. Therefore, there is a need to make policy makers recognize such vulnerable situation of energy use and GHG emissions for them to take proper and timely actions to cope with the threats of climate change which can occur anytime in the very near future.";"Ali, Ghaffar

A land cover and statistical data set, the Regional emission inventory in Asia (REAS), was also used in this study. The results show that the spatial variations of the CO₂ concentration in the whole of China are obvious, and with clear seasonal fluctuation during 2003–2005. The monthly averaged variability of CO₂ over China fluctuates, with the peak occurring in April to May and the trough occurring in August to October. The largest peak-to-trough amplitude was about 16 ppm in this period. The spatial and temporal variations of CO₂ had a strong correlation with anthropogenic CO₂ emissions and regional terrestrial ecosystem, as well as local meteorological conditions. This paper illustrates that satellite data are promising for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the variations of atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and of CO₂ emissions to the atmosphere.";"Wang, Ke

However, such analysis tends to overestimate the rate of change. Main error sources are the mis-registration between classified maps and their thematic accuracies. This study proposes a change detection method with morphological post-processing to improve change detection accuracy in comparison with traditional post-classification by taking into account these error sources. The method is developed for binary maps and is based on standard morphological procedures that are generally integrated in common spatial processing or free software. A detailed sensitivity analysis of this method based on simulated data sets of different landscape characteristics and error levels demonstrated the potential improvement. The degree of improvement in change detection accuracy mainly depended on the error type and level and the fragmentation of the landscape. In particular, location error effects on change detection were strongly reduced independent of class proportion. Up to 60% improvement in user's accuracy of change could be achieved for maps with location error and characterized by fragmented landscapes. Coping with classification errors was shown to be more challenging. A user-friendly reference table summarizes the potential improvement through the proposed methods for various landscape characteristics and error sources.";"Seebach, Lucia

It is clear that the magnitude of the reservation value has a fundamental bearing on the decision to develop or preserve land.  This notwithstanding, many papers that analyze land development in a dynamic and stochastic setting treat a landowners reservation value as an exogenous variable.  Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to endogenize the reservation value in the context of a model of land development over time and under uncertainty.  Our analysis shows that the optimal reservation value is the solution to a specific maximization problem.  In addition, we also show that there exist theoretical circumstances in which the optimal reservation value is unique.";"Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012208530";"http://purl.umn.edu/28340";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400147107";"Co‐benefits, trade‐offs, barriers and policies for greenhouse gas mitigation in the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector";"";"The agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for approximately 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management. Mitigation from the sector is thus extremely important in meeting emission reduction targets. The sector offers a variety of cost‐competitive mitigation options with most analyses indicating a decline in emissions largely due to decreasing deforestation rates. Sustainability criteria are needed to guide development and implementation of AFOLU mitigation measures with particular focus on multifunctional systems that allow the delivery of multiple services from land. It is striking that almost all of the positive and negative impacts, opportunities and barriers are context specific, precluding generic statements about which AFOLU mitigation measures have the greatest promise at a global scale. This finding underlines the importance of considering each mitigation strategy on a case‐by‐case basis, systemic effects when implementing mitigation options on the national scale, and suggests that policies need to be flexible enough to allow such assessments. National and international agricultural and forest (climate) policies have the potential to alter the opportunity costs of specific land uses in ways that increase opportunities or barriers for attaining climate change mitigation goals. Policies governing practices in agriculture and in forest conservation and management need to account for both effective mitigation and adaptation and can help to orient practices in agriculture and in forestry towards global sharing of innovative technologies for the efficient use of land resources. Different policy instruments, especially economic incentives and regulatory approaches, are currently being applied however, for its successful implementation it is critical to understand how land‐use decisions are made and how new social, political and economic forces in the future will influence this process.";"Bustamante, Mercedes

A water colour model has been developed using a combined Geographical Information System and Multicriteria Evaluation approach. The model was used to predict water colour production potential based on key land management practices controlling colour production in UK upland catchments. Calibration of the model with historic data collected at water treatment works treating water from upland areas showed that the model was potentially capable of accurately predicting water colour production potential at the catchment scale (c. 90%). Subsequent validation has shown this to be the case. Rotational heather burning and vegetation type (particularly heather) were identified as the two most statistically significant variables influencing water colour generation in the study catchments. It was predicted that colour is generated in particular hotspots and management to improve water quality should, therefore, focus on such areas. Blending of water is also an important process in controlling colour at the catchment scale and at water treatment works, with high colour often being diluted by runoff from land elsewhere in the catchment with lower potential to generate colour.";"Grayson, Richard

Historical land-change analysis reveals that proportional forest cover loss in the Worcester County study area exceeds that of the state by 0.26% per year, 67% of which was driven by the expansion of low-density residential land use. Between 2008 and 2010, 2% of Worcester County’s tree canopy was lost to high- and low-density urban development (47% of the total loss), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) tree removal for Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) eradication (25%), timber harvest (15%) and ice storm damage (6%).

This paper investigates the impacts of increase or decrease in plantations and climate variability on streamflow using two approaches: the sensitivity-based approach (including a non-parametric model and six Budyko framework based models) and the hydrological modelling approach (using Xinanjiang and SIMHYD models) for three medium sized catchments in Australia. The results from the nine methods show that both plantation expansion/reduction and climatic differences can have major effects on catchment streamflow. There is a small variability in the reduction or increase in streamflow estimated by the nine methods. The results from this study show that the estimates of plantation impacts from the dynamic hydrological models are similar to those from the commonly used sensitivity-based approaches. The sensitivity-based approaches are only applicable where long term datasets are available and they only provide results at a mean annual time scale. The hydrological models simulate plantation impacted streamflow time series and so they can be used to estimate the relative contributions of land cover changes and climate change/variability at a daily, monthly or annual time-step. The outputs from the hydrological models can also be used to investigate the impacts of plantation expansion or reduction and climate change/variability on different runoff characteristics.";"Li, Huiyun

The status and trends of forest-associated species is one indicator of SFM, though it is under utilized due to challenges with indicator selection and data availability. This paper demonstrates and tests an indicator selection methodology which combines Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data and LandSat land cover data to identify indicator guilds, or groups of indicator species, for a series of forest composition and configuration attributes in the Great Lakes St. Lawrence forest region. Guild performance is tested at independent sites within the region and compared with that of guilds assembled using known species’ habitat preferences, and abundance trends are reported for two periods: 1990–2007 and 1967–2007. Guilds assembled using the method proposed here describe more variation in forest composition (r-sq(adj): 41–76) than those assembled using known habitat preferences alone (r-sq(adj): 17–58). Forest configuration guilds, which were not compared with existing guilds, also describe a large proportion of variation in configuration attributes (r-sq(adj): 47–76). Guild abundance remained stable over the long and short term for most guilds with the exception of the wetland guild, which increased moderately over the long-term, and the deciduous guild which increased moderately over the short-term. Despite challenges associated with the use of bird guilds as indicators of forest composition and configuration, results presented here suggest that indicator guilds may provide useful information regarding the status and trends of regional scale forest composition and configuration attributes.";"Hart, Mark

Traditional methods rarely quantify the history of such disturbances along a continuous temporal trajectory; yet, such disturbance history often determines system course and evolution. We adopted a retrospective perspective to study system history by implementing a newly proposed entropy index. The forest dynamics in the Amazon region, expressed by a time-series vegetation index, were taken as an example to demonstrate the application of such an entropy index. The results indicated that high entropy values were mainly distributed around the major cities with intensive land conversion rates, as well as the riverine areas with unsteady physiological and/or phenological fluctuations. Utilization of this index can measure forest dynamics in a retrospective way with accumulated information and therefore can provide a solid basis of information for current research and planning, such as for forest conservation and land-use plans.";"Sun, Jing

Remote sensing data provide a unique opportunity for gathering information on the spatial and temporal variability of restoration processes and may contribute to fill this knowledge gap. The aim of this study is to compare different management actions undertaken in Mediterranean degraded rangelands (i.e. dense pine plantations, thinned pine plantations, protection and passive management) by analysing landscape composition and pattern change assessed from object‐based classification of aerial photograph of 1954, 1977 and 2006. Results show a clear link between landscape composition and structure and the different restoration actions, allowing comparison between their spatial and temporal dynamics. All restoration actions promoted an increase in woody vegetation cover compared with non‐restored areas. However, only protection and passive management favoured the restoration of dense, complex and well‐connected patches of native Mediterranean maquis. The proposed methodology is discussed with respect to its applicability for future Mediterranean landscape restoration planning in a wider geographic and ecological perspective.

Village bylaws devised by communities govern the management of exclosures. We analysed the effectiveness of village bylaws that are used to manage exclosures in addressing forest degradation, resolving conflicts among users over natural resource use, and meeting high expectations of users to realise economic benefits from exclosures through enhancing revenue from sale of grass and dry wood. We collected data using qualitative methods during July and November 2008 in two villages of Tigray. The village bylaws mitigated forest degradation by facilitating users to have common goals in the management of exclosures, and resolved conflicts among users by using monetary sanctions including penalties. The village bylaws were not effective in meeting the high expectations of users to realise economic benefits from exclosures. In some cases, the enforcement of village bylaws was constrained by high social capital, which resulted in the negligence among users in exposing free riders. This indicates that high social capital does not always enhance communal resource management. Moreover, recurrent drought, shortage of fuel wood, and the growing number of landless youths in both villages constrained the effectiveness of village bylaws and further expansion of exclosures. Village committees should focus on addressing the low level of rule enforcement and minimise negligence among users of exclosures through developing a sense of responsibility among users rather than focusing on penalties.";"Yami, Mastewal

"AGRIS:US201600132521";"After All, Land Belongs to the State: Examining the Benefits of Land Registration for Smallholders in Ethiopia";"";"The role of land registration in reducing rural poverty has been debated for several decades. This article analyses the impacts of land registration on land rentals, security of land tenure, disputes over land, use of credit facilities from formal financial institutions and gender access and control over land. Our findings are based on data collected between April and December 2011 in irrigation systems in three regional states of Ethiopia using in‐depth interviews and field surveys. Land registration has a positive influence on land rentals by reducing the fear of landholders in losing land to renters. Important benefits of land registration also include enhancing tenure security through ensuring usufruct rights over land and addressing the conflicts that arise from the competition to access irrigable land. Joint land titling secures women's access to land and encourages women's decision‐making on land rentals, input use, cropping patterns and the marketing of harvest from irrigable plots. While land registration allows for improved tenure security, gender equity and reduced disputes over land, it does little to facilitate access to credit or increase the use of farm inputs. The findings suggest that more work needs to be carried out to translate the benefits of land registration into improved livelihoods by increasing investment in farm inputs, production of high value, off‐season crops and increase market participation.

This study researches on variations of streamflow, sediment load, and flow–sediment relationship on multi‐temporal scales (annual, flood season and, monthly scales) in a highly erodible catchment of Chinese Loess Plateau. The results demonstrated that the streamflow, sediment load, sediment concentration, runoff coefficient, and sediment coefficient all experienced evident reductions, and the decrease in the middle and downstream stations was more significant compared with the upstream stations. The land use changes and implementation of soil and water conservation measures played major role for the streamflow and sediment load reductions with respect to precipitation change, and the runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient linearly decreased with the percentage of conservation measure area. The runoff‐sediment yield relationship on annual, flood season, and monthly scales could be generally characterized by the linear function, and the slopes during the post‐change period was lower than those during the pre‐change period of sediment load. The sediment concentration–streamflow discharge relationship represented consistent form over the entire study period, and the logarithmic function was appropriate to describe the relationships on the three timescales. The decrease of sediment concentration contributed greatest (60·7%) to sediment reduction compared with runoff productivity of rainfall (30·2%) and precipitation (9·1%).

For north temperate lakes, the well-studied empirical relationship between phosphorus (as measured by total phosphorus, TP), the most commonly limiting nutrient and algal biomass (as measured by chlorophyll a, CHL) has been found to vary across a wide range of landscape settings. Variation in the parameters of these TP-CHL regressions has been attributed to such lake variables as nitrogen/phosphorus ratios, organic carbon and alkalinity, all of which are strongly related to catchment characteristics (e.g. natural land cover and human land use). Although this suggests that landscape setting can help to explain much of the variation in ecoregional TP-CHL regression parameters, few studies have attempted to quantify relationships at an ecoregional spatial scale. 2. We tested the hypothesis that lake algal biomass and its predicted response to changes in phosphorus are related to both local-scale features (e.g. lake and catchment) and ecoregional-scale features, all of which affect the availability and transport of covarying solutes such as nitrogen, organic carbon and alkalinity. Specifically, we expected that land use and cover, acting at both local and ecoregional scales, would partially explain the spatial pattern in parameters of the TP-CHL regression. 3. We used a multilevel modelling framework and data from 2105 inland lakes spanning 35 ecoregions in six US states to test our hypothesis and identify specific local and ecoregional features that explain spatial heterogeneity in TP-CHL relationships. We include variables such as lake depth, natural land cover (for instance, wetland cover in the catchment of lakes and in the ecoregions) and human land use (for instance, agricultural land use in the catchment of lakes and in the ecoregions). 4. There was substantial heterogeneity in TP-CHL relationships across the 35 ecoregions. At the local scale, CHL was negatively and positively related to lake mean depth and percentage of wooded wetlands in the catchment, respectively. At the ecoregional scale, the slope parameter was positively related to the percentage of pasture in an ecoregion, indicating that CHL tends to respond more rapidly to changes in TP where there are high levels of agricultural pasture than where there is little. The intercept (i.e. the ecoregion-average CHL) was negatively related to the percentage of wooded wetlands in the ecoregion. 5. By explicitly accounting for the hierarchical nature of lake-landscape interactions, we quantified the effects of landscape characteristics on the response of CHL to TP at two spatial scales. We provide new insight into ecoregional drivers of the rate at which algal biomass responds to changes in nutrient concentrations. Our results also indicate that the direction and magnitude of the effects of certain land use and cover characteristics on lake nutrient dynamics may be scale dependent and thus likely to represent different underlying mechanisms regulating lake productivity.";"WAGNER, TYLER

We analyzed extensive field data collected by the U.S. Forest Service covering 12 states to identify potential determinants of invasion and to predict likelihood of further invasion under a variety of possible management strategies. Results of multiple logistic regression, which classified 75% of the field plots correctly with regard to species presence and absence, indicated probability of invasion is correlated positively with elevation, adjacency (within 300 m) to waterbodies, mean extreme maximum temperature, site productivity, species diversity, natural regeneration, wind disturbance, animal disturbance, and private land ownership and is correlated negatively with slope, stand age, site preparation, artificial regeneration, distance to the nearest road, fire disturbance, and public land ownership. Habitats most at risk to further invasion (likelihood of invasion > 10%) under current conditions occur throughout Mississippi, with a band stretching eastward across south-central Alabama, and in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Invasion likelihoods could be reduced most by conversion to public land ownership, followed by site preparation, fire disturbance, artificial regeneration, and elimination of animal disturbance. While conversion of land ownership may be neither feasible nor desirable, this result emphasizes the opportunity for reducing the likelihood of invasions on private lands via increased use of selected management practices.Nomenclature: Chinese privet, Ligustrum sinense Lour, European privet, Ligustrum vulgare L.Management Implications: Biotic invasions have affected ecosystems worldwide. One of the greatest current challenges facing forest ecosystem management in the southern United States is the control of range expansions by invasive plant species. To move beyond reactive control efforts toward more proactive management requires prediction of potential ranges of invasive species on spatial scales relevant to forest managers. We drew upon extensive geo-referenced datasets on nonnative invasive plants maintained by the U.S. Forest Service to develop an invasion distribution model predicting possible range expansion of Chinese and European privets in forestlands of the southern United States. By identifying determinants of invasion and potential habitat, our analyses should assist land managers and restoration practitioners in planning proactive management strategies and control treatments.";"Wang, Hsiao-Hsuan

"AGRIS:US2016210061";"The Valuation of Agricultural Land and the Influence of Government Payments";"";"This study gives an overview of the theoretical foundations, empirical procedures and derived results of the literature identifying determinants of land prices. Special attention is given to the effects of different government support policies on land prices. Since almost all empirical studies on the determination of land prices refer either to the net present value method or the hedonic pricing approach as a theoretical basis, a short review of these models is provided. While the two approaches have different theoretical bases, their empirical implementation converges. Empirical studies use a broad range of variables to explain land values and we systematise those into six categories. In order to investigate the influence of different measures of government support on land prices, a meta-regression analysis is carried out. Our results reveal a significantly higher rate of capitalisation for decoupled direct payments and a significantly lower rate of capitalisation for agri-environmental payments, as compared to the rest of government support. Furthermore, the results show that taking theoretically consistent land rents (returns to land) and including non-agricultural variables like urban pressure in the regression implies lower elasticities of capitalisation. In addition, we find a significant influence of the land type, the data type and estimation techniques on the capitalisation rate.

"AGRIS:US201400165353";"Evidence for increased monoculture cropping in the Central United States";"";"While crop rotation patterns can be complex with multiple crops rotated over several years, the most common rotation practice in the Central United States is biannual rotation between corn and soybeans. We analyzed the changes in crop rotation patterns from 2003 to 2010 using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), which provides remotely sensed land cover layers for agricultural crops in the Central United States. The accuracy of the CDL was validated by comparing the total acreage for a state or county present in the CDL with the total planted crop acreage available from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The data layers were combined into two time periods 2003–2006 and 2007–2010, and specific rotation patterns were determined for every location in the study area. The combinations resulted in unique sequences such as single, double, triple and quadruple, the latter of which is equivalent to the same crop class present all four years at a particular location. Corn and soybeans were analyzed to determine the amount of area used for production as well as the amount of change between unique crop rotation sequences. While the total area under production of major crops in the second half of our study period increased only slightly, the extent to which major crops (e.g., corn and soybeans) were grown in continuous cropping sequences increased significantly. For example, the amount of land impacted by corn in the first time period increased by only 2% in the second time period. However, the amount of corn grown in quadruple sequence doubled from the first half to the second half of our study period. We conclude that, although crop rotation patterns are very complex in this region, involving considerable amount of non-cropland, the footprint of major crops such as corn have moved toward monoculture cropping practices in the last decade.";"Plourde, James D.

"AGRIS:US201600126115";"Correlation between landscape fragmentation and sandy desertification: a case study in Horqin Sandy Land, China";"";"The exact roles of landscape fragmentation on sandy desertification are still not fully understood, especially with the impact of different land use types in spatial dimension. Taking patch size and shape into consideration, this paper selected the Ratio of Patch Size and the Fractal Dimension Index to establish a model that reveals the association between the area of bare sand land and the fragmentation of different land use types adjacent to bare sand land. Results indicated that (1) grass land and arable land contributed the most to landscape fragmentation processes in the regions adjacent to bare sand land during the period 1980 to 2010. Grass land occupied 54 % of the region adjacent to bare sand land in 1980. The Ratio of Patch Size of grass land decreased from 1980 to 2000 and increased after 2000. The Fractal Dimension Index of grass increased during the period 1980 to 1990 and decreased after 1990. Arable land expanded significantly during this period. The Ratio of Patch Size of arable land increased from 1980 to 1990 and decreased since 1990. The Fractal Dimension Index of arable land increased from 1990 to 2000 and decreased after 2000. (2) The Ratio of Patch Size and the Fractal Dimension Index were significantly related to the area of bare sand land. The role of landscape fragmentation was not linear to sandy desertification. There were both positive and negative effects of landscape fragmentation on sandy desertification. In 1980, the Ratio of Patch Size and the Fractal Dimension Index were negatively related to the area of bare sand land, showing that the landscape fragmentation and regularity of patches contributed to the expansion of sandy desertification. In 1990, 2000, and 2010, the Ratio of Patch Size and the Fractal Dimension Index were mostly positively related to the area of bare sand land, showing the landscape fragmentation and regularity of patches contributed to the reversion of sandy desertification in this phase. The absolute values of the coefficients were the highest for grass land in the regression models, so that grass land had the most important influence on sandy desertification.";"Ge, Xiaodong

Black and white aerial photographs of 1957 and Landsat imageries of 1972 (MSS), 1986 (TM), 1994 (TM) and 2009 (TM) were used to derive ten land use and land cover classes by integrated use of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). Post-classification change detection analysis based on enhanced transition matrix was applied to detect the changes and identify systematic transitions. The results showed that 46% of the study area experienced a transition over the past 52 years, out of which 20% was due to a net change while 26% was attributable to swap change (i.e. simultaneous gain and loss of a given category during a certain period). The most systematic transitions are conversion of grassland to cultivated land (14.8%) followed by the degradation of natural woody vegetation and marshland to grassland (3.9%). Spatially explicit logistic regression modeling revealed that the location of these systematic transitions can be explained by a combination of accessibility, biophysical and demographic factors. The modeling approach allowed improved understanding of the processes of LULCC and for identifying explanatory factors for further in-depth analysis as well as for practical interventions for watershed planning and management.";"Teferi, Ermias

"AGRIS:US201400192646";"From climate-smart agriculture to climate-smart landscapes";"";"BACKGROUND: For agricultural systems to achieve climate-smart objectives, including improved food security and rural livelihoods as well as climate change adaptation and mitigation, they often need to be take a landscape approach; they must become ‘climate-smart landscapes’. Climate-smart landscapes operate on the principles of integrated landscape management, while explicitly incorporating adaptation and mitigation into their management objectives. RESULTS: An assessment of climate change dynamics related to agriculture suggests that three key features characterize a climate-smart landscape: climate-smart practices at the field and farm scale; diversity of land use across the landscape to provide resilience; and management of land use interactions at landscape scale to achieve social, economic and ecological impacts. To implement climate-smart agricultural landscapes with these features (that is, to successfully promote and sustain them over time, in the context of dynamic economic, social, ecological and climate conditions) requires several institutional mechanisms: multi-stakeholder planning, supportive landscape governance and resource tenure, spatially-targeted investment in the landscape that supports climate-smart objectives, and tracking change to determine if social and climate goals are being met at different scales. Examples of climate-smart landscape initiatives in Madagascar’s Highlands, the African Sahel and Australian Wet Tropics illustrate the application of these elements in contrasting contexts. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve climate-smart landscape initiatives widely and at scale will require strengthened technical capacities, institutions and political support for multi-stakeholder planning, governance, spatial targeting of investments and multi-objective impact monitoring.";"Scherr, Sara J

"AGRIS:US201301722383";"Combining LiDAR and IKONOS Data for Eco-Hydrological Classification of an Ombrotrophic Peatland";"";"Remote sensing techniques have potential for peatland monitoring, but most previous work has focused on spectral approaches that often result in poor discrimination of cover types and neglect structural information. Peatlands contain structural ""microtopes"" (e.g., hummocks and hollows) which are linked to hydrology, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and information on surface structure is thus a useful proxy for peatland condition. The objective of this work was to develop and test a new eco-hydrological mapping technique for ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands using a combined spectral-structural remote sensing approach. The study site was Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. Airborne light dectection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used with IKONOS data in a combined multispectral-structural approach for mapping peatland condition classes. LiDAR data were preprocessed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semi-variogram analysis) were extracted. These were assimilated alongside IKONOS data into a maximum likelihood classification procedure, and thematic outputs were compared. Ecological survey data were used to validate the results. Considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland classes were achieved when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semi-variance were included. Specifically, the classification accuracy improved from 71.8% (IKONOS data only) to 88.0% when a LiDAR semi-variance product was used. Of note was the improved delineation of management classes (including Eriophorum bog, active raised bog and degraded raised bog). The application of a combined textural-optical approach can improve land cover mapping in areas where reliance on purely spectral discrimination approaches would otherwise result in considerable thematic uncertainty.";"Anderson, K.

"AGRIS:US201301726407";"Woody Encroachment Removal from Midwestern Oak Savannas Alters Understory Diversity across Space and Time";"";"Recovering biodiversity is a common goal during restoration; however, for many ecosystems, it is not well understood how restoration influences species diversity across space and time. I examined understory species diversity and composition after woody encroachment removal in a large-scale savanna restoration experiment in central Iowa, United States. Over a 4-year time series, restoration had profound effects across space and time, increasing richness at local and site-level scales. Restoration sites had increased α (within sample) Simpson's diversity and α and γ (site level) species richness relative to control sites, although γ and β (among sample) Simpson's diversity, β richness, and α species evenness were not affected. Changes in richness were driven by graminoids at the α and γ scales and woody species (and some evidence for forbs) at the α scale. Interestingly, indicator species analysis revealed that at least some species from all functional groups were promoted by restoration, although no species were significant indicators of pre-treatment or control sites. Both savanna and nonsavanna species were indicators of restored sites. Restoration promoted exotic species at both scales, although species with spring phenologies were unaffected. Woody encroachment removal may be a means to promote species establishment in savannas; however, in this study, it resulted in establishment and proliferation of native and exotic and savanna and nonsavanna species. Future work might consider reintroduction of key savanna species to supplement those that have established. Work like this demonstrates the utility of restoration experiments for conducting research on large- and multiscale processes, such as species diversity.";"Brudvig, Lars A.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301726407";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00431.x";"";"";"";"74-84"

We used four time series Landsat satellite images, that is, Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat Thematic Mapper (1986), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (2000), and Landsat 8 OLI scenes (2014), to investigate the changes in LULC. In addition, individual interviews with 51 randomly selected households, discussions with focus group and key informants, and field observations were also incorporated for the study. The image classification indicated four categories of LULC classes: Natural forest, eucalyptus plantations, cropland/settlements, and grasslands. Between 1975 and 2014, cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations considerably increased, whereas grassland cover drastically decreased. According to the results, the area under cropland/settlements and eucalyptus plantations increased by 62 and 335%, respectively, with 74% concomitant decrease in the area of grasslands in the same period. Survey results showed that deterioration of soil fertility (41.2%) followed by shortage of land (35.3%) is the major constraint for crop production for poor farmers in the study area. However, better-off farmers ranked deterioration of soil fertility (64.7%) followed by lack of credit (17.6%) as priority constraints for crop production. Interviews mainly focused on selected women group revealed that the expansion of eucalyptus in the area greatly curbed the burdens of collecting fuel woods from long distances in the past. The availability of too many religious holidays (on average 16 days/month) directly or indirectly contributes to the current seasonal food shortages of the community. Generally, our results show that the community in the study area is beset with a host of social, economic, and institutional challenges. As a result, majority of the farming households are destitute, unable to make a livelihood from their small plot of land and live in absolute poverty. Therefore, in light of these finding, it is imperative that timely interventions by government and other development stakeholders are needed to come to grips with problems of soil fertility, land-use change, and food insecurity in the study area.";"Desalegn, T.

Soil organic carbon was also affected by deforestation and land cover change. Compared to the forest (4.7% organic carbon), both the coppice (3.7%) and the pasture (3.4%) had lower values. Phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen content varied and may have been affected by erosion, animal deposition, differing amounts of vegetative residues present, differing organic matter decomposition rates, and differing hydrological processes. Deforestation was also found to change the species composition of seedlings and saplings in the coppice in comparison to the forest, reducing oak numbers and increasing hornbeam recruitment.";"Rhoades, Jason L.

"AGRIS:US2016220636";"Is agricultural zoning exclusionary?";"";"In rapidly suburbanizing areas, minimum lot sizes of ten acres or greater are often used to discourage residential development and to maintain agricultural critical mass.  Because of significant development pressure in these places, there is a good chance these lot size regulations will bind.  Such “down-zoning” often appears alongside the purchase of agricultural and conservation easements that reduce housing development even more.  Whatever the benefits of such policies for agriculture and the environment, they raise obvious concerns about housing supply and affordability.   The issue of affordability should be analyzed at the regional scale, since we would normally expect some high-income, low density enclaves to exist within any metropolitan area.  In addition, the analyst should look beyond median home price to compare the distribution of a region’s available housing stock to the distribution of its income.   A primary hypothesized effect of large-lot zoning is that it skews the distribution of available housing upward relative to the distribution of income.The present study will use a unique dataset on the New Jersey Highlands region to help answer the fundamental question posed by its title.   This dataset includes historical data on the lot size minima imposed on every residential acre in the 83 Highlands municipalities, as well as real estate listing data on thousands of residential transactions in these 83 municipalities.  Data from the U.S. Census are used to examine the distribution of income among New Jersey residents who ought to be served by the housing stock in the Highlands.   The study finds that in the 1990s and 2000s, the stock of Highlands housing was skewed high relative to the metropolitan incomes available to purchase it, even with renters excluded from the analysis.  Using a simple threshold of three times household income, the bottom 30% of households were consistently able to afford fewer than 30% of the homes coming on the market, while the top earners could afford a disproportionately large share of the available housing.   At the same time, the study was unable to document a deterioration in Highlands housing affordability in the 1990s and 2000s that was attributable to anything other than the national housing bubble.  Down-zoning is likely to affect the mix of housing types on the margin, while the majority of real estate transactions involve homes that were built several decades ago.  This suggests either a separate analysis of new construction, or a longer time series on home types and prices that would capture the effects of restrictive zoning over several decades.";"Gottlieb, Paul D.

In this study, the Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) model developed by the United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) is used for modeling the impervious areas of Eskişehir which is located in the Porsuk Stream Watershed in Inner Anatolia, Turkey. Effects of impervious areas of Eskisehir on the Porsuk Stream pollution between 1975 and 2010 have been investigated. Important water quality parameters like nitrate, orthophosphate, sediment, chloride, and total coliform are modeled. Impervious land segments have been found to be affecting all parameter concentrations and also surface flows significantly as determined using the t test with a confidence level of 95 %.";"Şimşek Uygun, Burcu

"AGRIS:US201600186660";"Cognisance, participation and protected areas in the Yucatan Peninsula";"";"Local people's involvement in the management of conservation initiatives is central to ongoing debates on the relative merits of distinct biodiversity conservation models. Since different governance models provide distinct opportunities for local people to participate in the management of protected areas, their knowledge of these governance models and motivation to collaborate will vary. This paper analyses cognisance and participation in (1) government-imposed biosphere reserves and (2) community conservation areas, in which ecotourism projects take place. Qualitative and quantitative data (n = 205) were gathered in two indigenous communities in Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Whereas local cognisance of community-driven conservation initiatives is not always greater than cognisance of government-imposed Biosphere Reserves, local participation is always greater. Cognisance of and participation in conservation initiatives depend on the management approach, extent of external resource support, and a community's social organization. Gender and land holding status influence access to information about conservation initiatives, since men with land rights had more access than other people. More participatory mechanisms for decision-making and direct communication strategies between managers and local people are required to improve communitiesâ involvement in conservation.";"RUIZ-MALLÃN, ISABEL

Firstly, quantifications of land surface phenology and greenness dynamics are impaired by differences between satellite data sets and phenology detection methods. Secondly, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that can be used to diagnose controls still reveal structural limitations and contrasting sensitivities to environmental drivers. Thus, we assessed the performance of a new developed phenology module within the LPJmL (Lund–Potsdam–Jena managed Lands) DGVM with a comprehensive ensemble of three satellite data sets of vegetation greenness and ten phenology detection methods, thereby thoroughly accounting for observational uncertainties. The improved and tested model allows us quantifying the relative importance of environmental controls on interannual variability and trends of land surface phenology and greenness at regional and global scales. We found that start of growing season interannual variability and trends are in addition to cold temperature mainly controlled by incoming radiation and water availability in temperate and boreal forests. Warming‐induced prolongations of the growing season in high latitudes are dampened by a limited availability of light. For peak greenness, interannual variability and trends are dominantly controlled by water availability and land‐use and land‐cover change (LULCC) in all regions. Stronger greening trends in boreal forests of Siberia than in North America are associated with a stronger increase in water availability from melting permafrost soils. Our findings emphasize that in addition to cold temperatures, water availability is a codominant control for start of growing season and peak greenness trends at the global scale.";"Forkel, Matthias

Here, we present an approach that conducts clustering after gray-level vector reduction. In this manner, the speed of clustering can be considerably improved. The approach features applying eigenspace transformation to the dataset followed by compressing the data in the eigenspace and storing them in coded matrices and vectors. The clustering process takes the advantage of the reduced size of the compressed data and thus reduces computational complexity. We name this approach Clustering Based on Eigen-space Transformation (CBEST). In our experiment with a subscene of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, CBEST was found to be able to improve speed considerably over conventional K-means as the volume of data to be clustered increases. We assessed information loss and several other factors. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of CBEST in mapping land cover/use with the same image that was acquired over Guangzhou City, South China and an AVIRIS hyperspectral image over Cappocanoe County, Indiana. Using reference data we assessed the accuracies for both CBEST and conventional K-means and we found that the CBEST was not negatively affected by information loss during compression in practice. We discussed potential applications of the fast clustering algorithm in dealing with large datasets in remote sensing studies.";"Chen, Yanlei

Two stochastic modeling techniques, random forests (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), are compared. The objectives of this study were first to explore the sensitivity of RF and SGB to choices in tuning parameters and, second, to compare the performance of the two final models by assessing the importance of, and interaction between, predictor variables, the global accuracy metrics derived from an independent test set, as well as the visual quality of the resultant maps of tree canopy cover. The predictive accuracy of RF and SGB was remarkably similar on all four of our pilot regions. In all four study regions, the independent test set mean squared error (MSE) was identical to three decimal places, with the largest difference in Kansas where RF gave an MSE of 0.0113 and SGB gave an MSE of 0.0117. With correlated predictor variables, SGB had a tendency to concentrate variable importance in fewer variables, whereas RF tended to spread importance among more variables. RF is simpler to implement than SGB, as RF has fewer parameters needing tuning and also was less sensitive to these parameters. As stochastic techniques, both RF and SGB introduce a new component of uncertainty: repeated model runs will potentially result in different final predictions. We demonstrate how RF allows the production of a spatially explicit map of this stochastic uncertainty of the final model.";"Freeman, Elizabeth A.

Although the knowledge of fire effects on amphibians in the region is still limited relative to most other vertebrate species, we reviewed the current literature to determine if there are evident patterns that might be informative for conservation or management strategies. Of the seven studies that compared pre- and post-wildfire data on a variety of metrics, ranging from amphibian occupancy to body condition, two reported positive responses and five detected negative responses by at least one species. Another seven studies used a retrospective approach to compare effects of wildfire on populations: two studies reported positive effects, three reported negative effects from wildfire, and two reported no effects. All four studies that included plethodontid salamanders reported negative effects on populations or individuals; these effects were greater in forests where fire had been suppressed and in areas that burned with high severity. Species that breed in streams are also vulnerable to post-wildfire changes in habitat, especially in the Southwest. Wildfire is also important for maintaining suitable habitat for diverse amphibian communities, although those results may not be evident immediately after an area burns. We expect that wildfire will extirpate few healthy amphibian populations, but it is still unclear how populations will respond to wildfire in the context of land management (including pre- and post-fire timber harvest) and fragmentation. Wildfire may also increase the risk of decline or extirpation for small, isolated, or stressed (e.g., from drought or disease) populations. Improved understanding of how these effects vary according to changes in fire frequency and severity are critical to form more effective conservation strategies for amphibians in the western United States.";"Hossack, Blake R.

An economic estimation";"";"Panama has the highest rate of change in the area of primary forests within Central America. However, to meet growing timber demands, it became popular over the last decades to establish plantations made up of foreign species such as Tectona grandis or Pinus spp. In the majority of the cases the species used are well known; their characteristics such as growth performance have been reviewed intensively and can be accessed in numerous publications. Characteristics of Panama's native tree species of commercial relevance such as Hieronyma alchorneoides, Swietenia macrophylla and Terminalia amazonia are largely unknown and have been investigated within the study at hand. Using valuation methods of financial mathematics, the competitive position of these three indigenous species was assessed, the results compared to those of T. grandis stands in the same area. Land costs and taxes were not considered, as they would be the same for all species. Financial estimates for indigenous species will enlarge their acceptance for use in reforestation and plantation projects. Using the NPV method and applying the standard scenario, the profitability of T. grandis is lower than that of T. amazonia and S. macrophylla and lies only slightly above the profitability calculated for H. alchorneoides. This result clearly indicates that the investigated native tree species are comparable with T. grandis regarding their economic profitability. Besides its ecological impact, growing native tree species is now also economically legitimate. By calculating land expectation values for all tree species, ideal rotation lengths could be determined. For these species, considerable flexibility exists regarding the optimal rotation length.";"Griess, Verena C.

"AGRIS:US201400065842";"Using Changes in Agricultural Utility to Quantify Future Climate‐Induced Risk to Conservation";"";"Much of the biodiversity‐related climate change impacts research has focused on the direct effects to species and ecosystems. Far less attention has been paid to the potential ecological consequences of human efforts to address the effects of climate change, which may equal or exceed the direct effects of climate change on biodiversity. One of the most significant human responses is likely to be mediated through changes in the agricultural utility of land. As farmers adapt their practices to changing climates, they may increase pressure on some areas that are important to conserve (conservation lands) whereas lessening it on others. We quantified how the agricultural utility of South African conservation lands may be altered by climate change. We assumed that the probability of an area being farmed is linked to the economic benefits of doing so, using land productivity values to represent production benefit and topographic ruggedness as a proxy for costs associated with mechanical workability. We computed current and future values of maize and wheat production in key conservation lands using the DSSAT4.5 model and 36 crop‐climate response scenarios. Most conservation lands had, and were predicted to continue to have, low agricultural utility because of their location in rugged terrain. However, several areas were predicted to maintain or gain high agricultural utility and may therefore be at risk of near‐term or future conversion to cropland. Conversely, some areas were predicted to decrease in agricultural utility and may therefore prove easier to protect from conversion. Our study provides an approximate but readily transferable method for incorporating potential human responses to climate change into conservation planning.

The case of public lands in Algeria";"";"The use of groundwater in irrigated agriculture is often regarded as an effective way of increasing farm productivity. However, the effects of differential access to groundwater by farmers have rarely been studied at the microeconomic scale, particularly the possibly negative effects of marginalization of small farmers. During the hydraulic crisis that has affected Algerian irrigation schemes since the 1980s, groundwater has become a major source of irrigation for farmers. A process of farm differentiation occurred linked to farmers' access to groundwater, causing social inequity. To understand the differentiation of farms in the Ouarizane irrigation scheme, we first undertook a historical inquiry. Second, we used a participatory prospective approach to analyse possible changes in farming systems after the adoption of a new land reform. Our results confirmed that access to groundwater has become a structural factor in the differentiation of farms and in land concentration in Algerian irrigation schemes. Land concentration and the marginalization of small farmers are likely to worsen when the new land law is applied.";"Amichi, Hichem

In order to investigate which indicators are most effective in assessing the level of desertification risk, a total of 70 candidate indicators was selected providing information for the biophysical environment, socio-economic conditions, and land management characteristics. The indicators were defined in 1,672 field sites located in 17 study areas in the Mediterranean region, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Based on an existing geo-referenced database, classes were designated for each indicator and a sensitivity score to desertification was assigned to each class based on existing research. The obtained data were analyzed for the various processes of land degradation at farm level. The derived methodology was assessed using independent indicators, such as the measured soil erosion rate, and the organic matter content of the soil. Based on regression analyses, the collected indicator set can be reduced to a number of effective indicators ranging from 8 to 17 in the various processes of land degradation. Among the most important indicators identified as affecting land degradation and desertification risk were rain seasonality, slope gradient, plant cover, rate of land abandonment, land-use intensity, and the level of policy implementation.";"Kosmas, C.

As a first step, a conceptual framework was developed in which the factors and processes that may lead to land degradation and desertification were described. Many of these factors do not work independently, but can reinforce or weaken one another, and to illustrate these relationships sustainable management and policy feedback loops were included. This conceptual framework can be applied globally, but can also be made site-specific to take into account that each study site has a unique combination of bio-physical, socio-economic and political conditions. Once the conceptual framework was defined, a methodological framework was developed in which the methodological steps taken in the DESIRE approach were listed and their logic and sequence were explained. The last step was to develop a concrete working plan to put the project into action, involving stakeholders throughout the process. This series of steps, in full or in part, offers explicit guidance for other organizations or projects that aim to reduce land degradation and desertification.";"Hessel, R.

Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imageries acquired in 1999 and 2006 were pre-processed and classified using a supervised classification technique with maximum likelihood classifier algorithm in RS and were used to develop maps of the sub-watershed and sub-subwatershed levels in a GIS platform. LULC change analysis revealed that, from 1999 to 2006, significant changes occurred in the sub-watershed as indicated by the increase of agricultural (11.76%) and orchard (4.52%) areas at the expense of brushland (16.56%) areas. Other LULC such as water bodies, built-up, forest, and grassland remain almost unchanged. In the sub-subwatershed level, Tayabasan experienced minimal change, whilst Tanay had the most transitions. Overall accuracy and kappa statistics were then derived using the confusion matrix, which resulted in 96.15% and 95.49% for 1999 imagery, and 93.82% and 92.73% for 2006 imagery, respectively. LULC persistence and transition trends were analyzed using land change modeler, while the Markov chain model has been utilized to predict the LULC distribution in 2020 pertinent to rates of change from 1999 to 2006. This study contributes not only to the understanding of the past and present landscape of the sub-watershed, but also provides an idea of the areas that need rehabilitation for the formulation of suitable mitigation measures and strategies toward the sustainable management of the sub-watershed.";"Abino, Azyleah C.

"AGRIS:US2016220455";"The Production of Biofuels: Welfare and Environmental Consequences for Asia";"";"The production of biofuels has been supported by many conservationists and environmentalists on the grounds that it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is a renewable energy substitute for non-renewable fossil fuels, mainly oil. More recently the domestic production of biofuels (and the domestic supply of other forms of alternative energy) have been welcomed by several nations as ways to reduce their oil imports and increase their energy self-sufficiency, as for example, has happened in the United States. India also which is very dependent on oil imports has also begun to produce biofuels in Kerala and elsewhere. However, doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of biofuel use as a means to reduce the accumulation of greenhouse gases and elementary economics teaches us that it is likely to have opportunity costs. For example, increased cropping to provide biofuels can be at the expense of the production of food and natural fibres thereby adding to their prices. It may also increase the conversion of natural areas to agricultural use and consequently, add to biodiversity loss and an increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. For example, in Borneo, forests are being converted to grow oil palm, partly used for biodiesel production in developing countries. These issues are discussed generally and their economic welfare implications are given particular attention in relation to Asian nations. Amongst the different situations examined from economic welfare and environmental points of view are the following:1.Asian nations producing biofuels for their own use from home-grown crops, as is the case of India and China.2.The external trade of Asian countries in feedstock for biofuels, such as palm oil in Indonesia and Malaysia and in biofuel itself.3.Possible Asian ventures to grow crops for biofuels abroad or import biofuels.4.The economic consequences for Asian countries of decisions by higher income countries, such as the United States (which also happens to be a major global exporter of food and natural fibre), to raise their production of biofuels.Analysis is provided that casts doubts on the likelihood that the introduction of biofuels will reduce greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-09-31";"en";"";"";"";"IDN;142;USA;IND;MYS;CHN";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016220455";"http://purl.umn.edu/55340";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201600100574";"Restoring aboveground carbon and biodiversity: a case study from the Nile basin, Ethiopia";"";"In Ethiopia, exclosures in landscapes have become increasingly important to improving ecosystem services and reversing biodiversity losses. The present study was conducted in Gomit watershed, northern Ethiopia, to: (i) investigate the changes in vegetation composition, diversity and aboveground biomass and carbon following the establishment of exclosures; and (ii) analyse the economic returns of aboveground carbon sequestration and assess the perception of local communities on land degradation and exclosures. A space-for-time substitution approach was used to detect the changes in aboveground carbon, species composition, and diversity. Exclosures of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 7-years-old and a communal grazing land were selected. Household surveys, key informant interviews, and a financial analysis were used to assess the perception of local communities and the value of exclosure impacts, respectively. Significant (P = 0.049) differences in species diversity and considerable increases in aboveground carbon (ranged from 0.6 to 4.2 t C ha ⁻¹), CO ₂ storage (varied between 2.1 and 15.3 t CO ₂ ha ⁻¹), woody species composition, and richness (ranged from five to 28) were observed following the establishment of exclosures. Exclosures generated temporary certified emission reductions (tCER) of 3.4, 2.1, 7.5, 12.6, 12.5, and 15.3 Mg CO ₂ ha ⁻¹ after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 years, respectively. The net present value (NPV) of the aboveground carbon sequestered in exclosures ranged from US$6.6 to US$37.0 per hectare and increased with exclosure duration. At a watershed level, 51.4 Mg C ha ⁻¹ can be sequestered, which represents 188.6 Mg CO ₂ ha ⁻¹, resulting in tCER of 139.4 Mg CO ₂ ha ⁻¹ and NPV of US$478.3 per hectare. This result would suggest that exclosures can potentially improve local communities’ livelihoods beyond rehabilitating degraded lands if carbon stored in exclosures is traded. Communities in the watershed demonstrated that exclosures are effective in restoring degraded lands and they are benefiting from increased fodder production and reduced impacts of soil erosion. However, the respondents are also concerned over the sustainability of exclosure land management, as further expansion of exclosures aggravates degradation of remaining communal grazing lands and causes fuel wood shortages. This suggests that the sustainability of exclosure land management can be attained only if these critical concerns are addressed by a joint effort among government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and communities.";"Mekuria, Wolde

"AGRIS:US201600195426";"Dairy farming: indoor v. pasture-based feeding";"";"The current situation of volatile milk prices and rising costs of, e.g. grain and labour, suggests that it is worth studying productivity and efficiency in dairy farming. The objective of the current whole-system study, carried out in lowland Central Switzerland from 2007 to 2010, was to compare the performance, efficiency, land productivity and profitability of indoor-feeding (IF) dairy production with that of pasture-based feeding (PF) dairy production. An IF herd consisting of 11 HolsteinâFriesian (HF) and 13 Brown Swiss (BS) cows was kept in a free-stall barn and fed a part-mixed ration (PMR) of maize silage, grass silage and protein concentrate. The cows were allocated 15Â·8Â ha of agricultural land (AL). In the PMR, an average per lactation of 443Â kg protein concentrate and 651Â kg compound feed was fed by a concentrate dispenser according to the requirements of each cow. The PF herd comprised 14 Swiss Fleckvieh (SF) and 14 BS cows, which were kept in a free-stall barn throughout the winter; barn-ventilated hay was offered ad libitum during the lactation period. This herd was allocated 15Â·7Â ha of AL. After calving in spring, the PF cows grazed on semi-continuous pastures; they consumed an average of 285Â kg of concentrate per lactation. The IF cows of the BS breed produced significantly more energy-corrected milk (ECM) per standard lactation compared with PF cows (8750 v. 5610Â kg), more milk fat (350 v. 213Â kg) and more milk protein (306 v. 203Â kg). However, the milk of PF cows had higher levels of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1Â·9 v. 0Â·6Â g/100Â g fat) and Ïâ3 fatty acids (1Â·7 v. 0Â·9Â g/100Â g fat) than the milk of the IF cows. The calving interval (378 v. 405 days) and the empty time (87 v. 118 days) of the BS breed were significantly shorter in the PF in comparison with that of the IF production system. The IF herd yielded significantly higher ECM/ha AL and year (12Â 716 v. 10Â 307Â kg), and showed a higher feed efficiency (1Â·3 v. 1Â·1Â kg ECM/kg of total dry matter intake (DMI)). The productivity per hour was roughly similar in the two systems (IF: 76 v. PF: 73Â kg milk/h). The PF system resulted in higher labour income compared with the IF system (20Â·7 v. 13Â·4 â¬/h), but the difference was not significant. In conclusion, land productivity and efficiency were higher with the IF herd than the PF herd due to the higher energy intake per kg feed. However, within the given conditions, the more interesting case, economically, might be the reduced costs and improved milk quality of the PF system rather than the increased milk yield of the IF cows.";"HOFSTETTER, P.

We use the Land Use in Rural New Zealand (LURNZ) model to conduct2 simulations assuming that one tonne of CO2-eqv costs $25; The referencecase is that no one has entered the NZETS, the other scenario is thatthe whole agriculture sector and indigenous forest (but not plantation) haveentered the ETS. Each simulation estimates the amount of land use changesin dairy, sheep-beef and scrub from 2008 to 2015. By comparing these simulations,we identify the current use and the area of land that may revertto indigenous scrub. The results suggest that 224,000 more hectares of post-1989 forestry land will be protected into scrub under NZETS than withoutthe system. After applying a land use allocation algorithm, the most likelyreversion may take place on marginal sheep-beef land.";"Zhang, Wei

"AGRIS:US2016201105";"Global Property Rights in Genetic Resources: Do They Involve Sound Economics? Will they Conserve Nature and Biodiversity?";"";"In recent years, growing economic globalisation has been accompanied by rising social support for market systems as a means of managing resource-use. In turn, the free market movement considers definite and secure property rights (especially private rights and, sometimes, communal rights) in resources to be the necessary basis for a desirable market system. Global policies for managing the Earth’s genetic resources have been influenced by this approach. As outlined in this article, there has been a global expansion of property rights in genetic resources, and further extensions have been advocated. In order to assess the possible social benefits and costs of granting property rights in genetic resources, these are classified. This classification is shown to be useful in discussing economic and legal reasons for granting or denying property rights in genetic resources. Furthermore, this classification is demonstrated to be pertinent to the consideration of market failures that may accompany the granting of property rights in genetic resources and which limit the potential social economic benefits from establishing property rights in these resources. It is concluded that many of those who advocate the management of genetic resources by means of secure property rights and market systems have been overly optimistic about the economic potential of this policy, its social benefits, its impact on the conservation of biodiversity, and its workability. There is a need for more informed debate on these matters before concluding that wholesale global extension of property rights in genetic material is desirable. In addition to the above, this paper compares and assesses the approach on property rights in wildlife and nature adopted in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) with that advocated in the international Convention on Biological Diversity.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-08-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"001";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016201105";"http://purl.umn.edu/55109";"";"";"";""

To quantify temporal variations in P and nitrogen (N) contents of the grassy vegetation of BZs on a clay soil (Vertic Cambisol) in south-western Finland, plant samples were collected six times between May 2005 and April 2006 from natural BZs, BZs grazed by cattle and BZs harvested by cutting and removal of the yield. The total dry weight biomass peaked in early August at 2,130-2,360 and 5,500-6,270 kg ha⁻¹ for the grazed and the other BZs, respectively. In August, 3,840-4,830 kg ha⁻¹ were removed from the harvested BZs while the entire biomass of the non-harvested BZs remained in the field. In October, total P and N contents varied from 2.4-10.2 to 19-72 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, the lowest amounts being for the young harvested BZ and the highest for the non-harvested BZs. A considerable decrease of P and N contents occurred in the biomass up to 6.1 and almost 30 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, after the first frosts. Harvesting of BZs is recommended to decrease the amount of P and N in the BZs and reduce the risk of P and N leaching outside the growing season.";"Räty, Mari

"AGRIS:US201400060864";"Cholinesterases in Aquatic Biomonitoring: Assay Optimization and Species-Specific Characterization for a California Native Fish";"";"Cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme activity measurements are widely applied in aquatic organisms for water quality monitoring, especially for pesticide contamination in agricultural watersheds. These biomarkers are amenable to measurement in a variety of species, and are therefore useful for examining effects in model organisms relevant to the ecosystem of interest. However, extensive variation in ChE biochemistry exists among tissues and species. This variation is rarely characterized and may lead to biases in the interpretation of activity determinations. We optimized ChE activity measurement parameters and characterized ChE biochemistry in Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis), a widely distributed fish native to watersheds of the Central Valley of California. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was the predominant ChE present in C. occidentalis brain and muscle, and muscle AChE was most sensitive to diazinon inhibition. Field caging experiments indicated that exposures to ChE-inhibiting pesticides were insufficient to induce neurotoxic effects. However, pesticide usage in the Central Valley is highly variable among years, and long-term monitoring of in-stream effects would be necessary to evaluate trends in pesticide contamination. Recent changes to the State Water Code require agricultural landowners to participate in a regional water quality monitoring plan. As with most regional monitoring plans, measurements of in-stream effects, and effects in resident species, are not scheduled to be included. We suggest that inclusion of biomarker measures would lend important information to the monitoring process, and propose these procedures as a template for adapting ChE activity measurements into region-specific monitoring programs to assess in-stream effects of pesticide contamination on native species.";"Whitehead, Andrew

Here, we evaluated the relationships among catchment attributes (size, morphometry and land cover) and water chemistry in 23 Pampean streams in different seasons (autumn, spring and summer) and at three spatial scales: whole catchment and two scales of riparian buffers (200 and 500 m adjacent to both stream margins). Chloride concentration was positively related to catchment area and negatively related to drainage density. Nitrate level was strongly associated to cropland, but soluble phosphorus concentration showed no relationships with any type of land cover. Land cover at the buffer scale seemed to be more influential than land cover at the whole catchment for nitrogen concentration. The main impact of cropland was the increase of nitrate concentration, while cattle breeding was negatively associated to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in autumn and summer and to dissolved oxygen concentration in spring.

Grazing land has diminished, crop residues are becoming a more important element in raising livestock and fattening penned livestock has become profitable. The changes in land use, land tenure and the shift of livestock raising southwards in West Africa are illustrated. Farmers' adaptation to rapidly changing markets for their products and the factors of production are illustrated with examples from Senegal, Nigeria, Niger, and, by way of contrast, Kenya.

This is the same time period as a transformation in the agricultural input industry, rapid growth in demand for agricultural inputs, breakthroughs in information technology and biotechnology, and changes in intellectual property rights. An econometric model was used to test whether the transformation of agricultural input industry was a major factor in the growth of R&D expenditure or not. This article analyzes a unique, firm level sales and R&D data set from the seed, pesticide, tractor, and fertilizer industries in 2000–2009. The estimated model indicates that agribusiness firms' R&D expenditures from 2000 to 2009 were positively related to variables associated with industry transformation such as firm size, ownership by multinationals, and declining industry concentration. The model also indicates that strengthening patent policy as well as growth in the size of research‐intensive industries like the seed industry contributed to the growth of agribusiness R&D in India.";"Pray, Carl E.

"AGRIS:US201500003067";"Messy hectares: questions about the epistemology of land grabbing data";"";"Recent research on land deals reports gigantic quantities of hectares seized, with relatively little regard for the solidity of the evidence or for considerations of scale other than area. This commentary questions the usefulness of aggregating data of uneven quality and transforming it into ‘facts’. Making claims on the basis of problematic evidence does not serve agrarian and human rights activists well, since it may undercut their legitimacy and make it difficult for them to identify their adversaries. Studying land tenure and corporate ownership is inherently complicated, with intractable legibility problems. Social scientists must subject their sources to critical scrutiny and understand the contexts of their production, preservation and dissemination. An accelerated process of dispossession is clearly in motion, but countering it effectively requires precise and accurate data, which are difficult to obtain. Oversimplified claims may not only undermine efforts to counter specific cases of land grabbing – and claims about land grabbing more generally – but may also divert attention from less publicized cases and from the actors behind the land grabbing. They also tend to reduce land grabbing to a quantitative problem rather than focusing on the social relations that it may or may not transform.This is a much revised and expanded version of a paper presented at the Plenary Session Roundtable on Methodologies: Identifying, Counting and Understanding, International Academic Conference on Global Land Grabbing II, organized by the Land Deals Politics Initiative (LDPI), Cornell University, 17–19 October 2012.

The history, central concepts, benefits, and limitations of HRV are presented along with a discussion on the value of HRV in a changing world with rapid climate warming, exotic species invasions, and increased land development. This paper is meant as a reference on the strengths and limitations of applying HRV in land management. Applications of the HRV concept have specific contexts, constraints, and conditions that are relevant to any application and are influential to the extent to which the concept is applied. These conditions notwithstanding, we suggest that the HRV concept offers an objective reference for many applications, and it still offers a comprehensive reference for the short-term and possible long-term management of our nation's landscapes until advances in technology and ecological research provide more suitable and viable approaches in theory and application.";"Keane, Robert E.

In response, contemporary grassroots movements in Brazil, including the Landless Rural Workers Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, or MST) advocate the substantive transformation of what I develop here as a new form of “agrarian citizenship”, in which political participation, local food production, and environmental stewardship redefine the ongoing constitution of the relationship between land, state, and rural society. Based on extensive interviews, participant observation and document analysis from 2004-2006, this ethnographic study examines the contours of how changing notions of agrarian citizenship are negotiated among members of a growing body of social groups demanding land redistribution and reasserting agrarian culture in Brazil. By developing and enacting new forms of political participation that involve the transformation of personal and collective values and practices, rural activists such as the MST envision the redistribution of land as a material right, but also view the transformation of the land-society relation as an equally public responsibility.";"Wittman, Hannah";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301572974";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2008.07.002";"";"";"";"120-130"

This paper analyzed land use changes in the middle reach of the arid Heihe River Basin in northwest China over the last two decades and their impacts on water resources and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. The results indicated that from 1986 to 2007: (1) cropland and human settlements expanded by 45.0 and 17.6� %, respectively, at the expense of 70.1, 35.7, and 4.1� % shrinkage on woodland, grassland, and semi-shrubby desert; (2) irrigation water use was dominant and increased (with fluctuations) at an average rate of 8.2� %, while basic human water consumption increased monotonically over a longer period from 1981 to 2011 at a rate of 58� %; and (3) cropland expansion or continuous cultivation led to a significant reduction of SOC, while the land use transition from grassland to semi-shrubby desert and the progressive succession of natural ecosystems such as semi-shrubby desert and grassland, in contrast, can bring about significant carbon sequestration benefits. The increased water consumption and decreased SOC pool associated with some observed land use changes may induce and aggravate potential ecological risks for both local and downstream ecosystems, including water resource shortages, soil quality declines, and degeneration of natural vegetation. Therefore, it is necessary to balance socioeconomic wellbeing and ecosystem services in land use planning and management for the sustainability of socio-ecological systems across spatiotemporal scales, especially in resource-poor arid environments.";"Lü, Yihe

Because they are built at relatively high densities, New Urbanist developments can exacerbate risk by placing more people and property in harm's way. Conversely, New Urbanist design features theoretically better enable designers of New Urbanist developments to avoid floodplain portions of project sites than designers of conventional subdivisions. Using a sample of New Urbanist developments in the US that contain floodplain portions within their boundaries, this paper focuses on whether and why these developments locate built structures inside the floodplain. The authors find that roughly 30% of the developments locate structures inside the floodplain, and that the odds of locating structures inside the floodplain increase with the proportion of the project site located inside the floodplain and decrease with the presence of government policies that prohibit residential development in the floodplain. The authors also identify confusion among government planners regarding the distinction between pre and postconstruction floodplain boundaries. A subset of New Urbanist developments is found to have built structures located outside the postconstruction floodplain boundary, but inside the preconstruction floodplain boundary. This finding is cited as an example of the “safe development paradox” in action. The authors recommend changes in New Urbanist design codes and local government floodplain management to increasingly direct new development away from the floodplain.";"Stevens, Mark R.

"AGRIS:US2016213541";"Secure land rental contracts and agricultural investment in two communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal";"";"This study tests the hypothesis that an efficient rental market for cropland is a significant determinant of agricultural investment in the communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. An efficient rental market creates an opportunity cost for under-utilisation, which tends to transfer resources to more effective users. The efficiency of a rental market is compromised by the presence of transaction costs that reduce returns for both lessees and lessors. Transaction costs include risk arising from a possible breach of the rental contract. Potential losses caused by a breach of contract can be reduced by introducing a credible third-party to witness the contract. Likewise, moral hazard can be reduced by contracting with trusted persons. Data from household surveys conducted in two communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal were used to estimate a regression model explaining levels of investment in crop production amongst tenant farmers. The results confirm that tenants invest more when they contract with friends or family, and if their contracts are formally witnessed by a credible third-party. Interventions that reduce potential losses caused by a breach of contract are therefore expected to promote market efficiency and investment in crop production. In the short-run, the Provincial Department of Agriculture should sanction rental contracts negotiated by lessors and lessees. Ultimately, legal reform that leads to predictable contract enforcement in the communal areas is required to improve market efficiency and levels of investment in agriculture.";"Dengu, T.

The study area where oasis desertification occurred is located east of the Ebinur Lake region, just west of Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, China. The ecological and environmental issues in the study area are vulnerable and sensitive. The authors of this paper discuss the changes in land desertification that occurred between 1990 and 2010. In the past 20 years, because of the human activities, such as population growth and agricultural development, desertification occurred rapidly in the study area. Remote sensing images were classified into eight categories: light desertification, moderate desertification, severe desertification, extremely severe desertification, bare rock, farmland, water body, and salt desert. To evaluate the evolution and status of land desertification as well as its causes, the authors interpreted and analyzed Landsat Thematic Mapper images (acquired in 1990, 2007, 2010) and Enhanced Landsat Thematic Mapper images (acquired in 2001) as well as meteorological and socio-economic data. Results revealed that 4,426.49, 3,713.25, 3,713.95 and 3,789.16 km²of the total area is desertified land during these four periods (1990, 2001, 2007, and 2010). The factors controlling desertified land dynamics were analyzed from the perspectives of two groups: climatic variations and human activities. The results indicated that the climate-dominated natural factors contribute greatly to the occurrence and development desertified land. However, they are not the fundamental causes of its development. The human factors are the primary and direct driving forces responsible for the increase in desertification area. More thorough quantitative analysis, with more frequent remotely sensed data is needed to assess the driving forces in more detail.";"Zhang, Fei

The model incorporates the tradeoffs between biofuel, feed,and food production and consumption and international feedback effects of theemergence through world commodity prices and trade. We examine land allocation bytype of crop, and pasture use for countries growing feedstock for ethanol (corn,sorghum, wheat, sugarcane, and other grains) and major crops competing with feedstockfor land resources such as oilseeds. We shock the model with exogenous changes inethanol demand, first in the United States, then in Brazil, China, EU, and India, andcompute shock multipliers for land allocation decisions for crops and countries ofinterest. The multipliers show at the margin how sensitive land allocation is to thegrowing demand for ethanol. Land moves away from major crops and pasturecompeting for resources with feedstock crops. Because of the high U.S. tariff on ethanol,higher U.S. demand for ethanol translates into a U.S. ethanol production expansion. Thelatter has global effects on land allocation as higher coarse grains prices transmitworldwide. Changes in U.S. coarse grain prices also affect U.S. wheat and oilseedsprices, which are all transmitted to world markets. In contrast, expansion in Brazilethanol use and production chiefly affects land used for sugarcane production in Braziland to a lesser extent in other sugar-producing countries, but with small impact on otherland uses in most countries.";"Fabiosa, Jacinto F.

The highly efficient vector, Anopheles darlingi Root, is currently considered the most important. The preferred larval habitat of An. darlingi has been described as floating detritus patches, which are commonly associated with overhanging spiny bamboo, Guadua longifolia (E. Fourn.), along river margins. The objectives of this study were to use remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) tools to 1) define the landscape features (i.e., river curvature, land cover, and house locations) associated with An. darlingi-positive breeding habitats and 2) determine the association between cleared land cover and the growth of spiny bamboo. A systematic survey was conducted in which all detritus patches of at least 1 m(2) were sampled, mapped using GPS, and characterized by cause of habitat lodging. Bamboo stretches growing along the river margins also were mapped. Spatial analyses of satellite imagery found no associations between river characteristics or land cover with positive An. darlingi habitats. In addition, there was no significant difference in cleared versus forested land cover in relation to the presence or absence of bamboo. Results indicate that the average distance from homes to negative habitats was significantly greater than from positive detritus mats. Based on the land cover and river characteristics used, our results do not support the use of remote sensing as a predictive tool to locate specific areas within rivers positive for An. darlingi habitats.";"Achee, N.L.

With that idea in mind, it sheds light onto the institutional course of the Ottoman Empire through the examination of two phenomena: the social structure of the imperial subjects and the provision of public goods. The reason that these two phenomena are essential in assessing the historical trajectory of the empire lies in their particular developmental paths that intertwine and support each other. The Ottoman Empire, which, to an extent, can be seen as the successor state to the Byzantines - as the Byzantine Empire was to Rome-, formed the highest stage of Islamic political institutionalization, having built upon the heritage of mainly the Turks as well as the earlier Muslim polities such as the Umayyad, Abbasid, Seljukian and Mamluk dynasties -plus that of the Mongol. Keeping in mind the Western state model, in the complexity of the political and economic Ottoman organization, those differences that appear as differences of degree compared to the West, still constitute an Ottoman peculiarity.

This study examines British Columbia's CORE and LRMP planning processes, their successes and failures, as determined by residents of six communities that participated in these processes. Lessons on improving public processes from the viewpoint of that public are discussed.";"Booth, Annie

Phytosociology was integrated with GIS and remote sensing data as follows: (1) a land cover/land use map was obtained by analysing remote sensing data and conducting field verification; (2) phytosociological relevés were randomly sampled in woodland vegetation patches using the map; (3) the pattern of land cover/land use around the relevés was described; (4) gradients of land use intensity (human impact) were obtained based on the descriptions; (5) the response of vegetation types to impacts of gradients was calculated using fuzzy set theory. Two complementary gradients of human impact were defined based on land cover/land use analysis of the remotely sensed data: one related to cultivation intensity and the other to grazing intensity. Response functions of vegetation types (defined by numerical classification) to these gradients demonstrated that the vegetation types are strongly related to the degree of human impact and that the corresponding vegetation patches show different degrees of permeability to the species of the surrounding landscape.";"Feoli, Enrico

They play an active dominant and leading role in land use planning decisions, and are, therefore, expected to have a significant impact on patterns of development and open space conservation. The present study identified correlations between characteristics of developers and indicators of open space conservation, based on a random sample of 88 statutory land use plans in the Tel Aviv metropolitan region over the period 1990–1999. The variables used to describe characteristics of developers were of two kinds: direct variables including developer type and land ownership, and indirect proxy variables that represented typical entrepreneurial behaviors (profit seeking, risk taking and innovativeness) including: net residential density, open space per residential unit, spatial location of the plan area and the time lapse until plan approval. Indicators of conservation were: size of plan area, existing agricultural land within the plan, proposed open space and effective open space. We found that developer type and land ownership were connected mainly to plan size and existing agricultural land rate, both indicators of regional conservation potential, while variables representing profit seeking, risk taking and innovativeness were significantly connected to proposed and effective open space rates, which express the conservation level within plans.";"Maruani, Tseira

Mid infra red diffuse reflectance spectrometry was applied to estimate the quantities of organic matter, dithionite extractable aluminium- (Ald) and iron (Fed), kaolinite, dioctahedral clay and mica (D&M) minerals in 1052 snapshot samples of fine (<150μm) BS in small to medium-sized (5–55km²) agricultural headwater catchments across a large area (15400km²) of central England. Analyses included estimates of BS specific surface area, cerium (Ce) concentrations (enriched in P-bearing apatite and P-fertilsers), and catchment average topsoil P content. Simple linear regression demonstrated that the proportion of variance in BSP explained by specific components of BS across all catchments declined in the following order: Ald>Fed>topsoil P=kaolinite=residualiron> organic matter=Ce>D&M>mineral SSA. No single component accounted for more than 36% of the variance in BSP. Multiple regression – including a classification of bedrock lithology and proportions of arable and grassland by area – accounted for 61.9% of the variance in BSP. The proportion of arable and grassland by area in each catchment was also a statistically significant predictor of BSP. Across this large region – with widely differing geology and soils – Fed in BS is more strongly associated with kaolinite than D&M minerals because iron-oxyhydroxides and kaolinite form contemporaneously during pedogenesis.

In response to the increasing population pressure, the Chinese authorities strongly invested in improving the irrigation systems and increasing ground and surface water exploitation within the plain to increase the crop productivity. This resulted in a reduction of water resource availability and in turn indirectly affected the suitability of various agricultural ecosystems in the plain. The main purpose of this study was to review the suitability of temperature and precipitation for the winter wheat and summer maize cropping system in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, in order to provide a preliminary irrigation scheme. This analysis provides a first attempt to enhance the water resource management as well as to increase the water use efficiency. For this aim, a GIS-based multicriteria analysis procedure has been developed consisting of (1) definition of objectives (evaluated entities) and database building; (2) definition of evaluation criteria; (3) standardization of the criteria; (4) combination of the criteria; (5) classification of the objectives; and (6) integration of the objectives. The land suitability classification maps were transformed into maps of required irrigation amounts for each growing stage of the winter wheat and summer maize cropping system.

To determine the variation of productivity in A. ordosica rangeland, we investigated net primary production (NPP), fine root turnover, soil microbial C (Cmic), and soil organic carbon density (SOCd) on sand dunes differing in mobility (i.e., fixed, semifixed, and shifting sand dunes) in Mu Us sandland. We found that, on an area basis, the NPP, SOCd, Cmic, and fine root turnover rates all increased with increasing vegetation cover. However, the ratios of root NPP to total NPP (RMRN) increased with declining vegetation cover. Total NPP varied markedly among habitats and ranged from 18.3 g·m-2·yr-1 for communities on the shifting sand dunes to 293.8 g·m-2·yr-1 for communities on the fixed sand dunes; whereas the rates of fine root turnover varied from 0.16·yr-1 to 0.54·yr-1. Our study demonstrated that habitat change in sandland has significant impacts on ecosystem productivity by affecting many related aspects of NPP. From the perspective of biomass production, protection of the semifixed dunes from degradation should be taken as a higher priority than trying to convert shifting sand dunes to semifixed sand dunes; whereas conversion of semifixed sand dunes to fixed sand dunes would appear to be a much easier task than restoring shifting sand dunes.";"Li, Chunping

Many spatial problems are complex and require the use of integrated analysis and models. The present paper illustrates the development of a MC-SDSS approach for studying the ecological connectivity of the Piedmont Region in Italy. The MC-SDSS model considers ecological and environmental spatial indicators which are combined by integrating the Multicriteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) technique named Analytic Network Process (ANP) and the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) approach. The ANP is used for the elicitation of attribute weights while the OWA operator function is used to generate a wide range of decision alternatives for addressing uncertainty associated with interaction between multiple criteria. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by different OWA scenarios that report the ecological connectivity index on a scale between 0 and 1. The OWA scenarios are intended to quantify the level of risk taking (i.e., optimistic, pessimistic, and neutral) and to facilitate a better understanding of patterns that emerge from decision alternatives involved in the decision-making process. The purpose of the research is to generate a final map representing the ecological connectivity index of each area in the region under analysis, to be used as a decision variable in spatial planning. In particular, by using the resulting index map as a means of analysis, it is possible to identify, for the sake of nature conservation, some critical areas needing mitigation measures. In addition, areas with high ecological connectivity values can be identified and monitoring procedures can therefore be planned. The study concludes highlighting that the applied methodology is an effective tool in providing decision support for spatial planning and sustainability assessments.";"Ferretti, Valentina

Habitats rich in plant species in the European rural landscape seem to be correlated with a long continuity of management. Accurate spatial data from historical data sources are fundamental to understand patterns of vegetation and biodiversity in the present-day landscape. However, traditional methods for rectification of non-geometric maps using corresponding points from orthophotos or modern maps are not satisfying, as internal inaccuracies will remain in the maps. This study presents a method to rectify the maps by local warping, thereby eliminating geometrical irregularities. Further, the land-cover changes were calculated and presented as transition matrices. The extent of arable fields and grasslands were analysed in relation to soil characteristics and continuity of management. The results show a dynamic relation between grassland and arable field, albeit the overall proportions remained almost the same between 17th and 18th centuries: 60% grassland to 32% arable field. The most substantial changes in land-cover were prior to 1945. Today there is 18% grasslands left in the study area, while 56% of the land-cover is arable field. Approximately 8% of present-day land-cover is semi-natural grassland 300 years of age or more. Compared to 300 years ago there is only 1% grassland left on peat and 2% on clay. In contrast, grassland covers associated with bare bedrock have been fairly stable in size. All semi-natural grasslands with a long continuity of management were situated on shallow soils, less than 50 cm depth. The major conclusions from this study are that (i) correctly rectified, old maps are very useful to address questions of land-cover changes in historical time, (ii) general trends in land use over 300 years in this hemi-boreal landscape seem to underestimate the full dynamics of land use change, and (iii) only a small proportion of the semi-natural grassland area had a 300 year continuity of management.";"Cousins, Sara A.O.";"";"Kluwer Academic Publishers";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"SWE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500220937";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008108704358";"";"";"";"41-54"

Many fields of study require monitoring of LULC change at a variety of scales. LULC change assessment is dependent upon high-quality input data, most often from remote sensing-derived products such as thematic maps. This research compares pixel- and object-based classifications of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for mapping and analysis of LULC change in the mixed land use region of eastern Ontario for the period 1995–2005. For single date thematic maps of 10 LULC classes, quantitative and visual analyses showed no significant accuracy difference between the two methods. The object-based method produced thematic maps with more uniform and meaningful LULC objects, but it suffered from absorption of small rare classes into larger objects and the incapability of spatial parameters (e.g. object shape) to contribute to class discrimination. Despite the similar map accuracies produced by the two methods, temporal change maps produced using post-classification comparison (PCC) and analysed using intensive visual analysis of errors of omission and commission revealed that the object-based maps depicted change more accurately than maximum likelihood classification (MLC)-derived change maps.";"Dingle Robertson, Laura

The case of Spain";"";"Agricultural trade is by far the largest vehicle to ‘move’ water virtually around the world. Observing that most countries import and export water embedded in the exchanged products, the objective of this study is to assess the virtual water ‘trade’ in Spain for the period 1997-2006. We differentiate between the green and blue components of virtual water from a hydrological and economic perspective. The combination of spatial and time dimensions offers a unique empirical setting to determine whether virtual water ‘trade’ can contribute to reduce water scarcity. The study reveals that Spain is a net ‘importer’ of virtual water. By far the largest virtual water ‘imports’ are linked to cereals and animal feed products whilst the virtual water ‘exports’ are linked to exports of animal products, fruits and vegetables. Virtual water ‘trade’ is one way to reduce the vulnerability of the agri-food sector to climate instability. It reinforces the competitive advantages of its natural endowments capital investments in agriculture. The econometric analysis using provincial water exports water exports are invariable to cyclical water scarcity, and largely explained by fixed factors. Virtual water ‘trade’ does not exacerbate water scarcity, though it is certainly a source of pressure for resources management.";"Garrido, Alberto

Consequently, increased soil erosion can hamper a sustainable land management in the mountainous TGA. This paper presents the model framework TerraCE (Terrace Condition Erosion) for determining the causes for different terrace conditions and terrace degradation based on field surveys and spatial data mining. For a total of 987 bench terrace plots in the Xiangxi catchment we collected data on their state of maintenance and terrace design to account for terrace stability and thus capability of soil conservation. Assessing the driving factors of terrace degradation was done by embedding terrain-based predictors and distance-transforms of remote-sensing data as indicators of environmental and anthropogenic influences. Random forests classification and regression models were applied for data mining. Terrace degradation in the Xiangxi catchment is obvious. The sequence of degradation ranges from ‘well maintained’ (21%), ‘fairly maintained’ (44%), and ‘partially collapsed’ (23%) to ‘completely collapsed’ (11%) terraces. The cross-validation error of the supervised TerraCE model is below 8%, allowing for reasonable and valid interpretations of the causes of terrace degradation. Data mining reveals indicators for anthropogenic effects such as the distance to settlements or to roads as major drivers for the spatial distribution of terrace conditions. The effect of relief, which can be regarded as the major natural driver for terrace degradation by erosive action is tributary but altered and overlaid by land use dynamics associated with the Three Gorges Dam. An important indicator representing a combined effect of terrain and human activity is the distance to stream channels of different orders. Applying TerraCE we reveal mechanisms of terrace degradation in disturbed environments and present a framework for standardized mapping and analysis of terrace degradation under cultivation. The approach might also be used to develop guidelines for terrace planning in mountainous terraced landscapes of limited carrying capacity, with respect to socio-economic as well as environmental conditions.";"Schönbrodt-Stitt, Sarah

Our water temperature readings revealed that the canopy elimination above the streams in the areas damaged by the windstorm caused increase in daily and annual water temperature and also wider daily water temperature range, than those in the undisturbed reference stream, which caused the decline of cold stenotherm species abundance. The stream basins deforestation was collinear with FPOM and UFPOM concentrations, water temperature gradient and nitrate concentrations. Statistical analysis showed that size of stream, conductivity, catchment area and discharge were negatively correlated with the stonefly mesotherm ratio and nitrate contents. Higher average concentrations of nutrients (like NOâ»â) in samples from some streams are a consequence of their mobilization from disturbed forest soils due to the windstorm. Most streams located in the deforested area were found by us in a higher trophic status, especially due the particulate organic matter (POM) content and biofilms amount, what caused increase in some functional feeding groups occurrence (collectorgatherers, scrapers and mainly predators). Stream degradation positively correlated with the percentage of deforested area, ratio of eurytherm taxa, transported organic matter, dissolved organic matter, and biofilms occurrence. The conductivity values measured in water samples were collinear with alkalinity and pH values and increased with watersheds areal extent. We established environmental variables influenced by the windstorm event along the catchment degradation gradient using measurable characteristics of stonefly assemblages and metrics. The proportion of the Leuctridae family and the Nemoura genus expressed as the LN áµ¢âdââ (1) shows a negative correlation with part undisturbed forested areas and channel stability, and positive correlation with stream erosion (expressed as the TAM quantity) in river basins. Proportion of shredders among the investigated streams was significantly higher in deforested streams, and shows lower stability of stonefly community in these habitats, where significantly fluctuate channel stability, water temperature and discharge of these streams.";"Krno, IÄ¾ja

"AGRIS:US2016212765";"Projecting Supply and Demand for Land in the Long Run";"";"The goal of this work is to investigate land-use change at the global scale over the long run  particularly in the context of analyzing the fundamental drivers behind land-use related GHG emissions. For this purpose, we identify the most important drivers of supply and demand for land. On the demand side, we begin with a dynamic general equilibrium (GE) model that predicts economic growth in each region of the world, based on exogenous projections of population, skilled and unskilled labor and technical change. Economy-wide growth is, in turn, translated into consumer demand for specific products using an econometrically estimated, international cross-section, demand system that permits us to predict the pattern of future consumer demands across the development spectrum. This is particularly important in the fast-growing, developing countries, where the composition of consumer demand is changing rapidly. These countries also account for an increasing share of global economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. Consumer demand is translated into derived demands for land through a set of sectoral production functions that differentiate the demand for land by Agro-Ecological Zone(AEZ). The paper devotes considerable attention to modeling the supply of land to different land-using activities in the economy. In order to represent the competition for land among different sectors in the model, we disaggregated the land endowment in each region into Agro-EcologicalZones, drawing on the data base of Lee et al. (2005), to reflect the fact that land is heterogeneous endowment. To further restrict land mobility across uses, land supply within an AEZ is constrained via a nested Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) frontier. In the nestedstructure, land owner of particular type of land (AEZ) first decides on the allocation of land between agriculture and forestry to maximize the total returns from land. Then, based on the relative returns to land in crop and livestock production, the land owner decides on the allocationof land between these two broad types of agricultural activities.A soft link between our GE model and an intertemporal forestry model is included for better representation of forestry sector in GE model. To reflect the real world fact that deforestation represents an important source of land supply in the face of high demand, we also introduce thepossibility of conversion of unmanaged forest land to land used in production. This is treated as an investment decision whereby new land is accessed only when present value of returns on land in a given region is high enough to cover the costs of accessing the new land. In equilibrium, the supply of land to each land-using activity adjusts to meet the derived demand for land. A set of projections for the long run supply and demand for land obtained with this model is a useful input to improving our understanding of land-related GHG emissions in the future.";"Golub, Alla A.

The originality of the approachis to combine statistical data and expert knowledge to describe low-input alternative techniques at thenational level. These data are used in a mathematical programming model to simulate the effect onland use, production and farmers’ income of achieving different levels of pesticide reduction.

It is known that adoption of new technology may vary among farm households because of socio-economic characteristics. This paper intends to typify farm households in Rwanda based on the exploration of factors explaining adoption of new technology. Ultimately, typical farms obtained from the typology will be used, later as basis to develop representative mathematical programming models. Multivariate statistical techniques offer the means of creating such typologies, particularly when an in-depth database is available. This multivariate analysis approach, combining principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA), has allowed us to identify clearly five typical farm households and their socio-economic characteristics explaining adoption of new technology.. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as PCA and CA, are great tools to envisage building mathematical programming models on the basis of typical farm households.";"Bidogeza, J.C.

"AGRIS:US201500193014";"Estimating soil erosion in sub-Saharan Africa based on landscape similarity mapping and using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE)";"";"Soil erosion is one of the major forms of land degradation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with serious impact on agricultural productivity. Due to the absence of reliable data at appropriate resolution and differences in the methods used, there are discrepancies in soil erosion estimates at both continental and basin levels. This study attempts to contribute to the existing regional soil erosion estimates based on a two-stage approach. First, we partitioned SSA into environmental units, so-called similar environmental constraint envelops (SECEs), using broad scale data as proxies of erosion drivers. The SECEs are intended to provide spatial frame for scaling out modeled erosion results. Second, soil erosion estimate is made at two selected basins of the White Volta and the Nile using spatially distributed revised universal soil loss (RUSLE) model. The delineation of SECEs across SSA provided spatially differentiated clusters governed by the existence of similar environmental conditions and soil erosion risk levels. The RUSLE-based estimates show that soil erosion ranges between 0 to 120 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹(overall mean of 35 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) in the White Volta basin, and 0–650 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹(overall mean of 75 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) in the Nile basin. The soil loss estimates show an overall agreement with other studies conducted in the two basins. Our approach provides guidance on where empirically estimated soil erosion for a given SECE can be extrapolated to similar SECE’s with acceptable confidence and where finer SECE’s sub-units should be defined to further collapse the spatial variability of drivers of erosion.";"Tamene, Lulseged

"AGRIS:US201400104710";"Assessment of shallow landslides from Hurricane Mitch in central America using a physically based model";"";"Shallow landslides induced by heavy rainfall events represent one of the most disastrous hazards in mountainous regions because of their high frequency and rapid mobility. Recent advancements in the availability and accessibility of remote sensing data, including topography, land cover and precipitation products, allow landslide hazard assessment to be considered at larger spatial scales. A theoretical framework for a landslide forecasting system was prototyped in this study using several remotely sensed and surface parameters. The applied physical model SLope-Infiltration-Distributed Equilibrium (SLIDE) takes into account some simplified hypotheses on water infiltration and defines a direct relation between factor of safety and the rainfall depth on an infinite slope. This prototype model is applied to a case study in Honduras during Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Two study areas were selected where a high density of shallow landslides occurred, covering approximately 1,200 km2. The results were quantitatively evaluated using landslide inventory data compiled by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) following Hurricane Mitch’s landfall. The agreement between the SLIDE modeling results and landslide observations demonstrates good predictive skill and suggests that this framework could serve as a potential tool for the future early landslide warning systems. Results show that within the two study areas, the values of rates of successful estimation of slope failure locations reached as high as 78 and 75%, while the error indices were 35 and 49%. Despite positive model performance, the SLIDE model is limited by several assumptions including using general parameter calibration rather than in situ tests and neglecting geologic information. Advantages and limitations of this physically based model are discussed with respect to future applications of landslide assessment and prediction over large scales.";"Liao, Zonghu

Far less is understood about how more-common species, that are less dependent on interior forests, use both forested and non-forested habitat in fragmented landscapes. Using both behavioral observations and radio-tracking relocation data, I quantified the within-territory use of different land cover types for three tropical songbird species, the dusky antbird (Cercomacra tyrannina), red-throated ant-tanager (Habia fuscicauda), and cocoa woodcreeper (Xiphorhynchus susurrans). Small forest fragments (<50ha) were also surveyed for these same species. Territories of all three species were mostly forest (>75%), with different amounts of non-forested land cover. As predicted, all three species had increased use in forest cover and decreased use where neighboring territories overlapped. In addition all three species had higher use of areas where there were more forest gaps and/or ‘soft edges’ in the vicinity. Dusky antbirds were less likely to use monocultures of non-native grass and impervious surfaces, while the other two species had mixed responses to non-forested habitats. Dusky antbirds and cocoa woodcreepers were observed foraging at higher-than-expected frequencies along ‘hard edges’ of forested habitat. All three species were found in forest fragments even smaller than a minimal home range area estimate. Conservation of more-common bird species in fragmented landscapes can include secondary forests and small remnants but for these three species non-forested land cover alone would not be expected to provide breeding habitat.";"Withey, John C.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400189001";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.08.022";"";"";"";"405-413"
"AGRIS:US201400182055";"Biohydrologic effects of eastern redcedar encroachment into grassland, Oklahoma, USA";"";"Woody encroachment affects the biohydrology of rangelands worldwide and can increase evapotranspiration by increasing plant rooting depth, increasing the duration of the growing season, or by initiating a process of hydrologic recovery in formerly overgrazed landscapes. Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) is encroaching rapidly into rangelands in the Southern Great Plains of the USA, and beyond, including Oklahoma. However, the degree to which increasing growing season duration causes higher evapotranspiration after encroachment is not known. Here we show that increasing the duration of the growing season in north-central Oklahoma’s water-limited climate from seven months (April–October) to 12 months increases modeled evapotranspiration only marginally, from 95% to 97% of precipitation. However, this increase in evapotranspiration with woody encroachment into grassland corresponded to a two-thirds reduction in deep drainage. This study’s estimate of the hydrologic effects of eastern redcedar encroachment is likely to be highly conservative because it does not take into account the runoff-inducing effects of livestock grazing. Comparing simulated hydrologic fluxes in the present study to past work measuring runoff from grazinglands suggests that eastern redcedar encroachment into overgrazed rangelands is likely to increase evapotranspiration significantly. Whether or not eastern redcedar encroachment effects on evapotranspiration are discernable at the watershed scale will depend on the extent of encroachment throughout the watershed. Further research is necessary to quantify how the hydrologic effects of eastern redcedar encroachment vary due to climatic gradient.";"Wine, Michael L.

Its causes were analysed through various thematic attribute data layers for the study area. Firstly, landslide locations were identified in the study area from the interpretation of aerial photographs, satellite imageries, field surveys, reports and previous landslide inventories. Topographic, geologic, soil and satellite images were collected and processed using Geographic Information System and image processing tools. There are 12 landslide-inducing parameters considered for the landslide hazard analyses. These parameters are: topographic slope, topographic aspect, plan curvature, distance to drainage and distance to roads, all derived from the topographic database; geology and distance to faults, derived from the geological database; landuse/landcover, derived from Landsat satellite images; soil, derived from the soil database; precipitation amount, derived from the rainfall database; and the vegetation index value, derived from SPOT satellite images. In addition, hazard analyses were performed using landslide-occurrence factors with the aid of a statistically based frequency ratio model. Further, landslide risk analysis was carried out using hazard map and socio-economic factors using a geospatial model. This landslide risk map could be used to estimate the risk to population, property and existing infrastructure like transportation networks. Finally, to check the accuracy of the success-rate prediction, the hazard map was validated using the area under curve method. The prediction accuracy of the hazard map was 89%. Based on these results the authors conclude that frequency ratio models can be used to mitigate hazards related to landslides and can aid in land-use planning.";"Pradhan, Biswajeet

Volkart ex Schinz and R. Keller and Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene, in a greenhouse replacement series experiment. In mixture, aboveground production of S. americanus was significantly higher than production of D. spicata. When plant canopy was experimentally removed, this difference was stronger (366±35gm⁻² vs. 139±41gm⁻²; P=0.0033) than when it was left intact (383±44gm⁻² vs. 215±67gm⁻²; P=0.07). Belowground yield of S. americanus was significantly higher than yield of D. spicata (113±27gm⁻² vs. 57±20gm⁻²; P=0.047) in pots with canopy removal. In control pots, there was no significant difference between the belowground yields of the two species (P=0.23). Comparisons of relative yields of the two species (based on biomass and stem density measurements) indicated that S. americanus suppressed D. spicata when the plant canopy was removed. This suggests that canopy disturbance gives S. americanus a competitive advantage over D. spicata in mixed compositions. Anthropogenic disturbances such as prescribed fire and grazing used as land management techniques are likely to influence competitive interactions and play a key role in plant community productivity.";"Bickford, Wesley A.

At the epicenter of this crisis lies Southeast Asia, where biodiversity‐rich forests are being converted to oil‐palm monocultures. As demand for palm oil increases, there is an urgent need to find strategies that maintain biodiversity in plantations. Previous studies found that retaining forest patches within plantations benefited some terrestrial taxa but not others. However, no study has focused on aquatic taxa such as fishes, despite their importance to human well‐being. We assessed the efficacy of forested riparian reserves in conserving freshwater fish biodiversity in oil‐palm monoculture by sampling stream fish communities in an oil‐palm plantation in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Forested riparian reserves maintained preconversion local fish species richness and functional diversity. In contrast, local and total species richness, biomass, and functional diversity declined markedly in streams without riparian reserves. Mechanistically, riparian reserves appeared to increase local species richness by increasing leaf litter cover and maintaining coarse substrate. The loss of fishes specializing in leaf litter and coarse substrate decreased functional diversity and altered community composition in oil‐palm plantation streams that lacked riparian reserves. Thus, a land‐sharing strategy that incorporates the retention of forested riparian reserves may maintain the ecological integrity of fish communities in oil‐palm plantations. We urge policy makers and growers to make retention of riparian reserves in oil‐palm plantations standard practice, and we encourage palm‐oil purchasers to source only palm oil from plantations that employ this practice.";"Giam, Xingli

The integral aim of this concept of rural development is the maximization ofeconomic results, besides the sustainable development of rural areas, environmentalprotection and the production of strategic (staple) agricultural products.The objective of this paper is to define the general, theoretical, quantitative model forthe determination of the size and quality of agricultural land which, considering theabove-mentioned demands (criteria) is optimal for the utilization in agriculturalproduction in certain regions. The remaining agricultural land would be available forthe non-agricultural purposes.The economic optimal model for the selection of agricultural land in the traditionalagriculture is the model of linear programming. The criteria of the land selectionfor traditional agriculture are the economic effectiveness (measured by net incomeor by gross national product) and the economic efficiency (measured by theproduction economy). The maximum economic effectiveness is determined by thestandard method of linear programming and the maximum economy by the methodof broken linear programming. The solution of compromise can be determined bymulti-criteria programming, based on the minimum differences.The limitation groups in the mentioned variations of the model are: limitations ofproduction quotas of agricultural products, minimum quantities of staple agriculturalproducts, limitations of processing plants in a region (minimum and maximum),limitation of crop rotation, limitations of the needs in animal husbandry for bulky forageand limitations of agricultural land according to various types of utilization.

At first, the landslide locations (528 landslides) were identified by interpretation of aerial photographs, satellite images and field surveys, and then to calculate the fractal dimension (D), we used the computer programming named as FRACEK. In the next step, geometrical characteristics of each landslide such as length (L) and width (W) were calculated by ArcGIS software. The landslide polygons were digitized from the mentioned landslide inventory map and rotated based on movement direction. The fractal dimension for all landslides varied between 1.665 and 1.968. Subsequently, the relationship between the length/width ratios and theirs fractal D values for 528 landslides was calculated. The results showed that correlation coefficients (R), which are different regression models such as exponential, linear, logarithmic, polynomial, and power, between D and L/W ratio are relatively high, respectively (0.75, 0.75, 0.76, 0.78, and 0.75). It can be concluded that the fractal dimension values and geometry characteristics of landslides would be useful indices for the management of hazardous areas, susceptible slopes, land use planning, and landslide hazard mitigation.";"Pourghasemi, H.

Nonetheless, previous research has focused primarily on the dynamic implications of input management and ignored land-use choice. This paper extends this theory through an examination of the intertemporal management of agricultural land through the use of non-crop inputs, such as fertilizer, and land uses that either degrade or restore productivity. The need to consider the relative total asset value of alternative crops over time is demonstrated. Moreover, higher output prices for degrading crops are shown to increase their relative value, motivating the later adoption of substitutes. An inability of land markets to reflect differencesin resource quality and low capital malleability promote greater degradation. However,  substitution of complementary effects through input use may help to sustain productivity. These factors are discussed in the context of crop sequence management in Western Australian cropping systems.";"Doole, Graeme J.

The aim of the present study is to show how fuzzy analysis can be implemented when running a water quality assessment, and then focus on a relevant case study. Fuzzy logic approach is studied in order to manage the subjectivity of the analysis, in which examined indicators are classified after data fuzzification and a subsequent defuzzification. A potential optimization of water quality assessment would then reduce sampling frequencies when downward or steady-state trends are found during monitoring campaigns.

"AGRIS:US2016208685";"IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL POLICY REFORM ON LAND PRICES: A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE";"";"Agricultural policy support to farmers is being reconsidered in most industrialized countries.  The adverse incentive structure of price support is generally considered to be inadequate. Income support schemes may therefore be preferable in view of externalities of agricultural production such as the development and maintenance of nature.  A plethora of studies comprises estimates of the impact of a sustained future benefit stream (among other things through continued price and income support) on land prices.  The empirical results of these studies vary considerably.  We apply meta-analytical methods to identify the factors explaining this variation in capitalization of future benefits in agricultural land prices.  The resultant information is of crucial importance given the current change from price support to income support in agricultural policymaking.  The results of the meta-analysis show that there is considerable variation due to the way in which income is taken into account, and the way in which expectations of future benefits are operationalized.  There is also evidence that a change from a mixed price and income support scheme to a system of income support will result in substantially lower capitalization in land values.";"Oltmer, Katrin

"AGRIS:US201500193170";"Effectiveness of land management measures to reduce coastal georisks, eastern Québec, Canada";"";"Erosion and flooding are geohazards that pose a significant problem in eastern Québec, as they do throughout the world. To manage such risks, zoning to set limits on new construction projects is generally the first adaptation solution introduced in an area. However, very few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of zoning in terms of risk reduction. Offered here is a retrospective approach to evaluate the evolution of settlement in coastal areas before and during the progressive implementation of zoning laws and regulations in the Percé region of eastern Québec, Canada. It was possible to evaluate the evolution of the built environment and coastal hazards by using 6 series of aerial photographs (1934–2001) and archived processed in a GIS. The results show a significant change in coastal land use. At first land use was consistent with a fishery-based economy, and later with an economy based on the tourism industry. Such a transformation in human activity leads to changes in the typology of the built environment, and consequently to an increase in the value of buildings at risk. Due to widespread ignorance respecting the intensity of hazards and the rhythm of coastal evolution, a lack of understanding and acceptance of land management regulations, an excessive level of confidence respecting anti-erosion protective structures and conscious risk taking by property owners seeking to take advantage of the coast’s attractiveness among others for tourism purposes, the implementation of land use planning and development laws and regulations in the 1980s was not able to limit the number of buildings at risk in the coastal zone. In fact, a 133% increase in buildings at risk was observed between 1980 and 2001. Only one quarter of this increase can be attributed to the coastline’s movement caused by erosion, whereas 74% of the buildings newly at risk were new, built in a zone where building was prohibited. Poorly adapted measures that limited risks over an insufficient period were also observed. Such observations reveal a problem of governance respecting the management and prevention of natural coastal hazards. While it may be useful to redefine measures for the zoning of coastal risks with precision and based on criteria that take into account the dynamics of coastal hazards, zoning on its own is no guarantee of risk reduction. Such zoning measures must be developed and applied along with a strategy for communicating hazards and risk to all actors in the coastal zone. Due to the complexity of the problems involved, reinforcing adaptive capacities of coastal communities with respect to coastal hazards requires a process whose efficiency is ensured by close collaboration among the various actors (scientists, managers, levels of government, the general public).";"Drejza, Susan

Most of Aceh communities are composed of small scale farmers with land ownership averaging from 0.25 to 4 ha per capita; they plant various trees species (fruits, rubber, cocoa, etc.) in a mixed-tree based system (agroforestry) with extensive management. In Aceh' village markets most fruit is produced by local farmers. Increased prices for fruits in the Aceh region has urged the farmers to enhance their fruit production by planting more fruit trees. Farmers prefer to plant tree species that have good market prices and are easy to domesticate, such as durian, rambutan, mango and duku. However, currently farmers have limited access to good quality fruit seedlings. Farmers with financial resources buy seedlings from Medan while most cash-limited farmers produce seedlings themselves. Farmers need good quality fruit germplasm resources if they are going to produce high-quality seedlings. As part of the post-tsunami and conflict rehabilitation activities in Aceh region, we inventoried fruit germplasm resources (both indigenous and introduced cultivars) and demands in Aceh as a source for livelihood and to ensure food security (nutritional standpoint) particularly of the local community. The work was completed through discussion with local stakeholders (farmers, governments, universities) and by direct observation. In this paper, we list the fruit germplasm resources' location and condition in Aceh and how small scale farmers could access and use it to improve their fruit production.";"Martini, E.

Several parameters were considered in this study, including the annual average, minimum and maximum temperatures, annual precipitation, slope, elevation, and some soil properties such as organic matter, pH, EC, texture, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, and zinc. The environmental parameters and the classification system used in the this work are inspired by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) method dedicated to land suitability. In determining the weights of parameters, expert opinions were consulted and the final land suitability map was generated in five classes. As evidenced by the results, it was estimated that 23.48% of the study area (48,354.5ha) is highly suitable for faba bean cropping, while 25.38% (52,237.37ha) is moderately suitable and 25.03% (51,522.85ha) is marginally suitable. In addition, our results indicated that just 26.11% of total agricultural lands are non-suitable for crop production. The currently non-suitable (49,778.80ha) and permanently non-suitable (3997.09ha) classes are located in the north and northwest parts of Gonbad-Kavous township.

The developed methodology is applicable to other source watersheds to determine ecosystem services for water quality. We assess the value of forest land for source water mitigation of total organic carbon (TOC) through the use of linked watershed and reservoir simulation models and cost-based valuation economics. Watershed modeling results indicated that expected urbanization will increase TOC loads to Converse Reservoir (Mobile, AL). Reservoir model results indicated that future median TOC concentrations increased by 1.1 mg·L-1 between 1992 and 2020 at the source water intake. Depending upon dynamic reservoir TOC concentrations, additional drinking water treatment with powdered activated carbon (PAC) often is necessary between May and October to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. The cost for additional treatment was calculated using minimum and maximum volume treated with simulated TOC concentrations at the source water intake. Daily simulated TOC concentrations for the base scenario using 1992 land cover (3% urban) were compared with simulated TOC concentrations following forest to urban land conversion predicted in the watershed by 2020 (22% urban). The daily cost for additional drinking water treatment with PAC was calculated if simulated TOC concentrations exceeded 2.7 mg·L-1. The mean increase in daily treatment costs between base and future scenarios ranged from $91 to $95 per km2 per day for forest land water purification ecosystem services.";"Elias, Emile

To address this issue, the study herein suggests implementing a new location-planning and assignment model to reduce the number of existing recycling centers. Such a reduction would reduce the use of land resources. Moreover, the total transportation distance would decrease through the efficient assignment of collection depots to recycling centers. On the basis of results from previous studies, this study proposes a 2-stage location set covering problem–P-median integrated model that obtains exact solutions using heuristic algorithms on the basis of set operations. The results of numerical analyses show that the model introduced in this study is effective in solving the problems stated above as well as in improving the layout of Taiwan's existing recycling centers.";"Ye, Lin

After analysing and evaluating soil properties, suitability maps were generated for both methods by means of remote sensing (RS) and a geographic information system (GIS). The results showed that 9031 ha (21.5%) of the studied area was highly suitable for surface irrigation methods, whereas 32 500 ha (77.5%) of the study area was highly suitable for drip irrigation methods. Also some land units covering an area of 2111 ha (5.0%) were not suitable to be used for surface irrigation systems. One land unit with an area of 724 ha (1.7%) was classified as not suitable for drip irrigation systems. Moreover, the results indicated that a larger amount of the land (30 100 ha - 71.8%) can be classified as more suitable for drip than surface irrigation. Ultimately, the application of a drip irrigation system was suggested as the best method to be applied to the study area. The main limiting factors in using surface irrigation methods in this area were sandy soil texture and slope; moreover, for drip irrigation methods, the main limiting factor was soil calcium carbonate.

This paper reviews the state of GHG emissions forecasting methods for project-level development. We argue that when forecasting changes in regional emissions it is important to make explicit what is assumed about a project′s effect on the population of residents and businesses in the region. We present five regional growth assumptions capturing the range of ways that project-level development might influence (i) construction and occupancy of similar developments elsewhere in a region and (ii) relocation of the initial activities that occur on-site before the project is built. We show that current forecasting tools inconsistently address the latter when they are interpreted as forecasted changes in regional emissions. Using a case study in Yolo County, California we demonstrate that forecasted changes in regional emissions are greatly affected by the regional growth assumption. In the absence of information about which regional growth assumption is accurate, we provide guidelines for selection of a conservative regional growth assumption.";"Rowangould, Dana

Some implications for their use as indicators of soil quality";"";"Although a great deal of information exists about the effect of land use on soil enzyme activities, much of this is contradictory and brings into question the suitability of soil enzyme activities as indicators of how land use affects soil quality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of land use on different soil biochemical properties, especially hydrolytic enzyme activities, with the aim of providing knowledge about the problems related to the use of enzymes as indicators of soil quality. The data presented derive from various studies in which a large number of soils under different types of forest or agricultural management were analysed by the same methods. All of the soil samples were characterized in terms of their main physical and chemical properties, the activity of several hydrolases, microbial biomass C and soil basal respiration. The results indicate that soil use causes a large reduction in organic matter content and that the effect on enzyme activity varies depending on the type of land use or management and the type of enzyme. Furthermore, the enzyme activities per carbon unit (specific activities) in soils affected by land use are almost always higher than in maximum quality soils (climax soils under oak vegetation or oak soils), and land use also generates greater increases in the specific activity as the C content decreases. The mechanism responsible for these increases probably involves loss of the most labile organic matter. Enzyme enrichment is not always produced to the same degree, as it varies as a function of the enzyme and the type of land use under consideration. It is concluded that the complexity of the behaviour of the soil enzymes raises doubts about the use of enzyme activities as indicators of soil degradation brought about by land use.";"Trasar-Cepeda, C.

"AGRIS:US201300929091";"Suitability of enzyme activities for the monitoring of soil quality improvement in organic agricultural systems";"";"There is growing interest in the applications of soil enzymes as early indicators of soil quality change under contrasting agricultural management practices. However, despite there being an abundant literature on this subject, most comparative assessments have been based on a limited number of experimental farms and, therefore, conclusions are not as robust as desired. In this study, we compare 18 pairs of organic and neighbouring conventional olive orchards in southern Spain. These sites were selected to allow the definition of the relative contributions of site-landscape features, soil type, and time since organic accreditation and tillage intensity, on the soil quality. Soils were analysed for physico-chemical properties, the activities of dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and potential nitrification. The geometric mean of the assayed enzymes (GMea) was validated with an independently performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and used as a combined soil quality index. The effects of tillage intensity and time since organic accreditation on the improvement of soil quality were also evaluated within the subset of organic farms. Overall for the 18 sites, contrasted management practices did not differ in their impact on basic soil physico-chemical properties, except for loss of on ignition and available inorganic N which were higher and lower in organic farms, respectively. Organic management resulted in significantly higher soil enzyme activities. However, differences were not significant in some of the paired comparisons when considered individually. This highlights the need for extensive comparative assessment, as in this study, to draw clear conclusions concerning the changes to soil quality under sustainable management practices. The GMea was significantly correlated with the first axis of the PCA and shown to be appropriate for condensing the set of soil enzyme values to a sole numerical value. Soil quality changes in organic versus conventional farms, as measured by the GMea, ranged from -23% to 97%, and was highly dependent on time since organic accreditation (r = 0.88; P < 0.01). On the other hand, tillage intensity clearly tended to delay any progress in soil quality in the organic farms.";"García-Ruiz, Roberto

Three measures of efficiency are used: (1) the capitalization of support into farmland values, (2) the rate of income stabilization, and (3) the effect of past government support on the variance of income. We derive transfer efficiency estimates by applying panel econometric techniques to provincial time series data. With regard to the capitalization formula, we find that the capitalization of government into farmland values is homogeneous across provinces. We estimate the rate of capitalization at approximately $11.76 for every $1.00 increase in government support. A substantial amount of heterogeneity was found for the stabilization equation. Four homogeneous regions were found for Canada: 1) Maritimes; 2) Central Canada; 3) Western Canada; and 4) British Columbia.  Among these heterogeneous regions, substantial differences in the stabilization coefficient estimates were found. There is also evidence of a trend in government payments in the Maritimes, indicating evidence of rent seeking. The variance of income was found to be correlated with past levels of government support, indicating that government support may be causing a moral hazard problem.";"Thibodeau, David R.

On the other side are those whounderscore the complexity of customary rights and the need to account for dynamism andflexibility in drylands environments in particular. It explores innovative examples ofdealing with secure access to resources and comes to the conclusion that process, ratherthan content, should be the focus of policy makers. Any attempt to secure access formultiple users in variable drylands environments should identify frameworks for conflictresolution, in a negotiated manner, crafting rules from the ground upwards, in addition toa more generalized or generic identification of rights. Elite capture and exclusion ofwomen and young people continue to pose significant challenges in such decentralizedprocesses. For rights to be meaningfully secured there is need to identify the nature andsources of threats that create insecurities.";"Mwangi, Esther

We used Global Positioning System data collected from telemetered female elk (Cervus elaphus) to evaluate effects of refuges (areas where hunting was prohibited), spatial variation in hunting risk, and landscape attributes on resource selection within an established Greater Yellowstone Area, USA, winter range. We also evaluated elk distributions during and outside of a late-season hunting period. Refuge areas and landscape attributes such as habitat type and snow water equivalents (SWE) affected resource selection. Elk selection for flat grasslands increased as SWE increased, likely because these areas were windswept, leaving grasses exposed for foraging. Elk distributions differed during hunting and no-hunting periods. During the hunting period, elk shifted to privately owned refuge areas and the estimated odds of elk occupying refuge areas more than doubled. Risk-driven changes in resource selection resulted in reduced availability of elk for harvest. Elk selection for areas where hunting is prohibited presents a challenge for resource managers that use hunting as a tool for managing populations and influences grazing patterns on private ranchlands.";"Proffitt, Kelly M.

"AGRIS:US201600109306";"Change in soil organic carbon between 1981 and 2011 in croplands of Heilongjiang Province, northeast China";"";"BACKGROUND: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is fundamental for mitigating climate change as well as improving soil fertility. Databases of SOC obtained from soil surveys in 1981 and 2011 were used to assess SOC change (0–20 cm) in croplands of Heilongjiang Province in northeast China. Three counties (Lindian, Hailun and Baoqing) were selected as typical croplands representing major soil types and land use types in the region. RESULTS: The changes in SOC density (SOCD) between 1981 and 2001 were −6.6, −14.7 and 5.7 Mg C ha⁻¹ in Lindian, Hailun and Baoqing Counties respectively. The total SOC storage (SOCS) changes were estimated to be −11.3, −19.1 and 16.5% of those in 1981 in the respective counties. The results showed 22–550% increases in SOCS in rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddies in the three counties, but 28–33% decreases in dry cropland in Lindian and Hailun Counties. In addition, an increase of 11.4 Mg C ha⁻¹ in SOCD was observed in state‐owned farms (P < 0.05), whereas no significant change was observed in family‐owned farms. CONCLUSION: Soil C:N ratio and initial SOCD related to soil groups were important determinants of SOCD changes. Land use and residue returning greatly affected SOC changes in the study region. To increase the topsoil SOCD, the results suggest the conversion of dry croplands to rice paddies and returning of crop residue to soils. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry";"Li, Lu‐Jun

"AGRIS:US201301607189";"Ad hoc rural regionalism";"";"A new regionalism has been much documented and researched for metropolitan areas; this article documents that there is a new rural regionalism as well. In the United States, these groups appear most likely to emerge in areas that are challenged by outcomes characterizing globalization's effects on the rural condition: namely, exurban or metropolitan sprawl and the resulting landscape fragmentation, often in combination with extreme pressure on the profitability of small farms or other resource uses. This research asks: what impetus is behind rural regional efforts; and what sort of processes of institutionalization do these groups utilize? The paper builds on theory developed by the new regional geographers over the last twenty years, most notably Anne Gilbert and Anssi Paasi, and applies the theoretical framework to three North American case studies in what can be classified as ad hoc rural initiatives in contested landscapes, initiated by local or grassroots actors to foster a specific conceptualization of region. While specific programming varies for different groups, rural regionalism addressed the balance between and interconnections of landscape and land use change, social networks, economic viability, and impacts of global industry. Central to the case studies are actors' efforts to create a regional identity, including forming institutions, defining regional boundaries, and identifying social/symbolic shapes for the region. The research discusses the importance of viewing regionalization through the lens of agency.";"Hamin, Elisabeth M.

Attention has been given to the investigation of soil contamination; however, there is little information available on the variation of heavy metal pollution in soils. To resolve this problem and provide references on similar regions, 18 topsoil (0∼20 cm) samples were collected from identical sites of districts that with different functions in Kaifeng City in 1994 and 2012. Total contents of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were determined by standard methods. The variation of heavy metal pollution was evaluated by using geoaccumulation index and pollution load index. Results show a descending trend in heavy metal pollution of soil in Kaifeng City that demonstrated over the last 20 years, though there are still some contaminations in 2012. The highest concentration of soil metal was observed in industrial district, followed by the cultural and educational district, administrative business district, and entertaining district in turn. Concentrations of Pb in all soils and As in most soils were higher in 2012 than that in 1994, which mainly due to the rapid increase of motor vehicles and domestic garbage. Meanwhile, the concentrations of Hg and Cd in most soils were lower in 2012 than that in 1994, as the relocation and shutdown of industry and the wide development of environmental facilities. Land use and land cover change in urban areas can effect on soil metal pollution. When farmland transforms into urban land, the concentrations of soil metals would be increased, and also, the soil pollution will increase severely.";"Liu, Dexin

This conflict concerns the disputes between farmers and social movements, in which the landowners questioned the legality of the invasion for agrarian reform and compliance with the immediate mandate of reinstatement of possession when there is invasion of property. On the side of the social movements, land invasions have become the main form of pressure) to speed up expropriation processes and settlements. Having as institutional landmark, the ""anti-invasion Law"", associated with the report on properties invaded released by the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Parana (Faep in Portuguese), it was developed an empirical model applied to land owners in conflict areas encompassing invasions occurred over 2000 and 2006. Based on the premises of the New Institutional Economics and on the analysis of land property rights and private investments, this study examined the relation between the variable ""invasion period"" (proxy for the property right insecurity) and ""land productivity level"" (proxy for investment), by comparing farmers productivity before and after the invasion. The descriptive results showed important effects on investment decisions of producers and a greater complexity of the relationship between variables.

O objetivo desta pesquisa foi investigar um tipo específico de conflito fundiário, referente ao processo de invasões de terras (ocupações) realizadas por organizações de movimentos sociais no Brasil. No atual conflito, as invasões tornaram-se o principal instrumento de ""pressão"" sobre os governos para a execução da reforma agrária. Por outro lado, os produtores rurais questionam a legalidade das invasões e pleiteiam o cumprimento imediato dos mandados de reintegração de posse. Tendo como marco institucional a MP 2027-38/2000 (conhecida como lei ""antiinvasão""), mais o relatório de invasões da Federação de Agricultura do Estado do Paraná (Faep), foi desenvolvida uma pesquisa empírica junto aos produtores rurais das principais áreas de conflito, compreendendo as invasões de terra entre 2000 e 2006. Com base na Nova Economia Institucional e nos resultados da literatura empírica sobre direitos de propriedade, a presente pesquisa analisou a relação entre as variáveis ""tempo de invasão"" (proxy para a insegurança do direito de propriedade) e o ""nível de produtividade da terra"" (proxy para investimento), comparando diferentes grupos de produtores e sua produtividade antes e depois da invasão. Os resultados descritivos apontaram importantes efeitos sobre as decisões de investimentos dos produtores e uma complexidade maior entre a relação das variáveis analisadas.";"Nascimento, Viviam Ester de Souza(USP Pensa ,Fatec PG)

This population is managed by a well-defined manager, typically consisting of many landowners operating in a cooperative manner, with the goal of maximizing the present-value hunting related income while taking browsing and grazing damages into account. The red deer population is structured in five categories of animals (calves, female and male yearlings, adult females and adult males). It is shown that differences in the per-animal meat values and survival rates (‘biological discounted’ values) are instrumental in determining the optimal harvest composition. Fertility plays no direct role. It is argued that this is a general result working in stage-structured models with harvest values. In the numerical illustration it is shown that the optimal harvest pattern stays quite stable under various parameter changes. It is revealed which parameters and harvest restrictions that is most important. We also show that the current harvest pattern involves too much yearling harvest compared with the economically efficient level.";"Skonhoft, Anders

Small- scale waterharvesting irrigation systems in Mexico have endured for centuries. They now faceconsiderable challenges with changes in the ejido property rights over land and water, thegrowing importance of alternative sources of livelihoods, and increasing scarcity andcompetition for water within the river basins. Two case studies of water harvestingirrigation systems in the Lerma-Chapala Basin illustrate the response of communities tothese challenges. In the first community, earlier collective action to build the irrigationreservoir provided a platform to address catchment resource use. Water here was lessscarce than in the second community, allowing for good crop productivity throughsufficient irrigation. Water scarcity in the second community increases crop risk;expected sorghum yields during the period of field study did not justify harvesting costsand the crop was used as stover. Members of the second community increased theirdependence on off- farm income sources, but still responded collectively to externalforces claiming the water.";"Scott, Christopher A.

Therefore in this paper we study the impact of declining forest productivity on the land expectation value and the optimal rotation length. We start from the research by Lu and Chang (1996) and try to fill the gap between the stable site productivity (“best”) and the site mining (“worst”) cases. For that we extend the classical Faustmann model by availability of different recovering technologies. In general the model allows the analysis of the two plantation groups: “mining the site by high productive plantation followed by management of degraded areas” and “high productive plantation and regeneration cycling” with the same comparative static. The model, analysis and comparison with the two extreme cases in Lu and Chang (1996) leads to a detailed understanding of land use management when site productivity decline is possible. Particularly the relation between declining periods with intensive land use and land use alternatives after declining periods with regeneration can be well understood. Findings are: Not ever declining process asks for regeneration. Many declining processes can be stopped at early times by high cash flows after mining periods. Shortenings of the regeneration time can boost site mining intensities.";"Halbritter, Andreas

Making use of the 1998-2001 Kyrgyz Household Budget Survey, we show that when the hypothesis of decreasing return to scale holds, the relation between the threshold value of revenue per hectare and the amount of land cultivated is positive. In addition to that, the relation between the threshold and the amount of land owned is positive in the case of continuous supply of land and negative when there isdiscontinuous supply of land. The direct consequence is that, in the first case, smaller farms will be more willing to rent land and exercise the option where, in the second case, larger farms will exercise first. The results corroborate the findings of the theoretical model and suggest threemain conclusions: (i) the combination of uncertainty and irreversibility is a significant factor in the land development decisions, (ii) farmers’ behaviour is consistent with the continuous profit maximization model, (iii) farming unit revenue tends to be positively related to farm size, once uncertainty is properly accounted for.";"Scandizzo, Pasquale Lucio

"AGRIS:LV2016022817";"Stratégie des acteurs face à la multifonctionnalité : le cas de la Guadeloupe et de la Réunion";"";"The multifunctionality of agriculture promoted by the Agriculture Act is difficult to reconcile with the intensive models dominant in Guadeloupe and Reunion. This is made clear by an analysis of the management rules and practices for territorial farming contracts, intended to implement this Act. The difficulty of this reconciliation can also be observed by the impact that the statute’s application has had on its targets — production units. We conducted open or conversation interviews with institutional personnel and with farmers who have signed these contracts. Those signed so far have supported production for export from both places, markedly in Guadeloupe and less so in Reunion. In Guadeloupe, these contracts have rarely served to help develop the practices of participating farmers or to incite new projects. Technical, economic or even organizational innovations have remained more ad hoc than at Reunion. Although the objectives of these contracts have been ""deflected"", this learning process via diversion of the statute augurs well for a better adjustment to the new sustainable agriculture contracts by farmers and the institutions working with them.

La multifonctionnalité de l’agriculture promue par la loi d’orientation agricole (LOA) cohabite difficilement avec les modèles intensifs dominants en Guadeloupe et à la Réunion. L’analyse des règles et des pratiques de gestion des contrats territoriaux d’exploitation (CTE), instruments de la LOA, permet d’en rendre compte. La difficulté de cohabitation s’apprécie également par les impacts que l’application de la LOA a eus sur les unités de production, cibles de la loi. Des entretiens ouverts et non directifs ont été réalisés auprès des institutions d’une part, et auprès d’agriculteurs signataires des CTE, d’autre part. Les CTE signés ont appuyé la production pour l’exportation, de façon marquée en Guadeloupe, de manière plus nuancée à La Réunion. En Guadeloupe, ils ont rarement servi à faire évoluer les pratiques des exploitants signataires ou à susciter de nouveaux projets. Les innovations techniques, économiques ou encore organisationnelles y sont restées plus ponctuelles qu’à la Réunion. Si les objectifs des CTE ont été « détournés », le processus d’apprentissage via le contournement de la LOA augure d’une prise en main plus satisfaisante du contrat d’agriculture durable (CAD) par la profession agricole et les institutions d’accompagnement.";"Dulcire, Michel

Peri-urban forests are under strong anthropic pressure. Any activity needs a previous identification of stakeholders, landscape perception, socio-economic trends in local communities and their relationships with land and natural resources. Kinshasa (capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC) is a 10 millions inhabitants city with rapid growth and increasing impacts on surrounding villages linked with forest natural resources. This paper describes the relationship amongst local communities stakeholders and their relations with land areas and wood resources. Two areas surrounding Kinshasa (Bas-Congo and Bateke Plateaux) are considered as major fuel-wood and charcoal supply zones for the city. Those two areas are different in terms of land pressure (very high in Bas-Congo and focused on riparian forests on Bateke Plateaux), but show the same pattern of overuse of the forest and woody natural resources. In both areas, local management of forest resources by the traditional authorities (heads of village or lineage) has failed. Local population willingness for reforestation and forest restoration activities is much more important in Bas-Congo than on Bateke Plateaux. In both areas, shifting cultivation due to slash and burn practices for agricultural and charcoal practices are more and more quick. This has strong negative impact on the potential of regeneration process with local forest species. Sustainability of forest natural resources management by communities is discussed in regard to the on going negotiations on community based forest management regulations.";"Vermeulen, C.

Assessing the role of biological activity in micro-scale Zn and Pb distributions in A, B and C horizons";"";"This work assesses relationships between characteristic aggregate microstructures related to biological activity in soils under different long-term land use and the distribution and extractability of metal pollutants. We selected two neighbouring soils contaminated with comparable metal loads by past atmospheric deposition. Currently, these soils contain similar stocks, but different distributions of zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) concentrations with depth. One century of continuous land use as permanent pasture (PP) and conventional arable (CA) land, has led to the development of two soils with different macro- and micro-morphological characteristics. We studied distributions of organic matter, characteristic micro-structures and earthworm-worked soil by optical microscopy in thin sections from A, B and C horizons. Concentrations and amounts of total and EDTA-extractable Zn and Pb were determined on bulk samples from soil horizons and on size-fractions obtained by physical fractionation in water. Large amounts of Zn and Pb were found in 2–20-µm fractions, ascribed to stable organo-mineral micro-aggregates influenced by root and microbial activity, present in both soils. Unimodal distribution patterns of Zn, Pb and organic C in size-fractions were found in horizons of the CA soil. In contrast, bimodal patterns were observed in the PP soil, because large amounts of Zn and Pb were also demonstrated in stable larger micro-aggregates (50–100-µm fractions). Such differing distribution patterns characterized all those horizons markedly influenced by earthworm activity. Larger earthworm activity coincided with larger metal EDTA-extractability, particularly of Pb. Hence, land use-related biological activity leads to specific soil microstructures affecting metal distribution and extractability, both in surface and subsurface horizons.";"Fernandez , Christelle

"AGRIS:US201500201569";"Dating and quantification of erosion processes based on exposed roots";"";"Soil erosion is a key driver of land degradation and heavily affects sustainable land management in various environments worldwide. An appropriate quantification of rates of soil erosion and a localization of hotspots are therefore critical, as sediment loss has been demonstrated to have drastic consequences on soil productivity and fertility. A consistent body of evidence also exists for a causal linkage between global changes and the temporal frequency and magnitude of erosion, and thus calls for an improved understanding of dynamics and rates of soil erosion for an appropriate management of landscapes and for the planning of preventive or countermeasures. Conventional measurement techniques to infer erosion rates are limited in their temporal resolution or extent. Long-term erosion rates in larger basins have been analyzed with cosmogenic nuclides, but with lower spatial and limited temporal resolutions, thus limiting the possibility to infer micro-geomorphic and climatic controls on the timing, amount and localization of erosion. If based on exposed tree roots, rates of erosion can be inferred with up to seasonal resolution, over decades to centuries of the past and for larger surfaces with homogenous hydrological response units. Root-based erosion rates, thus, constitute a valuable alternative to empirical or physically-based approaches, especially in ungauged basins, but will be controlled by individual or a few extreme events, so that average annual rates of erosion might be highly skewed. In this contribution, we review the contribution made by this biomarker to the understanding of erosion processes and related landform evolution. We report on recent progress in root-based erosion research, illustrate possibilities, caveats and limitations of reconstructed rates, and conclude with a call for further research on various aspects of root–erosion research and for work in new geographic regions.";"Stoffel, Markus

"AGRIS:US201300945911";"Landowner willingness to participate in a Texas brush reduction program";"";"Because most of Texas consists of privately owned land and the amount of brush cover on rangelands may affect off-site water yields, there has been increasing interest in publicly funded brush clearing programs aimed at increasing water yield. The Pedernales River was selected as 1 of 8 watersheds to determine the feasibility of implementing such a program. A survey questionnaire was mailed to 720 landowners in Blanco and Gillespie County (containing most of the Pedernales watershed) in June 2000 to identify factors that influence their interest in participating in a brush reduction program. The sample consisted of equal numbers of landowners with 4-20, 21-202, and > 202 ha of land. Fifty eight percent of the survey participants responded, 82% of whom answered questions about their willingness to enroll at least part of their land in a brush reduction program. Property size and income from wildlife were found to be significant positive determinants and level of satisfaction with brush a significant negative determinant of respondents' willingness to enroll. To optimize public investments, it may be preferable to maximize the area enrolled in a brush removal program by targeting larger landowners who appear to be willing to enroll larger portions of their land without requiring compensation that exceeds their net cost of enrollment. Because land in the Edwards Plateau is being subdivided and purchased by people who do not depend on land-based income and who may be more tolerant of brush, public funds required to encourage landowner participation may increase over time.";"Kreuter, U.P.

First, I argue that the region's history of settlement, production and political struggle helped to entrench certain normative beliefs around landownership, most notably in its population of semi‐commercial upper peasants. I then detail the ways in which these upper peasants mobilized around notions of distributive justice to successfully press demands for land restitution in the late 1980s, drawing on Vietnamese newspapers and other sources to construct case studies of local land conflicts. Finally, I argue that the successful mobilization of the upper peasants around such a moral economy has helped, over the past two decades, to facilitate the re‐emergence of agrarian capitalism in the Mekong Delta, in contrast to other regions in Vietnam.";"Gorman, Timothy";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land reform;landowners";"";"";"VNM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500146343";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.12047";"";"";"";"501-521"
"AGRIS:US201400024110";"Social vulnerability to climate change in primary producers: a typology approach";"";"Adaptation in agro-ecological systems will be important for moderating the impacts of climate change. Vulnerability assessments provide the basis for developing strategies to reduce social vulnerability and plan for climate adaptation. Primary industries have been identified as the most vulnerable industry sector globally. We review how primary producers might be socially vulnerable to climate change and develop a ‘vulnerability typology’ of cattle producers based on survey responses from 240 producers across northern Australia. We measured social vulnerability according to ten indicators of climate sensitivity (resource dependency) and four indicators of adaptive capacity. Using a K-means clustering analysis we identified four main ‘types’ of cattle producers. Type 1 producers (43%) were vulnerable because they had low strategic skills and low interest in changing behaviour. Mean age was 59 years old, they were weakly networked within the industry and businesses were small. Type II producers (41%) had low strategic skills, poorly managed risk and uncertainty, had medium sized businesses and were 51 years old on average. Only 16% of producers (Type III and IV) appeared to have resilience to change. Type III producers (13.4%) had a stronger psychological and financial buffer, were 52 years old on average, were well-networked and managed or owned larger businesses. Type IV producers (2.6%) managed risk well, liked to experiment with options and were interested in change. They were 41 years old on average, managed large properties, were well-networked, perceived themselves as responsible for the future productivity of their land and were early adopters of new technology. By providing knowledge of the different ways in which people can be vulnerable to climate change, vulnerability assessments can enable decision-makers to prioritise their efforts, provide a basis for early engagement, and tailor a range of adaptation approaches to most effectively accommodate and support the divergent requirements of different ""types"" of resource users.";"Marshall, N.

Observations are drawn from either size of a discontinuous minimum lot size zoning boundary.  Using these selected sub-samples, a binary discrete choice model of residential land use change is estimated using parcel-level data and other spatially explicit data from an exurban county that lies on the fringes of Cleveland, Ohio.

"AGRIS:US201600126586";"Attributing changes in land cover using independent disturbance datasets: a case study of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico";"";"Detailed observations of natural and anthropogenic disturbance events that impact forest structure and the distribution of carbon are essential to estimate changes in terrestrial carbon pools and the associated emissions and removals of greenhouse gasses. Recent advances in remote sensing approaches have resulted in annual and decadal estimates of land-cover change derived from observations using broad-scale moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m–1 km imagery. These land-use change estimates, however, are often not attributed directly to a cause or activity and are not well validated, especially in tropical areas. Knowledge of the type of disturbance that caused the observed land-cover changes is important, however, for the quantification of the associated impacts on ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes. In this paper, we provide estimates of the amount of forest land-cover change in a Mexican forested region and propose an approach for attributing the cause of the observed changes to the underlying disturbance driver. To do so, we collate geospatial and remote sensing data from a variety of sources to summarize statistics about the major disturbances within the Yucatan Peninsula, an “early action” region for the reduction of emissions from deforestation and degradation, from 2005 to 2010. We combine the datasets to develop rules to estimate the likely disturbances that caused the observed land-cover changes based on their spatially explicit location. Finally, we compare our observed disturbance rates to those detected using classified land-cover data derived from MODIS.";"Mascorro, Vanessa S.

Spatial planning aimed at maintaining biological diversity and functionality must consider how changes at landscape and more local scales will influence the biotic structure of urban areas. From May 2006 to July 2010, bird surveys were conducted in three metropolitan parks in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Surveys were conducted with the goal of examining the effect of vegetation structure and adjacent land cover on the distribution and species richness of breeding birds within this park system. A total of 65 species were recorded throughout the study area. Avian species richness was linked to several habitat metrics, measured at both the local and landscape scale. Generally, species richness was highest at locations characterized by moderate forest cover. The proportion of canopy cover at survey sites related negatively to species richness and the density of understory vegetation showed a positive relationship with species diversity. Despite the influence of these three metrics, sensitivity analysis indicates that the density of understory vegetation is the most significant correlate to avian diversity within this suburban park system. Management actions aimed at providing habitat for the greatest diversity of breeding songbirds within the study area should allow for moderate canopy cover while retaining or improving the structural complexity of understory vegetatation.";"Rush, Scott A.

Modeling tools are necessary to consider the complexity of river networks in the determination of the sources and processes by which nutrients are transported at the watershed scale. Mediterranean rivers are potentially vulnerable to climate change (decrease in precipitation and increase of extreme events), and identifying and quantifying nutrient pollution sources and their spatial distribution can improve water resource management at the watershed scale. We apply a hybrid process-based and statistical model (SPARROW, spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes) to a largely disturbed Mediterranean watershed in NE Spain in order to estimate the annual nitrate and phosphate loads reaching the drainage network. The model emphasized the contribution of in-stream processes in nutrient transport and retention, and the inter-annual (7years) effects of hydrological variability on the export of nutrients from the landscape to water bodies. Although forest and grassland land cover types predominate, agricultural activities and human agglomerations were significant sources of nutrient enrichment. Nutrient flux apportionment was also linked to inter-annual hydrological variability. Exported nutrient load increased in the downstream direction and coincided with decreased in-stream nutrient removal, probably worsened by the significant chemical and geomorphological impairment found in the lower parts of the watershed.";"Aguilera, Rosana

"AGRIS:US201400147594";"Managing Spatial and Temporal Switchgrass Biomass Yield Variability";"";"Biorefineries that plan to use switchgrass exclusively will encounter year-to-year variability in feedstock production. The economic success of the biorefinery will depend in part on the ability of the management team to strategically identify land for conversion from current use to the production of switchgrass enabling a flow of feedstock for the life of the biorefinery. The objective of this research is to determine the optimal quality, quantity, and location of land to lease while considering the spatial and temporal variability of switchgrass biomass yield. A calibrated biophysical simulation model was used to simulate switchgrass biomass yields for 50� years based on historical weather data from 1962 to 2011, for three land capability classes for each of 30 counties. Mathematical programming models were constructed and solved to determine the optimal leasing scheme for each of three strategies for a biorefinery that requires 2,000� Mg/day. As expected, a model based on the assumption that the average yield would be obtained in each year finds that production from land identified for leasing would be insufficient to fulfill the biorefinery’s needs in half of the years. In the absence of other sources of biomass, the feedstock shortage would require forced idling of the biorefinery for an average of 29.5� days during these years. Results of a strategy of leasing sufficient land to cover feedstock needs in the worst year from among 50� years for which data are available are compared to that of a strategy enabling year-to-year storage.";"Debnath, Deepayan

"AGRIS:US201600014065";"politics of conservation in contemporary rural China";"";"Placing conservation within a broad framework of agrarian and environmental politics, this review article argues that natural resource governance is fundamental to rural politics in China. Much of the environmental literature adopts a technocratic approach, ignoring the political nature of the redistribution of access to and control over natural resources, and of knowledge vis-à-vis degradation. Reading the managerial literature with and against the grain of political ecological studies, the essay reviews contemporary environmental issues including Payments for Ecosystem Services and other market-based approaches, the establishment of national parks and resettlement schemes justified through ecological rationales. The first section following the introduction focuses on two of the largest forest rehabilitation schemes in the world. Next, the paper reviews work on China's rapidly growing number of nature reserves, examining their role as enclosures and their entanglement with tourism income generation. This is followed by a discussion of research on the politics of rangeland degradation and property rights. The inclusion of pastoralism within the scope of rural politics is sometimes obscured by the fact that China's extensive rangelands coincide almost completely with its minority populations. The misrecognition of rural politics over resources and the environment as ethnic politics is addressed in the concluding section.";"Yeh, Emily T.";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"property rights;rangelands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014065";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.859575";"";"";"";"1165-1188"
"AGRIS:US201400166543";"Minimising the harm to biodiversity of producing more food globally";"";"Should farming and conservation policies aim broadly to separate land for nature and land for production (land sparing) or integrate production and conservation on the same land (wildlife-friendly farming)? Most studies that try to address this question suffer from flaws in sampling design, inappropriate metrics, and/or failure to measure biodiversity baselines. We discuss how these failings can be addressed, and what existing information tells us about the key debates on this topic. The evidence available suggests that trade-offs between biodiversity and yield are prevalent. While there are some wildlife-friendly farming systems that support high species richness, a large proportion of wild species cannot survive in even the most benign farming systems. To conserve those species, protection of wild lands will remain essential. Sustainable intensification could help to facilitate sparing of such lands, provided that as much attention is given to protecting habitats as to raising yields. We discuss the general circumstances under which yield increases can facilitate land sparing, recognising that policies and social safeguards will need to be context-specific. In some situations, bringing degraded lands into production could help reduce pressure on wild lands, but much more information is needed on the biodiversity implications of using degraded lands. We conclude that restricting human requirements for land globally will be important in limiting the impacts on biodiversity of increasing food production. To achieve this, society will need to integrate explicit conservation objectives into local, regional and international policies affecting the food system.";"Phalan, Ben

Conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices, can enhance the SOC pool, improve soil quality, increase agronomic productivity, advance global food security, enhance soil resilience to adapt to extreme climatic events, and mitigate climate change by off-setting fossil fuel emissions. The technical potential of carbon (C) sequestration in soils of the agroecosystems is 1.2–3.1billiontonsC/yr. Improvement in soil quality, by increase in the SOC pool of 1tonC/ha/yr in the root zone, can increase annual food production in developing countries by 24–32milliontons of food grains and 6–10milliontons of roots and tubers.

"AGRIS:US201400152634";"Demographic consequences of climate change and land cover help explain a history of extirpations and range contraction in a declining snake species";"";"Developing conservation strategies for threatened species increasingly requires understanding vulnerabilities to climate change, in terms of both demographic sensitivities to climatic and other environmental factors, and exposure to variability in those factors over time and space. We conducted a range‐wide, spatially explicit climate change vulnerability assessment for Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a declining endemic species in a region showing strong environmental change. Using active season and winter adult survival estimates derived from 17 data sets throughout the species' range, we identified demographic sensitivities to winter drought, maximum precipitation during the summer, and the proportion of the surrounding landscape dominated by agricultural and urban land cover. Each of these factors was negatively associated with active season adult survival rates in binomial generalized linear models. We then used these relationships to back‐cast adult survival with dynamic climate variables from 1950 to 2008 using spatially explicit demographic models. Demographic models for 189 population locations predicted known extant and extirpated populations well (AUC� =� 0.75), and models based on climate and land cover variables were superior to models incorporating either of those effects independently. These results suggest that increasing frequencies and severities of extreme events, including drought and flooding, have been important drivers of the long‐term spatiotemporal variation in a demographic rate. We provide evidence that this variation reflects nonadaptive sensitivity to climatic stressors, which are contributing to long‐term demographic decline and range contraction for a species of high‐conservation concern. Range‐wide demographic modeling facilitated an understanding of spatial shifts in climatic suitability and exposure, allowing the identification of important climate refugia for a dispersal‐limited species. Climate change vulnerability assessment provides a framework for linking demographic and distributional dynamics to environmental change, and can thereby provide unique information for conservation planning and management.";"Pomara, Lars Y.

Already less resilient production areas will suffer the most, as temperatures will rise further in tropical and semi-tropical latitudes and water-scarce regions will face even drier conditions. International trade plays an important role in compensating, albeit partially, for regional changes in productivity that are induced by climate change. While a well-functioning international trade system can support the adaptation to climate change-related challenges, trade policies as such are imperfect instruments to induce less emissions globally. A well-functioning international trading system can support the adaptation to climate change-related challenges. Hence welfare gains from reforms to trade policies may be greater than normally measured if they also reduce GHG emissions globally.";"Huang, Hsin

This paper presents experiences of local communities in diagnosis of SQ and assesses the contribution of local knowledge as a strategy for sustainable development decision making within the Mai-Negus catchment of northern Ethiopia. Participatory transect-walks, group discussions and field observation which complemented by household interview were used to acquire data. Farmers identified SQ indicators e.g., crop yield, soil depth, erosion and sedimentation as their basis of categorizing the soils into high, medium and low SQ. They were also able to identify severely degraded areas (hotspots) and underlying causes. Significant variations (P≤0.05) were shown between the proportions of farmers used certain SQ indicator and those who didn't while categorizing SQ. Local farmers involved in this study demonstrated their capability to suggest appropriate land management solutions for specific problems. This study demonstrates the benefit of involving local farmers in both problem identification and solution development so that anti-degradation technologies can easily be implemented and adopted.";"Tesfahunegn, Gebreyesus Brhane

"AGRIS:US2012211031";"LOCATIONAL EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION ON AGRICULTURE IN SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA";"";"Most agricultural output in the northeastern United States comes from counties that have experienced significant development. A mail survey, with 300 responses, was conducted in southeastern Pennsylvania to determine farmer adaptation to urbanization in this region. Despite development, traditional agriculture still predominates. Changes in land use were examined using multinomial logit models. Results show that changes in population density and farm preservation policies have an influence, as increased population density reduced total land operated and having land in an agricultural security area increased it.  Other measures of urbanization, such as proximity to a city or inter-state highway had no statistically significant effect on farm practices.

The literature also tends to focus solely on direct relationships between various predictors of trust, rather than examining indirect relationships. Using survey data of Escalante, Utah, residents 10 years after designation of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument (GSENM), and via mediation analysis, we find perceived power of local groups and perceptions of the manner of designation work through perceptions of the current GSENM decision-making process to affect trust in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The findings suggest that as participatory processes become more inclusive over time, it is possible that the scars from the manner of designation may be less prominent.";"Petrzelka, Peggy

Over decades, deforestation and land degradation have markedly affected ethnic peoples’ livelihoods in the CHTs. Although communities once managed extensive forest commons to support their livelihood needs, population explosion triggered fragmentation of common land leading to a gradual decline in livelihood opportunities. However, ethnic communities still manage the remnants of those once extensive common resources that are locally known as Village Common Forests (VCFs), which provide valuable resources for community use. An investigation was made of the role of forest income in livelihoods of selected VCF communities in Bandarban and Rangamati districts of the CHTs. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were employed to examine the household livelihood system of the respondents selected at random from 7 villages. Data were collected through participatory rural appraisal and structured quarterly surveys. The contribution of all forest-related income was found to be much smaller (11.59 %) than that of agricultural income (77.02 %) in average total household income. However, VCFs provide bamboos, which are the largest source of household forest income. Moreover, they harbour rich native tree diversity which is vital for maintaining perennial water sources upon which most household livelihood activities depend. Therefore, it seems that rejuvenation of VCFs is crucial to support sustainable community livelihood in the CHTs. A strong political will is necessary to formalize the existence of VCFs in the land-use strategies for the CHTs.";"Misbahuzzaman, Khaled

The aim of the experiment was to assess the short-term performance of Acacia karroo seedlings under different environmental conditions and the implications of such factors on the long-term recruitment of plant species in savanna rangelands. There were no significant treatment effects on the survival of A. karroo seedlings. Using stem length and basal diameter as growth parameters, it was observed that irrigation enhanced both variables, while nitrogen fertilization did not have any significant effects. Clipping, grass competition and their interaction greatly suppressed the growth of the seedlings. Clipping increased the mean stem length when they were irrigated and fertilized. Control and fertilized plants had the highest stem length in the absence of grass competition, while grass competition combined with clipping resulted in the lowest stem length in both irrigated and nonirrigated plants. It was concluded that in the presence of grass competition, controlled browsing could be a viable solution to the problem of bush encroachment in savanna rangelands.";"Mopipi, Keletso

"AGRIS:US201400051803";"century of chasing the ice: delayed colonisation of ice‐free sites by ground beetles along glacier forelands in the Alps";"";"Climate change is affecting species distribution, composition of biological communities, and species traits. Despite the growing body of knowledge on the reaction of species to climate change, the potentially delayed response of species is still severely understudied. In this paper we modelled the time needed by ground‐living invertebrates to effectively react to habitat modification induced by climate change in relation to dispersal abilities. We analyzed the occurrence pattern of alpine ground beetles (carabids) along areas recently freed by retreating glaciers in the central‐eastern Italian Alps, to test how the synergic effects of time since deglaciation and environmental factors may affect the colonisation process. Different times of response to climate change in ground beetles were found. Sites already hosting the land cover type suitable for our study taxon, but ice‐free for less than 100 yr, are mainly colonised by winged carabid beetles (which have high dispersal abilities and are mostly habitat generalists). No, or very few, wingless species (slow colonizers and ecologically specialized) occur within those sites. The overall pattern suggests that within a site, suitable land cover is established prior to colonization, due to a strong joint effect of time since deglaciation and land cover type. Long‐lasting habitat development at the fine scale is likely to result in a lack of specific resources (e.g. food items, or microhabitat), which is likely to contribute to delayed colonisation, which potentially could be tied also to dispersal abilities. Whatever the reason, the existence of a time‐lag often equal to or greater than 100 yr in species colonisation implies caution in predicting species’ occurrence shifts following climate change.";"Brambilla, Mattia

"AGRIS:US201600101561";"Understanding the Characteristics of Non-industrial Private Forest Landowners Who Harvest Trees";"";"Achieving regional and national goals of renewable energy production will depend on sufficient supply of biomass from private forests, the majority of which are controlled by non-industrial private forest landowners (NIPF). Considering the diversity in management objectives and changing demographic dynamics in this ownership group, it is important to understand the characteristics of landowners that may supply woody biomass. This study developed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification tree (CT) models to examine the characteristics and motivation of such NIPF landowners. Thirteen combinations of CT variable selection and split-point selection models were used in conjunction with LDA. The “importance of income” from a woody biomass harvest was the most important factor influencing NIPF landowners’ decisions in supplying woody biomass. Another significant interrelated variable was “farmer or non-farmer” forestland ownership, which was also related with “years of residency”, “availability of a multi-management plan,” and “ownership of multi-tracts of land.” CT models provided higher-level explanatory information when compared with LDA models. Study findings provide useful insight for land managers, wood procurement managers, and policy-makers in identifying the landowner groups with interest in biomass supply, and in understanding the factors influencing their decisions.";"Young, Timothy

This paper aimed to determine the effects of land management changes (LMC) on soil organic carbon (SOC) by re-sampling long-term agoecosystem experiments (LTAEs) across Canada using identical sampling and laboratory protocols. The impact of sampling depth on the monitoring of LMC-induced differences in SOC stock in LTAEs in Canada, and the implications on statistical power and sampling design, were assessed. In most cases, four cores would be suitable for detecting a significant difference in SOC stock of 5 Mg ha−1 at 95% confidence for LMCs in western Canada. The impact of eliminating fallow on SOC stocks was typically restricted to the surface 15 cm. The impact of perennial forages on the average cumulative SOC was sufficiently large to be detectable at all sampling depths (to 60 cm). In three of the six LTAEs sampled in western Canada comparing conventional tillage to no-till, there was a significantly greater SOC storage in the 0- to 30-depth than the 0- to 15-cm depth, suggesting that sampling below 15 cm could be necessary. The same comparisons in eastern Canada suggested that sampling often must exceed the 30-cm depth to account for any changes in SOC due to moldboard plow tillage. Nonetheless, there was little evidence to suggest that increasing sampling intensity or sampling deeper would improve the ability to detect a difference in SOC stocks for this LMC.";"VandenBygaart, A.J.

The study applied the Landsat satellite data to characterize the LULC at Laizhou Bay, Shandong Province, China. Then, the ET and heat fluxes were estimated using the surface energy balance algorithm for land model with two-time phase thermal infrared band images and regional surface parameters. This allowed for the eventual linkage of seawater intrusion to land use/cover changes (LUCC) and ET variations over time. The case study discussed in this paper carried out a coastal landscape dynamics assessment using multi-source and multi-sensor remote sensing technologies. The results are: (1) due to its distance from the sea, the vegetation index (modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, MSAVI) gradually increases with the gradual increase of land use grade (Uindex); (2) there are a variety of types of relational patterns between parameters (LST, Gₙ, MSAVI, and Uindex) and ET (positive, negative, and no relationship); and (3) seawater intrusion significantly affected the spatial pattern of LUCC, which evidently affected the spatial distribution of ET. The spatial distribution pattern and change characteristics of ET were formed by double driving forces of seawater intrusion and LUCC under the background effects of regional climate.";"Cao, Xiaoming

"AGRIS:US201400105436";"Determining the genetic origin of nitrate contamination in aquifers of Northern Gujarat, India";"";"Over the past decades, the Gujarat state of India experienced intensive agricultural and industrial activities, fertilizer consumption and abstraction of groundwater, which in turn has degraded the ground water quality. Protection of aquifers from nitrate pollution is a matter of prime concern for the planners and decision-makers. The present study assessed the spatial and temporal variation of groundwater nitrate levels in areas with different land use/land cover activities for both pre- and post-monsoon period. The pre-monsoon nitrate level (1.6–630.7� mg/L) in groundwater was observed to be higher as compared to the post-monsoon level (2.7–131.7� mg/L), possibly due to insufficient recharge and evaporation induced enrichment of agrichemical salts in groundwater. High HCO₃ ⁻ (200–1,000� mg/L) as well as SO₄ ²⁻/Cl⁻ (0.111–0.992) in post-monsoon period provides a favourable environment for denitrification, and lower the NO₃ levels during the post-monsoon period. The K vs NO₃ scatter plot suggests a common source of these ions when the concentration is <5� mg/L, the relationships between different pollutants and nitrate also suggest that fertilizers and other sources, such as, animal waste, crop residue, septic tanks and effluents from different food processing units present in the area can be attributed to higher nitrate levels in the groundwater. Appropriate agronomic practices such as application of fertilizers based on calibrated soil tests and proper irrigation with respect to crop can minimize the requirement for inorganic fertilizers, which can bring down the cost of cultivation considerably, and also protect groundwater from further degradation.";"Rina, Kumari

"AGRIS:US201301572286";"Landscape Planning for Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Reduction III: Assessing Phosphorus and Sediment Reduction Potential";"";"Riparian buffers have the potential to improve stream water quality in agricultural landscapes. This potential may vary in response to landscape characteristics such as soils, topography, land use, and human activities, including legacies of historical land management. We built a predictive model to estimate the sediment and phosphorus load reduction that should be achievable following the implementation of riparian buffers; then we estimated load reduction potential for a set of 1598 watersheds (average 54 km²) in Wisconsin. Our results indicate that land cover is generally the most important driver of constituent loads in Wisconsin streams, but its influence varies among pollutants and according to the scale at which it is measured. Physiographic (drainage density) variation also influenced sediment and phosphorus loads. The effect of historical land use on present-day channel erosion and variation in soil texture are the most important sources of phosphorus and sediment that riparian buffers cannot attenuate. However, in most watersheds, a large proportion (approximately 70%) of these pollutants can be eliminated from streams with buffers. Cumulative frequency distributions of load reduction potential indicate that targeting pollution reduction in the highest 10% of Wisconsin watersheds would reduce total phosphorus and sediment loads in the entire state by approximately 20%. These results support our approach of geographically targeting nonpoint source pollution reduction at multiple scales, including the watershed scale.";"Diebel, Matthew W.

This paper focuses on the potential impact of the reform on land idling decisions in France with the help of a survey of the intentions of landowners. Both operator and non-operator landowners were considered since, although SFP entitlements are owned only by operator landowners in France, non-operator landowners may now have a higher incentive to switch to operating land by idling land and maintaining it under GAEC in order to claim SFPs. The key variables in landowners’ decisions to idle land in GAEC appear to be both monetary and non-monetary. Despite the likely difference in conversion and cross-compliance costs, operators and non-operators were shown to be equally uninterested in GAEC, suggesting that no dramatic changes in terms of idling land should occur in France as a result of the 2003 reform.";"Bougherara, Douadia

In this study, we used testate amoebae in sediments from a mire in the western Alps (Lac du Thyl) to: (1) reconstruct the hydrology of the site over the last 7,000 years, (2) determine how hydrological changes affected testate amoebae diversity and (3) infer past trophic state shifts. The study site is located in one of the driest valleys of the Alps and is thus very sensitive to hydrological changes. Our study revealed that the water table depth increased (dry conditions) between 5,800 and 4,000 cal year BP. This triggered establishment of a Sphagnum-type peat and acidic conditions from 5,700 to 4,000 cal year BP. These processes were independent of ongoing transformations of the terrestrial vegetation and soil in the catchment area. After 1,690 cal year BP, the depth to the water table decreased (wetter conditions) and a minerotrophic fen developed. At the same time, the diversity of testate amoebae increased, probably as a result of deforestation that supported the expansion of grassland. Climate and land use were apparently more important factors controlling the lake hydrology than were changes in vegetation and soil in the catchment. Testate amoebae diversity was linked to land cover. Changes in pH were controlled indirectly by external forcing (climate), but more directly by fluctuations in the level of the water table (internal forcing) and autogenous expansion of Sphagnum.";"Oris, France

After a sustained growth for 50 years, plantation forests (softwood and hardwood on both private and public lands) amounted to 18 million ha or 24 percent of all timberlands in these states in 2007. The vast majority of the plantation forests were established on private lands with fast-growing loblolly pines and slash pines. While purposeful hardwood plantations were rare, there were hardwood stands growing on failed pine plantation sites. Using a two-stage Markov land use transition model, we forecast that private forest land in these states will decline about 7 percent or from 66 million ha in 1997 to 61 million ha in 2027, primarily due to urbanization, and that private pine plantations will rise nearly 40 percent from 11 million ha to 16 million ha. Further, growth in pine plantations will decline in coming decades, and states with low population and population growth have the greatest increase in plantations. These plantations, along with other woody biomass, are expected to play an important role in the emerging bio-energy sector.";"Zhang, Daowei

Climate conditions in Mediterranean ecosystems have undergone, and are projected to undergo, significant change in the future with marked impacts on forest and shrubland vegetation. In the southwest of Australia (SWAU), endemic tree species have experienced significant declines in health and mortality since the early 1990s primarily due to these climatic changes. In this paper we examine trends in Net Primary Production (NPP) from 2000 to 2011 as an indicator of productivity and health condition of the woody vegetation across the SWAU region. To do so, we examine NPP estimates derived from satellite imagery and climate data to answer the questions: (1) what is the extent and rate of change in NPP for the SWAU region over the study period, and (2) how important is fire as a contributing factor in the observed trends? Our results suggest that, similar to the global trend in Mediterranean ecosystems, between 2000 and 2011, overall NPP declined across the study region, with the majority of declines occurring in the ecological transition zone between trees and shrubs. Twenty-six percent of the 37,042 square kilometre of woody vegetation that showed a declining NPP trend, was affected by fire. The overall rate of NPP decline for the region was estimated to be â0.38 megaton C per year since 2000, indicating a reduction in the capacity of the region to act as a carbon sink. Under climate change projections, the observed decline trends are likely to continue and our results suggest that the carbon storage potential in this region is gradually decreasing following an ecological shift from tall tree-dominated to lower shrub-dominated vegetation.";"Brouwers, Niels Christiaan

In this region, the degree of freedom to respond to Climate Change with land-cover changes is very small. Based on a participatory process, an approach was developed to extend land-cover classes (e.g. forest, agriculture) by land management classes. In this paper, the focus is on the forest management classification. In the discussion with regional actors, four recommendations were identified that must be fulfilled to make land management classes regionally applicable and relevant. They should (1) reflect the effectiveness of management practices to mitigate Climate Change impacts, (2) express different management objectives, (3) show the compatibility with future trends (new crops, new public demands) and (4) provide a link to land-cover data. Finally, 22 mixed land-cover and management classes in forestry and around 30 classes in agriculture could be derived. For a test case on afforestation of agricultural sites the paper demonstrates that a more differentiated look at land management practices instead of land-cover classes helps to improve the understanding of (a) regional potentials to adapt to Climate Change and to mitigate its effects and (b) the impact of sectoral management strategies at landscape level on the provision of ecosystem services.";"Fürst, Christine

"AGRIS:US201301816474";"Differential evolution algorithm for solving multi-objective crop planning model";"";"This study presents four strategies of a novel evolutionary algorithm, multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (MDEA). The four strategies namely, MDEA1, MDEA2, MDEA3 and MDEA4 are adapted to solve the multi-objective crop planning model with multiple constraints in a farmland in the Vaalharts irrigation scheme (VIS) in South Africa. The three objectives of the model are to minimize the total irrigation water (m²) and to maximize both the total net income in South African Rand (ZAR) from farming and the total agricultural output in tons. The total area of the farm is 771,000m² and supplied with 704,694m² of irrigation water annually. Numerical results produce non-dominated solutions which converge to Pareto optimal fronts. MDEA1 and MDEA2 strategies with binomial crossover method are better for solving the crop planning problem presented than MDEA3 and MDEA4 strategies with exponential crossover method. MDEA1 found a solution with the highest total net income of ZAR 1,304,600 with the corresponding total agricultural output, total irrigation water and total planting areas of 316.26tons, 702,000m³ and 725,000m², respectively. The planting areas for the crops in the solution are 73,463m² for maize, 551,660m² for groundnut, 50,000m² for Lucerne and 50,000m² for Peacan nut. It can be concluded that MDEA is a good algorithm for solving crop planning problem especially in water deficient areas like South Africa.";"Adeyemo, Josiah

"AGRIS:US201300917465";"Environmental and management factors determining weed species composition and diversity in France";"";"Multivariate analysis of data from approximately 700 arable fields from France was carried out to partition the respective importance of environmental factors versus management practices on weed species richness and composition. Overall, canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the major variations in species composition between fields were associated with human management factors; (1) the current crop type and (2) the preceding crop type. Three main weed communities were identified according to sowing season: winter, spring and summer-sown crops. The third most important gradient was associated with soil pH and soil texture to a lesser degree, resulting in highly contrasting weed communities on basic clay soils against those on acidic sandy soils. The influence of climate and geographical region was less pronounced and identified mainly through relationships with precipitation and longitude. Within individual crop types, the effect of other management practices became more prominent. Species richness is dependant on factors other than, or in addition to those influencing species composition, like those describing landscape organisation and/or tillage depth. Species richness (α-diversity) and community composition (β-diversity) had, for example, contrasting relationship to altitude: 300-450m altitude giving high species richness but low species turnover. The variations observed in this large scale data set help to identify the agricultural practices which have had the most significant impact on the loss of species diversity in arable fields in recent decades.";"Fried, Guillaume

It is widely thought that private sector expectations of higher agricultural commodity prices and government concerns about longer-term food and energy security underpin much recent land acquisition for agricultural investments. These processes are expected to have lasting and far-reaching implications for world agriculture and for livelihoods and food security in recipient countries. This paper critically examines evidence of trends, scale, geography and drivers in the global land rush. While this analysis broadly corroborates some widespread assumptions, it also points to a more complex set of drivers that reflect fundamental shifts in economic and geopolitical relations linking sovereign states, global finance, and agribusiness through to local groups. Only a solid understanding of these fundamental drivers can help identify levers and pressure points for policy responses to address the challenges raised by large-scale land acquisitions.";"Cotula, Lorenzo";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land acquisitions;food security";"Land & Food Security";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014041";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.674940";"";"";"";"649-680"
"AGRIS:US201600199748";"Forest forecasting with vegetation models across Russia1";"";"Vegetation models are essential tools for projecting large-scale land-cover response to changing climate, which is expected to alter the distribution of biomes and individual species. A large-scale bioclimatic envelope model (RuBCliM) and an individual species based gap model (UVAFME) are used to simulate the Russian forests under current and future climate for two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Results for current conditions are compared between models and assessed against two independent maps of Russian forest biomes and dominant tree species. Comparisons measured with kappa statistics indicate good agreement between the models (kappa values from 0.76 to 0.69), as well as between the model results and two observation-based maps for both species presence and absence (kappa values from 0.70 to 0.43). Agreement between these multiple types of data on forest distribution provides confidence in the projected forest response to changing climate. For future conditions, both models indicate a shift in the dominant biomes from conifers to deciduous leaved species. These projections have implications for feedbacks between the energy budget, carbon cycle, and land cover in the boreal system. The distinct biome and species changes emphasize the need for continued investigation of this landmass that has the size necessary to influence regional and global climate.";"Shuman, Jacquelyn K.

"AGRIS:US201301816472";"Furrow diking in conservation tillage";"";"Crop production in the Southeastern U.S. can be limited by water; thus, supplemental irrigation is needed to sustain profitable crop production. Increased water capture would efficiently improve water use and reduce supplemental irrigation amounts/costs, thus improving producer's profit margin. We quantified infiltration (INF), runoff (R), and sediment (E) losses from furrow diked (+DT) and non-furrow diked (−DT) tilled conventional (CT) and strip tillage (ST) systems. In 2008, a field study (Tifton loamy sand, Typic Kandiudult) was established with DT, ST, and CT systems. In 2009, a field study (Faceville loamy sand, Typic Kandiudult) was established with DT and ST systems. Treatments (6) included: CT−DT, CT+DT, ST₁ (1-year old)−DT, ST₁ +DT, ST₁₀ (10-year old)−DT, and ST₁₀ +DT. Simulated rainfall (50mmh⁻¹ for 1h) was applied to each 2-m×3-m plots (n =3). Runoff and E were measured from each 6-m² plot. ST₁ +DT plots had 80-88% less R than ST₁ −DT plots. Any disturbance associated with DT in ST₁ systems did not negatively impact E values. For both soils, CT−DT plots represented the worst-case scenario in terms of measured R and E; ST+DT plots represented the best-case scenario. Trends for R, E, and estimated plant available water (PAW) values decreased in order of CT−DT, CT+DT, ST₁ −DT, ST₁ +DT, ST₁₀ −DT, and ST₁₀ +DT treatments. From a hydrology standpoint, ST₁ −DT plots behaved more similarly to CT plots than to other ST plots; from a sediment standpoint, ST₁ −DT plots behaved more similarly to other ST plots than to CT plots. DT had no effect on ST₁₀ plots. CT−DT and ST₁₀ +DT plots resulted in 5.9 (worst-case) and 8.1 (best-case) days of water for crop use, a difference of 2.2 days of water for crop use or 37%. Compared to the CT−DT treatment, an agricultural field managed to CT+DT, ST₁ −DT, ST₁ +DT, ST₁₀ −DT, and ST₁₀ +DT would save a producer farming the CT−DT field $5.30, $9.42, $13.55, $14.14, and $14.14ha⁻¹, respectively, to pump the amount of water lost to R and not saved as INF back onto the field. The most water/cost savings occurred for CT and ST₁ plots as a result of DT. Savings for CT+DT, ST₁ −DT, and ST₁ +DT treatments represent 27%, 47%, and 68% of the cost of DT ($20ha⁻¹) and 37%, 67%, and 96% of the savings a producer would have if managing the field to ST for 10 years without DT (ST₁₀ −DT) in a single 50-mm rainfall event. For row-crop producers in the Southeastern U.S. with runoff producing rainfall events during the crop growing season, DT is a management practice that is cost-effective from a natural resource and financial standpoint for those producers that continue to use CT systems and especially those that have recently adopted ST systems into their farming operations.";"Truman, C.C.

"AGRIS:US201600014048";"next Great Trek? South African commercial farmers move north";"";"This paper analyses the shifting role of South African farmers, agribusiness and capital elsewhere in the Southern African region and the rest of the continent. It explores recent trends in this expansion, and investigates the interests and agendas shaping such deals, and the ideologies and discourses of legitimation employed in favour of them. While for the past two decades small numbers of South African farmers have moved to Mozambique, Zambia and several other countries, this trend seems to be undergoing both a quantitative and a qualitative shift. Whereas in the past their migration was largely individual or in small groups, now it is being more centrally organised and coordinated, is more frequently taking the form of large concessions for newly formed consortia and agribusinesses, and is increasingly reliant on external financing through transnational partnerships. By early 2010, the commercial farmers' association Agri South Africa (AgriSA) was engaged in negotiations for land acquisitions with the governments of 22 African countries. This essay is the product of a scoping study to document and analyse major land acquisitions by South African farmers and agribusinesses, and the processes through which these have occurred and are occurring. It considers the changing character, scale and location of South African investments elsewhere in the region and the continent, and focuses specifically on the AgriSA-Congo deal (the largest deal concluded thus far), and acquisitions by the two South African sugar giants, Illovo and Tongaat-Hulett, for outgrower and estate expansion elsewhere in the region. The study addresses the degree to which South Africa is no longer merely exporting its farmers, but also its value chains, to the rest of the continent – and what this means for trajectories of agrarian change. It questions how we might understand the growing trend of ‘intra-regional land grabbing’ and, in the cases discussed, suggests that South African-based companies are acting as arteries of global capital.";"Hall, Ruth";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land acquisitions;farmers";"";"";"ZMB;MOZ;ZAF;018";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014048";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.677037";"";"";"";"823-843"
"AGRIS:US201301610820";"Quantifying successional rates in western aspen woodlands: Current conditions, future predictions";"";"Stands of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) rank among the most biologically diverse plant communities across the intermountain region of western North America. Marked declines of aspen have occurred in recent decades, likely due to a combination of effects from changes in fire regimes, herbivory, climate (e.g. drought), and interspecific competition with conifer species. However, it is poorly understood how the effects of these factors are manifested at a landscape scale over decadal time periods. Analysis of field data combined with topographic information collected across the 500,000ha Owyhee Plateau in southwestern Idaho revealed that aspen in the area occur in three different biophysical settings; First, aspen stands exist at high altitudes on south-facing slopes where local conifer species are not likely to occur because of limiting temperature or precipitation levels under current climate conditions. In these areas aspen is the potential vegetation type rather than conifers. Second, aspen grow on anomalously wet microsites (e.g. near springs), and third, aspen grow within upland mixed aspen/conifer stands, which are experiencing rapid rates of conifer establishment. Based on a paired t-test (α =0.05) we conclude that stands growing on wet microsites show significantly slower successional rates of conifer establishment relative to upland aspen stands. We developed a conceptual state-and-transition model for upland aspen/conifer stands occurring across a range of topographic positions. We then parameterized the model using extensive field data in the vegetation dynamics computer simulation model Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT), and examined the current and future aspen distribution under varying fire regimes. Model results indicate that average fire return intervals of 50-70 years are desirable for maintenance of aspen in upland areas where conifers are present. Under the current fire regime in the area many upland aspen/conifer stands will likely be lost within 80-200 years. Thresholds for the effect of conifer encroachment and browsing on aspen regeneration identified through this research are similar to those described by others across the West. We therefore suggest that the results presented for the Owyhee Plateau are likely applicable to semi-arid aspen woodlands across the American West where succession to conifers is a cause of aspen decline.";"Strand, Eva K.

Data for existing soil slope failures was collected from geotechnical reports and field visits. A total of 48 slope failures were recorded and analyzed. Six factors, including event precipitation, geological formation, land cover, slope history, slope angle, and elevation were considered to affect highway soil slope stability. The observed trends indicate that precipitation and poor surface or subsurface drainage conditions are principal factors causing slope failures. 96% of the failed slopes have an open drainage section. A majority of the failed slopes lie in regions with relatively high event precipitation (P>200 mm). 90% of the existing failures are surficial erosion type failures, and only 1 out of the 42 slope failures is deep rotational type failure. More than half of the analyzed slope failures have occurred in regions having low density land cover. 46% of failures are on slopes with slope angles between 20° and 30°. Influx of more data relating to failed slopes should give rise to more trends, and thus the developed slope management system will aid the state highway engineers in prudential budget allocation and prioritizing different remediation projects based on the literature reviewed on the principles, concepts, techniques, and methodology for slope instability evaluation (Leshchinsky et al., 2015).";"Ramanathan, Raghav

Many of these maps are potential input datasets for forest-related applications for the European Union (EU), due to their spatial extent and harmonised approach at the European level. However, they possess different characteristics in terms of spatial detail or thematic accuracy. Little attention has been paid to the effect of these characteristics on simulation models and the resultant policy implications. In this study we tested whether the choice of a forest map has substantial influence on model output, i.e. if output differences can be related to the input differences. A sensitivity analysis of the spatially explicit Global Forest Model (G4M) was performed using four different forest maps: the pan-European high resolution forest/non-forest map (FMAP), the Corine Land Cover (CLC), the Calibrated European Forest Map (CEFM) and the Global Land Cover (GLC). Finally, the impact of potential differences owing to input datasets on decision-making was tested in a selected case study: reaching the EU 10% biofuel target through enhanced utilization of forest biomass. The sensitivity analysis showed that the choice of the forest cover map has a major influence on the model outputs in particular at the country-level, while having less influence at the EU27 level. Differences between the input datasets are strongly reflected in the outputs. Similarly, depending on the choice of the input alternate options for decision-making were found within the hypothesized biofuel target (case study), demonstrating a substantial value of information. In general, it was demonstrated that input maps are the major driver of decision-making if forest resource outputs of the model are their basis. Improvement of the input forest map would result in immediate benefit for a better decision-making basis.";"Seebach, Lucia

The average NPP of terrestrial vegetation in Xuzhou showed a decreasing trend in recent years, likely due to changes in climate and environment. The study area was divided into four sub-regions, designated as highest, moderately high, moderately low, and lowest in NPP. The area designated as the lowest sub-region in NPP increased with expanding scale, indicating that the NPP distribution varied with different spatial scales. The NPP of different vegetation types was also significantly influenced by scale. In particular, the NPP of urban woodland produced lower estimates because of mixed pixels. Similar trends in NPP were observed with different RS data. In addition, expansion of residential areas and reduction of vegetated areas were the major reasons for NPP change. Land cover changes in urban areas reduced NPP, which could chiefly be attributed to human-induced disturbance.";"Tan, Kun

"AGRIS:US201500200217";"Rigorous evaluation of a soil heat transfer model for mesoscale climate change impact studies";"";"The influence of Climate Change on plant development as well as on carbon and nitrogen cycling in soils is an important research topic for Global Change impact assessment at the regional scale. These changes affect the availability and quality of ground and surface waters and accordingly the future productivity of agriculturally used landscapes. The integrated assessment of these changes requires a robust prediction of the potential future characteristics of soil temperature and moisture based on scale-appropriate, process-oriented models. Hence, we present the Soil Heat Transfer Module (SHTM) used as a component of the mesoscale decision support system DANUBIA, which is developed by the multi-disciplinary research project GLOWA-Danube (www.glowa-danube.de). DANUBIA is applied on the Upper Danube catchment to assess the future changes in water availability, quality and use based on Global Change scenarios. In order to cover the temporal and spatial resolution (1h, 1×1km) of the main model as well as the desired investigation period of 50 years, SHTM combines a variable time step conductive heat transfer algorithm with an analytical lower boundary condition to react to long-term climate change with minimal model drift. Changes in soil moisture and soil freezing are explicitly taken into account. The ground heat flux at the soil surface is computed by iterative closure of the energy balance including radiative, latent and sensible energy fluxes. Validation of the heat transfer scheme shows that the variable time step solution improves computational efficiency while imposing only minimal RMSE and phase shift errors. Furthermore, the analytical lower boundary stabilizes the long term heat balance and induces a rather small potential model drift in the order of 0.001Wm⁻². Then the results of the full land surface model including SHTM are compared to measurements at 25 agrometeorological sites. Without site-specific parameterisation other than land cover type, we show that the model performs well (RMSE about 2K) in reproducing daily and annual top soil temperature dynamics over long simulation periods. The analysis of systematic model errors reveals that about 75% of the RMSE is attributable to uncertainties in meteorological input, canopy parameters and snow processes.";"Muerth, Markus

"AGRIS:US201600190596";"Zoning eco-environmental vulnerability for environmental management and protection";"";"Eco-environmental vulnerability assessment is crucial for environmental and resource management. However, evaluation of eco-environmental vulnerability over large areas is a difficult and complex process because it is affected by many variables including hydro-meteorology, topography, land resources, and human activities. The Thua Thien â Hue Province and its largest river system, the Perfume River, are vital to the social-economic development of the north central coastal region of Vietnam, but there is no zoning system for environmental protection in this region. An assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the vulnerable eco-environment in association with 16 variables with 6 of them constructed from Landsat 8 satellite image products. The remaining variables were extracted from digital maps. Each variable was evaluated and spatially mapped with the aid of an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographical information system (GIS). An eco-environmental vulnerability map is assorted into six vulnerability levels consisting of potential, slight, light, medium, heavy, and very heavy vulnerabilities, representing 14%, 27%, 17%, 26%, 13%, 3% of the study area, respectively. It is found that heavy and very heavy vulnerable areas appear mainly in the low and medium lands where social-economic activities have been developing rapidly. Tiny percentages of medium and heavy vulnerable levels occur in high land areas probably caused by agricultural practices in highlands, slash and burn cultivation and removal of natural forests with new plantation forests. Based on our results, three ecological zones requiring different development and protection solutions are proposed to restore local eco-environment toward sustainable development. The proposed integrated method of remote sensing (RS), GIS, and AHP to evaluate the eco-environmental vulnerability is useful for environmental protection and proper planning for land use and construction in the future.";"Nguyen, Anh Kim

Less is known about robustness of inter-annual variation within parameters for water quality in the nearshore. We have conducted high-resolution surveys with towed electronic instrumentation in nearshore areas of Lake Superior and have combined several seasons (2001–2005) of measurements from multiple research efforts to investigate how spatial variation compares across years. The combined survey tows ranged across approximately 1200 km of Lake Superior's south shore. In addition to the survey tracks, we also sampled fixed stations to collect calibration data and other parameters not observed by the in situ electronic sensors. The towed sensor data provided information on the spatial and temporal variability of water quality parameters along the nearshore. We found a consistent spatial pattern over time along the south shore of Lake Superior. Nearshore water quality parameters were analyzed with respect to landscape characteristics of the adjacent watersheds (US only) using multivariate stepwise regressions and found to correlate to landscape characterization. The stressor categories of landscape character that best described the nearshore parameters were agriculture-chemical usage and land-cover attributes. Peak nearshore values corresponded with landscape position that had the most altered landuse character (e.g. Duluth/Superior region). The landscape character appears to drive and maintain the spatial pattern in nearshore water quality parameters.";"Yurista, Peder

Taking the Beijing–Tianjin dust and sandstorm source region (BTSSR) as the study area, the land degradation dynamic in the first decade of twenty-first century is assessed by utilizing the time series trends of net primary production (NPP) and modified rain use efficiency (RUE), respectively, and their sensitivities and performances are evaluated through the validation. The results shows that (1) a widespread degradation in the BTSSR is identified from 2000 to 2010, with a proportion of 52.7 % by using NPP, and 65.2 % when using RUE; (2) the proposed RUE is effective in eliminating high correlations between NPP and precipitation, and overcame the problem that the RUE assumption often breaks down at the pixel scale, through incorporating the land degradation assessment division; and (3) the RUE is preferred for land degradation assessment with a higher accuracy (93.5 %), compared with NPP (81 %), which can provide valuable insights into the land degradation assessment in the arid and semi-arid regions.";"Li, Xiaosong

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of logging operation on peat swamp forest in this area. <b>Approach:</b> The study used a remote sensing technique to assess vegetation cover in a peat swamp forest areas in Sarawak as result of logging practice and land clearing activities for oil palm plantation. Vegetation Index was used to assess impact of timber harvesting system and land clearing activities on remaining peat swamp forest in two sites which were logged previously and the possible relationship of change in hydrology. <b>Results:</b> The timber harvesting system was a combination of rail system for log transportation and excavator crawler for log skidding. Drainage work was probably carried out prior to logging activities which was followed up by land preparation for the establishment of the oil palm plantations. There was a general decrease in the level of greenness from 2002-2007. Between the two sites, the level of greenness was relatively lower in the West Site. The high green level of both sites was reduced remarkably in 2007 especially for the West Site and this corresponded to increase in the percentage of medium green level. The changed in the level of greenness in the remnant peat swamp forest could suggest that soil and other conditions such as vegetation structure and floristic composition are unfavorable for the expected rate of forest regeneration. <b>Conclusion:</b> The remnant logged peat swamp forest of the area declined due to a poor state of growth as shown by the dramatically decrease in the level of greenness. The peat swamp forest types strongly related to the hydrological conditions and the associated flow of nutrients and mineral elements. The surrounding hydrology was presumed to have influence the physical and chemical characteristics of the peat";"Seca Gandaseca

However, responses of soil properties and soil microbial activities to land cover conversion under different land cover types have not been fully understood. The objective was to assess the effects of land cover conversion on soil C and N stocks and soil microbial properties of topsoil of an alpine meadow in the Tibetan Plateau. Soil cores of surface soil (0–20 cm) were collected from three adjacent land cover types: native alpine meadow, artificial grassland and mound-shaped denuded land. Soil microbial metabolic diversity was measured using Biolog EcoPlates. Significant losses of SOC and TN storages were subject to land cover conversion in topsoil, decreasing 14.5 and 10.9 % of alpine meadow to artificial grassland and 52.9 and 51.7 % to denuded land. Alpine meadow soils had the highest soil microbial biomass and microbial metabolic activity of three land cover types. Microbial biomass and microbial metabolic activity decreased markedly after alpine meadow conversion to denuded land. Land use conversion from original alpine meadow to artificial grassland and denuded land caused decline in soil organic carbon density, total nitrogen density and soil microbial activity. Soil carbon emissions from alpine meadow conversion were released to the atmosphere and could influence climatic change.";"Zhu, Ping

Past land management practices caused a major threat to the long-term sustainability of the region. Horizons Regional Council introduced Whole Farm Plans (WFP) as part of a variety of tools to protect and conserve the land. This paper discusses the progressive findings of a study about farmers’ WFP adoption decisions. Following Gladwin’s (1989) ethnographic decision tree modeling (EDTM) approach, qualitative interviews were held with a sample of 15 WFP adopters and 14 non-adopters across the Region to develop the adoption decision tree. Key findings were that hill country farmers’ decision to develop, or not develop, a WFP was based on six fundamental criteria: (1) their awareness and concern of the issues of soil erosion and water quality and/or siltation of rivers and streams in the region and/or their farm; (2) the degree to which retiring land on their farm by fencing and tree planting would help solve the issue; (3) the degree to which the current status and level of development of the farm still allowed for further fencing and/or tree planting; (4) perceived benefit of the plan; (5) consideration of the enabling/disabling factors, which included the willingness to invest time, effort, and capital in the development and implementation of the plan.";"Roth, Hein

"AGRIS:US201600006487";"Potential distribution and population size of the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in the jura Mountains and possible corridors to adjacent ranges";"";"To estimate the potential population size of the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in the Jura Mountains and to assess possible corridors between this population and adjacent areas (the Vosges Mountains, the Black Forest and the Alps), we adapted a previously developed Geographic Information system (GIS) probability model for lynx distribution and extrapolated it over the entire mountain range. The model was based on knowledge of the habitat use and land tenure system of resident animals from the central part of the Jura Mountains, where lynx were followed by means of radio-telemetry. Corridors were computed in the GIS using a friction grid and a cost distance function. The friction value attributed to each land use variable was assessed from our observations of lynx dispersal. Our model predicts a breeding population in the Jura Mountains of 74-101 individuals and 51-79 individuals when continuous habitat patches of < 50 km² are disregarded. The Jura population lies within the range of a viable population if only demographic aspects are taken into account, but is rather small from a genetic point of view. Genetic viability would be assured if the Jura lynx population were part of a larger metapopulation. Potential corridors exist from the Jura Mountains to the Vosges Mountains, the Black Forest and the Alps (Chartreuse and Salèève, respectively). The length of these corridors range within 7.3-37.3 km, and their costs are all within the range of radio-collared lynx roaming outside their prime habitat. The best corridor leads south to the Chartreuse, an isolated part of the French Alps, which is itself connected to the rest of the Alps by two corridors of 4.5 and 6.5 km, respectively. Observations in the Chartreuse indicate that lynx may have immigrated from the Jura Mountains, but there is no evidence for the use of northern corridors, as the species has not yet completely occupied this area. We conclude that the monitoring of the population size, its spatial expansion, and the genetic surveillance in the Jura Mountains must be continued, as the status of the population is still critical. Only good surveillance would allow the necessary conservation measures to be initiated in time.";"Zimmermann, Fridolin

"AGRIS:US201500225556";"Pests controlling pests: does predator control lead to greater European rabbit abundance in Australasia?";"";"In New Zealand and Australia, rural landowners believe that local predator control to protect indigenous biota exacerbates European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus problems on their land. We assess the validity of their concerns by reviewing the published literature on effects of predators on rabbit abundance. In New Zealand, where rabbits and their predators are introduced, predators appear to have relatively little effect on rabbit numbers compared with other factors leading to mortality, such as disease, flooding of burrows and burrow collapse. Similarly, in Australia, rabbit numbers are driven primarily by climate and its effects on food abundance and quality, and by disease. However, where rabbit numbers are low following drought or major epizootics, predation can limit population recovery. In the Iberian Peninsula, where rabbits and their predators are indigenous, the effects of predators are unknown, as they are often confounded by other factors. Rabbit numbers are influenced mostly by habitat, food, disease and rainfall. Elsewhere in Europe, predators have their strongest effect when rabbit numbers have been reduced by other factors, but have little effect on high‐density rabbit populations. In Australasia, abundance of predators (especially rabbit specialists) can usually be predicted from rabbit abundance, not vice versa. Although predation effects can be limiting under certain conditions, they are minor compared to the roles of climate, food, disease and habitat. A key unresolved question is whether those circumstances where predator control might lead to increases in rabbit populations can be identified with enough certainty to allow reliable predictions to be generated. One approach is to implement robust rabbit, predator and disease monitoring programmes at sites with predator control operations. Data on changes in rabbits, predators, and disease prevalence could be combined with local data on other key factors to facilitate reasonable inference about effects of predators on rabbits. The inclusion of carefully matched non‐treatment areas is crucial if such programmes are to succeed.";"Norbury, Grant

"AGRIS:US2016213485";"Valuing the Otago Peninsula: The Economic Benefits of Conservation";"";"It is suggested that valuing objects is a distinctive human trait. It is a prerequisite for rational behaviour. Factors that are likely to influence valuations, the difficulties of getting agreements about valuations and the limited perspective of economics as a basis for valuation are discussed generally. Attributes of Otago Peninsula that seem to be valuable and worth conserving are listed and discuss taking into account possible conflicts in getting maximum value from these attributes. Particular attention is given to the economic value of conserving wildlife species on the Otago Peninsula. It is estimated that as a result of the presence of these species and their use for tourism, expenditure of over $100 million annually is generated in the Dunedin regional economy (directly or indirectly) and that 800-1000 full-time equivalent jobs are created. The economic opportunity cost of this wildlife conservation on the Peninsula is low and it is clear that the economic benefits from this conservation are well in excess of the costs involved. When non-use economic values and the social values associated with Otago Peninsula are taken into account, this further adds to the value of conserving this wildlife. While there has been remarkable expansion in wildlife tourism on the Otago Peninsula and its economic impact in the Dunedin region in the last two decades, (especially in the viewing of yellow-eyed penguins) difficulties and constraints are emerging that are likely to hamper its future expansion. However, wildlife tourism on the Otago Peninsula will still have a huge economic impact on Dunedin regional economy. Consequently, even if assessed solely in terms of their economic value, the wildlife attractions of the Otago Peninsula are well worth conserving. It can be argued however, that the value of conserving biodiversity on the Peninsula exceeds its touristic and its economic value. Some conservation organizations (such as the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust) even though not directly involved in tourism add to its economic value as well as its social value and promote the highly desired goal of conserving biodiversity.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-11-31";"en";"";"";"";"NZL";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016213485";"http://purl.umn.edu/55104";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201500217569";"Land use determines interest in conservation easements among private landowners";"";"Protection of private lands through conservation easements has garnered recent attention from scientists and conservation practitioners. Questions remain, however, about the specific characteristics and activities driving landowners’ interest in conservation easements and their willingness to consider granting them. Resolving these questions could improve prospects for private land conservation by helping land conservation organizations identify and better understand potential easement grantors. We conducted a survey of 513 private landowners in a peri-urban fringe area in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, USA. Logistic regression analysis returned seven significant predictors of landowner willingness to consider granting conservation easements. Participation in environmental organizations, recreational land-use activities, wild food gathering, and land entitlement were the strongest factors promoting interest in conservation easements. Long-term residency, male gender, and hunting or fishing, on the other hand, significantly decreased the likelihood of considering conservation easements. The findings suggest that landowners most interested in to granting conservation easements are active land users. Notably, among all the land-use activities reported, the most frequent and the most important in predicting interest in conservation easements are those undertaken for recreational and subsistence, rather than economic, purposes. This suggests that while easements might be appropriate for working lands, their role in reconciling land use with conservation requires a flexible definition of work.";"Brenner, Jacob C.

The aim was to investigate whether the blanket support rates for the afforestation of agricultural land are sufficient to cover the associated costs in a wide range of site conditions. Costs were calculated for 43 groups based on forest typology. The calculation was based on the comparison of present costs and present revenues (here: European fund support) with the discount rate of 3% and a 15-year evaluation period. The analysis demonstrated that input costs vary considerably in the different forest typologies; 44% of groups show higher present costs than the support rates currently available. In the most expensive group costs are 150% higher than even an increased support rate in less favoured areas available to agricultural entrepreneurs, and almost 200% in comparison with the basic support rate. In several cases – and always in case of pine management – the support payments are notably higher than the related input costs, and because of that the land owner might be strongly motivated to change the land use from agriculture to forestry. The article points out the sensitivity of the results to the discount rate used and to the importance of the CZK/Euro exchange rate fluctuation. The analysis’ results lead us to strongly encourage a more substantial differentiation of the support rates for afforestation of agricultural, and other, land. This differentiation should be based on realistic input costs according to forest typology – the methodology of which might be relevant in several other EU countries.";"Jarský, Vilém

A thorough understanding of past and present processes transforming landscapes is essential for guiding future developments toward the sustained provision of the ecosystem services humans critically depend upon. Drawing on the driving forces and resilience frameworks, we identify possible variables and patterns of land change, connecting them to empirical findings in three case study areas in the Swabian Alb region, southwestern Germany. GIS-based analysis of historical and contemporary maps from four time layers between the 1820s and 2009 reveals complex and spatially differentiated trajectories. Woodland expansion, marginal grass- and heathland conversion and expansion of urban areas were the main change processes affecting all case study areas. A literature review regarding causes of these changes points to socioeconomic drivers at the supraregional scale, playing themselves out in diverse ways on areas with contrasting natural site characteristics. Human agency also fosters the alteration of large-scale drivers of change at the local level. We conclude that policy and management strategies need to be particularly sensitive to natural site characteristics and take both driving forces and human agency into account. Landscape-scale studies of patterns and causes of land change, making cross-site and cross-issue comparisons, are necessary to test how far our insights may apply to other geographical contexts and land change processes.";"Bieling, Claudia

Subsequently, securing farmers’ property rights would help to enhance their capacity to adapt to climate change.";"Yegbemey, Rosaine N.

"AGRIS:US201500210064";"Simulation of the relationship between land use and groundwater level in Tailan River basin, Xinjiang, China";"";"Groundwater is widely recognized as the most significant water resource for irrigation and drinking purposes in the extremely-arid inland river region. However, land use is a major force altering the hydrological processes over a range of temporal and spatial scales. Therefore, understanding the interaction between land use and groundwater processes will definitely contribute to formulate a regional sustainable development strategy and recognize the impact of land use on the groundwater flow regime in the Tailan River basin. A numerical simulation of groundwater level for the inland river basin and scenario analysis under land use using FEFLOW is presented. Spatial data of the regional land use were processed using GIS, and the effects of land use on groundwater level were simulated. The amount of irrigation water and pumped groundwater have the most remarkable influences on groundwater level as main source/sink factors. Their variations were simulated according to the irrigation systems with different crops. Other factors including percolation and evapotranspiration of precipitation and condensed water jointly exerted influences on groundwater level. Changes to farmlands had the greatest impact on Tailan River basin for groundwater level, and unused land and Gobi had the least impact on groundwater level. Groundwater level maintained a decreasing trend in the irrigated zone, and increasing groundwater pumping would further intensify the water shortage in Tailan river basin. This coupled effects resulted from land use and extensive groundwater pumping were considered as the major human-induced factors influencing the groundwater system in the extremely-arid inland river basins. The results can provide useful support for land use. Understanding hydrological processes at the watershed level is essential in land use and water resource planning and management, and the proposed approach can be used as a management and planning tool for evaluating the local and overall impacts of land use management on the surface and groundwater flow regimes.";"Sun, Dongyuan

The goals of this study were to predict and map patterns of fish biomass as a proxy for the availability of catchable fish for anglers in rivers and to identify the strongest landscape constraints on fish productivity. We examined hypotheses about fish responses to total phosphorus (TP), as TP is a growth-limiting nutrient known to cause increases (subsidy response) and/or decreases (stress response) in fish biomass depending on its concentration and the species being considered. Boosted regression trees were used to define nonlinear functions that predicted the standing crops of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis , Brown Trout Salmo trutta , Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu , panfishes (seven centrarchid species), and Walleye Sander vitreus by using landscape and modeled local-scale predictors. Fitted models were highly significant and explained 22–56% of the variation in validation data sets. Nonlinear and threshold responses were apparent for numerous predictors, including TP concentration, which had significant effects on all except the Walleye fishery. Brook Trout and Smallmouth Bass exhibited both subsidy and stress responses, panfish biomass exhibited a subsidy response only, and Brown Trout exhibited a stress response. Maps of reach-specific standing crop predictions showed patterns of predicted fish biomass that corresponded to spatial patterns in catchment area, water temperature, land cover, and nutrient availability. Maps illustrated predictions of higher trout biomass in coldwater streams draining glacial till in northern Michigan, higher Smallmouth Bass and panfish biomasses in warmwater systems of southern Michigan, and high Walleye biomass in large main-stem rivers throughout the state. Our results allow fisheries managers to examine the biomass potential of streams, describe geographic patterns of fisheries, explore possible nutrient management targets, and identify habitats that are candidates for species management.

"AGRIS:US201400191521";"Water quality in agricultural lands draining to the Great Barrier Reef: A review of causes, management and priorities";"";"The environmental consequences of agriculture are of growing concern. One example of these consequences is the effect of agricultural pollutants on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), a world heritage-listed ecosystem lying off the tropical north-eastern coast of Australia. Pollutants from agricultural lands (fine sediments and attached nitrogen (N) mainly from grazing lands, and dissolved N and pesticides mainly from cropping) in catchments draining into the GBR lagoon threaten the health and resilience of this ecosystem. Government actions are prompting farmers to adopt new management practices to reduce pollutant exports from their farms. However, previous agricultural research has, with the exception of erosion, largely focussed on production rather than environmental impacts. Also, the relevance of research conducted in other regions, e.g. Europe and North America, with different climates, soils and agricultural systems may be limited. Thus, there may not be a strong knowledge base underpinning actions to improve water quality. In this paper, we review research on the relationship between management of agricultural lands and pollutant exports in GBR catchments, and compare this knowledge with experience in other regions. Despite the differences in climate and agricultural systems, there are similarities in the causes and management of N and pesticide losses from cropping lands. Substantial N fertiliser is applied to high value crops in GBR catchments, and the primary path to reducing N losses from cropped lands will be through reducing N applications. Other practices may become effective in these crops once current (high) rates of N application and reduced. Herbicides are widely used, and practices that reduce herbicide runoff have recently been developed and demonstrated in most of the main cropping systems. However, there are still uncertainties over breakdown and fate of pesticides, especially new products, in these tropical environments. The principles of reducing erosion in grazing lands are well understood, and centre on maintaining ground cover and biomass of pastures, especially during the dry season and droughts. Highly variable rainfall makes this principle challenging to achieve in practice. In addition, it has recently become clear that gully networks caused by livestock grazing are much more important sources of sediment that previously thought. Practices such as targeted vegetation management will be important strategies for reducing gully erosion. Despite these advances in practice effectiveness, it is clear that much more is needed to have agricultural systems that are compatible with a sustainable and resilient GBR. As the demand for food increases in coming decades, and agriculture expands and intensifies in tropical countries, the experience in GBR catchments will help guide the development of more sustainable agricultural systems in these countries.";"Thorburn, P.J.

Identifying relations between stream ecological condition and urban intensity indicators such as impervious surface provides important, but insufficient information to effectively address planning and management needs in such areas. In this study we investigate those specific landscape metrics which are functionally linked to indicators of stream ecological condition, and in particular, identify those characteristics that exacerbate or mitigate changes in ecological condition over and above impervious surface. The approach used addresses challenges associated with redundancy of landscape metrics, and links landscape pattern and composition to an indicator of stream ecological condition across a broad area of the eastern United States. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected during 2000-2001 from forty-two sites in the Delaware River Basin, and landscape data of high spatial and thematic resolution were obtained from photointerpretation of 1999 imagery. An ordination-derived ‘biotic score' was positively correlated with assemblage tolerance, and with urban-related chemical characteristics such as chloride concentration and an index of potential pesticide toxicity. Impervious surface explained 56% of the variation in biotic score, but the variation explained increased to as high as 83% with the incorporation of a second land use, cover, or configuration metric at catchment or riparian scales. These include land use class-specific cover metrics such as percent of urban land with tree cover, forest fragmentation metrics such as aggregation index, riparian metrics such as percent tree cover, and metrics related to urban aggregation. Study results indicate that these metrics will be important to monitor in urbanizing areas in addition to impervious surface.";"Riva-Murray, Karen

Lidar data are employed to characterize both vegetation structure and topography, whereas digital orthophotographs and in situ vegetation measurements are employed to quantify surrounding land use and larval host plant cover, respectively. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination identified nine environmental variables that were strongly related to butterfly species composition and community structure. Logistic and standard regression models were developed based on these variables to predict the presence and density of each butterfly species, respectively. We found that lidar-derived variables described more butterfly habitat characteristics than orthophotograph-derived variables or ground measurements, demonstrating the value of lidar in describing diverse habitat characteristics. However, the strongest models observed in our study use both the local- and landscape-scale variables derived from both remote-sensing data and in situ ground measurements. We conclude that combining lidar and other remotely sensed data with in situ vegetation measurements allows for an effective in-depth, large-area evaluation of local- and landscape-scale butterfly habitat structure across a diverse ecosystem.";"Hess, Anna N.

To the utility and energy companies, the tool can quickly and effectively provide feedback on land suitability based on technology specific inputs.

In Egypt, agriculture is a key sector of the economy. Land reclamation seeks to transfer desert areas to agricultural land and support the construction of new villages. The agricultural productivity improvement of these Newlands is slow and requires considerable time due to their fragility and sensitivity to desertification. The main objectives of this study were the assessment, monitoring, and mapping of the areas’ most sensitive to desertification in the Bustan 3 area, Egypt; one of the Newlands that was targeted for reclamation during the 1990s. Standard and adjusted Mediterranean desertification and land use (MEDALUS) approaches were applied for two time series (1984 and 2008). The main goals were achieved via: (a) identifying the most environmentally sensitive areas to desertification in the study area, (b) assessing the environmental sensitivity area indices (ESAIs) of 1984 and 2008 to determine the effects of land reclamation processes, (c) adjusting the MEDALUS factors for 2008 to obtain more reliable data at the local level, and (d) monitoring the ESAI change between 1984 and 2008 over the studied area. When the standard MEDALUS approach was applied to both 1984 and 2008, the ESAI results classified 100% and ∼78% of the study area as critically sensitive to desertification due to the impact of plant cover, respectively. In the adjusted version of the MEDALUS approach, new parameters were added to the soil quality indicator while irrigation water quality was considered as a new indicator. This approach was applied in 2008 and the results revealed that critical ESAI areas covered ∼89% of the study area. Since the Bustan 3 area is intensively cultivated, more attention is required for the most sensitive areas to desertification in order to achieve sustainable land use in such fragile agro-ecosystems.";"Bakr, Noura

In savanna systems, the effects of large herbivores on tree-grass interactions have rarely been studied experimentally, though these herbivores are major players in these systems. In African savannas, trees often become more abundant under heavy cattle grazing but less abundant in wildlife preserves. Woody encroachment where cattle have replaced wild herbivores may be caused by a shift in the competitive balance between trees and grasses. Here we report the results of an experiment designed to quantify the positive, negative, and net effects of grasses, wild herbivores, and cattle on Acacia saplings in a Kenyan savanna. Acacia drepanolobium saplings under four long-term herbivore regimes (wild herbivores, cattle, cattle + wild herbivores, and no large herbivores) were cleared of surrounding grass or left with the surrounding grass intact. After two years, grass-removal saplings exhibited 86% more browse damage than control saplings, suggesting that grass benefited saplings by protecting them from herbivory. However, the negative effect of grass on saplings was far greater; grass-removal trees accrued more than twice the total stem length of control trees. Where wild herbivores were present, saplings were browsed more and produced more new stem growth. Thus, the net effect of wild herbivores was positive, possibly due to the indirect effects of lower competitor tree density in areas accessible to elephants. Additionally, colonization of saplings by symbiotic ants tracked growth patterns, and colonized saplings experienced lower rates of browse damage. These results suggest that savanna tree growth and woody encroachment cannot be predicted by grass cover or herbivore type alone. Rather, tree growth appears to depend on a variety of factors that may be acting together or antagonistically at different stages of the tree's life cycle.";"Riginos, Corinna

Changes in the EFBI over coming years are likely to reflect how well agri-environment schemes (AES), funded under Pillar 2 (Axis 2) of the Common Agricultural Policy, have been able to offset the detrimental impacts of past agricultural changes and deliver appropriate hazard prevention or risk mitigation strategies alongside current and future agricultural change. The delivery of a stable or positive trend in the EFBI will depend on the provision of sufficient funding to appropriately designed and implemented AES. We present a trait-based framework which can be used to quantify the detrimental impact of land-use change on farmland bird populations across Europe. We use the framework to show that changes in resource availability within the cropped area of agricultural landscapes have been the key driver of current declines in farmland bird populations. We assess the relative contribution of each Member State to the level of the EFBI and explore the relationship between risk contribution and Axis 2 funding allocation. Our results suggest that agricultural changes in each Member State do not have an equal impact on the EFBI, with land-use and management change in Spain having a particularly large influence on its level, and that funding is poorly targeted with respect to biodiversity conservation needs. We also use the framework to predict the EFBI in 2020 for a number of land-use change scenarios. This approach can be used to guide both the development and implementation of targeted AES and the objective distribution of Pillar 2 funds between and within Member States. We hope that this will contribute to the cost-effective and efficient delivery of Rural Development strategy and biodiversity conservation targets.";"Butler, S.J.

We studied a mid-altitude steppe-like area of Southern France, the Causse de Sauveterre, that has been grazed for many centuries. The decrease of human population during the 20th century, particularly since the end of 2nd World War, and the ongoing changes in agricultural practices may have dramatic effects on many biodiversity components of these landscapes. Our study assesses landscape change and modifications in bird community composition through the repeated sampling of a network of sites after an interval of 15-19 years. We paid particular attention to the possible consequences of recent changes in agricultural policy on these communities. Landscape changes were studied through remote sensing, and bird community and vegetation changes by field sampling on 183 sites. Correspondence Analysis showed an overall trend towards landscape closure. This results in a decrease of open-habitat species that are fairly rare in Europe (e.g. Tawny Pipit Anthus campestris, Linnet Carduelis cannabina, Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana), and in an increase of common forest species (e.g. the Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes). Although most of the avifauna changes seem to be explained by local landscape changes, the decrease of certain bird species as Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula and Citril Finch Serinus citrinella may result from population changes at larger scales. The current closure of the landscape represents a threat for several steppe species whose conservation status is unfavourable in Europe. This closure does not result from a decrease in human population and/or in flock number, as observed in many Mediterranean hinterlands. It rather results from a shift from a former extensive pastoralism, where sheep grazed steppe-like grasslands (rangeland grazing), towards a more intensive herding that use hay and cereal foodstocks cultivated on the more productive areas of the farms. To alleviate the observed trends, subsidies should be oriented towards the compensation of a possible loss of income resulting from the maintenance of the traditional extensive pastoralism.";"Fonderflick, Jocelyn

This implies that a degree of „decoupling‟ is required – that economic development needs to occur without similar growth in transport. Before evaluating the possible impacts of policies that may be introduced to achieve decoupling, it is vital to consider what might happen to the relationship between economic development and transport over the next 50 or 100 years. Two key factors that are likely to impact upon this relationship in the future are demographic change and structural change. This paper suggests that in the absence of any policy change, some decoupling of economic development and transport may take place as a result of these two factors. However, income growth and transport demand from the rapidly growing tourism sector may push total transport growth use up.";"Ballingall, John

A strong positive correlation exists between the abundance of Quercus and the abundance of Tilia, Corylus and Alnus, which also experienced a steady decline across the region in the last two millennia. Climate change is the broad-scale driver of the observed dynamics, but human activity introduced considerable variation in the regional and temporal details of these changes. In the hemiboreal northern part of the study area the decline of Quercus appears to be controlled largely by competition with other tree species (especially Pinus and Picea), mediated by harvesting. In the temperate south part Quercus forests decreased through deforestation for agriculture. 4. Multivariate analyses indicate that although substantial phytogeographical variation has existed through past millennia the regional vegetation is more homogeneous today than in earlier periods. 5. Synthesis. The long-term decline and recent rapid reductions in Quercus populations throughout southern Scandinavia are striking and indisputable. From the perspective of both the populations of Quercus and its associated species of insects and epiphytes, the recent rate of decline is extremely rapid. Given the former abundance, longevity and capacity for persistence of Quercus, current populations of Quercus and its associated species appear to represent biological legacies in the midst of protracted decline. Based on these results, a reasonable conservation goal is to restore the abundance and distribution of Quercus to levels that preceded the drastic decline in the 18th and 19th centuries.";"Lindbladh, Matts

"AGRIS:US201300779128";"GM Crops: Patently Wrong";"";"This paper focuses on the ethical justifiability of patents on Genetically Modified (GM) crops. I argue that there are three distinguishing features of GM crops that make it unethical to grant patents on GM crops, even if we assume that the patent system is in general justified. The first half of the paper critiques David Resnik's recent arguments in favor of patents on GM crops. Resnik argues that we should take a consequentialist approach to the issue, and that the best way to do so is to apply the Precautionary Principle, and that the Precautionary Principle, in this case, supports patents on GM crops. I argue that his argument in favor of a consequentialist treatment is invalid; his Precautionary Principle in any case appears to be incompatible with consequentialism; and his conception of reasonable precautions is too ill-defined to have any argumentative purchase. In the second half of the paper, I argue against GM crop patents, on three grounds. First, there is insufficient evidence to say whether allowing patents on GM crops will make research go faster than not having patents, whilst there is a good reason to think that, other things being equal, a society that allows patents on GM crops will be less just than one that does not. Second, even assuming that patents on GM crops will increase the pace of GM crop research, there is no social need to do so. Third, patents on GM crops will frequently have ethically unacceptable side effects.";"Wilson, James";"";"Kluwer Academic Publishers";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300779128";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-007-9032-2";"";"";"";"261-283"
"AGRIS:US201600196293";"Examination of land use/land cover changes, urban growth dynamics, and environmental sustainability in Chittagong city, Bangladesh";"";"As in many other developing countries, cities in Bangladesh have witnessed rapid urbanization, resulting in increasing amounts of land being taken over and therefore land cover changing at a faster rate. Until now, however, few efforts have been made to document the impact of land use and land cover changes on the climate, environment, and ecosystem of the country because of a lack of geospatial data and time-series information. By using open source Landsat data integrated with GIS technologies and other ancillary data, this study attempts to classify land use and create land cover maps, enabling post-classification change detection analysis. By this method, we document the spatial and temporal trajectory of urban expansion in Chittagong, the second largest city in Bangladesh, over a 36-year period. The findings suggest that, over the study period, 56Â % of the land cover has undergone change, mainly because of the expansion of built-up areas and other human activities. During the 36-year period, the built-up area around Chittagong city has expanded by 618Â %, with an average annual rate of increase of 17.5Â %. As a result of rapid urbanization, the vegetated hills near urban development areas face serious threats of further encroachment and degradation, given that 2178Â ha of hills have already been intruded over the study period. Because urbanization processes in Bangladesh have traditionally been viewed as the result of population growth and economic development, very little work has been done to track the potential growth trajectory in a physical or spatial context. This study, therefore, will contribute to the current understanding of urban development in Bangladesh from a temporal and spatial point of view. Findings will be able to assist planners, stakeholders, and policy makers in appreciating the dynamism of urban growth and therefore will facilitate better planning for the future to minimize environmental impacts.";"Hassan, Mohammad Mehedy

"AGRIS:US201500206110";"Satellite remote sensing of wetlands";"";"To conserve and manage wetland resources, it is important to inventory and monitor wetlands and their adjacent uplands. Satellite remote sensing has several advantages for monitoring wetland resources, especially for large geographic areas. This review summarizes the literature on satellite remote sensing of wetlands, including what classification techniques were most successful in identifying wetlands and separating them from other land cover types. All types of wetlands have been studied with satellite remote sensing. Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, and SPOT are the major satellite systems that have been used to study wetlands; other systems are NOAA AVHRR, IRS-1B LISS-II and radar systems, including JERS-1, ERS-1 and RADARSAT. Early work with satellite imagery used visual interpretation for classification. The most commonly used computer classification method to map wetlands is unsupervised classification or clustering. Maximum likelihood is the most common supervised classification method. Wetland classification is difficult because of spectral confusion with other land cover classes and among different types of wetlands. However, multi-temporal data usually improves the classification of wetlands, as does ancillary data such as soil data, elevation or topography data. Classified satellite imagery and maps derived from aerial photography have been compared with the conclusion that they offer different but complimentary information. Change detection studies have taken advantage of the repeat coverage and archival data available with satellite remote sensing. Detailed wetland maps can be updated using satellite imagery. Given the spatial resolution of satellite remote sensing systems, fuzzy classification, subpixel classification, spectral mixture analysis, and mixtures estimation may provide more detailed information on wetlands. A layered, hybrid or rule-based approach may give better results than more traditional methods. The combination of radar and optical data provide the most promise for improving wetland classification.";"Ozesmi, Stacy L.

"AGRIS:US201600191243";"classificatory approach integrating fuzzy set theory and permutation techniques for land cover analysis: a case study on a degrading area of the Rift Valley (Ethiopia)";"";"We suggest a classificatory approach for land cover analysis that integrates fuzzy set theory with permutation techniques. It represents a non parametric alternative and/or a complement of traditional multivariate statistics when data are scarce, missing, burdened with high degree of uncertainty and originated from different sources and/or times. According to this approach, the Operational Geographic Units (OGUs) in which landscape is subdivided and sampled are classified with hierarchical clustering methods. The clusters of a classification which are significantly sharp are used to define fuzzy sets. In this way, the original data scores are transformed by degrees of belonging. We introduce the concepts of endogenous and exogenous fuzzy sets and we suggest to apply the Mantel test between the similarity matrices of these fuzzy sets to test the predictivity of internal variables with respect to external variables. The approach is applied to OGUs corresponding to the smallest administrative units (kebeles) of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, a degrading area with high risk of further degradation. We found that: 1) there is a high correlation between geo-physical features of the landscape (geology, rainfall and elevation) and some indicators of the human pressure such as land use/cover, land management for livestock breeding and human, household and livestock densities, 2) there is a high correlation between land degradation, measured with relative loss of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the human pressure. However, the correlation is higher when the human pressure is considered in the geo-physical context of the landscape. The approach can be easily applied to produce maps useful for planning purposes thanks to geographical information system (GIS) technology that is becoming available at low cost even to small administrative units of developing countries.";"Feoli, E.

These measures allow for empirical estimations of the hedonic price function that distinguish the property value effect associated with exposure to hazard from the property value effect associated with industrial activity.

We can consider it  as a basis to cope with (changing) social structure characteristics. Rationalisation of public services, which we face when coping with economic crisis, might  take this into consideration. The Forest Service network serves as a scanner of needs in their social context. It is also a respondent to local specifics in the form  of forest management measures.  Evidence of research on the social research in Slovenian forestry is weak, although not non-existent. We tested a system approach, a structuring method of  general public. Segmentation, a method presented, is generally known in marketing and has not been used in Slovenian forestry up to now. The two-step  clustering analysis of quantitative and qualitative data gathered with an inquiry of study circles (form of community learning) was used and is described  herewith. The results show three general value based segments of study circle participants.  The role of Slovenian forestry is changing and is not independent of its dynamic and colourful social contexts. Recognition of the society structure and  dynamics may contribute to the rationalisation of organisational models during the crisis period. However, grounded actualisation of recent organisational  models is possible only by considering priorities of the society ěs segments.

The study was carried out on second crop maize in Bafra District of Samsun province in 2001 and 2002 years. The experiment was established at four different directions (east-west, north-south, northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast) containing the plots with 70x12 cm row spacing and row planting distances in three replications. The result of the study revealed that the parcels constructed on N-S and NW-SE orientations seem to be more advantageous in terms of plant growth and yield. For this reason, during block planning in Land Consolidation, if the short axis of any block is created towards the NS direction (or the long axis of any block is on the EW direction), in this case, the long side of the plots created will be in the NS direction, hence significant gains might be expected in agricultural production comparing the other directions. On the other hand, when it is considered that the second highest yield is obtained from the NW-SE direction, it can be mentioned that the zone between N-S and NW-SE directions is a zone of optimal directions in the block planning in land consolidation. This information may provide important flexibility to the planner during the block planning.

Araştırma, parsellerin yönlendirilmesinin, bitkisel ürün verimi ve bazı verim özellikleri üzerindeki etkisini belirlemek amacıyla yapılmıştır. Çalışma Samsun'un Bafra İlçesinde 2001- 2002 yıllarında, ikinci ürün olarak, mısır bitkisi üzerinde yürütülmüştür. Deneme; doğu-batı, kuzey-güney, kuzeydoğu-güneybatı ve kuzeybatı-güneydoğu yönlerinde ve 70x12 cm sıra aralığı ve sıra üzeri ekim mesafelerinde olmak üzere 3 tekerrürlü olarak gerçekleştirilmiştir.

Diğer yandan; ikinci verimin alındığı yönün KB-GD olduğu dikkate alındığında, arazi toplulaştırmasında blok planlamasında bir optimum yönler bölgesinden söz edilebilir.

The number of farms stability coefficient in Lithuania is 1.08 on average. The complex index of the stability of the utilised agricultural area in Lithuania is 1.13 on average. The value of index is the lowest only in 8 of the 51 municipalities in Lithuania, i.e. from 1.00 to 1.09.

"AGRIS:US201600194582";"Ecological consequences of rapid urban expansion: Shanghai, China";"";"Since China's economic reform in the late 1970s, Shanghai, the country's largest and most modern city, has experienced rapid expansion and urbanization. Here, we explore its landâuse and landâcover changes, focusing on the impacts of the urbanization process on air and water quality, local climate, and biodiversity. Over the past 30 years, Shanghai's urban area and green land (eg urban parks, street trees, lawns) have increased dramatically, at the expense of cropland. Concentrations of major air pollutants (eg SOâ, NOâ, and total suspended particles) were higher in urban areas than in suburban and rural areas. Overall, however, concentrations have decreased (with the exception of NOâ), due primarily to a decline in coal consumption by industry and in private households. Increased NOâ pollution was mainly attributed to the huge increase in the number of vehicles on the roads. Water quality changes showed a pattern similar to that of air quality, with the most severe pollution occurring in urban areas. Differences in mean air temperatures between urban and rural areas also increased, in line with the rapid pace of urban expansion, indicating an accelerating âurban heat islandâ effect. Urban expansion also led to a decrease in native plant species. Despite its severe environmental problems, Shanghai has also seen major economic development. Managing the tradeoffs between urbanization and environmental protection will be a major challenge for Chinese policy makers. [Formula: see text]";"Zhao, Shuqing

"AGRIS:US201400175680";"Multiple approaches to valuation of conservation design and low-impact development features in residential subdivisions";"";"Residents, developers and civic officials are often faced with difficult decisions about appropriate land uses in and around metropolitan boundaries. Urban expansion brings with it the potential for negative environmental impacts, but there are alternatives, such as conservation subdivision design (CSD) or low-impact development (LID), which offer the possibility of mitigating some of these effects at the development site. Many urban planning jurisdictions across the Midwest do not currently have any examples of these designs and lack information to identify public support or barriers to use of these methods. This is a case study examining consumer value for conservation and low-impact design features in one housing market by using four different valuation techniques to estimate residents’ willingness to pay for CSD and LID features in residential subdivisions. A contingent valuation survey of 1804 residents in Ames, IA assessed familiarity with and perceptions of subdivision development and used an ordered value approach to estimate willingness to pay for CSD and LID features. A majority of residents were not familiar with CSD or LID practices. Residents indicated a willingness to pay for most CSD and LID features with the exception of clustered housing. Gender, age, income, familiarity with LID practices, perceptions of attractiveness of features and the perceived effect of CSD and LID features on ease of future home sales were important factors influencing residents’ willingness to pay. A hypothetical referendum measured willingness to pay for tax-funded conservation land purchases and estimated that a property tax of around $50 would be the maximum increase that would pass. Twenty-seven survey respondents participated in a subsequent series of experimental real estate negotiations that used an experimental auction mechanism to estimate willingness to pay for CSD and LID features. Participants indicated that clustered housing (with interspersed preserved forest or open space areas), rain gardens, and neighborhood streams with a forested buffer were the features they were most willing to pay for. Participants were not willing to pay for neighborhood streams without buffers. Finally, a spatial hedonic price model using 2093 homes in Ames, IA was used to estimate the effect of public and private open space on housing values. The model indicated that presence of neighborhood association-owned forest and water features as well as proximity to public parks had significant positive effects on housing prices. However, proximity to a public lake had a negative effect on home values. The four methods used in this study include both stated and revealed preference techniques. Although the relative magnitude of value expressed varied, all methods indicated that residents value CSD and LID subdivision features. Subdivision features that included explicit environmental benefits were also consistently preferred over features that did not. Familiarity with alternative designs was an important factor influencing resident willingness to pay for neighborhood features, and developers and civic officials should consider ways to educate citizens about CSD and LID development techniques to increase interest in these designs.";"Bowman, Troy

"AGRIS:US2016204998";"Análise de Investimentos para três projetos de produção de Soja e Milho na região de Umuarama - Paraná.";"";"O presente trabalho tem como objetivo apresentar o estudo comparativo de retorno de investimentos em três áreas de terras arrendadas, de diferentes tamanhos, localizadas na região noroeste do Paraná, mais especificamente no município de Umuarama. Nesta região de solo arenoso, denominado Arenito Caiuá, tem-se presenciado, um crescimento significativo no setor de agronegócio. E, este vem se destacando em todo Brasil, pela alta competitividade internacional, devido aos baixos custos de produção, à crescente demanda e ao território disponível. O trabalho identifica, aos investidores, o valor da aplicação inicial e conseqüentemente o valor do retorno, após o período da colheita. Foi considerada uma previsão inicial de cinco anos, desprezando o armazenamento dos produtos para posterior venda. Na elaboração do trabalho foram realizadas pesquisas de mercado, com o intuito de identificar valores de insumos, arrendamento, aluguel de máquinas e preços médios praticados. Também foram utilizadas planilhas eletrônicas, com o uso do software  EXCEL®, para apurar e calcular os indicadores TIR, VPL e Payback. Os levantamentos e comparações poderão subsidiar os investidores na aplicação de seu capital, especialmente na cultura da soja e milho safrinha. Finalmente, o trabalho indica o retorno do capital aplicado e concluí que quanto maior a área, maior será a rentabilidade do projeto e menor será o custo operacional.-----------------------------------------------The work presents a study of return on investment in three areas of land of different sizes, in Umuarama, norwest of Paraná. In this region, with arenaceous soil, called Arenito Caiuá, is having a significant growth in the agribusiness. This economic sector is very important in Brasil by high productivity e competiveness in international context. Low costs, increase demand and available territory are vantages for the country. The work identifies for the investors the inicial values and the return on investment after harvest. An initial forecast was considered five years. In the elaboration of this work, market researches had been for to identify the price of the inputs and the price of products (corn and soybean). Were used the ExcelR to calculate the IRR, NPV and Payback. The work indicates the return of the applied capital and concluded that how much bigger the area, greater will be the yield of the project and lewer the operational cost.";"Arieira, Jailson De Oliveira

"AGRIS:US201600063821";"Monthly spatial distributed water resources assessment: a case study";"";"Water resource conservation is of utmost importance, especially for agriculture in developing countries. Frequent occurrences of water shortage have driven more social efforts in researching on water resources spatial distribution, as the land cover changes recently have shown positive influences. For the purpose of efficient water resources management, hydrological processes under different types of land covers and soil textures are supposed to be accurately analyzed and evaluated. Recently developed distributed hydrological mode (DHM) has been a strong hydro-cycle simulation tool for inferring variability and heterogeneity of water resources distribution. In this paper, a spatially distributed Water and Energy Transfer between Soil, Plants and Atmosphere under quasi Steady State (WetSpass) model was introduced in the distributed hydro-cycle simulation on upstream Han river basin. The simulation time-step of WetSpass model was modified from originally one season to currently one month. In addition, an experiential non-linear routing algorithm was integrated into WetSpass for discharge confluence. The study area was delineated into 12 upstream to downstream routing related catchments whose land covers and soil textures were investigated and illustrated. Model verification was completed through the calibration of simulated hydrograph against observation using eleven years of continuous precipitation and meteorological data. Moreover, four criteria were used to evaluate the model performance and the calibrated results of routing parameters were discussed. Furthermore, the distribution of surface runoff generation, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge were illustrated and analyzed considering the spatial heterogeneity of land cover and soil texture. Results showed that water resource spatial distribution and hydrological processes were closely related to land cover and soil texture and the model had achieved a success in hydro-cycle modeling of upstream Han river basin.";"Wang, Yuhui

However, there is less knowledge of between-species variations in seasonal changes in leaf traits and trait interrelationships. Therefore, we examined variations in leaf area (LA), dry biomass (DM), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf gas-exchange parameters in one non-native and seven native tree species under field environmental conditions, in a karst area in China subjected to desertification. Measurements were taken three times during the growing season. The results show that the seven native trees had higher LA, DM, and water-use efficiency (WUE) than the non-native Cinnamomum camphora. In contrast, all the native tree species except Ligustrum lucidum had lower photosynthetic rates (P N) than the non-native species. In all species, the relationship between LA and DM was less variable than the relationship between SLA and LA. However, leaves of the non-native C. camphora and native species Sterculia lanceolata, Cleidiocarpon cavalerei and Cyclobalanopsis glauca were highly sensitive to seasonal conditions, leaves of Sapindus mukorossi and Ligustrum lucidum were less sensitive to seasonal changes, and leaves of Syzygium cumini and Cephalomappa sinensis were insensitive. An understanding of leaf traits will aid the selection of suitable species for land restoration.";"Wei, L. -Y.

"AGRIS:US201500008367";"Quantifying the sensitivity of ephemeral streams to land disturbance activities in arid ecosystems at the watershed scale";"";"Large areas of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management and located in arid regions of the southwestern United States are being considered for the development of utility-scale solar energy facilities. Land-disturbing activities in these desert, alluvium-filled valleys have the potential to adversely affect the hydrologic and ecologic functions of ephemeral streams. Regulation and management of ephemeral streams typically falls under a spectrum of federal, state, and local programs, but scientifically based guidelines for protecting ephemeral streams with respect to land-development activities are largely nonexistent. This study developed an assessment approach for quantifying the sensitivity to land disturbance of ephemeral stream reaches located in proposed solar energy zones (SEZs). The ephemeral stream assessment approach used publicly-available geospatial data on hydrology, topography, surficial geology, and soil characteristics, as well as high-resolution aerial imagery. These datasets were used to inform a professional judgment-based score index of potential land disturbance impacts on selected critical functions of ephemeral streams, including flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitat value, and groundwater recharge. The total sensitivity scores (sum of scores for the critical stream functions of flow and sediment conveyance, ecological habitats, and groundwater recharge) were used to identify highly sensitive stream reaches to inform decisions on developable areas in SEZs. Total sensitivity scores typically reflected the scores of the individual stream functions; some exceptions pertain to groundwater recharge and ecological habitats. The primary limitations of this assessment approach were the lack of high-resolution identification of ephemeral stream channels in the existing National Hydrography Dataset, and the lack of mechanistic processes describing potential impacts on ephemeral stream functions at the watershed scale. The primary strength of this assessment approach is that it allows watershed-scale planning for low-impact development in arid ecosystems; the qualitative scoring of potential impacts can also be adjusted to accommodate new geospatial data, and to allow for expert and stakeholder input into decisions regarding the identification and potential avoidance of highly sensitive stream reaches.";"O’Connor, Ben L.

"AGRIS:US201301956628";"OPTIMIZING SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE PRACTICES IN IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN THE SEMI-ARID AND ARID REGIONS: EXPERIENCES FROM EGYPT, INDIA AND PAKISTAN";"";"In this paper, the role of subsurface drainage in irrigated agriculture in semi-arid and arid regions is discussed based on experiences obtained in Egypt, India and Pakistan. Agriculture in these countries is predominantly practiced by small, marginal farmers with landholdings of often less than one hectare. In general, they do not have the means to pay for the investments in irrigation and drainage themselves. Consequently, most irrigation and drainage projects are funded by the (local) governments. Shallow horizontal pipe drainage systems have proved to be a technically feasible and cost-effective tool to combat the twin problem of waterlogging and salinity. Their large scale implementation is, however, hampered by a number of institutional and socio-economic reasons. The paper discusses why subsurface drainage is needed to safeguard investments in irrigated agriculture and to conserve land resources, as well as what the challenges are to make subsurface drainage work.

Az idők során a támogatási rendszer is a non-food termelést helyezte egyre inkább előtérbe, majd a kialakított direktívák és piaci intézkedések előkészítették, és így biztosították az összefoglalóan biomasszának nevezett megújítható energiaforrások helyét a felhasznált energiahordozók között. A folyamatokat a fosszilis energiahordozók egyre nagyobb mértékű áremelkedése gyorsította fel, amely az egyre nagyobb bekeverési arányt ösztönző irányelvekkel együtt nem várt mértékben fokozta a bioüzemanyagok iránti keresletet is. Az agro-üzemanyagokkal kapcsolatban nem csupán a károsanyag-kibocsátás pozitív hatásaival vagy gazdasági életképességével kapcsolatban merül fel egyre több kérdés, de a korlátozottan rendelkezésre álló, mezőgazdasági tevékenységbe vont, illetve vonható területek – bioüzemanyagok előállításával is – fenntartható használata szintén a vizsgálatok középpontjába került.Annak ellenére, hogy jelenleg a magyar bioüzemanyag-piac működését tekintve még hiányosságokkal küzd, reális annak a lehetőségnek, illetve következménynek a vizsgálata, hogy milyen változások várhatók a földhasználat tekintetében. A rendelkezésre álló adatok alapján várhatóan a művelés alá vont terület nagysága jelentős mértékben nem fog változni, az élelmiszer-ellátás biztonsága érdekében azonban kiemelkedő fontosságú, hogy a szerkezetváltás biztosítsa az emberi, állati és energiaipari ellátást is, amely közvetetten fokozza a gazdálkodók versenyképességét, növeli az életszínvonalukat és hozzájárul a vidéki lakosság vidéken tartásához.  -----------------------------------   Burgeoning energy usage, world population and starvation are problems, which have not been ameliorated for decades but are exacerbated by climate change and consequent extreme weather conditions. The present world economic crisis still further aggravates their resolution. The European Union, who played the role of a catalyst in increasing the proportion of renewable energy resources, searched from the beginning of the 80's for a solution for the use of surplus arable landcrops accumulated due to overproduction. As time went by communal support increasingly placed non-food crops to the forefront of production, then directives and market measures prepared and secured a place for the renewable energy carrier referred as biomass among other commonly used energy carriers. This process was hastened by rapidly rising fossil fuels prices that lead to increases in the proportion of bio-fuel content of fuels bringing about an unexpected rise in demand for bio-fuels. Concerning agrofuels, however, more and more questions arise relating not only to emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere and economy of production but also to the sustainable use of limitedly available agricultural land for bio-fuels production.Although the operation of present Hungarian bio-fuels market suffers from deficiencies it is not irrelevant to examine the changes in land usage and consequences due to bio-fuel production. Based on available data the area of cultivated land is not expected to alter significantly, but for the sake of food supply it is of paramount importance that any structural change in land usage must still secure human and animal food supply as well as the row materials for the energy industry that enhances farmers’ competitiveness, increases their living standard and helps country people to stay in the countryside.";"Vida, Adrienn

Also, the view of land managers is usually not taken into account when evaluating various sets of indicators. Our objective was to compare, in functional terms, soil quality assessments based on 29 indicators, a subset with 8 of those indicators, and 4 indicators selected independently by farmers, based on their perceptions of soil quality. The assessments were made for three different rice management systems in Camaquã, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, on soils of four soil textural classes based on clay content (<200, 200–400, 400–600, or >600gkg⁻¹). The effects of land management practices on soil functions (water infiltration, storage and supply; nutrient storage, supply and cycling; and sustained biological activity) were evaluated. Soil quality was best assessed using the entire set of 29 indicators, but use of smaller indicator sets showed the same trends among management systems, textural classes, and soil functions, thus providing meaningful information on soil quality for land managers.";"Lima, A.C.R.

"AGRIS:US201500197011";"Mapping of mangrove forest land cover change along the Kenya coastline using Landsat imagery";"";"Mangroves in Kenya provide a wide range of valuable services to coastal communities despite their relatively small total area. Studies at single sites show reductions in extent and quality caused by extraction for fuel wood and timber and clearance for alternative land use including saltpans, aquaculture, and tourism. Such studies suggest that Kenyan mangroves are likely to conform to the general global trend of declining area but there are no reliable recent estimates of either total mangrove extent or trends in coverage for the country. The total extent of Kenyan mangroves was estimated at four points in time (1985, 1992, 2000 and 2010) using Landsat satellite imagery. Due to its medium resolution, Landsat may underestimate mangrove areas in Kenya where relatively small, linear, coastal features occur. There is also a high frequency of clouds in the coastal areas which can cause data gaps during analysis. However comparison with aerial photographs taken in 1992 showed satisfactory levels of accuracy (87.5%) and Cohen’s Kappa (0.54) validating its use in this context. These 1992 data provided an independently validated baseline from which to detect changes (fore- and hind-casted) in other periods after removing cloud coverage. We estimated total mangrove coverage in 2010 at 45,590 ha representing a loss of 18% (0.7% yr⁻¹) in the 25 years between 1985 and 2010. Rates of mangrove loss for Kenya varied both spatially and temporally with variations possibly due to legislative inadequacies and differences in habitat alteration patterns. Hence freely available Landsat images proved adequate to detect changes in mangroves and revealed that Kenya shows rates of decline similar to (although slower than) global estimates.";"Kirui, K.B.

An analysis of species banks in the USA through a survey of data from the website www.SpeciesBanking.com (established as a âclearing houseâ for species banking information) was complemented by questionnaire material from USA bank managers. The number of USA species banks has increased rapidly, bank area ownership and management is consolidated in a small number of organizations, and public information on species credit price is limited. In interrogating the case material, the roles of specific economic policies associated with neoliberalism are considered, focusing on the extension of privatization, de- and re-regulation and marketization into the arena of environmental conservation, and commodification processes as manifested in species banking.

Next, I consider briefly, some questions to which it must face up in order to move closer in dismantling the barriers that inhibit the capacity for virtuous caretaking of the food system at various levels. Lastly, and more deeply, how successful might agrarianism be in inculcating citizenship values (ones that go beyond food ethics as a private affair), for the democratization of agricultural technologies? Might the Jeffersonian foundation to which the agrarianism (a la) Thompson appeals need something like a contemporary theory of justice in order to facilitate the reconstitution of our politico-moral selves?

"AGRIS:US201500197017";"Green corridors and fragmentation in South Eastern Black Sea coastal landscape";"";"Green corridors are inevitable part of land cover and land use planning activities as they affect climate, hydrology and ecology of the urbanized regions. Detection and monitoring of green corridors and their relative functions are very important in terms of landscape management. They also carry information on changing speed from “green to grey” and fragmentation level of the urbanized regions. Analyzing the fragmentation level of the landscape formation reflects the management strategy and overall success of decision makers. This paper aims to assessment landscape fragmentation in relation to green corridor planning for the first time on coastal section of Trabzon and Rize city centers from South Eastern part of the Black Sea. The study area is densely populated coastal region with linear-littoral formation. Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information System (GIS) and in-situ techniques were used to detect pattern and role of green corridors in the study area. Green coverage was extracted by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. SVM classifier performed better on digital aerial images when compared to multispectral satellite data. After the classification, five land use/cover (LULC) classes were obtained: urban green areas, asphalt ways, water, other urban objects and shades with 94.64 and 96.53 overall accuracies for Trabzon and Rize cities, respectively. Shape related landscape metrics were computed to show the level of fragmented green covers in study area. Larger patches were observed in Rize with higher Largest Patch Index (LPI) values. Computed Area Weighted Mean Shape Index (AWMSI) and Area Weighted Mean Patch Fractal Dimension (AWMPFD) values indicated higher urbanization rates in Trabzon city. Green corridor networks were proposed for each city by considering the fragmentation level and landscape design rules. Finally, some implications were done towards creating ecologic cities in the context of sustainable landscape and ecological conservation.";"Guneroglu, Nilgun

"AGRIS:US2012211581";"PUBLIC CONSERVATION LAND AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN THE NORTHERN FOREST REGION";"";"As with many environmental issues, debates about increasing public conservation lands in the Northern Forest region frequently center on a perceived tradeoff between jobs and the environment.  In particular, opponents of conservation lands often argue that employment will decline significantly when land is diverted from commodity-oriented uses such as wood products production.  To evaluate this claim, we estimate a model of simultaneous employment and net migration growth using data on the 92 non-metropolitan counties comprising the region.  Growth in employment and net migration are measured over the period 1990 to 1997 and the set of exogenous variables includes the 1990 share of the county land base in public conservation uses.  We find that net migration rates were systematically higher in counties with more conservation lands, but the effects are relatively small.  Public conservation lands were found to have no systematic effect on employment growth over the 1990 to 1997 period.  Two extensions are considered.  We examine the separate effects of preservationist and multiple-use lands.  We also identify a ""natural experiment"" involving changes in national forest management that allows us to estimate the effects of diverting private forestland to public conservation uses.  Our central conclusions are that existing public conservation lands have a positive, but small, effect on employment and migration in the Northern Forest region and that, over the range of our data, employment and migration are unlikely to be affected by timber harvest reductions resulting from the establishment of new conservation lands.";"Lewis, David A.

The apartheid policy and its numerous measures are the first causes of such a situation.  Besides, the existence of a relatively well-developed non-agricultural labour market also maintains productive agricultural activities at a low level.This paper attempts to contextualize those elements in the Eastern Cape province.  At province level, the paper first provides the main features of poverty and livelihood systems.  Then, typological approaches are used to better understand the socio-economic diversity of local livelihood systems, beyond generic statistics.The results show that diversity is a major trait of local livelihood systems.  Pensions and remittances are the pillars of livelihood systems, whereas local off-farm job opportunities remain scarce.  Farming activities, although widespread, form a significant source of cash income for a small proportion of households.The factors influencing such a diversity and the evolution of types are discussed.  It is confirmed that rural areas in Transkei follow some major trends that have been identified at a global level: diversification of rural livelihood at household level, de-agrarianisation and de-peasantisation at community level.";"Perret, Sylvain R.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"ZAF;018";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016204199";"http://purl.umn.edu/18063";"";"";"";""

Understanding phenotypic functional composition (PFC) is relevant in plant communities strongly dominated by a few keystone species, since alteration of phenotypic composition of these species might be a mechanisms by which land management practices such as grazing impact on ecosystem functioning. Here, we report results from a field experiment where we manipulated PFC of Bouteloua gracilis (Kunth) Lag. ex Griffiths, a keystone species in the semiarid shortgrass steppe. B. gracilis' PFC was altered by using plant genetic lines which expressed consistently either high or low leaf tissue lignin content (LC), a plant trait known to affect soil biogeochemical processes. High-LC lines came from an area subjected to low grazing intensities, whereas low-LC lines came from an area historically overgrazed. Additionally, those plant genetic lines expressing high LC also expressed high dry matter content and vice versa. We established experimental plots with High (only high-LC plants), Low (only low-LC plants), and mixed (both high- and low- LC plants, BHL) LC genetic lines; and measured selected soil processes after the application of a small water pulse. We hypothesised that those soil processes related to microbial activity and nitrogen cycling would be higher in Low plots in comparison with High and BHL plots. Phenotypic functional composition did not affect most of our soil processes including ammonium and nitrate concentrations (inorganic N), microbial activity, potential ammonium mineralization, and microbial profiles of substrate utilization). Nonetheless, we observed a general response to the water pulse so that soil inorganic N increased, but soil water content and soil microbial activity decreased 48 h after the pulse application. This general response suggests that fractions of the soil microbial community with different soil moisture optima mineralise N-rich substrates. Overall, lack of response to plant phenotypic functional composition suggests that grazing effects on soil biogeochemical processes in the shortgrass steppe are not directly mediated through how grazing affects the phenotypic functional composition of B. gracilis.";"Medina-Roldán, Eduardo

Effective collective action (CA) allows smallholder farmers to jointlyinvest in management practices that provide collective benefits in terms ofeconomic and sustainability gains. The Government of India takes integratedwatershed management (IWM) as a key strategy for improving productivity andlivelihoods in the rain-fed and drought-prone regions. This study investigates theinstitutional and policy issues that limit effective participation of people incommunity watershed programs and identifies key determinants for the degree ofCA and its effectiveness in achieving economic and environmental outcomes. Weuse empirical data from a survey of 87 watershed communities in semi-arid Indianvillages to identify a set of indicators of CA and its performance in attaining desiredoutcomes. Factor analysis is used to develop aggregate indices of CA and itseffectiveness. Regression methods are then employed to test the effects of certainpolicy relevant variables and to determine the potential effects of CA in achievingdesired poverty reduction and resource improvement outcomes. We find a positiveand highly significant effect of CA on natural resource investments, but no evidenceof its effects on household assets and poverty reduction outcomes.

"AGRIS:US201400192505";"Tasmanian landowner preferences for conservation incentive programs: A latent class approach";"";"An empirical model of landowners’ conservation incentive program choice is developed in which information about landowners’ socio-economic and property characteristics and their attitudes, is combined with incentive program attributes. In a Choice survey landowners were presented with the choice of two incentive programs modelled as ‘bundles of attributes’ mimicking a voluntary choice scenario. Landowner behaviour and decision and the type of conditions and regulations they preferred were analyzed. Based on choice survey data, landowner heterogeneity was accounted for using a latent class approach to estimate the preference parameters. Three latent classes of landowners with different attitudes to the role and outcome of establishing conservation reserves on private land were identified: multi-objective owners; environment owners; and production owners. Only a small proportion of landowners, mostly environment owners, would voluntarily join a program. Although compensation funding contributed to voluntary program choice for multi-objective owners and environment owners, welfare losses were around 4000 AUD per hectare, which is less than the average agricultural land value in Tasmania. Landowners for whom compensation funding contributed to voluntary program choice were also most likely to set aside land for conservation without payment. This raises the possibility that the government’s compensation expenditure could potentially be either reduced or re-allocated to landowners who will not voluntarily take conservation action. Increasing participation in conservation incentive programs and minimizing the welfare losses associated with meeting conservation targets may be best achieved by offering programs that allow flexibility in terms of legal arrangements and other program attributes.";"Putten, van Ingrid E.

We used complementary approaches (experimental, fisher-based) to investigate how small-scale variations in density, size and sex-ratio related to the ecology of S. serrata may impact fishing practices in New Caledonia. Crabs were measured/sexed across 9 stations in contrasted mangrove systems between 2007 and 2009. Stations were described and classified in different kinds of mangrove forests (coastal, riverine, and estuarine); vegetation cover was qualitatively described at station scale. Annual catch was used as an indicator of fishing pressure. Middle-scale environmental factors (oceanic influence, vegetation cover) had significant contributions to crab density (GLM, 84.8% of variance), crab size and sex-ratio (<30%). While small-scale natural factors contributed significantly to population structure, current fishing levels had no impacts on mud crabs. The observed, ecologically-driven heterogeneity of crab resource has strong social implications in the Pacific area, where land tenure system and traditional access rights prevent most fishers from freely selecting their harvest zones. This offers a great opportunity to encourage site-specific management of mud crab fisheries.";"Dumas, P.

Habitat reduction and fragmentation are perhaps the greatest threats. We used published data from a conservation genetics study of 5 endangered primates in China (Rhinopithecus roxellana, R. bieti, R. brelichi, Trachypithecus francoisi, and T. leucocephalus); distribution data on these species; and the distribution, area, and location of protected areas to inform conservation strategies for these primates. All 5 species were separated into subpopulations with unique genetic components. Gene flow appeared to be strongly impeded by agricultural land, meadows used for grazing, highways, and humans dwellings. Most species declined severely or diverged concurrently as human population and crop land cover increased. Nature reserves were not evenly distributed across subpopulations with unique genetic backgrounds. Certain small subpopulations were severely fragmented and had higher extinction risk than others. Primate mobility is limited and their genetic structure is strong and susceptible to substantial loss of diversity due to local extinction. Thus, to maximize preservation of genetic diversity in all these primate species, our results suggest protection is required for all sub‐populations. Key priorities for their conservation include maintaining R. roxellana in Shennongjia national reserve, subpopulations S4 and S5 of R. bieti and of R. brelichi in Fanjingshan national reserve, subpopulation CGX of T. francoisi in central Guangxi Province, and all 3 T. leucocephalus sub‐populations in central Guangxi Province.";"Liu, Zhijin

Before direct aids were introduced, there had been periods with decreasing prices for agricultural land and for rented agricultural area in real terms, according to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data base (specialised crop farms in 53 regions for 11 years) and EUROSTAT data (B, DK, D-W, F, NL in the period 1975 to 1999). Regression analysis is used to show the relationship between hapremiums, land rental prices and other relevant economic variables, such as land prices, rental share, livestock density, the price index of agricultural products and farm income. The analysis shows increasing price effects due to the introduction of ha-premiums on prices for agricultural land and on rental prices. Landlords received a share of about 6 % to 18 % of the ha-premiums (depending on the data source). An in-sample simulation, 1999-continuation scenario, and scenarios of further CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reforms are used for the assessment of the ex-post and ex-ante developments.

Using primary qualitative and quantitative data, this paper investigates the role of the titling policy in fostering the use of soil conservation practices by upland farmers in the northern mountains region. There, population growth and growing market demands have induced farmers to intensify agricultural production onto steep slopes. While poverty has been reduced, environmental16 problems such as soil erosion, landslides, and declining soil fertility have become severe over the past years. Our findings suggest that soil conservation technologies although relatively well known are perceived as being economically unattractive. Focusing on agroforestry, we estimate household and plot level econometric models to empirically assess the determinants of adoption. We find that the possession of a formal land title influences adoption, but that the threat of land re-allocations in villages creates uncertainty and discourages this type ofinvestment. We conclude that more efforts are needed from decision-makers to promote and support the adoption of conservation practices and also to clarify objectives of the land policy in order to secure land tenure and initiate a more sustainable development in fragile areas.";"Saint-Macary, Camille

"AGRIS:US201500205293";"Hydrologic changes resulting from urban cover in seasonally snow‐covered catchments";"";"There are few multibasin analyses of the effects of urban land cover on seasonal stream flow patterns within northern watersheds where winter snow cover is the norm. In this study, the effects of urban cover on stream flow were evaluated at nine catchments in southern Ontario, Canada, which vary greatly in urban impervious cover (1–84%) but cluster into two groups having ≥54% urban impervious area (‘urban’) and ≤11% impervious cover (‘rural’), respectively. Annual and seasonal run‐off totals (millimetres) were similar between the rural and urban groups and were relatively insensitive to urban cover. Instead, urban streams had significantly greater high flow frequency, flow variability and quickflow and lower baseflow compared with rural streams. Furthermore, differences in high flow frequency between urban and rural stream groups were largest in the summer and fall and less extreme in the winter and spring, perhaps because of the homogenizing effect of winter snow cover, frozen ground and spring melt on surface imperviousness. Although the clear clustering of streams into urban and rural groups precluded the identification of a threshold above which urban cover is the primary cause of flow differences, relatively high extreme flow frequency and flow variability in the two most urbanized of the rural streams (10–11% impervious) suggest that it may lie close to this range. Furthermore, whereas total run‐off volumes were not affected by urban cover, increases in stream flashiness and a greater frequency of high flow events particularly during the summer and fall may negatively impact stream biota and favour the transfer of surface‐deposited pollutants to urban streams.

Farms are categorized by geographic region, farm type, farm size, gross cash sales, farm tenure, net farm income, debt-to-asset, and age of farmer to analyze relationships between financial performance and farm characteristics. Five-year averages, 2000-2004, and farm financial trends for the 1996-2005 period are also presented.

Year-to-year changes in median net farm income within regions and farm types averaged 50 percent from 1996 to 2005.  Median net farm income fell slightly in 2005 to $42,286, but 19 percent of farms had net farm income greater than $100,000.  Financial performance was lowest in 1997 and 1998 when over one-half of farms could not make scheduled term debt payments.  In 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004 the rate of return on equity exceeded the rate of return on assets, which indicates that debt capital was employed profitably. The first rise in eight years of interest expense as a percent of gross revenue occurred in 2005, to 6.0.

The Red River Valley and crop farms had stronger profitability, solvency and repayment capacity from 1995 to 2004 than other regions and farm types, respectively, but were out performed by the south central region and livestock farms in 2005. Farms with sales less than $100,000 were three times as likely to have debt-to-asset higher than 70 percent than were farms with sales greater than $500,000. Farms that own some crop land, but less than 40 percent and are more likely to be crop farms, farm more acreage, have larger sales, and be more profitable.

We studied the export of DOC from Finnish rivers to the Baltic Sea between 1975 and 2010, and estimated trends in DOC fluxes (both flow normalised and non-normalised). The study encompassed the whole Finnish Baltic Sea catchment area (301,000km²) covering major land use patterns in the boreal zone. Finnish rivers exported annually over 900,000t DOC to the Baltic Sea, and the mean area specific export was 3.5t km⁻². The highest export (7.3t km⁻²) was measured in peat dominated catchments, whereas catchments rich in lakes had the lowest export (2.2t km⁻²). Inter-annual variation in DOC export was high and controlled mainly by hydrology. There was no overall trend in the annual water flow, although winter flow increased in northern Finland over 36years. Despite the numerous studies showing increases in DOC concentrations in streams and rivers in the northern hemisphere, we could not find any evidence of increases in DOC export to the northern Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments since 1975.";"Räike, Antti

Reforestation with frugal conifers has been carried out in the area over the last 50years. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the impact of reforestation and land use change on erosion rates in nine small drainage basins through a multidisciplinary approach. Geological, geomorphological, hydrological and land use characteristics were analyzed by a diachronic confrontation between pre-reforestation (1954) and post-reforestation (2007) situations. Aerial-photo interpretation and processing in GIS allowed us to quantify changes in areas affected by badland erosion, land use and variations in erosion rates. Moreover, dendrometric data were gathered from 18 circular sample plots in forest stands of 40years old. This allowed us to evaluate both the adaptability of different forest species to the clayey substrate and reforestation fragmentation. The differences between the pre- and post-reforestation situations led to increases in arable land and forest areas and considerable decreases in erosion rates and badland areas. However, no significant correlation between the erosion rates and the forest area emerged, due to the excessive fragmentation of reforestation cores and relatively small reforested surfaces. Land reclamation seems to have played a more important role in reducing erosion in the clayey substrate. The integrated method presented here is an important tool useful to understand the morphological dynamics of badlands in relation to forest vegetation, and for land planning and management.";"Castaldi, Fabio

[1] have been spatially allocated on the EU-27¹ territory using several auxiliary geospatial layers describing, for example, land cover, expected biomass productivity derived from soil parameters, climatic zones and topographical conditions. In the second step the number of model power plants (i.e., plants with a size of 50MW thermal input and a raw material demand of about 100kt/yr might be conveniently fed with available crop residues was estimated on the basis of two different allocation strategies implying a different grade of optimization. The results show that the estimated crop residue resources in EU-27 could provide fuel for about 850 plants expected to produce about 1500PJ/yr. Mobilization needs for the residues are also estimated, leading to a total amount of 1.5×10¹²–2×10¹²tkm are necessary for the full potential exploitation.";"Monforti, F.

"AGRIS:US201400182644";"Influences on the spatial pattern of soil carbon and nitrogen in forested and non-forested riparian zones in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Delaware River Basin";"";"This study investigated the landscape characteristics that influence C and N in unsaturated surface soils of riparian zones along 1st to 3rd order streams in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the Delaware River Basin. Unsaturated surface soils (0–30cm) were sampled in forested and non-forested sites at 29 locations throughout S New Jersey and SE Pennsylvania. Overall, the soil %C and %N in forested and non-forested riparian sites studied in this investigation were comparable to similar riparian zone soils in eastern North America. However, the soil C and N contents of these Atlantic Coastal Plain soils were 3 to 8-fold greater which underscores the value of these riparian soils as C pools. Soil C content (100.3±15.0Mgha⁻¹) in forested riparian sites was consistently higher but not statistically different (P>0.05) from soil C content (90.6±12.1Mgha⁻¹) in non-forested riparian sites. Likewise, neither soil N storage or the C:N ratio were different between the contrasting land covers but forested sites with forest floor organic horizons had significantly greater (82%, P=0.004) soil C storage than the non-forested sites. Of the forested sites, 70% did not have organic horizons. All of the forested sites without organic horizons had abundant earthworms and comparisons of sites with and without forest floor suggests that earthworms and the removal of native forest cover may be responsible for a loss of 75–93Mgha⁻¹ of soil C from these riparian zones. Multivariate regression tree analysis was able to explain ⩾50% of the variability in soil C and N and as much as 68% of the variability in the C:N ratio. The analysis indicated that watershed-scale land cover, local soil series, and elevation above the active channel had the greatest influence on C and N storage. Moreover, this analysis indicated that a combination of easily measured, reach-scale characteristics and GIS-based watershed-scale variables can be used to estimate regional riparian soil C pools and identify restoration sites with the potential to store soil C.";"Bedison, James E.

The model also assumes that kinship contracts may eliminate or reduce the Marshallian inefficiency (H3) and threat of eviction (H4) effects on land productivity. Our empirical findings were consistent with H2 and H4 being true. We found higher land productivity on sharecropped plots than on share tenants' own plots and higher land productivity on sharecropped plots of nonkin than of kin tenants. The nature of the data allowed controlling for unobservable household characteristics through household fixed effects and for observable plot characteristics. Analyses with and without plot characteristics revealed that these findings were stronger with plot characteristics than without them. Based on the plausible assumption that observable plot characteristics are positively correlated with unobservable plot characteristics this strengthens our conclusion. The results are also supported by first-order stochastic dominance analysis. Sharecropped plots' output value distribution unambiguously dominated the output value distribution from share tenants' own plots. Nonkin sharecropped plots' output value distribution also first-order stochastically dominated the output value distribution from kin sharecrop plots.";"Kassie, Menale

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) produces the most detailed digital spatial soil datasets that are publicly available. The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database contains basic attributes for the continuous coverage of soils across the United States. In its standard format, the SSURGO database is incompatible for use within the ArcView Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A modified version of the State Soil and Geographic (STATSGO) database is the template soils dataset used by ArcView SWAT. This paper presents the methodology and development of a SSURGO database preprocessor extension for the ArcView SWAT model. A case study for the Upper Sabinal River Watershed near Uvalde, Texas, is given. Results indicate that hydrologic output parameter differences occur when comparing the STATSGO and SSURGO database information in the ArcView SWAT model under identical modeling conditions. Specifically, the SSURGO model produced a greater daily mean water yield with evapotranspiration and surface runoff being found consistently lower across the watershed. The most likely causes assigned to this phenomenon were higher percolation and resulting ground water return flow values due to significantly larger saturated hydraulic conductivity values associated with the SSURGO 2.x database.";"Peschel, J.M.

A key hypothesis is thatconsolidation of agricultural land in Moldova has beneficial effects in terms of productivity and is desirable in the long run. We examine the case for market-driven land consolidation using data from several recent surveys in Moldova. We show that, in the individual sector, larger farms consume less of their output and attain higher levels of commercialization. Larger individual farms thus have higherrevenues from commercial sales and generate higher family incomes. Farm augmentationaccordingly makes a positive contribution to the well-being of the rural population. The extent of parcel consolidation is directly correlated with the relative efficiency of farms: consolidated family farms are more efficient than those with fragmented holdings. Hence, land consolidation leads to better economic performance of family farms.";"Cimpoies, Dragos

"AGRIS:US201600105452";"Mountain pastoralism in transition: Consequences of legalizing Cordyceps collection on yak farming practices in Bhutan";"";"Yak farming is the main livelihood source for the high altitude communities in the eastern Himalaya. With increasing access to modern facilities, market opportunities and changes in the legal framework, pastoral systems in the Himalaya are undergoing an unprecedented change. Questionnaire-based qualitative surveys were conducted in five villages of northern Bhutan, to understand how the recent changes in the legal framework for Cordyceps (known as caterpillar fungus) collection have caused specific changes in yak farming practices. Survey results revealed that women were increasingly involved in yak husbandry and household work, after the legalization of Cordyceps collection in 2004. After legalization, the Cordyceps business overtook yak farming as the main income-earning activity. Post-legalization saw a decline in the overall grassland condition and most herders migrated a month earlier to the summer grazing land. Legalization also led to increase in the number of households buying commercial feeds for yaks. Yak mortality increased and fodder scarcity became more acute, which is a major constraint to yak farming. Despite the good income from the Cordyceps business, yak farming was the preferred earning activity over Cordyceps due to herders’ confidence in yak farming as a reliable source of livelihood. Of several measures proposed by yak herders to improve yak farming, increasing grassland productivity and providing subsidies for feed purchases were the most important measures. The study concluded that yak farming practices have undergone a few positive but more undesirable changes after the legalization of Cordyceps collection in 2004. The results suggest multi-disciplinary approaches to address adequately the emerging issues of yak farming e.g. introducing schemes to make yak farming attractive to the mountain youth. The paper suggests interventions to strengthen yak farming and help herders make informed choices in the high altitude rangelands of Bhutan. Essentially, yak farming is at a crossroads where a firm decision is needed to either encourage and strengthen the farming practices or witness the gradual extinction of the age-old tradition.";"Wangchuk, Kesang

"AGRIS:US201600181237";"Shrub control by browsing: Targeting adult plants";"";"Reconciling the well known benefits of shrubs for forage with environmental goals, whilst preventing their dominance, is a major challenge in rangeland management. Browsing may be an economical solution for shrubby rangelands as herbivore browsing has been shown to control juvenile shrub growth. Less convincing results have been obtained for adult plants, and long-term experiments are required to investigate the cumulative effects on adult plants. We therefore assessed the impact of different levels of browsing intensity on key demographic parameters for a major dominant shrub species (broom, Cytisus scoparius), focusing on adult plants. We assigned individual broom plants to one of three age classes: 3â5 years (young adults); 5â7 years (adults); and 7â9 years (mature adults). These plants were then left untouched or had 50% or 90% of their total edible stem biomass removed in simulated low-intensity and high-intensity browsing treatments, respectively. Morphological, survival and fecundity data were collected over a period of four years. Browsing affected the morphology of individual plants, promoting changes in subsequent regrowth, and decreasing seed production. The heavily browsed plants were 17% shorter, 32% narrower, and their twigs were 28% shorter. Light browsing seemed to control the growth of young adult plants more effectively than that of older plants. Reproductive output was considerably lower than for control plants after light browsing, and almost 100% lower after heavy browsing. High-intensity browsing had a major effect on survival causing high levels of plant mortality. We conclude that suitable browsing practices could be used to modify adult shrub demography in the management of shrub dominance and forage value.";"da Silveira Pontes, LaÃ­se

Pasture degradation can be indexed by pasture nutritional status, which is impacted by environmental and human related factors. Most studies of the biogeochemistry of Amazonian pastures have been restricted to highly acidic soils with little focus on how management affects pasture biogeochemistry. We investigated soil physical and chemical properties and grass nutrients under different edaphic conditions and management practices in Rondônia state, in the southwestern Amazon region. Our objectives were to analyze the impacts of soil order, pasture age, and pasture management on soil fertility, bulk density and plant nutrients, in order to understand sustainability needs for the future of this region. We sampled 17 study sites on Oxisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols. The pasture age classes we used consisted of 6-10, 11-15, and >16 years including forest as the control. We also evaluated the impact of beef and dairy management strategies on pastures installed on Ultisols. Pastures on Alfisols showed the highest soil P, Ca, and base saturation, properties that decreased gradually after 5 years of pasture installation. In contrast, pastures on Oxisols showed low and stable levels of nutrients regardless of age. Foliar nutrient concentrations appear to be influenced by edaphic conditions. Soil P and foliar P concentration were highly correlated. In general, pasture age was a poor indicator of soil fertility and foliar chemistry because of high variability among pastures belonging to the same soil order. In terms of the impacts of pasture management, we did not observe significant differences in soil or foliar properties in pasture used for beef and dairy on Ultisols.";"Numata, I.

We also used logistic regression analyses to examine key environmental, socioeconomic and institutional drivers associated with deforestation. One of the areas, La Montaña (LM) at Hopelchen, Campeche, is part of the northern section and buffer zone of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR) as well as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. LM is an agricultural forest frontier region economically dependent on productive activities. The other study, Zona Maya (ZM), found at the municipality of Felipe Carrillo Puerto in Quintana is characterized by having developed community-based forestry enterprises with world wide recognition. In addition, the major tourism industry in nearby Cancun and Riviera Maya provide an important source of off-farm labor and temporary migration. Results show contrasting annual deforestation rates among the two study areas, being greater in the Campeche site (0.7% from 2000 to 2005) compared to Quintana Roo (-0.002% from 2000 to 2004). Logistic regression results show that the occurrence of land clearing at LM is significantly related to demographic variables as well as soil-environment types and conservation status did not reveal to relate to LUCC processes at all. At Quintana Roo, despite twice the population density, population variables at large did not strongly correlate to forest clearing. Rather forest conservation or maintenance was shown to be influenced by local community forestry institutions and a landscape zoning provided by larger management goals from the part of the communities. Greater availability of wage labor for the prominent tourism economy may also reflect a lesser dependence on agriculture and contribute to the much lower deforestation rate. Nonetheless, results show that community forest management can play an effective role in forest conservation. We argue for a regional land use management approach as a conservation strategy in which local inhabitants are considered key actors.";"Ellis, Edward A.

"AGRIS:US201400148649";"impact of agro‐pastoral abandonment on the Rock Partridge Alectoris graeca in the Apennines";"";"Human depopulation of rural mountain areas and the consequent abandonment of traditional land management are among the greatest driving forces behind changes in mountain ecosystems in Western Europe. Tree and shrub encroachment lead to an increase in landscape matrix uniformity and habitat fragmentation. For some animal species, this represents an unusual case of habitat loss caused by secondary succession. The animal species associated with this agro‐pastoral habitat may suffer from decreased connectivity as a consequence. The Rock Partridge Alectoris graeca is a species endemic to European mountains that represents a model for investigating the impact of habitat loss. We compared the habitat suitability of the Apennine Rock Partridge prior to abandonment of traditional agro‐pastoral activities by aerial photography with the current landscape, in order to investigate the effect of secondary succession on the distribution and viability of the species. We assessed the historical distribution (c. 1900–1950) by quantifying anecdotal evidence from interviews, and the current distribution (2005) from survey data. We applied ecological niche factor analysis and connectivity approaches to evaluate change in habitat suitability over this time scale. Moreover, to quantify landscape connectivity, we evaluated the relative importance of each patch in the two periods. Results indicated that to maintain a viable population in the Apennines, the species requires an ensemble of ecological conditions considerably different from the current situation. We observed a drastic decrease in connectivity as a result of a reduction in numbers and size of high suitability patches. This is most probably the primary cause of the current decline of the Rock Partridge population in the Apennines.";"RIPPA, DANIELA

Because many, if not most, restoration projects require continual management once established, human choice remains a vital component of restoration projects for their entire life. But ecological restorationists often downplay the role of choice in restoration, partly because we see the choice to restore as obvious and inherently good and partly because we feel the restoration of more natural conditions for a habitat will lessen the impact of human choice over time. Some critics feel the role of human choice in restoration degrades the value of restoration. However, another response to human choice in restoration is to embrace choice, even with the problems it brings, and use choice as a way to more fully engage humans with the environment. If such choices are approached carefully, with recognition of the potential for poor choices, then restorationists can arrive at restorations that are better for both the environment and us.";"Allison, Stuart K.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300836755";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00271.x";"";"";"";"601-605"

"AGRIS:US201400036699";"No longer tracking greenery in high altitudes: Pastoral practices of Rupshu nomads and their implications for biodiversity conservation";"";"Nomadic pastoralism has thrived in Asia’s rangelands for several millennia by tracking seasonal changes in forage productivity and coping with a harsh climate. This pastoralist lifestyle, however, has come under intense transformations in recent decades due to socio-political and land use changes. One example is of the high-altitude trans-Himalayan rangelands of the Jammu and Kashmir State in northern India: major socio-political reorganisation over the last five decades has significantly impacted the traditional pasture use pattern and resources. We outline the organizational transformations and movement patterns of the Rupshu pastoralists who inhabit the region. We demonstrate the changes in terms of intensification of pasture use across the region as well as a social reorganisation due to accommodation of Tibetan refugees following the Sino-Indian war in 1961 to 1962. We focus in particular on the Tso Kar basin - an important socio-ecological system of livestock herding and biodiversity in the eastern Ladakh region. The post-war developmental policies of the government have contributed to these modifications in traditional pasture use and present a threat to the rangelands as well as to the local biodiversity. In the Tso Kar basin, the number of households and livestock has almost doubled while pasture area has declined by half. These changes have potentially negative consequences for the long-term resilience of nomadic pastoralism as well as for the survival of rare local wildlife. To increase the pastoralist standard of living, having fewer pastoralists may be the only solution, and alternative livelihood options may bring this about. Development programmes should concentrate on enhancing opportunities for herders so that there is a greater diversity of employment opportunities and potentially better chances for the persistence of biodiversity.";"Singh, Navinder J

Important improvements are: the use of fate analysis, the much better definition of the damage categories concerned with human health and ecosystem health, using the PAF (Potentially Affected Fraction) and DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years) concept, and a completely new approach to modelling resources and land use. Perhaps the most fundamental improvement is the management system for value choices. The result of this management system is that there will be three instead of one indicator. Each version is based on a different cultural perspective. The method should be updated continuously. It is proposed to set up an independent organisation to guide this future development.";"Goedkoop, Mark

Specifically, the method is a variant of density estimation. We revisit in this article the MS paradigm and its use for clustering of remotely sensed images. Specifically, we investigate further the classification accuracy of remotely sensed images as a function of various MS parameters, such as the variant used, kernel type, dimensionality, kernel bandwidth, etc. We provide empirical assessment of the algorithm based on experiments with multi-temporal and multi-spectral remotely sensed data sets, representing agricultural and land-cover data. Although the classification accuracy and reliability seem comparable to those obtained by other unsupervised methods (e.g. ISODATA), the MS algorithm provides several important operational advantages. The adaptation of the procedure to a parallel computational environment is also discussed and demonstrated.";"Friedman, Lior

"AGRIS:US2016200479";"The Role of Irrigation in Determining the Global Land Use Impacts of Biofuels";"";"In recent years there has been a flurry of activity aimed at evaluating the land useconsequences of biofuels programs and the associated carbon releases. In this paper we argue that these studies have tended to underestimate the ensuing land use change, because they have ignored the role of irrigation, and associated constraints on cropland expansion. In this paper, wedevelop a new general equilibrium model which distinguishes irrigated and rainfed cropping industries at a global scale. Using the new model we evaluate the implications of land use change due to US ethanol programs, in the context of short run constraints on the expansion of irrigatedcropland. Since irrigated area tends to offer a higher yield than its rainfed counterpart, this provides an upper bound on the change in cropland following biofuel expansion. We find that the biofuel-induced expansion in global cropland cover is about 16 percent larger when the irrigationconstraint is imposed. This translates into a 21 percent increase in land use emissions due to US ethanol production. This estimate represents an upper bound, since irrigated area can be expanded over the medium run in many places around the world.";"Taheripour, Farzad

"AGRIS:US201500077987";"SWAT plant growth modification for improved modeling of perennial vegetation in the tropics";"";"The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been used for assessing the impact of land cover and land management changes on water resources for a wide range of scales and environmental conditions across the globe. However, originally designed for temperate regions, SWAT must be critically examined for its appropriate use in tropical watersheds. One major concern is the simulation of perennial tropical vegetation due to the absence of dormancy. While for temperate regions SWAT uses dormancy to terminate growing seasons of trees and perennials, seasonality in the tropics (wet and dry season) can only be represented by defining date or heat unit specific “plant” and “kill” operations which are fixed for every year of simulation. In this paper, we discuss these shortcomings and present an alternative approach to automatically initiate annual growing cycles based on changes in soil moisture. Furthermore, we propose a logistic leaf area index (LAI) decline function which approaches a user-defined minimum LAI instead of using the default function, which is not considering the minimum LAI. The modified SWAT model was tested based on MODIS LAI and evapotranspiration data for the Santa Maria/Torto watershed in Central Brazil, covered mostly by Cerrado (savanna) vegetation. Our model results show that the modified model can reasonably represent seasonal dynamics of the Cerrado biome. However, since the proposed changes are process-based but also allow flexible model settings (e.g. the beginning of growing cycles based on a soil moisture threshold adjustable for plant/land cover types), the modified plant growth module should be useful for large parts of the model community.";"Strauch, Michael

We estimated the stocks of total carbon and nutrients, microbial biomass and different P fractions along a gradient of land-uses that is typical of the eastern escarpment of the Cordillera Real i.e., old-growth evergreen lower montane forest, active pastures (17 and 50 years-old), abandoned pastures 10 and 20 years old with bracken fern or successional vegetation. Conversion of forest to pasture by slash-and-burn increased the stocks of SOC, TN, P and S in mineral topsoil of active pasture sites. Microbial growth in pasture soils was enhanced by improved availability of nutrients, C:N ratio, and increased soil pH. Up to 39 % of the total P in mineral soil was stored in the microbial biomass indicating its importance as a dynamic, easily available P reservoir at all sites. At a 17 years-old pasture the stock of NH₄F extractable organic P, which is considered to be mineralisable in the short-term, was twice as high as in all other soils. The importance of the NaOH extractable organic P pool increased with pasture age. Pasture degradation was accelerated by a decline of this P stock, which is essential for the long-term P supply. Stocks of microbial biomass, total N and S had returned to forest levels 10 years after pasture abandonment; soil pH and total P 20 years after growth of successional bush vegetation. Only the C:N ratio increased above forest level indicating an ongoing loss of N after 20 years. Soil nutrient depletion and microbial biomass decline enforced the degradation of pastures on the investigated Cambisol sites.";"Hamer, Ute

"AGRIS:US201500007325";"SAC-SMA a priori parameter differences and their impact on distributed hydrologic model simulations";"";"Deriving a priori gridded parameters is an important step in the development and deployment of an operational distributed hydrologic model. Accurate a priori parameters can reduce the manual calibration effort and/or speed up the automatic calibration process, reduce calibration uncertainty, and provide valuable information at ungauged locations. Underpinned by reasonable parameter data sets, distributed hydrologic modeling can help improve water resource and flood and flash flood forecasting capabilities. Initial efforts at the National Weather Service Office of Hydrologic Development (NWS OHD) to derive a priori gridded Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model parameters for the conterminous United States (CONUS) were based on a relatively coarse resolution soils property database, the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO) (Soil Survey Staff, 2011) and on the assumption of uniform land use and land cover. In an effort to improve the parameters, subsequent work was performed to fully incorporate spatially variable land cover information into the parameter derivation process. Following that, finer-scale soils data (the county-level Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) (Soil Survey Staff, 2011a,b), together with the use of variable land cover data, were used to derive a third set of CONUS, a priori gridded parameters. It is anticipated that the second and third parameter sets, which incorporate more physical data, will be more realistic and consistent. Here, we evaluate whether this is actually the case by intercomparing these three sets of a priori parameters along with their associated hydrologic simulations which were generated by applying the National Weather Service Hydrology Laboratory’s Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) (Koren et al., 2004) in a continuous fashion with an hourly time step. This model adopts a well-tested conceptual water balance model, SAC-SMA, applied on a regular spatial grid, and links to physically-based kinematic hillslope and channel routing models. Discharge and soil moisture simulated using the different set of parameters are presented to show how the parameters affect the results and under what conditions one set of parameters works better than another. In total, 63 basins ranging in size from 30km² to 5224km² were selected for this study. Sixteen of them were used to study the effects of different a priori parameters on simulated flow. Simulated hourly flow time series from three cases were compared to hourly observed data to compute statistics. Although the overall statistics are similar for the three different sets of parameters, improvements in simulated flow are observed for small basins when SSURGO-based parameters are used. Fifty-seven basins covering different climate regimes were used to analyze differences in the modeled soil moisture. Results again showed that the use of SSURGO-based parameters generate better soil moisture results when compared to STATSGO-based results, especially for the upper soil layer of smaller basins and wet basins.";"Zhang, Ziya

"AGRIS:US201500162971";"Indicators of nutrients transport from agricultural catchments under temperate climate: A review";"";"The flow of chemical materials along spatial elements is a fundamental aspect of landscape ecology. The research renders indicators for water pollution, which are utile for functional water management and land use planning. Ecologists identify mechanisms of nutrients transfer and mitigate their environmental impacts using freshwater wetlands and riparian buffers. In order to estimate the N (nitrogen) and P (phosphorus) loss risk, current research combines indicators into index models. The objective of this work was to review the factors of transport from upland source areas to surface water as N and P indicators, and to report on the magnitudes of N and P fluxes in agricultural landscapes under temperate climate. We reviewed the ISI Web of Science for recent developments on N and P transport factors and nutrient index models, and we suggested how to improve these schemes. We presented conceptual diagrams of N and P transport. Catchment-scale index models use factors of contributing distance, connectivity, soil properties, and erosion as indicators. P losses are mainly dependent on overland flow conduits and barriers, whereas subsurface flows control N more. Riparian vegetation accumulates great N and P amounts, while it is usually just a temporary sink. Riparian soil is a smaller but a more permanent store, whereas it may turn to a nutrient sink, too, when saturated. Anaerobic soil microbes denitrify somewhat less N, while this process is irreversible, and therefore equally crucial. In spite of this, most nutrient index models do not consider wetlands and riparian buffers. Hence we suggest to include the removal capacity of the riparian buffer zone in both catchment N and P index models. In general, we propose a landscape framework, which considers upland source areas, transit, and hydric riparian landscape elements as a single system.";"Pärn, Jaan

Artificial waterpoints are constructed by wildlife managers to supplement natural water supplies, to support herbivore populations. The aim of this paper is to analyse how a landowner may realize his ecological and economic goals by manipulating waterpoints for the management of an elephant population, a water-dependent species in the presence of water-independent species. We develop a theoretical bio-economic framework to analyse the optimization of wildlife management objectives (in this case revenue generation from both consumptive and non-consumptive use and biodiversity conservation), using waterpoint construction as a control variable. The model provides a bio-economic framework for analysing optimization problems where a control has direct effects on one herbivore species but indirect effects on the other. A landowner may be interested only in maximization of profits either from elephant offtake and/or tourism revenue, ignoring the negative effects that could be brought about by elephants to biodiversity. If the landowner does not take the indirect effects of waterpoints into consideration, then the game reserve management, as the authority entrusted with the sustainable management of the game reserve, might use economic instruments such as subsidies or taxes to the landowners to enforce sound waterpoint management.";"Mwakiwa, Emmanuel

Research funders are requiring greater returns on their investments and scientists are expected to demonstrate clearly how their research can inform policy and regulation to deliver positive consequences for societal, economic and environmental wellbeing. Within the co-evolving context of environmental management research in dryland Africa and the policy approaches designed to mitigate land degradation, few academic analyses have deconstructed the practical ‘bottom-up’ actions that can help to channel scientific research into national decision-making and policy. Similarly, while international platforms developed by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification have started to facilitate greater knowledge exchange between scientists and policymakers, analyses have failed to consider the powerful informal actions that scientists can take to allow their research to inform evidence-based international policy. Drawing on examples in the literature from research on land degradation and sustainable land management across sub-Saharan African drylands, we identify key enabling activities that help make scientific research more visible, accessible to, and compatible with, policy processes at local, national and international levels. We argue that these enablers are applicable to other environmental research areas beyond land degradation, and suggest that improved understanding of science into policy processes that look across multiple scales and levels will help researchers and policy-makers to better match information supply and demand to the mutual benefit of both groups.";"Stringer, Lindsay C.

The dynamics of runoff and suspended sediment transport are not completely understood. In this study, we examined the trends, breaking point and regime changes for the runoff and sediment load at different temporal scales using 50 years of continuous observational data from a highly erodible sub‐catchment with an area of 7,325 km² in the Beiluo River basin on the Loess Plateau, China. At the annual scale, the runoff and sediment load declined significantly (p < 0·05) with decreasing rates of −0·23 mm y⁻¹ and −164·9 Mg km⁻² y⁻¹, respectively. Abrupt changes in the runoff and sediment load series were detected between 1979 and 1999; thus, the data were divided into intervals of 1960–1979, 1980–1999 and 2000–2009. The flow duration curve analysis indicated increasing low‐flow values and decreasing daily runoff and sediment discharge peaks, which suggested that soil and water conservation measures reduced the volume of runoff and the sediment load. This led to a more uniform runoff regime. At the flood event scale, we investigated the relationship between runoff and the suspended sediment load based on 123 flood events, which showed clearly that the magnitude and frequency of hyper‐concentrated sediment flows decreased in 2000–2009 compared with 1960–1999. The annual erosive rainfall exhibited non‐significant changes throughout the entire study period. We conclude that soil and water conservation measures (e.g. afforestation, grassing, terraces and check dams) have played major roles in the changes in runoff and the sediment load in the Beiluo River catchment.

"AGRIS:US201600132541";"Rain Use Efficiency, Primary Production and Rainfall Relationships in Desert Rangelands of Tunisia";"";"Desert rangelands are characterised by low and highly variable rainfall regime, low forage production and high heterogeneity in the distribution of natural resources. This study was carried out in the desert rangelands of Tunisia to evaluate the response of different rangelands to annual rainfall in terms of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and rain use efficiency over a 10‐year period (2003–2012). In general, ANPP values were relatively low (123 kg DM ha⁻¹ y⁻¹) but would tend to increase with increasing annual rainfall for all rangeland types. The highest value of ANPP was observed from Stipagrostis pungens and Hammada shmittiana communities (sandy‐soil) during the wet year 2011. In contrast, rain use efficiency tends to decline with the highest annual rainfall and varies among rangeland types and with an average of 1·9 kg DM ha⁻¹ mm⁻¹ y⁻¹. Rain use efficiency tended to be higher during dry years and lower during wet years and tended to be higher on S. pungens and H. shmittiana (sandy‐soils) and lower on Helianthemum kahiricum (loamy soils). Therefore, understanding how rainfall affects productivity in rangelands is critical for predicting the impact of land degradation on the functioning of these ecosystems. It can be used to explain production decline associated with desertification as well as to assess rangeland conditions.

In this paper, we (i) analyse hydro‐climatic trends at the annual and monthly scales in three nested sub‐catchments in a central Pyrenean basin and (ii) quantify the relative contribution of climate change and forest cover on the observed changes in runoff. Land use maps indicate an increase in the forest cover in all sub‐basins for the period 1987–2009. Non‐parametric Mann–Kendall statistic on annual and monthly hydro‐climatic data from 1965 to 2009 was used to identify trends in climate and runoff data. To assess the potential influence of the period length, trends were also examined for the 1941–2009 stretch. Upward trends were detected for temperature and potential evapotranspiration, particularly during summer and winter months. Precipitation trends and their significance depended on the length of the period considered, although overall results indicated a decrease, particularly for February and July. The effects of climate change and land cover change on annual runoff were identified by means of a change point analysis. Results indicated that a change in annual runoff took place in the 1980s, suggesting the non‐linearity in the relationship between precipitation and runoff, and thus the influence of land use factors. The influence of forest cover was confirmed by comparing observed runoff trends with those resulting from a hydro‐climatic model that does not take into account land use changes. Divergence between both trends revealed that forest cover can account for ~40% of the observed decrease in annual runoff. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Buendia, Cristina

Within this context, forest inventory must provide enough species composition detail to allow the design of appropriate harvesting activities. The project evaluated the use of softcopy photo-interpretation and a semi-automated inventory approach to create a forest inventory with a higher level of detail, and looked to advance these methodologies to explore whether metrics such as tree height and volume could also be included.

Results indicate that the more detailed inventory is useful in addressing forest management challenges associated with the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation and in improving growth and yield analysis, resulting in an overall enhancement to strategic and operational planning.

Knowledge of factors that improve our ability to detect predation events using animal telemetry data could be used to develop strategies to reduce time and resources required to obtain reliable kill estimates. Using Global Positioning System telemetry-collars, we investigated 246 bobcat Lynx rufus location clusters to identify white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus kill sites in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, during May-August, 2009-2011. We documented kills of white-tailed deer at 42 location clusters. We used logistic regression and Akaike Information Criterion for small samples to identify factors (i.e. number of locations in cluster, time from cluster formation to investigation, time of day and land cover) that may influence bobcat behaviour and our ability to detect white-tailed deer kill sites. Clusters with more locations and the search of clusters within 14 days after cluster formation increased odds of detecting bobcat kill sites. The best-performing model was 67% accurate overall and identified 34% of kill sites and 75% of non-kill sites. Applying our best-performing model with the optimal cut-off value would result in a twofold increase in the identification of white-tailed deer kill sites reducing time and effort to find a similar number of kill sites without models by half. Identifying factors that improve our ability to identify bobcat kill sites can reduce field effort and search time.";"Svoboda, Nathan J.

"AGRIS:US201500212018";"Anticipated climate and land‐cover changes reveal refuge areas for Borneo's orang‐utans";"";"Habitat loss and climate change pose a double jeopardy for many threatened taxa, making the identification of optimal habitat for the future a conservation priority. Using a case study of the endangered Bornean orang‐utan, we identify environmental refuges by integrating bioclimatic models with projected deforestation and oil‐palm agriculture suitability from the 1950s to 2080s. We coupled a maximum entropy algorithm with information on habitat needs to predict suitable habitat for the present day and 1950s. We then projected to the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s in models incorporating only land‐cover change, climate change or both processes combined. For future climate, we incorporated projections from four model and emission scenario combinations. For future land cover, we developed spatial deforestation predictions from 10 years of satellite data. Refuges were delineated as suitable forested habitats identified by all models that were also unsuitable for oil palm – a major threat to tropical biodiversity. Our analyses indicate that in 2010 up to 260 000 km² of Borneo was suitable habitat within the core orang‐utan range; an 18–24% reduction since the 1950s. Land‐cover models predicted further decline of 15–30% by the 2080s. Although habitat extent under future climate conditions varied among projections, there was majority consensus, particularly in north‐eastern and western regions. Across projections habitat loss due to climate change alone averaged 63% by 2080, but 74% when also considering land‐cover change. Refuge areas amounted to 2000–42 000 km² depending on thresholds used, with 900–17 000 km² outside the current species range. We demonstrate that efforts to halt deforestation could mediate some orang‐utan habitat loss, but further decline of the most suitable areas is to be expected given projected changes to climate. Protected refuge areas could therefore become increasingly important for ongoing translocation efforts. We present an approach to help identify such areas for highly threatened species given environmental changes expected this century.";"Struebig, Matthew J.

"AGRIS:US201600005357";"Nest survival of wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo silvestris in a mixed-use landscape: influences at nest-site and patch scales";"";"Nest survival is a critical factor affecting avian demographics, and can be influenced by nesting chronology, fine scale nest-site selection and broad-scale landscape characteristics. We modeled the relative influences of nest age, temporal variation in nest success and habitat-related covariates at two spatial scales (nest-site and patch scale) on daily nest survival during incubation for eastern wild turkeys Meleagris gallopavo silvestris in a mixed-use landscape. Daily survival rate of turkey nests during incubation increased as percent understory cover (vegetation < 1 m tall) increased and decreased with increasing density of woody shrubs and saplings and herbaceous stems < 1 m tall (understory vegetation density) around the nest. We suggest that nest survival may be dependent on a balance of sufficient understory cover around nests to provide concealment for hens and nests, but with understory vegetation density below levels that reduce the hen's ability to detect a predator or to escape after detecting a potential threat. The balance between sufficient understory cover and limited density of understory vegetation occurred where understory (< 1 m tall) cover exceeded 50% and understory vegetation density was < 25 stems/m². Models that included variables related to the patch scale (e.g. fragmentation, edge and dominant land-cover class in a patch) did not receive strong support, demonstrating the relative importance of finer scale nest-site variables over patch-scale variables in determining survival of wild turkey nests in our highly variable mixed-use landscape.";"Fuller, Angela K.

"AGRIS:US201600104277";"Self-Identification of Indigenous People in Post-Independence Indonesia: A Historical Analysis in the Context of REDD+";"";"SUMMARYThe reform era around the turn of the century in Indonesia has been followed by a revitalization of local claims to political authority and natural resources on the basis of adat and indigeneity. In May of 2013, the Constitutional Court acknowledged indigenous ownership of forest territories and declassified them from State-owned forest zones without further conceptualizing the notion of indigeneity and its relation to land tenure and territorial conflicts. Drawing on a historical review of the adat discourse, this paper demonstrates how Dutch scholars during the colonial time have supported a definition of indigeneity based on territorialisation. Using a case study from the interior of Kalimantan, we provide evidence that privileging indigenous communities based on the notion of territoriality and prior occupation of the land, supported by a colonial definition of adat rights tends to exclude right-holders who do not necessarily fit clear territorial niches. This administrative practice of essentializing the social structuring of the landscape matches the requirements used in the context of REDD+ but ignores the fact that social and territorial boundaries of ethnic groups are permeable and dynamic due to social-political interactions which create contention and conflict especially in the context of the recent introduction of carbon rights and benefit sharing under the context of REDD+.";"Royer, S.

"AGRIS:US201600191406";"systematic map of ecosystem services assessments around European agroforestry";"";"Agroforestry offers proven strategies as an environmentally benign and ecologically sustainable land management practice to promote ecosystem services. In this literature review, we systematically consider the agroforestry and ecosystem services literature with the aim to identify and catalogue the knowledge field and provide the first systematic synthesis of ecosystem services research in relation to European agroforestry. We reviewed 71 scientific publications from studies conducted in farmland and forest ecosystems with various types of agroforestry management. Each publication was systematically characterized and classified by agroforestry practice and research approach in order to provide an insight into the current research state in addressing ecosystem services (including methods, indicators, and approaches). Spatial distribution of the case study sites in Europe was also explored. In addition, typical clusters of similar research approaches were identified.The results show that ecosystem service assessment of European agroforestry is currently focused on the spatially extensive wood pastures in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Continental agricultural mosaic landscapes. A specific emphasis has been on regulating, supporting, and provisioning services, such as provision of habitat and biodiversity, food, climate regulation, fibre, and fuel, and the consideration of cultural services has been largely limited to aesthetic value. There is a bias to biophysical and monetary research approaches. The majority of the studies focus on quantitative methods and biophysical field measurements addressing the assessment of only one or two services. Monetary approaches have been applied in less than one fifth of the studies but form a distinctive group.Our results highlight gaps and biases in the ecosystem service research agenda within agroforestry based on which we conclude that research should aim to diversify from the biophysical and monetary approaches, towards a wider variety of approaches, especially socio-cultural, and a wider coverage of ecosystem services. Stronger consideration of stakeholder participation and introduction of spatially explicit mapping are also important key actions. We make suggestions to advance the promise of ecosystem services provision from European agroforestry in decision making including various actors, stakeholders, and institutions, with strong links to policy processes, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Common Agricultural Policy.";"Fagerholm, Nora

"AGRIS:US201400105606";"Satellite-based assessment of large-scale land cover change in Asian arid regions in the period of 2001–2009";"";"Arid regions in Asia are commonly characterized by rapidly growing populations with limited land resources and varying rainfall frequencies under climatic change. Despite being one of the most important environmental challenges in Asia, the changing aridity in this region, particularly due to large-scale land cover change, has not been well documented. In this study, we used rainfall data and a new land heterogeneity index to identify recent trend in land cover changes in the Asian arid regions. The result indicates a significant decreasing trend of barren lands and an increasing trend of vegetated lands. Although the potential land cover change is commonly believed to be strongly sensitive to rainfall change, such sensitivity has not been observed during the nine-year period (2001–2009) analyzed. Through the analyses of two separate periods (2001–2005 and 2005–2009), the sensitivity of rainfall to land cover change in arid regions is found to be dependent on the initial spatial heterogeneity of vegetated land cover. The approach used and the findings in this study represent an important step toward better understanding of large-scale land cover change in the Asian arid regions, and have the potential to predict future land cover change under various climate change scenarios.";"Cho, Jaeil

"AGRIS:US201400165370";"Managing soil carbon for climate change mitigation and adaptation in Mediterranean cropping systems: A meta-analysis";"";"Mediterranean croplands are seasonally dry agroecosystems with low soil organic carbon (SOC) content and high risk of land degradation and desertification. The increase in SOC is of special interest in these systems, as it can help to build resilience for climate change adaptation while contributing to mitigate global warming through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C). We compared SOC change and C sequestration under a number of recommended management practices (RMPs) with neighboring conventional plots under Mediterranean climate (174 data sets from 79 references). The highest response in C sequestration was achieved by those practices applying largest amounts of C inputs (land treatment and organic amendments). Conservation tillage practices (no-tillage and reduced tillage) induced lower effect sizes but significantly promoted C sequestration, whereas no effect and negative net sequestration rates were observed for slurry applications and unfertilized treatments, respectively. Practices combining external organic amendments with cover crops or conservation tillage (combined management practices and organic management) showed very good performance in C sequestration. We studied separately the changes in SOC under organic management, with 80 data sets from 30 references. The results also suggest that the degree of intensification in C input rate is the main driver behind the relative C accumulation in organic treatments. Thus, highest net C sequestration rates were observed in most eco-intensive groups, such as “irrigated”, “horticulture” and controlled experiments (“plot scale”).";"Aguilera, Eduardo

Although economic, technological and political analyses have previously been performed, this study aims to analyze a suite of environmental variables specific to corn production in Nebraska. The overall objective of this research is to better understand the spatial distribution of natural resources in Nebraska related to site selection of corn-based ethanol plants. Principal component analysis was used to determine, which environmental variables explained the majority of the variance in determining location suitability for an ethanol plant. In the first principal component, the highest loadings are irrigation requirement (0.912), growing season precipitation (0.870), rain-fed corn yield (0.840), and corn land abundance (0.735). In the second principal component, the highest loadings are potential competition for corn inputs (0.629) and irrigation restrictions (0.613). Our findings support the hypothesis that the controls related to water and land resources are playing a larger role in determining the location for ethanol plant locations than controls related to competition. This research was intended to become a foundation of methodology which could be used in other states and on other crops harvested for biofuel production. The results of this study illuminate some of the most influential environmental variables on Nebraskan ethanol plant location suitability.";"Healey, Nathan C.

"AGRIS:US201600188348";"Vegetation productivity trends in response to urban dynamics";"";"Urbanization is a global phenomenon with still unknown consequences for vegetation dynamics of urban ecosystems, especially in subtropical areas of developing countries. In this paper we analyze the vegetation productivity trend associated to urban densification and urban expansion during the last decade, in twelve cities of northern Argentina. We used time series analysis of MODIS-NDVI images to reconstruct the phenological patterns to retrieve a productivity trend under three spatial classes of urban dynamics: (1) urban, (2) expansion and (3) periphery. Our results show that trends in vegetation productivity are more associated to the environmental characteristics (basal productivity and climate) than to the land cover class. The average trend in productivity in urban areas ranged between â2.54% yearâ1 (MetÃ¡n) and â0.22% yearâ1 (ConcepciÃ³n). In contrast, the range was much tighter between classes; it was â1.37% yearâ1 in urban areas and â1.21% in the periphery. In this sense we found significant differences between cities, but no significant differences were observed between classes. Urban growth and urban expansion patterns found in our study suggest the system dynamics is dominated by sprawl patterns rather than by a homogeneous densification. Related to this phenomenon, our results dismissed the idea of urban expansion as the main factor affecting vegetation phenology and supported the hypothesis of regional warming as an explanation for the decrease in vegetation productivity, probably due to the decrease of water balance in arid regions.";"Paolini, Leonardo

Three rural communities that were still far from urban influence were selected from each of the 16 local government areas of the state. In each community, 20 household heads were selected and interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured matrix. The interviews aimed at the determination of respondents' socioeconomic status, awareness and belief in the effectiveness or otherwise of the forest laws and regulations, land use, tenure and property rights. Results obtained revealed that the awareness of forest laws and regulations cut across the socio-economic categories. Most of these laws and regulations that were considered to be necessary could also constitute disincentives to sustainable forest development. Three types of land tenure niches—private holdings, commons, and government reserves—exist in the state. These led to land fragmentations in which individuals are now left with small holdings. Individuals with small and medium landholdings found it difficult to invest in tree planting; hence, they meet their subsistence use of wood and non-wood forest products from diverse sources. Individuals with large landholdings were found cultivating cash tree crops; timber species were not cultivated though their wildlings were preserved. Also, when land is let or leased out, tenants were not allowed to invest in tree planting on such land.";"Kayode, Joshua";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land use;property rights;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500071550";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2011.532022";"";"";"";"321-328"

"AGRIS:US201500058828";"high-resolution GIS null model of potential forest expansion following land use changes in Norway";"";"During recent decades, forests have expanded into new areas throughout the whole of Norway. The processes explained as causing the forest expansion have focused mainly on climate or land use changes. To enable a spatially explicit separation of the effects following these two main drivers behind forest expansion, the authors set out to model the potential for natural forest regeneration following land use abandonment, given the present climatic conditions. The present forest distribution, a number of high-resolution land cover maps, and GIS methods were used to model the potential for natural forest regeneration. Furthermore, the results were tested with independent local models, explanatory variables and predictive modelling. The modelling results show that land use abandonment, in a long-term perspective, has the climatic and edaphic potential to cause natural forest regeneration of 48,800 km², or 15.9% of mainland Norway. The future natural forest regeneration following land use change or abandonment can now be spatially separated from the effects of climate changes. The different independent model tests support the main findings, but small fractions of the modelled potential natural forest regeneration will probably be caused by other processes than land use abandonment.";"Bryn, Anders

"AGRIS:US201301554883";"Economic determinants of biodiversity change over a 400-year period in the Scottish uplands";"";"1. Economic forces are recognized as an important driving factor behind current biodiversity losses. This study investigates whether such factors have been important in determining one measure of biodiversity change over the 'long run'- in our case, 400 years - for upland sites in Scotland. 2. A combination of palaeoecological, historical and economic methods is used to construct and then analyse a database of factors contributing to changes in plant diversity over time for 11 upland sites. 3. Using an instrumental variables panel model, we find livestock prices, our proxy for grazing pressure, to be a statistically significant determinant of diversity change, with higher grazing pressures resulting in lower diversity values on average, although site abandonment is also found to result in a fall in plant diversity. Technological change, such as the introduction of new animal breeds, was not found to be a statistically significant determinant. 4. Using later period data (post 1860) on livestock numbers at the parish (local) level, we were able to confirm the main result noted above (3) in terms of the effects of higher grazing pressures on plant diversity. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study shows how data from very different disciplines can be combined to address questions relevant to contemporary conservation and understanding. This novel, interdisciplinary approach provides new insights into the role of economic factors as a driver of biodiversity loss in the uplands. Biodiversity levels have varied considerably over 400 years, partly as a function of land management, suggesting that establishing baselines or 'natural' target levels for biodiversity is likely to be problematic. Changes in livestock grazing pressures brought about by changes in prices had statistically significant effects on estimated plant diversity, as did land abandonment. This suggests that long-term management of upland areas for the conservation of diversity should focus on grazing pressures as a key policy attribute. Another policy implication is that drastic cuts in grazing pressures - such as might occur under current reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy - can have adverse biodiversity consequences.";"Hanley, Nick

Due to remote sensing data availability and different acquisition sensors of satellite images, a wide variability of benchmarks could be conducted under the same theme. Rainwater harvesting is the branch of science where the rainwater is the main target to improve groundwater recharge, stratocumulus clouds are the main source of rain in arid regions. Cloud detection using remote sensing techniques proved to be efficient recently but the general uses of different cloud detection techniques are to precisely omit clouds from satellite images. The use of cloud detection scheme described herein is designed for the MERIS Level1B data; therefore, total set of 60 MERIS images was collected on monthly basis for 5 years started from January 2008. The use of the cloud detection algorithm is to find proper land cover suitable for rainwater harvesting mostly covered with cloud all over the year. Evaluation of land use for rainwater harvesting in terms of groundwater recharge is considered, several factors were taken into consideration and NDWI is one of the most important factors involved.

"AGRIS:US201500071624";"Forest Fuel Reduction and Biomass Supply: Perspectives from Southern Private Landowners";"";"Removing excess biomass from fire-hazardous forests can serve dual purposes: enhancing the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems and supplying feedstock for energy production. The physical availability of this biomass is fairly well-known, yet availability does not necessarily translate into actual supply. We assess the perception and behavior of private forestland owners in the southern United States with respect to thinning overstocked forests for bioenergy production. Landowner perception is then integrated with the USDA Forest Service's Fuel Treatment Evaluator to estimate the biomass supply from fuel treatments on non-industrial private timberlands in the region. Due to competing uses for lumber and pulp/paper products, only about one-third of this biomass could be used as bioenergy feedstock. Between 6 and 66% of landowners would consider thinning overstocked forests for bioenergy purposes depending upon whether financial incentives and technical assistance are provided. Accounting for competing uses, landowner willingness, accessibility, and recovery loss, annual feedstock supply from Southern private treatable timberlands is estimated between 0.9- and 11-million dry tonnes (dt). The average production cost is proximately $48/dt. Government cost shares, biomass market development, and technical assistance could significantly stimulate private landowners to procure biomass from fire-hazardous forests while mitigating wildfire risk.";"Gan, Jianbang

The purpose of the study is to generate, compare and validate landslide susceptibility zones. Landslide inventory was done with data collected from the State Highways department. There are nine landslide-influencing parameters such as slope gradient, slope aspect, slope curvature, relief, lithology, land use and land cover, proximity to road, proximity to drainage, and proximity to lineament, analyzed with help of topo map, existing geology map and satellite data to produce landslide susceptibility maps. Landslide susceptibility maps were generated by calculating relationship between the landslide-influencing factors with past landslide locations using frequency ratio, relative effect and fuzzy gamma operator models. These landslide susceptibility maps were verified and compared using the existing landslide inventory data. The prediction accuracy of frequency ratio model was 87.93 %, for fuzzy gamma operator model was 87.33 %, and for relative effect model it was 85.26 %. Out of which, the frequency ratio model provide maximum prediction accuracy on landslide susceptibility.";"Ramesh, V.

In this study, fine resolution GVF and albedo values derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images from 1990 to 2000 were used to examine the relationship of both GVF and albedo values to the spatial gradients of parameters related to dramatic urbanization in the Greater Guangzhou metropolitan area, Guangdong Province, in South China. Moderate resolution GVF and albedo datasets derived from the MODIS Collection 5 product were used to analyze the seasonal variation of GVF and albedo with rapid urban expansion from 2001 to 2007. The results show that the shortwave albedo had a clear declining trend from the urban center to natural land in 1990. However, no obvious trend in shortwave albedo change was observed along urban–rural gradients caused by the expansion of low-albedo urban buildings and more heterogeneous land cover patterns in 2000. A threshold of GVF (~0.21) was estimated for determining the change of albedo associated with vegetation fraction. Vegetation cover modified by urban expansion changed surface reflectance and influenced the surface energy balance. It is suggested that a large portion of energy absorbed in an urban area is likely to be converted to thermal energy that heating up is near the surface and emitted as longwave radiation.";"Hou, Meiting

One interesting case study to consider is the delta oasis of the Weigan and Kuqa rivers, China, which was studied using a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image collected in August 2001. In recent years, decision tree classifiers have been successfully used for land cover classification from remote sensing data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular data reduction technique used to help build a decision tree; it reduces complexity and can help the classification precision of a decision tree to be improved. A decision tree approach was used to determine the key variables to be used for classification and ultimately extract salinized soil from other cover and soil types within the study area. According to the research, the third principal component (PC3) is an effective variable in the decision tree classification for salinized soil information extraction. The research demonstrated that the PC3 was the best band to identify areas of severely salinized soil; the blue spectral band from the ETM+ sensor (TM1) was the best band to identify salinized soil with the salt-tolerant vegetation of tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis Lour); and areas comprising mixed water bodies and vegetation can be identified using the spectral indices MNDWI (modified normalized difference water index) and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Based upon this analysis, a decision tree classifier was applied to classify landcover types with different levels of soil saline. The results were checked using a statistical accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of the classification was 94.80%, which suggested that the decision tree model is a simple and effective method with relatively high precision.";"DING, Jian-li

The database of the State Forest Service and field research from 1994 to 2004 were used. Diversity and protection of the current forest ecosystems were described using different forest classification methods. The structure of tree species and their age was analyzed. Analysis indicated a decrease of oak forests by 3.5% of their native vegetation area and a high proportion of drained forests, as well as a disproportional age structure of forest ecosystems. The findings can be useful for biodiversity protection in intensively managed and fragmented forest landscapes.

"AGRIS:US201500083792";"Spatial assessment of ecosystem goods and services in complex production landscapes: A case study from south-eastern Australia";"";"Many production landscapes are complex human-environment systems operating at various spatio-temporal scales and provide a variety of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) vital to human well-being. EGS change over space and time as a result of changing patterns of land use or changes in the composition and structure of different vegetation types. Spatio-temporal assessment of EGS can provide valuable information on the consequences of changing land use and land cover for EGS and helps to deal with this complexity. We carried out a quantitative and qualitative appraisal of selected EGS (timber production, carbon stock, provision of water, water regulation, biodiversity, and forage production) to understand how these have altered in a complex mosaic of landscape that has undergone significant change over the past 200 years. Land use and land cover types and their associated EGS were assessed and mapped using a wide range of readily available data and tools. We also evaluated the trade-offs among services associated with observed land use change. In contrast to work elsewhere, we found the recent changes in land use and land cover have an overall positive impact on various EGS due mainly to the conversion of pasture to managed plantations which are connected to the larger areas of remnant vegetation. Results also indicate that there was a high level of variation in the distribution of the EGS across the landscape. Relatively intact native vegetation provides mainly regulating services whereas the modified landscapes provides provisioning services such as timber and forage production at the cost of regulating services. Rapidly changing demand and supply of certain goods and services (e.g., timber, pulp or carbon) may also have positive and negative impact on other services. For example, increasing plantation rotation has positive impacts for biodiversity and carbon stock but reduces stream flow and water yield.";"Baral, Himlal

In this study, we analyse the ectomycorrhizal inoculum potential of the soil and the competitiveness of Tuber melanosporum ectomycorrhizas to this inoculum in the different land uses present in a truffle-producing region with the aim of assessing their suitability for establishing truffle orchards. Soil samples collected from forests, croplands and wastelands in El Toro (Valencian Region, Eastern Spain) were used to perform four greenhouse bioassays. Forest soils showed the highest ectomycorrhizal inoculum potential and produced the highest contamination levels in the mycorrhized seedlings; they were thus considered the least suitable for new truffle plantations. Greenhouse bioassays are found to be a useful methodology for studying the target variables as long as care is taken to both prevent nursery contamination and adjust the culture to the plant species.

The Murcia region is one of the most arid regions in southern Europe and also one of the most prone to land abandonment. This study researches which environmental features are more relevant to explain abandonment at the agricultural plot scale. Geomorphometric features were measured at different scales to investigate which scales could be more relevant. Two different models have been used: logistic regression, a statistical model that allows the interpretation of the involved features, and Random Forest, a machine learning model with a higher predictive power but lower interpretability. The combined use of both such models allows a set of predictors to be selected, which, when used with Random Forest, produce a map that is highly accurate for predicting abandonment and, when used with logistic regression, produce an interpretable model. The main conclusion is that climate is the most relevant factor to explain land abandonment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Alonso‐Sarría, Francisco

"AGRIS:US201500217194";"To reallocate or not: Reconsidering the dilemma in China's agricultural land tenure policy";"";"In China, rural land is collectively owned at the village level. Village officials usually have the power to reallocate land property across families on an ongoing basis due to demographic changes in the village. Realizing that frequent land reallocation and abusive land requisition will undermine economic productivity as well as social stability, the “Rural Land Contract Law” passed in 2002 explicitly reads that farmland tenure security must be maintained for at least 30 years since the last nationwide reallocation in 1998. The frequency and magnitude of land reallocation in Chinese villages have decreased as a result. However, failure to allocate land to the newly increased population often induced conflicts among village members if the security of land tenure for 30 years was strictly implemented. Administrative land reallocations then still continued in some villages to accommodate demographic changes in these places. Based on an almost nationally representative rural dataset collected in 119 villages of 6 provinces across China in 2008, this paper lays out some stylized facts about the administrative land reallocation after 1998. By analyzing the opinions of over 2200 farmers on the central policy of maintaining farmland tenure security, we are able to rationalize why some farmers support the policy while others oppose it. This analysis helps us to better understand the dilemma between efficiency and equity embedded in the current agricultural land system in China. It is further shown that social conflicts among village members may easily arise either due to administrative land reallocation or due to lack of it. We argue that this dilemma cannot be resolved effectively without coordinated reforms in household registration system which can help hundreds of millions of Chinese rural migrant workers to permanently settle in cities and release their farmland to those who stay in the countryside.";"Wang, Hui

An important set of factors in farmers’ use of improved agricultural technologies is generally known to be their possession of livelihood assets. This study examines the influence of ownership of livelihood assets in farmers’ decisions to use cattle manure as land improvement technology, which is currently being promoted by Ethiopia’s agricultural extension system. The study was conducted in Dangila woreda (district) in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. Data were collected from a survey of 201 rural households from April to June 2011 and in October 2012. Logistic regression modelling and Chi-square and t-tests were used to analyse data. The findings show that plot distance from residence, number of livestock owned, use of dung for fuel, maize–vegetable–fruit intercropping, land to man ratio and perception of land tenure security were important determinants of manure use among the farmers. Existing and future local development interventions should focus on these factors to improve the farmers’ capability to invest in cattle manure application and sustainable land management.";"Belay, Mehretie

Elle conclut que les circuits commerciaux du pays s’intègrent dans un système commercial régional qui se traduit par des flux ouverts sur les pays voisins (Bénin, Ghana, Burkina) et lointains (Niger, Gabon). L’analyse des marges a permis de constater que le commerce des produits alimentaires est en général viable. Toutefois, les marges nettes demeurent modestes.

It is argued that Mexico City's land-use policy has been reactive and internally inconsistent, failing to take informal settlements into account, has not offered the poor access to housing with adequate services and greater security in terms of land tenure, and lacks the necessary financial resources and institutional capabilities for providing solutions to these problems. Through a case study of informal settlement management policy in the Tlalpan Delegation,¹ applied in what has been termed SC or “Conservation Land,”² we conclude that local government exhibits an inability to confront the new challenge of urban sustainability, that it resorts to conventional solutions which give rise to contradictory situations where political decision-making prevails over ecological considerations, so land-use policy is permissive and does not halt informal urban expansion in areas of high environmental value.";"Aguilar, Adrian Guillermo

With the U.S. Agricultural Census farm-level longitudinal data on land use and enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), I find that an average partial-farm CRP participant converts 25% of noncropland to cropping activities as a consequence of CRP enrollment. Also, an estimated slippage rate varies across farm types and regions. In particular, farms with relatively inelastic crop acreage supply lead to more slippage.

Previous studies have focused on particulate P loads in relation to agricultural non-point source pollution. In areas undergoing rapid urbanization, dissolved P loads may be important with respect to conditions of surface infiltration and rainfall runoff. The present study developed an integrated model for the analysis of both dissolved P and particulate P loads, applied to the Meiliang Bay watershed, Taihu Lake, China. The results showed that NPS P loads up to 15kg/km2 were present, with particulate P loads up to 13kg/km2. The highest loads were concentrated in the southeastern region of the watershed. Although particle P was the main contributor to NPS P loads state, the contribution of dissolved P was significant, especially in sub-basins with significant amount of artificial land cover. The integration of dissolved P and particulate P loads provided more accurate evaluation of NPS P pollution. NPS P loads were found to correspond to specific soil properties. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen were shown to influence dissolved P loads, while total phosphorus and soil particle composition proportion were more closely related to particulate P loads.";"Lin, Chen

"AGRIS:US201300798647";"Predicting the Impacts of Future Sea-Level Rise on an Endangered Lagomorph";"";"Human-induced global climate change presents a unique and difficult challenge to the conservation of biodiversity. Despite increasing attention on global climate change, few studies have assessed the projected impacts of sea-level rise to threatened and endangered species. Therefore, we estimated the impacts of rising sea levels on the endangered Lower Keys marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri) across its geographic distribution under scenarios of current conditions, low (0.3-m), medium (0.6-m), and high (0.9-m) sea-level rise. We also investigated the impacts of allowing vegetation to migrate upslope and not allowing migration and of two land-use planning decisions (protection and abandonment of human-dominated areas). Not surprisingly, under all simulations we found a general trend of decreasing total potential LKMR habitat with increasing sea-level rise. Not allowing migration and protecting human-dominated areas both tended to decrease potential LKMR habitat compared with allowing migration and abandoning human-dominated areas. In conclusion, conservation strategies at multiple scales need to be implemented in order to reduce the impact of global climate change on biodiversity and endangered species. At the regional level, managers must consider land-use planning needs that take into account the needs of both humans and biodiversity. Finally, at the local scale those agencies that are in charge of endangered species conservation and ecosystem management need to rethink static approaches to conservation or else stand by and watch ecosystems degrade and species go extinct. This can be accomplished by bioclimatic reserve systems where climatically underrepresented areas are included in conservation planning along with the standard concerns of threat, opportunity, connectivity, and viability.";"LaFever, David H.

Regional efforts to preserve rural landscapes and remnant habitat have had variable success. In the 1990s, significant conflict emerged over proposals to build large housing developments on portions of the Oak Ridges Moraine, a 160-km stretch of environmentally sensitive land along the city's northern edge. After years of planning conflict, Ontario's provincial government created the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, an Act of the Ontario Legislature. The Plan represents a dramatic change in Ontario's approach to conservation planning. We examine the development and implementation of the Conservation Plan as an example of environmental planning policy in a complex urban setting. Data from interviews with policy actors, planning agency documents, and geospatial sources are used to construct an analysis and discussion of the Plan and its implementation. From a policy research perspective, the evolution and implementation of the Plan require analysis and monitoring to better understand how such approaches can best be implemented.

The investigation was carried out on different beekeeping experiences in southern Brazil: peasant family farms, settlements of agrarian reform, and Afro-descent quilombola and Guarani indigenous villages. The systems are managed in the contexts of agroecological farming and include “Africanized honeybees” and native “stingless bees,” integrated among trees and crops. We show that the dynamics of investigation that follows the guidelines presented by family farmers and traditional people contribute to their empowerment and to changing their own reality, favoring endogenous development and the dialogue of knowledge. The participatory experiences by ISEC and EMBRAPA Temperate Agriculture through the organization and mobilization of farmers and traditional people generated organizational structures that build local food systems. This joint initiative contributes to peasants’ search for autonomy and food sovereignty, and strengthens the reproduction of this work toward the political dimension of agroecology.";"Wolff, Luis Fernando

"AGRIS:US2016213563";"The Efficiency of Voluntary Incentive Policies for Preventing Biodiversity Loss";"";"In this paper we analyze the efficiency of voluntary incentive-based land-use policies for biodiversity conservation. Two factors combine to make it difficult to achieve an efficient result. First, the spatial pattern of habitat across multiple landowners is important for determining biodiversity conservation results. Second, the willingness of private landowners to accept a payment in exchange for enrolling in a conservation program is private information. Therefore, a conservation agency cannot easily control the spatial pattern of voluntary enrollment in conservation programs. We begin by showing how the distribution of a landowner’s willingness to accept a conservation payment can be derived from a parcel-scale land-use change model. Next we combine the econometric land-use model with spatial data and ecological models to simulate the effects of various conservation program designs on biodiversity conservation outcomes. We compare these results to an estimate of the efficiency frontier that maximizes biodiversity conservation at each level of cost. The frontier mimics the regulator’s solution to the biodiversity conservation problem when she has perfect information on landowner willingness-to-accept.Results indicate that there are substantial differences in biodiversity conservation scores generated by the incentive-based policies and efficient solutions. The performance of incentive-based policies is particularly poor at low levels of the conservation budget where spatial fragmentation of conserved parcels is a large concern. Performance can be improved by encouraging agglomeration of conserved habitat and by incorporating basic biological information, such as that on rare habitats, into the selection criteria.";"Lewis, David J.

"AGRIS:US201302927679";"Spatial modeling of rangeland potential vegetation environments";"";"Potential vegetation environments (e.g., habitat types, range sites, ecological sites) are important to land managers because they provide a conceptual basis for the description of resource potentials and ecological integrity. Efficient use of potential vegetation classifications in regional or subregional scale assessments of ecosystem health has been limited to date, however, because traditional ecological unit mapping procedures often treat such classifications as ancillary information in the map unit description. Accordingly, it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe the precise location, patch size, and spatial arrangement of potential vegetation environments from most traditional ecological unit maps. Recent advances in remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), terrain modeling, and climate interpolation facilitate the direct mapping of potential vegetation through a predictive process based on gradient analysis and ecological niche theory. In this paper, we describe how a predictive vegetation mapping process was used to develop a 30 m raster-based map of 4 grassland, 5 shrubland, and 6 woodland habitat types across the Little Missouri National Grasslands, North Dakota. Discriminant analysis was used in developing this potential vegetation map based on 6 primary geographic information system themes. Geoclimatic subsections and remotely sensed vegetation lifeform maps were used in predictive model stratification. Terrain indices, LANDSAT satellite imagery, and interpolated climate information were used as independent (predictor) variables in model construction. A total of 616 field plots with known habitat type membership were used as dependent variables and assessed by a jackknife discriminant analysis procedure. Accuracy values of our map ranged from 54 to 77% in grasslands, 62 to 100% in shrublands, and 70 to 100% in woodlands dependent on geoclimatic subsection setting. Techniques are also described for generalizing the 30 m pixel resolution habitat type map to appropriate ecological unit maps (e.g., landtype associations) for use in ecosystem health assessments and land use planning.";"Jensen, M.E.

"AGRIS:US201301858433";"Rethinking species selection for restoration of arid shrublands";"";"Restoration is playing an increasingly important role in ecology as natural habitats become scarcer and chances to restore ecosystems damaged by human activities are more common. However, restoration of degraded Mediterranean arid ecosystems is hampered by drought and poor soils, which cause many establishment failures. To compare how species belonging to different successional stages establish in a very stressful site, we carried out a field experiment with 14 tree and shrub species differing in functional traits. After three growing seasons, mid-successional shrubs such as the leafless Ephedra fragilis and the C4 Salsola oppositifolia, or green-stemmed legumes like Coronilla juncea, Genista umbellat, and Retama sphaerocarpa, showed survival rates up to 93%, while late-successional species like Tetraclinis articulata, Pinus halepensis, Olea europaea, and Pistacia lentiscus, frequently used and recommended in regular restoration projects, hardly reached 55%. We found that survival was highest for legumes, followed by leafless species, and C4 shrubs, traits that are believed to maximize resource uptake in cleared and infertile areas while reducing water losses. Thus, selection of mid-successional species having such traits should be considered for successful restoration. These species would increase the success of restoration programs, but also would increase soil fertility, reduce soil erosion processes, and eventually facilitate establishment of other species, therefore accelerating secondary succession. We suggest a new approach for the restoration for arid shrublands in which species are carefully selected based on traits that best suit the environmental conditions.";"Padilla, Francisco M.

Among its strategic lines it is necessary to put forward the import replacement, formation of favorable investment climate, rise of profitability for agricultural commodity producers, social development of the countryside and development of integrating processes at the post-Soviet space. In all mentioned lines, the scientists of the All-Russian research institute of agricultural economy perform the great analytical work, connected with forming new innovative mechanisms for stable development of the branch. Herewith it is substantiated that despite of available difficulties and financial limitations, Russia has real opportunities to become one of the most active participants of the world market as a food exporter. Gross harvest of grain and leguminous plants in 2014 comprised over 105 mln t after additional modification. Threshed in Russia are over 2.5 mln t soybean and over 1.45 mln t rapes. New records have been set in harvest of vegetables - 15.4 mln t, fruits and berries - 3 mln t. In calculations, the level of food independence of Russia by 2020 will comprise 132% in grain, 168 in sugar, 239 - in vegetable oil, 121 - in potato, 90 in vegetables, 39 - in fruits, meat and meat products -107, milk and dairy products - 79 and 124% in eggs. Herewith, the export potential of Russia will comprise 28 mln t in grain, 2 - in sugar, 2 - in vegetable oil and 6 mln t in potato. In Russia not only for reaching the parameters of Food security doctrine, but coming out for the balance of export-import at the level of 20-25 billions US dollars in coming 8-10 years.

В условиях широкой межгосударственной интеграции в системе АПК, членства России во Всемирной торговой организации, введения отдельными странами Запада антироссийских экономических санкций и принятия ответных защитных мер с российской стороны для обеспечения устойчивого роста аграрного сектора и преодоления целого комплекса социально-экономических рисков необходима новая аграрная политика. Среди ее стратегических направлений следует выделить импортозамещение, формирование благоприятного инвестиционного климата, повышение доходности сельхозтоваропроизводителей, социальное развитие села, развитие интеграционных процессов на постсоветском пространстве. По всем перечисленным направлениям ученые Всероссийского НИИ экономики сельского хозяйства ведут большую аналитическую работу, связанную с формированием инновационных механизмов устойчивого развития отрасли. При этом обосновано, что, несмотря на имеющиеся трудности и финансовые ограничения, Россия располагает реальными возможностями стать одним из наиболее активных участников мирового рынка в качестве экспортера продовольствия. Валовой сбор зерновых и зернобобовых культур в 2014 г. составил свыше 105 млн т после доработки. В России намолочено более 2,5 млн т сои и более 1,45 млн т рапса. Поставлены новые рекорды в сборе овощей - 15,4 млн т, плодов и ягод - около 3 млн т. По расчетам, уровень продовольственной независимости России к 2020 г. по зерну составит 132%, сахару - 168, растительному маслу - 239, картофелю - 121, овощам - 90, фруктам - 39, мясу и мясопродуктам - 107, молоку и молокопродуктам - 79 и яйцам - 124%. При этом экспортный потенциал России составит по зерну - 28 млн т, сахару - 2, растительному маслу - 2, картофелю - 6 млн т.

"AGRIS:US201301858437";"Impacts of silica-based defences in grasses on the feeding preferences of sheep";"";"Grasses, which dominate many terrestrial ecosystems, sustain high densities of grazing mammals, so are of great economic and ecological importance. Traditionally, grasses are thought to be adapted to tolerate grazing rather than defend against it; however, silica deposited in the leaves of grasses has recently been shown to act as a feeding deterrent to invertebrate herbivores and small mammals. This study assesses whether silica is effective as a feeding deterrent to larger mammalian herbivores. We assess the impact of manipulated silica levels in five grass species on the feeding preferences of sheep both within and between grass species. Sheep feeding behaviour was driven by between-species differences in palatability. Hence, within a single species silica addition did not cause significant changes in feeding preference. However, there were significant differences in both the feeding preferences and bite rates between grass species, and these differences were much more marked when the grasses had been exposed to high levels of silica. The impacts that silica had on preference were least pronounced in palatable species (e.g. Poa annua) compared with less-palatable species (e.g. Brachypodium pinnatum and Festuca ovina). Sheep fed for longer, took more bites and had a higher bite rate on the grass species with the lowest leaf silica concentrations, namely P. annua. Sheep were less affected by silica defences than smaller, non-ruminant herbivores, but the changes in species preference rankings caused by silica suggest it may lead to changes in sward composition. Further, in species that are already relatively low in palatability, silica-induced reductions in bite rate could potentially reduce forage intake rates, with consequences for sheep performance.";"Massey, Fergus P.

"AGRIS:RU2016000008";"Methodology of assessing the efficiency of state regulation of agriculture requires the improvement";"Методология оценки эффективности государственного регулирования сельского хозяйства требует совершенствования";"The system of assessing the efficiency of state regulation of agriculture, included in the State program, does not permit in full extent to reveal the efficiency of using budgetary means; it does not cover all important spheres of agriculture and its influence on macroeconomic situation. In view of that, it is feasible to enforce the target direction of assessing the state regulation with accounting for changed socioeconomic situation in the country, including the membership of Russia in the WTO ant participating in the Europe-Asia economic union (EAEU). At EAEU level, it is necessary to develop the uniform economic mechanism and coordinated indicators of developing the AIC of countries-participants, which in its turn requires uniform methodology for calculating the level and efficiency of regulation. At the macro level as indicators of efficiency might be considered the share of domestic food in resources of retail trade of food products, duration of life of rural population. At the branchial level (agriculture) for achievement of general state targets, it is possible to put forward five target lines: production-economic, technical-technological, foreign economic, ecological and social development of rural areas. In each line assessing the efficiency must be conducted by respective system of indicators. Thus, assessing the efficiency of state regulation presents the complicated multilevel and multifunction system. That system proposes assessing the regulation action both at national and supranational levels, in the format of integrating formation of states (EAEU). The multifunctionality displays via the system of interrelations of the economic mechanism as a whole, as well as its separate instruments and targets of state regulation.

Система оценки эффективности государственного регулирования сельского хозяйства, заложенная в Государственной программе, не позволяет в полной мере выявить эффективность использования бюджетных средств, не охватывает все важнейшие сферы сельского хозяйства и его влияние на макроэкономическую ситуацию. В связи с этим целесообразно усилить целевую направленность оценки госрегулирования с учетом меняющейся социально-экономической ситуации в России, в том числе членства страны в ВТО и участия в Евразийском экономическом союзе (ЕАЭС). На уровне ЕАЭС необходима разработка единого экономического механизма и согласованных индикативных показателей развития АПК стран-участников, что, в свою очередь, потребует единой методологии расчета уровня и эффективности регулирования. На макроуровне в качестве показателей эффективности могут рассматриваться доля отечественного продовольствия в ресурсах розничной торговли продовольственными товарами, продолжительность жизни сельского населения. На отраслевом уровне (сельское хозяйство) для достижения общегосударственных целей можно выделить 5 целевых направлений: производственно-экономическое, технико-технологическое, внешнеэкономическое, экологическое, социального развития сельских территорий. По каждому направлению оценка эффективности должна производиться по соответствующей системе показателей. Таким образом, оценка эффективности государственного регулирования представляет собой сложную многоуровневую и многофункциональную систему. Эта система предполагает оценку регулирующего воздействия как на национальном, так и на наднациональном уровнях, в формате интеграционного формирования государств (ЕАЭС). Многофункциональность проявляется через систему взаимосвязей экономического механизма в целом, а также отдельных его инструментов и целей государственного регулирования.";"Chekalin, V.S.

"AGRIS:US201500217222";"Index of Function Suitability (IFS): A new tool for assessing the capacity of landscapes to provide amenity functions";"";"Integrating social demands into landscape management has been proven difficult because of a lack of suitable measures. In order to address this issue this article describes the development of the Index of Function Suitability (IFS). This offers an integrated conceptual tool for incorporating social demands into landscape management. The IFS links preferences to land cover spatial patterns as it uses quantitative indicators for gauging differences between the preferred landscape patterns by users, for a certain activity related to an amenity function (e.g. hunting), and the land cover patterns of a given rural area (either at the present or from scenarios developed for the future). Introducing the measurement of the difference between the preferred spatial patterns and the landscape patterns occurring in a given landscape is a fundamental conceptual development represented in the IFS. By using the same set of indicators to quantify different land cover patterns, the IFS gauges quantitatively the differences between their spatial patterns, thus providing landscape managers with an indication of the suitability of changing land covers to support the selected amenity functions. In this paper, the conceptual aspects, as well as the methodological steps of the IFS were explained and further applied to one empirical case study in the Alentejo region of Portugal. This paper also examines both the strengths and weaknesses of the IFS approach along with a discussion for improvement.";"Pinto-Correia, Teresa

"AGRIS:US201500217227";"Geographical downscaling of outputs provided by an economic farm model calibrated at the regional level";"";"There is a strong need for accurate and spatially referenced information regarding policy making and model linkage. This need has been expressed by land users, and policy and decision makers in order to estimate both spatially and locally the impacts of European policy (like the Common Agricultural Policy) and/or global changes on farm-groups. These entities are defined according to variables such as altitude, economic size and type of farming (referring to land uses). European farm-groups are provided through the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) as statistical information delivered at regional level. The aim of the study is to map locally farm-group probabilities within each region. The mapping of the farm-groups is done in two steps: (1) by mapping locally the co-variables associated to the farm-groups, i.e. altitude and land uses; (2) by using regional FADN data as a priori knowledge for transforming land uses and altitude information into farm-groups location probabilities within each region. The downscaling process focuses on the land use mapping since land use data are originally point information located every 18km. Interpolation of land use data is done at 100m by using co-variables like land cover, altitude, climate and soil data which are continuous layers usually provided at fine resolution. Once the farm-groups are mapped, European Policy and global changes scenarios are run through an agro-economic model for assessing environmental impacts locally.";"Cantelaube, P.

This paper uses the case of an urban riparian corridor in South East Queensland, Australia to contribute to understandings of interactions between land use planning processes, watershed management initiatives and broader administrative structures in urban and rapidly urbanising settings. In particular it examines the understudied application of watershed management to an urban setting. Analysis of changes to the structure and function of urban riparian corridor management over time show that changes have occurred as a result of broader policy and institutional change in three distinct phases: top-down watershed management policy (1996–2000), regional natural resource and population growth management policy (2001–2005) and the recent re-emergence of local government as the dominant actor in a multilevel networked context (2006–2008). Trends toward regional scale approaches and increased urban planning initiatives have tended to concentrate responsibilities for urban environmental management with local government. This is in contrast to most rural natural resource management experience, and highlights the importance of meta-governance frameworks in ensuring the enduring applicability of the watershed management model to urban and rapidly urbanising catchments.";"Schmidt, P.

"AGRIS:US201500217229";"Factors associated with landowner involvement in forest conservation programs in the U.S.: Implications for policy design and outreach";"";"One-third of the forestland in the U.S. is owned by 10.4million family forest owners. Their collective decisions have a great impact on the sustainability of forest landscape across the country. Public policies and programs for encouraging landowners to properly manage their land include cost-share, forest certification, and conservation easements. However, to date, less than 6% of the family forest owners have participated in a cost-share program, less than 1% have certified their land, and less than 2% have an easement. By analyzing data from USDA Forest Service's National Woodland Owner Survey, we examined the characteristics of family forest owners who had participated in these programs and identified strategies to capitalize on these landowner characteristics to improve current programs and attract a wider range of participants. We found that family forest owners with larger land holdings were more likely to participate in all three types of programs. Obtaining forest management information or advice was important for program participation; however, the effects differed depending on the types of programs and the sources of information. Income was not significant in predicting participation in cost-share programs, implying family forest owners from lower-income strata were not more likely to use cost-share program. The results also suggest the importance of targeting the right audience when promoting forest certification programs, namely those who are participants of cost-share programs, own forestland for reasons other than farming or ranching, and plan to harvest sawlogs or pulpwood in the future. Age was not significant in any of the empirical models. This result is particularly intriguing in the context of conservation easement, considering recent discussions about the high cost of dying unprepared and the potential for promoting conservation easement as part of estate planning among older family forest owners. Finally, few variables were significant in the model predicting landowner decision about donating or selling an easement, suggesting the easement decision is very different from cost-share and forest certification decisions and further efforts are needed to understand the dynamics of this increasingly popular conservation policy tool. In summary, this study provides a better understanding of the relationship between program participation and the demographics, attitudes and behaviors of family forest owners. This understanding contributes to the development of outreach strategies for improving landowner interest in forest conservation programs.";"Ma, Zhao

Each colony site was characterized using 12 environmental variables describing the physical environment, land-cover categories, and human activities, and by three demographic parameters: the number of breeding pairs, the number of pairs with chicks, and the number of fledged chicks per pair. Generalized linear mixed models and the self-organizing map algorithm (SOM, neural network) were used to investigate effects of biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic factors on demographic parameters and on their relationships. Numbers of breeding pairs and of pairs with chicks were affected by the same environmental factors, mainly anthropogenic, which differed from those affecting the number of fledged chicks per pair. Numbers of fledged chicks per pair was not affected by colony size or by the number of nests with chicks. The categorization of the environmental variables into natural and anthropogenic, in connection with demographic parameters, was relevant to detect factors explaining variation in colony size and breeding parameters. The SOM proved a relevant tool to help determine actual dynamics in White Stork colonies, and thus to support effective conservation decisions at a regional scale.";"Si Bachir, Abdelkrim

"AGRIS:US2016216420";"Sustainability of Corn Stover Harvest for Biomass";"";"Off-farm demand for crop residues is expected to grow as bioenergy policies become effective. Demand for residues will provide farmers with an additional source of revenue but it may also trigger losses in soil organic carbon and increases in fertilizer application. This study develops a dynamic economic model of stover harvest that permits conceptualization and quantification of these potential tradeoffs. We parameterize our model based on publicly available studies of soil biophysical relationships in the Corn Belt. Under these parameter values and 2010 corn and fertilizer prices harvesting stover is not economically convenient at prices below $53 per dry ton of stover. Results suggest that the rate of stover harvest may be quite sensitive and negatively linked to corn prices, which means that policies favoring the use of stover for biomass may be overridden by further increases in corn price. The negative link between stover harvest and corn prices, while somewhat counterintuitive, is driven by the fact that removal of stover reduces future grain yield (through reductions in soil organic carbon). Results also seem to indicate that, under plausible parameter values, profit maximizing farmers would increase stover supply in response to increases in stover price. However increases in supply are, according to our simulations, associated with (potentially significant) reductions in soil organic carbon (and hence carbon emissions as these are positively linked) and increases in nitrogen application (and potential runoffs). This result suggests that concerns about adverse environmental implications of harvesting stover may be justified, and more precise quantification of environmental tradeoffs should be pursued by future research.";"Sesmero, Juan P.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016216420";"http://purl.umn.edu/103765";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201300894098";"Quantifying sample biases of inland lake sampling programs in relation to lake surface area and land use/cover";"";"We quantified potential biases associated with lakes monitored using non-probability based sampling by six state agencies in the USA (Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, Maine, and New Hampshire). To identify biases, we compared state-monitored lakes to a census population of lakes derived from the National Hydrography Dataset. We then estimated the probability of lakes being sampled using generalized linear mixed models. Our two research questions were: (1) are there systematic differences in lake area and land use/land cover (LULC) surrounding lakes monitored by state agencies when compared to the entire population of lakes? and (2) after controlling for the effects of lake size, does the probability of sampling vary depending on the surrounding LULC features? We examined the biases associated with surrounding LULC because of the established links between LULC and lake water quality. For all states, we found that larger lakes had a higher probability of being sampled compared to smaller lakes. Significant interactions between lake size and LULC prohibit us from drawing conclusions about the main effects of LULC; however, in general lakes that are most likely to be sampled have either high urban use, high agricultural use, high forest cover, or low wetland cover. Our analyses support the assertion that data derived from non-probability-based surveys must be used with caution when attempting to make generalizations to the entire population of interest, and that probability-based surveys are needed to ensure unbiased, accurate estimates of lake status and trends at regional to national scales.";"Wagner, Tyler

Indigenous people and colonists subsist on the natural resources of the reserve, and MARENA is responsible for protecting the area from colonization and illicit exploitation. Using geostatistical procedures and Landsat images at three different time periods, we compared per capita deforestation and boundary stabilization in areas with colonists and areas with indigenous peoples. We also examined whether the Mayangna deforested less than the Miskitu and whether the Nicaraguan government has effectively defended the Bosawas boundary against the advance of the agricultural frontier. In addition, we analyzed the current distribution of land uses within the reserve and its contiguous indigenous areas with a supervised classification of current land cover. Indigenous demarcations protected the forest successfully, whereas the Bosawas boundary itself did not inhibit colonization and consequent deforestation. Indigenous farmers deforested significantly less per capita than colonists, and the two indigenous groups in Bosawas did not differ significantly in their effects on the forest. Our results show that indigenous common-property institutions and indigenous defense of homeland have been powerful factors in protecting the forests of Bosawas and that the difficult evolution of a nested cross-scale governance system in Bosawas--under pressure from indigenous peoples--is probably the key to the forest's survival thus far.";"STOCKS, ANTHONY

"AGRIS:US201301639755";"Appraising and selecting conservation measures to mitigate desertification and land degradation based on stakeholder participation and global best practices";"";"Most desertification research focuses on degradation assessments without putting sufficient emphasis on prevention and mitigation strategies, although the concept of sustainable land management (SLM) is increasingly being acknowledged. A variety of already applied conservation measures exist at the local level, but they are not adequately recognised, evaluated and shared, either by land users, technicians, researchers, or policy makers. Likewise, collaboration between research and implementation is often insufficient. The aim of this paper is to present a new methodology for a participatory process of appraising and selecting desertification mitigation strategies, and to present first experiences from its application in the EU-funded DESIRE project. The methodology combines a collective learning and decision approach with the use of evaluated global best practices. In three parts, it moves through a concise process, starting with identifying land degradation and locally applied solutions in a stakeholder workshop, leading to assessing local solutions with a standardised evaluation tool, and ending with jointly selecting promising strategies for implementation with the help of a decision support tool. The methodology is currently being applied in 16 study sites. Preliminary analysis from the application of the first part of the methodology shows that the initial stakeholder workshop results in a good basis for stakeholder cooperation, and in promising land conservation practices for further assessment. Study site research teams appreciated the valuable results, as burning issues and promising options emerged from joint reflection. The methodology is suitable to initiate mutual learning among different stakeholder groups and to integrate local and scientific knowledge. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Schwilch, G.

This study reports surveys that reveal farmers' perceptions of environmental degradation and their adoption of improved management practices in this poor and remote desert region. Surveys were made in villages that had been engaged in a large environmental rehabilitation and management project [Alxa League environmental rehabilitation and management project (ALERMP)] and those that had not. The survey results showed that farmers perceived environmental degradation in terms of increased frequency and severity of sandstorms, movement of sand dunes, deterioration of pasture quality and declines in groundwater depth and quality. Farmers had low adoption rates for improved management practices, ranging from zero to a maximum of 28·5 per cent for the most adopted practice. A Tobit model analysis showed that the education level of farmers, the availability of extension services and whether farmers had participated in ALERMP were highly significantly correlated with the farmers' perception of degradation. The farmers' adoption of improved management practices was found to be significantly correlated only with whether they had participated in ALERMP. This shows that specific extension activities of the type possible in large and well-funded projects are required if farmers are to recognise degradation and adopt improved management practices. The promotion of farmer education and strengthening of extension services are recommended as the best policy strategies for improving environmental management in this region.

"AGRIS:US201600185934";"Ecological Risk Assessment at The Regional Scale";"";"Ecological risk assessments are used by policy makers and regulatory agencies for balancing and comparing ecological risks associated with environmental hazards. An approach for regionalâscale ecological risk assessment is described and demonstrated by modeling environmental risks associated with elevated ozone in a forested region. The demonstration illustrates (1) how a regionalâscale risk assessment might be done, (2) the importance of spatial characteristics in considering regionalâscale risk, and (3) the necessity of considering terrestrial and aquatic linkages. Generic problems often encountered when doing regional assessments, the foremost of which is the frequent lack of regionâspecific information and spatial data, are also highlighted. In the demonstration, two levels of elevated ozone and five different atârisk regional features are considered (forest cover, forest edge, forest interior, landscape pattern, and lake water quality). The mechanism for impacts on these features is ozoneâinduced stress in coniferous trees, patches of which can then be killed by bark beetle attacks. A stochastic spatial model of landâcover change is developed to evaluate the risks or probabilities of significant changes in the selected ecological features as a consequence of these ozoneâtriggered beetle attacks. Risk to regional water quality of lakes is evaluated by linking the landâcover output from the spatial stochastic model to an empirical waterâquality model that is sensitive to landâcover changes within a lake's watershed. The risk analysis shows that those environmental features that are sensitive to the location of coniferous forest (such as forest edge) are at risk of a significant change due to ozoneâinduced conifer mortality even though overall coniferous forest cover is only slightly affected. The analysis also suggests a high probability of changes in regional water quality of lakes as a consequence of locationâspecific forestâcover change.";"Graham, R. L.

The authors is a traced the cyclic processes in the history of the development of land and property relations, assesses the present stage of the next cycle and are historical parallels in socio-economic development. In Russia, the all major socio-economic reforms is due to political changes in the country (the coming to power of Ivan the terrible, Peter I, Catherine II, Alexander II, Nicholas II, the provisional government, the Soviet government, Gorbachev, M. S., B. Yeltsin N.), where the key issue was the relationship to the land, property rights, and use of the territory of new landowners. But no one conducted in the country of agrarian reforms were not brought to its logical conclusion, which is directly braked at all times the development of the agricultural sector, prevented the formation of its sustainability and, as a consequence, the stability of the socio-economic development of the entire state. The repeated statements of some scientists and public figures of concerns about the height of the risks of globalization of the economy to the loss of statehood, not much attention was a paid to mid-March 2014. The subsequent of economic sanctions from US, EU, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan, and the response of the Russian government in the form of a ban on food imports from these countries, revealed the urgent need of adoption scenarios protection of the Russian economy from the impact of external economic destabilization, primarily due to the development of their own agriculture. In this regard, the authors propose an economic model of the organization of interaction between a cities and agricultural enterprises through the multifunction integrated agro complex. Thus, only the implementation of state programs and strategies of the socio-economic development a through evidence-based planning on implementation in industrial practice, projects and schemes of land management of agricultural enterprises is a key for involvement in the turnover of agricultural land to economically and ecologically safe of the use of agricultural potential in country for ensure food security and stable development.";"KOVALEVA, T N (Saratov State Agrarian University)

Nine LULC classes were mapped from multi-temporal Landsat data of 1974, 1986 and 2000. Special attention was given to the growth or otherwise of agricultural land in relation to other LULC classes. Conversion of one land-use/-cover type to the other was identified, and its effects discussed. Major conversions occurred between agricultural lands, grasslands, evergreen forest, built-up areas and barren land. Built-up areas increased by at least 140% between 1974 and 2000, suggesting a high urbanization rate. About 882 ha (27%) of agricultural lands in 1986 were converted to residential purposes in 2000, especially at the urban fringes, in response to an increase in population. Some 14% of evergreen forest was found to have been converted to agricultural land. These major conversions suggest a strong linkage between urbanization, agriculture and deforestation.";"Forkuor, Gerald

"AGRIS:US201400106557";"step-wise land-cover classification of the tropical forests of the Southern Yucatán, Mexico";"";"Analysis of land-cover change in the seasonal tropical forests of the Southern Yucatán, Mexico presents a number of significant challenges for the fine-scale land-cover information required of land-change science. Subtle variation in mature forest types across the regional ecocline is compounded by vegetation transitions following agricultural land uses. Such complex mapping environments require innovation in multispectral classification methodologies. This research presents an application of a step-wise maximum likelihood/In-Process Classification Assessment (IPCA) procedure. This hybrid supervised and unsupervised classification methodology allows for exploration of underlying characteristics of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery in tropical environments. Once spectrally separable classes have been identified, field data then determine the ecological definition of vegetation types with special attention paid to areas of unknown or mixed classes. A post-field assessment re-classification using the Dempster–Shafer method reduced the original 25 spectral classes to 14 ecologically distinctive classes, providing the fine-tuned land-cover distinctions that are required for both environmental and socioeconomic research questions. The overall map accuracy was 87% with an average per-class accuracy of 86%. Per-class accuracy ranged from as low as 45% for pasture grass to a high of 100% for tall-stature evergreen upland forest, low and medium-stature semi-deciduous upland forest and deciduous forest.";"Schmook, Birgit

"AGRIS:US201600098504";"Defining the forest landowner’s utility–loss compensative subsidy level for a biodiversity object";"";"New, cost efficient and voluntary biodiversity protection tools may require bidding price definition on part of the seller. Both the seller and the buyer can withdraw from negotiations if they find that the conditions of the protection contract are unacceptable. However, it can be very difficult for non-industrial, private landowners to define the bidding price demand for their biodiversity objects. The terms of the protection contract, the production possibilities of the forest holding, the forest owner’s multiple forest management goals and their substitutability, and the possible monetary subsidy paid for biodiversity protection should all be simultaneously taken into account when estimating the owner’s price demand for protecting the biodiversity object. This study strives to provide relief in resolving this problem by presenting an approach in which the landowner’s utility–loss compensative subsidy can be defined based on the owner’s forest-holding level utility function and the production possibilities of the holding. The properties of the approach are illustrated by four planning cases in which the length of the protection period (permanent or 20-year temporary protection) and the holding-level goals were varied. The utility functions of the cases were derived by selecting numeric goal variables for the goals, and by defining weights and sub-utility functions for these variables. Varying subsidies for protecting an old-growth spruce stand were included into the simulation of “No treatment” schedules for the examined stand, and the holding-level total utility was maximized for every price level. The utility–loss compensative subsidy was found when the holding-level total utility equaled the total utility achieved in the plan where the stand was regenerated. This subsidy, however, is not necessarily the exact price that the owner should ask from the buyer; all prices above the defined subsidy level will increase owner’s utility if the buyer accepts them. It was concluded that the presented approach provided consistent results in the four cases and that it thus offers valuable decision support for current biodiversity-protection programs.";"Kurttila, Mikko

Rehabilitation/revegetation of mine spoils has received considerable attention in recent years due to acceleration of mining and associated land disturbances. This is an attempt towards rehabilitation of limestone mine spoils in arid areas where water and nutrients are the main constraints even in normal soil. An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), Glomus mosseae was isolated from limestone mine spoils and its effect on the growth and nutrient uptake in different tree species grown on limestone mine spoils as well as rhizosphere effect were examined. Soil inoculation with G. mosseae had significantly enhanced plant growth and biomass production in limestone mine spoils and the enhancement varied from one species to the other. Further, there was an improvement in per cent root infection and AMF spore density in the rhizosphere indicating the establishment of G. mosseae in limestone mine spoil. Activities of various enzymes (dehydrogenase, phosphatases and nitrogenase) and population of nitrifying bacteria and Azotobacter were also improved upon inoculation with AM-fungus besides improvement in the uptake of many nutrients except Na and K. Because of the ability of AM-fungi in improving the water uptake and transport in plants, enhancing the uptake of various nutrients and enabling the plants to withstand high temperatures, AM-fungi native to limestone mine spoils may play a critical role in revegetating these spoils in arid areas. In view of the above results, use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may be adopted for the rehabilitation of limestone mine spoils for creating a better ecosystem.";"Rao, A.V.

This study assesses groundwater recharge and exploitative potential zone in the central division of the mountain areas of Taiwan (the middle reaches of the Jhuoshuei River Basin). Basic information from remote sensing and a satellite phantom is collected to set up the basic data maps using elevation, Formosa-II images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, drainage distribution, slope, aspect ratio, lineament distribution, and land cover. A geographical information system is used to integrate five contributing factors, namely lithology, land cover/land use, drainage, slope, and lineaments. The criteria for the recharge potential assessment are established to demarcate the potential groundwater recharge zone. Finally, the GOD rating system is adopted to evaluate the potential exploitation zone. Three main parameters are considered: the groundwater occurrence, the lithology of the overlying layers, and the depth to groundwater. The results show that the middle reaches of the Chenyuland River have large potential exploitation zones due to its high rainfall recharge capacity. Regions west of the Jhuoshuei River and the downstream regions of the Chingshui River are medium potential exploitation zones because of their high infiltration rates and shallow groundwater levels.";"Huang, Chih-Chao

"AGRIS:US201500059045";"Microscale evidence for a high decrease of soil bacterial density and diversity by cropping";"";"Soil microbes play major agricultural functions such as the transformation of soil organic matter into plant fertilizers. The effects of agricultural practices on soil microbes at the scale of plots, from meters to hectare, are well documented. However, the impact at soil microscale, from micrometers to millimeters, is much less known. Therefore, we studied bacterial community density and diversity at microscale in crop soil under grassland, tillage, and no tillage. We fractionated macroaggregates, from 2,000 to 250 μm and from 250 to 63 μm; microaggregates, from 63–20 μm and 20–2 μm; and clay particles, lower than 2 μm. We measured the bacterial density and diversity by real-time PCR and 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes of soil DNA, respectively. Results show that bacterial density and diversity were heterogeneous among size aggregates. Tillage decreased bacterial density from 22 to 74 %, and diversity from 4 to 11 %, and changed taxonomic groups in micro- and macroaggregates. This change led to the homogenization of bacterial communities and is explained by a higher protection of microaggregates. As a consequence, microaggregates contained similar bacterial communities whatever the land management is, whereas strong differences were observed between communities inhabiting macroaggregates. These findings demonstrate that bacterial diversity in microaggregates was mainly controlled by historical contingency, whereas bacterial communities in macroaggregates are shaped by contemporary perturbations. Our findings thus revealed unprecedented insights of the effect of agriculture on soil microbes. Potential applications include using crop management options that preserve macroaggregate structure to promote soil heterogeneity and therefore microbial diversity.";"Constancias, Florentin

"AGRIS:US201500180509";"foxtail (Setaria) species-group";"";"The weedy Setaria species (giant, green, yellow, knotroot, and bristly foxtail) compose one of the worst weed groups interfering with world agriculture and in other disturbed and managed habitats. These species, together with their crop counterparts (foxtail millet, korali), form the foxtail species-group (spp.-gp). Five successive waves of Setaria spp. invasion from preagricultural times to the present have resulted in widespread infestation of the disturbed, arable, temperate regions of the earth. These invasions have resulted in considerable economic and environmental costs. The success of the Setaria spp.-gp is because of their intimate evolutionary relationship with humans, disturbance, agriculture, and land management. The ability to adapt rapidly to local conditions is the hallmark of this weedy group. Genotypic and phenotypic biodiversity provides this spp.-gp with traits that allow it to invade, colonize, adapt to, and endure in a wide range of habitats around the world. The phenotypic life-history traits important to the success of weedy Setaria spp. begin with the induction of dormancy in seed during embryogenesis. The formation of long-lived, heterogeneous seed pools in the soil is the inevitable consequence of the dormant seed rain. In soil seed pools, after-ripening, the occurrence and timing of seedling emergence, and the induction of secondary (summer) dormancy are regulated by seasonally and diurnally varying soil oxygen, water, and temperature signals. Precise and variable timing of seedling emergence ensures Setaria a dominant place in disturbed and managed communities during the growth and reproductive phases that follow. Once established in a community, phenotypic plasticity inherent in an individual weedy Setaria sp. allows it to maximize its growth, form, and reproduction to the specific local conditions it encounters, including competitive interactions with neighbors. Traits controlling the plastic development of plant architecture include the ability to form one or more tillering shoots whose stature and number are precisely sized to local conditions. A complex pattern of branching, from plant to spikelet, provides diverse microenvironments within which different levels of dormancy are induced in individual seeds on a panicle and among panicles on a common plant. Traits for adaptation to stress in weedy Setaria spp. include tolerance to many inhibitory chemicals (e.g., herbicides, salt), mechanical damage, and drought. Genetic traits such as self-pollination and small genome size contribute to a highly diverse collection of locally adapted genotypes and phenotypes ready to exploit any opportunities provided by a cropping system. Self-pollinating Setaria spp. exist in wild, weed, and crop variants, an ideal genetic condition ensuring both long-term stability and novelty. Weedy Setaria spp. populations have low to exceedingly low amounts of total genetic variation, unusually low intrapopulation genetic diversity, and unusually high genetic diversity between populations compared with an average plant species. These traits result spatially in local populations that are unusually homogeneous, typically consisting of a single multilocus genotype. Either a generally or a specifically adapted genotype of an individual species might predominate in that local population. Across the landscape, different single-genotype populations dominate particular local sites, providing novel genetics to the region by dispersal and gene flow when conditions change. Across North America, populations of green foxtail and knotroot foxtail are genetically differentiated along a north––south gradient. The history of invasion and colonization, the successful life histories of locally adapted weedy Setaria spp., and the evolutionary potential of this weed group emphasize the need for accurate prediction of its behavior. Weedy Setaria spp. management is the management of local selection pressure and consequent adaptation. Farmers, land managers, policy makers and regulators, homeowners, and consumers need accurate information about weedy Setaria spp. to predict and guide management decisions based on economics, risk, and environmental sustainability.Nomenclature: Green foxtail, Setaria viridis, subspecies viridis (L.)

Complex and spatially heterogeneous landscapes that typify forest-urban watersheds are not fully represented with these types of data. Hence important questions concerning how green infrastructure influences water quality and quantity at different spatial scales remain unanswered. OBJECTIVES: Demonstrate the feasibility of creating novel high-resolution land cover maps across entire watersheds and highlight deficiencies of standard land cover products. METHODS: We used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to create high-resolution (0.5 m) land cover maps and detect tree canopy overlapping impervious surfaces for a representative forest-urban watershed in Duluth, MN, USA. Unbiased estimates of accuracy and area were calculated and compared with similar metrics for the 30-m National Land Cover Database (NLCD). RESULTS: Mapping accuracies for the high-resolution land cover and canopy overlap maps were ~90 %. Error-adjusted estimates of area indicated that impervious surfaces comprised ~21 % of the watershed, tree canopy overlapped ~10 % of impervious surfaces, and that three high-resolution land cover classes differed significantly from similar NLCD classes. CONCLUSIONS: OBIA can efficiently generate high-resolution land cover products of entire watersheds that are appropriate for research and inclusion in the decision-making process of managers. Metrics derived from these products will likely differ from standard land cover maps and may produce new insights, especially when considering the unprecedented opportunity to evaluate fine-scale spatial heterogeneity across watersheds.";"Stueve, Kirk M.

"AGRIS:US201500078816";"Land‐use drivers of forest fragmentation vary with spatial scale";"";"AIM: Improving our understanding of the drivers of forest fragmentation is fundamental to mitigating the consequences of anthropogenic fragmentation for biodiversity. Moreover, the impacts of fragmentation on biodiversity depend on the spatial scale at which fragmentation occurs. Therefore, understanding how the effect of land use on fragmentation patterns varies across scales is critical to ensure that fragmentation is managed at scales relevant to the ecology of target species or to land management. Here, we quantified the influence of land use on patterns of forest fragmentation at different scales using Queensland, Australia, as a case study. LOCATION: North‐eastern Australia. METHODS: We combined fractal analysis with piecewise linear regression to measure patterns of forest fragmentation across a range of scales in 5309 landscapes of c. 50 km², with different proportions of land used for cropping and grazing. A significant change in fragmentation patterns occurred at approximately 1 km². We used beta regression to quantify the impact of land use on the degree of fragmentation at scales finer and coarser than 1 km². RESULTS: The use of land for grazing tended to create more fragmented forest patterns than use of land for cropping. This difference was more pronounced at coarser than finer scales. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggests that the choice of land use where conservation actions, such as revegetation and retention of forest patches, are to be prioritized depends on the scale at which we measure fragmentation. This information contributes to reducing the risk of mismatches between the scale at which fragmentation is managed and the scale at which fragmentation is measured, which is often dictated by the scale of species movements or the scale of land management. Our finding also improves our capacity to discern between fragmentation patterns that are typical of land‐sharing and land‐sparing conservation strategies, as spatial scale varies, thus aiding the implementation of land sparing and land sharing at scales relevant to biodiversity conservation and land management.";"Cattarino, Lorenzo

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify the spatial pattern of land surface temperatures (LSTs) and associated heat fluxes in relation to land-cover types in Beijing, China, using portable infrared thermometers, thermal infrared imagers, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer. METHODS: The spatial differences and the relationships between LSTs and the hierarchical landscape structure were analyzed with in situ observations of surface radiation and heat fluxes. RESULTS: Large LST differences were found among various land-use/land-cover types, urban structures, and building materials. Within the urban area, the mean LST of urban impervious surfaces was about 6–12 °C higher than that of the urban green space. LSTs of built-up areas were on average 3–6 °C higher than LSTs of rural areas. The observations for surface radiation and heat fluxes indicated that the differences were caused by different fractions of sensible heat or latent heat flux in net radiation. LSTs decreased with increasing elevation and normalized difference vegetation index. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in building materials and urban structure significantly influenced the spatial pattern of LSTs in urban areas. By contrast, elevation and vegetation cover are the major determinants of the LST pattern in rural areas. To alleviate urban heat island intensity, urban planners and policy makers should pay special attention to the selection of appropriate building materials, the reasonable arrangement of urban structures, and the rational design of landscape components.";"Kuang, Wenhui

In this work, the application of pre-classification techniques could contribute to produce land-cover and land-use maps with higher quality of classification. At this point, the average value of overall classification accuracies for the three classification outputs was an estimated 90%.Then, ‘from–to’ change information, as well as the area and the type of landscape transformations, are provided through the post-classification technique. The findings of this study show that the province of Pisa has significantly experienced a high rate of deforestation and urban development over past decades. It is revealed that artificial structures (e.g. urban and industrial zones) in Pisa Province increased at a change rate of around 265% and forested land decreased from approximately 45% to 32% of the total area of the province between 1972 and 2006. Likewise, the perceptible growth of built-up structures from about 4% to 10.6% in Pisa City during this 34-year period has imposed a heavy pressure on the landscape of Pisa.";"Peiman, Reihaneh";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover;deforestation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ITA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400106735";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.486806";"";"";"";"4365-4381"

First, several important conceptual issues arising from this particular meso-levelfocus are discussed. Second, a description of the key tenure and tree management issuesin Uganda and Malawi is presented. In each case, data representing changes in land useand tree cover between the 1960–70s and 1990s are analyzed. In both countries, there hasbeen significant conversion of land from woodlands to agriculture. Tree cover has beenmore or less maintained over time in Uganda but has decreased in Malawi. Lastly, thepaper explores the relationships between tenure and tree management using econometrictechniques. Tenure is found to be linked to land-use and tree-cover change in bothcountries, though it is not necessarily the most important factor (e.g., population pressureis the key driving force for land-use change). In Uganda, conversion of land was morerapid under the customary tenure system and tree cover on nonagricultural land bettermaintained under the mailo system. In Malawi there was more rapid land-use conversionand tree cover depletion where there were more changes to traditional tenure systemstaking place.";"Place, Frank

Residential soils in Baltimore had SOC densities that were approximately 20 to 34% less than Moscow or Chicago. By contrast, park soils in Baltimore had more than double the SOC density of Hong Kong. Of the six cities, Atlanta and Chicago had the highest and lowest SOC densities per total area, respectively (7.83 and 5.49 kg m-2). On a pervious area basis, the SOC densities increased between 8.32 (Oakland) and 10.82 (Atlanta) kg m-2. In the northeastern United States, Boston and Syracuse had 1.6-fold less SOC post- than in pre-urban development stage. By contrast, cities located in warmer and/or drier climates had slightly higher SOC pools post- than in pre-urban development stage (4 and 6% for Oakland and Chicago, respectively). For the state analysis, aboveground estimates of C density varied from a low of 0.3 (WY) to a high of 5.1 (GA) kg m-2, while belowground estimates varied from 4.6 (NV) to 12.7 (NH) kg m-2. The ratio of aboveground to belowground estimates of C storage varied widely with an overall ratio of 2.8. Our results suggest that urban soils have the potential to sequester large amounts of SOC, especially in residential areas where management inputs and the lack of annual soil disturbances create conditions for net increases in SOC. In addition, our analysis suggests the importance of regional variations of land-use and land-cover distributions, especially wetlands, in estimating urban SOC pools.";"Pouyat, R.V.

The investigation of consistent associations between ecological parameters, called bundles, and of their links to landscape composition and structure is essential to inform management and policy, yet it is still in its infancy. We mapped over the French Alps an unprecedented array of 18 ecological parameters (16 ES and two biodiversity parameters) and explored their co‐occurrence patterns underpinning the supply of multiple ecosystem services in landscapes. We followed a three‐step analytical framework to i) detect the ES and biodiversity associations relevant at regional scale, ii) identify the clusters supplying consistent bundles of ES at subregional scale and iii) explore the links between landscape heterogeneity and ecological parameter associations at landscape scale. We used successive correlation coefficients, overlap values and self‐organizing maps to characterize ecological bundles specific to given land cover types and geographical areas of varying biophysical characteristics and human uses at nested scales from regional to local. The joint analysis of land cover richness and ES gamma diversity demonstrated that local landscape heterogeneity alone did not imply compatibility across multiple ecosystem services, as some homogeneous landscape could supply multiple ecosystem services. Synthesis and applications. Bundles of ecosystem services and biodiversity parameters are shaped by the joint effects of biophysical characteristics and of human history. Due to spatial congruence and to underlying functional interdependencies, ecological parameters should be managed as bundles even when management targets specific objectives. Moreover, depending on the abiotic context, the supply of multiple ecosystem services can arise either from deliberate management in homogeneous landscapes or from spatial heterogeneity.";"Crouzat, Emilie

The present study was aimed to assess the impact of land uses and soil management practices on soil properties, and consequently on soil quality of degraded soils. The catchments selected were Maileba and Gum Selassa, and land uses included cultivated (CL), grazing (GL), plantation (PA) and area exclosure (AE). Replicated soil samples were collected from topsoil and profiles of four land-use types in both catchments. Soils in area exclosure showed higher soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and extractable K than grazing land, cultivated land and plantation area mainly at 0–40 cm soil depth. Estimated soil organic carbon stock at Maileba in 0–40 cm depth varied between 54 to 74 Mg C ha⁻¹, being lowest in cultivated land and highest in area exclosure, and the soil organic carbon stock in area exclosure represents 63% of total carbon stock stored in the profile. Soil organic carbon stock (0–40 cm) at Gum Selassa ranged between 33 to 38 Mg C ha⁻¹, being higher in cultivated land and lower in plantation area. Soil quality index (SQI) of area exclosure (0.794) at Maileba and cultivated land (0.721) at Gum Selassa scored highest among all land uses, and the order was area exclosure>grazing land>plantation area>cultivated land at Maileba and cultivated land>grazing land>plantation area at Gum Selassa, highlighting the effectiveness of area exclosure in restoring soil quality of degraded soils.";"Girmay, G.

The fern spreads across the landscape by wind-blown spores and invades isolated and undisturbed habitats such as interior portions of the Florida Everglades. Land managers in Florida have reported that multiple herbicide treatments are required to control the fern, which could indicate that herbicides do not translocate throughout the plant in long-established populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the absorption and translocation patterns in Old World climbing fern using the three herbicides most commonly used for management of this plant by land managers in Florida. Using 14C-labeled herbicides, we evaluated absorption and translocation of glyphosate (2.25 kg ai ha−1), metsulfuron (0.10 kg ai ha−1), and triclopyr (1.68 kg ai ha−1) in Old World climbing fern using five different application scenarios (cut-and-spray, basal spray, 25% foliar spray, 50% foliar spray, and 100% foliar spray). Triclopyr was absorbed to the greatest extent (60.3%) of applied radioactive compounds compared to glyphosate (31.2%) and metsulfuron (19.8%). The majority of radioactivity remained in treated leaves for all herbicides with only small percentages of the absorbed radioactivity being detected in other plant parts. All three herbicides translocated acropetally and basipitally to some extent. Radioactivity, for the most part, translocated evenly throughout the plants but the greatest amount of radioactivity derived from triclopyr occurred in rhizomes when the cut-and-spray and basal applications were used. The radioactivity in rhizomes derived from glyphosate was greater in those treated using cut-and-spray. Based on autoradiographs, there was limited horizontal movement of any herbicide in the rhizomes of Old World climbing fern which could explain why resprouts are observed several weeks following treatment.";"Hutchinson, Jeffrey T.

This approach encourages exploration of multifunctional solutions to meet the needs of growing populations in many areas around the world, while minimizing the negative impacts of human activities on the environment. This is achieved by incorporating theoretical and applied principles from the fields of landscape ecology, agroecology, and ecological design. Multifunctional landscapes can be designed to provide a range of environmental, social, and economic functions, while considering the interests of landowners and users. Here, we propose a process for designing multifunctional landscapes, guided by ecological principles in the following steps: (1) defining the project site and landscape context, (2) analyzing landscape structure and function, (3) master planning using an ecosystem approach, (4) designing sites to highlight ecological functions, and (5) monitoring ecological functions. The development of a framework for ecological design of landscapes demonstrates the importance of a multiâscale approach for connecting sites to their surroundings, the benefits of a multifunctional design for sustainability, and the value of involving ecologists throughout the entire design process.

Moose-vehicle accidents have spurred construction of fences along roads, and these may interfere with moose migration between summer and winter ranges, or the road alone may be a barrier. If this happens and moose build up along roads, landowners may suffer economically. Therefore, this study investigated whether roads, fences or other factors influence the use of young pine stands by moose. Eighty stands along roads in northern Sweden were evaluated in which individually-browsed branches were counted on 9972 pines. Moose browsing was not significantly related to birch (Betula pendula Roth, B. pubescens Ehrh.) density, nor did it differ between pines (Pinus contorta Douglas or P. sylvestris L.). However, increased pine density, site productivity and proximity to a highway were associated with increased browsing.

The study examined methods and amounts of investment by small-holder farmers in southwestern Nigeria. Multistage sampling was used to randomly select 200 arable farmers from 20 LGAs distributed throughout five states in the region. Descriptive statistics and a multiple regression analysis were used to analyze data. The study showed that the average age of farmers was 46.5 years and that families were very large, averaging 10 members. The level of education was mostly low but respondents were highly experienced farmers with a mean farming experience of 24.6 years. Farms were generally small, averaging 3.3 ha per capita with land distribution of 6.6 ha in the study area. Ninety percent of farmers had no tenure on their farm holdings beyond usufructuary rights. Most farmers did not use critical farm inputs such as tractors; fertilizer, improved seedlings and agrochemicals while those who did use them had invested very little. Key factors determining farm investment were farm size and income while expenditure incurred on fertilizer, land improvement and capital assets were key determinants of a farm’s income. Important recommendations determined by the study include the use of farm extension agents to educate farmers on sources and how to access existing investment opportunities for small holder operators, land reform policies that will give tenure to farm operators, and to increase investment on farm inputs and assets to increase output and income.";"Oluwasola O.";"";"International Academic Journals";"AGRIS";"2012-03-01";"";"land improvement";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012072869";"http://www.inacj.com/agriscience/archive/77-march-2012/121-march-2012-list-of-articles.html";"";"";"";"265-279"
"AGRIS:US201500209726";"Quantifying long-term changes in gully networks and volumes in dryland environments: The case of Northern Ethiopia";"";"Understanding historical and present gully development is essential when addressing the causes and consequences of land degradation, especially in vulnerable dryland environments. For Northern Ethiopia, several studies exist on the severity of gully erosion, yet few have quantified gully development. In this study, gully network and volume development were quantified over the period 1963–2010 for an area of 123km², representing the regional variability in environmental characteristics. Gully networks were mapped from small-scale aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images. For the latter, visualizing Google Earth images in 3D proved to be very suitable to investigate gully erosion. From the changes in networks and volumes over the period 1963–2010, the occurrence of one cut-and-fill cycle is apparent. From a largely low-dynamic gully system in the 1960s, network expansion and increased erosion rates in the 1980s and 1990s caused the drainage density and volume to peak in 1994. The average gully density (Dₜₒₜₐₗ) was then 2.52kmkm⁻² and the area-specific gully volume (Vₐ) 60×10³m³km⁻². This coincides with soil losses by gully erosion (SLg) of 17.6tha⁻¹y⁻¹ over the period 1963–1994. By 2010, improved land management and the region-wide implementation of soil and water conservation measures caused 25% of the gully network to stabilize, resulting in a net infilling of the gully channels over the period 1994–2010. The study validates previous findings that land degradation by gullying was indeed severe in Northern Ethiopia in the second half of the 20th century, but also shows that when proper land management is applied, a gully can be transformed into a linear oasis, which increases the resistance of gullies to further erosion.";"Frankl, Amaury

Várias áreas do conhecimento, como a sociologia, a antropologia e a economia, contribuem para a construção do conhecimento neste domínio, a par de outras mais recentes como os estudos feministas e os estudos pós-coloniais. Como resultado, as teorias e os conceitos sobre a relação das mulheres com o desenvolvimento e os efeitos deste sobre as mulheres têm sido vários. O objectivo deste trabalho foi em primeiro lugar caracterizar o papel da mulher no desenvolvimento rural, identificando as suas funções, as principais abordagens utilizadas e a sua situação perante o enquadramento jurídico internacional. Em segundo lugar fazemos uma análise da situação da mulher em Timor-Leste, abarcando aspectos sociais, nomeadamente os papéis de género, da família, e o acesso aos recursos naturais. Faz-se igualmente uma leitura da situação da mulher perante o direito positivo e o sistema costumeiro. A análise recorreu a informação documental e a observações e dados recolhidos no local em 2000 e 2003.Os contributos que as mulheres de Timor-Leste poderão dar ao desenvolvimento do seu país está bastante condicionado pelas desigualdades de género presentes no direito consuetudinário, no qual destacamos o desigual acesso aos recursos naturais, com relevo para a terra. A HRBA parece ser a abordagem que melhor se adapta a uma integração plena da mulher no processo de desenvolvimento, ao defender a igualdade e a não discriminação das mulheres em qualquer circunstância, e ao apelar à formação e ao empoderamento das mulheres para o exercício dos seus direitos.---------------------------------------------It has been a long way, until both gender and development were recognized as important issues in academic and political arena. Several fields of science, such as sociology, anthropology, and economy contributed to the knowledge in this area, in addition to recent developments in feminist and pos-colonial studies. As a result, there are different gender approaches to development.The first objective of this paper is to examine the role of women in rural development, identifying their roles, the main gender approaches to development and women status under international law framework. The second aim is to analyze the position of women in East Timor with respect to social aspects, namely the gender roles, the family, access to natural resources and women status under the legal system and the traditional law. This analysis used documental sources of information and observations and data collected in field work in East Timor in 2000 and 2003.The contribution of East Timorese women to the development is heavy constrained by the gender inequality present in traditional/customary law, in which unequal access to natural resources, in special land, is relevant. The HRBA seems to be the best approach to a full integration of women in the development process, once it vindicates the right to equality and non discrimination and advocates training and empowerment as means to make women exercise their rights.";"Narciso, Vanda Margarida De Jesus Dos Santos

"AGRIS:US201400143252";"procedure to obtain a refined European land use/cover map";"";"Available land use/cover maps differ in their spatial extent and in their thematic, spatial, and temporal resolutions. Due to the costs of producing such maps, there is usually a trade-off between spatial extent and resolution. The only European-wide, consistent, and multi-temporal land use/cover dataset available is the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map. Despite the value and usefulness of CLC, its minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 25 hectares considerably limits its applications at large scales of analysis. Our objective was to improve the spatial detail of CLC 2006 by incorporating land use/cover information present in finer thematic maps available for Europe such as the CLC change map, Soil Sealing Layer, Tele Atlas® Spatial Database, Urban Atlas, and Water Bodies Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Relevant data from these datasets were extracted and prepared to be combined with CLC in a stepwise approach. Each step increased the level of modifications to the original CLC. This process generated a newly refined version of the CLC 2006 map with an improved MMU of 1 hectare for all types of artificial surfaces and inland waters while keeping constant the original 100 meter cell size. A validation of the new map was carried out using Land Use/Cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) 2006 sample points. The observed increase in spatial detail was done, however, at the cost of cartographic consistency.";"Batista e Silva, Filipe

This approach is based on the UPlan model. It acknowledges the lack of historical land use detailed data in most of the Egyptian cities and is heavily based on socioeconomic and land use patterns collected from field surveys and census data. The model is tested on Wadi El Natrun city, an urban agglomeration located on the agricultural fringes of the Nile River. Several scenarios are generated based on changes in a set of attractors, discouragements, and masks. The use of such model is recommended to both urban planners in assessing the effect of their land use allocation decisions and the local authorities in evaluating those plans and possible actions regarding land policies.";"Ayad, Hany M.

"AGRIS:DJ2012068048";"A methodology for evaluating land suitability for medicinal plants at a regional level";"";"Before introducing a new crop in an area, such as medicinal plant species, crop-land suitability analysis is a prerequisite to achieve an optimum exploitation of the available land resources for a sustainable agricultural production. To evaluate the land suitability it is important to take into account the habitats of the plant species. Moreover, agronomic, logistic and product quality aspects have to be considered. The importance of these aspects changes according to the stakeholders: the local government is more involved in supporting environmental suitability and production sustainability, farmers need areas which satisfy agronomic and logistic requirements, while industry is interested in the quality of production. A methodology was developed and implemented to create suitability maps for medicinal plants. Because of the generally limited information about medicinal plant adaptation, a simple methodology, based on a priori information has been developed, based on three different criteria: i) environmental suitability (point of view of local government); ii) agronomic, productivity and logistic suitability (point of view of the farmer); iii) quality suitability (point of view of industry). For each of the three criteria, a specific macro-indicator, based on land characteristics, was calculated using membership functions. Here, a methodology to create maps for the introduction of such species was developed and implemented. This methodology can be repeated by command scripts in an easy-to-use freeware GIS. The structure of the evaluation model can be easily adapted to consider more detailed land information like climate and soil. The methodology (implemented by scripts in a freeware GIS), can be easily repeated and adapted for other situations.";"Marco Barbaro

"AGRIS:US201600186000";"Scaleâdependent effects of landscape composition and configuration on natural enemy diversity, crop herbivory, and yields";"";"(1) Landâuse intensification in agricultural landscapes has led to changes in the way habitats and resources are distributed in space. Pests and their natural enemies are influenced by these changes, and by the farming intensity of crop fields. However, it is unknown whether the composition of landscapes (amount and diversity of land cover types) or their configuration (spatial arrangement of cover types) are more important for natural enemy diversity, and how they impact crop damage and yields. In addition, effects of interactions between local farming practices (organic vs. conventional) and landscape variables are unclear. (2) Here, we make use of a data set where landscape composition and configuration were uncorrelated across multiple spatial scales. Natural enemies, crop damage, and yields were sampled in 35 organic and conventional crop fields. Out of seven broad natural enemy taxa, five were positively affected by a complex landscape configuration. In contrast, only carabids were positively affected by the amount of seminatural habitat around fields. Increasing diversity of land cover types had positive effects on some, but negative effects on other taxa. Effect sizes varied among taxa but increased with increasing spatial scale, defined by circular areas of increasing radius around fields. (3) The diversity of aerial, but not of groundâdwelling enemies was higher in fields under organic than conventional management. Interactions of local and landscape variables were important for birds, but not other enemies. Bird richness was higher in organic fields in simple landscapes, but not in landscapes with complex configuration or high land cover diversity. (4) Crop damage decreased with landscape diversity, but increased in conventional fields with complex configuration. Yields increased with both parameters in conventional fields only, and were higher on average in organic compared to conventional fields. Enemy diversity was positively related to crop damage, indicating positive densityâdependence of enemies on pests. However, the diversity of aerial enemies was also positively related to yields. (5) Our results suggest that the effectiveness of agriâenvironmental schemes for managing natural enemy diversity, crop damage and yields could be enhanced by optimizing the effects of distinct landscape parameters, particularly landscape configuration and diversity, across scales.";"Martin, Emily A.

"AGRIS:US201301796708";"Effect of conservation management on bees and insect-pollinated grassland plant communities in three European countries";"";"It is now widely accepted that agricultural intensification drives the decline of biodiversity and related ecosystem services like pollination. Conservation management, such as agri-environment schemes (AES), has been introduced to counteract these declines, but in Western European countries these tend to produce mixed biodiversity benefits. Not much is known about the effects of AES in Central and Eastern European countries. We evaluated the effect of reduced stocking rates (0.5cow/ha vs. >1cow/ha) on bees and insect-pollinated plants in semi-natural pastures in Hungary. We sampled bees using sweep net and transect surveys in the edge and interior of the fields three times in 2003. On the same transects, we also estimated the cover of all plant species. We found no management effect on species richness and abundance with respect to cover of bees and insect-pollinated plants, but grazing intensity resulted in differences in species composition of insect-pollinated plants. Furthermore, we compared our results with those of a similar study carried out in Switzerland, and the Netherlands, but with different management regimes. There were positive effects of management in Switzerland, but conservation effects were lacking in the Netherlands. Species richness of both bees and insect-pollinated plants was highest in Hungary, intermediate in Switzerland and lowest in the Netherlands. Across all countries, the richness of insect-pollinated plants was a good predictor of bee species richness. Grassland extensification schemes were effective for bees and insect-pollinated plants in the country with intermediate land-use intensity and biodiversity only (Switzerland). The absence of effects in the Netherlands may have been caused by the management being highly intensive on both field types. In Hungarian grasslands biodiversity levels were high regardless of management and both investigated stocking rates may be qualified as conservation management. Therefore, agricultural policy in Hungary should encourage the maintenance of a variety of traditional grazing practices for conserving this still highly diverse pollinator fauna.";"Batáry, Péter

"AGRIS:US201400008381";"Assessment of grassland use intensity by remote sensing to support conservation schemes";"";"Grassland is a land cover in the area of conflict between agriculture and conservation, where intensification of land use is a major threat to grassland biodiversity. Grassland use intensity is a key factor for the conservation value of grassland, and detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed to improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A new remote sensing-based approach using multi-temporal high resolution RapidEye satellite data was developed in the present study that makes a large-scale assessment of grassland use intensity possible. RapidEye is a constellation of five satellites with 6.5m spatial resolution, which allows frequent and timely image acquisition targeted at specific growing seasons. Semi-natural grassland, extensively used grassland, intensively used grassland and tilled grassland could be reliably differentiated at the management plot level in a study area in southern Germany. Various combinations of images from different observation dates have been tested as classification input and their overall classification accuracies were validated by field data. Best results were achieved using a combination of five multi-temporal scenes with an overall accuracy of 85.7%. A three-scene combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 82.2%. The analysis showed that seasonal aspects are very important when selecting adequate observation dates. Grassland use intensity was also assessed on peatlands using a peat soil map, since land use intensity significantly affects greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. The results demonstrate the potential of targeted multi-spectral, high spatial resolution remote sensing for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic habitats, which is of vital importance to support various environmental conservation schemes through improved monitoring and reporting capabilities.";"Franke, Jonas

On these properties, in accordance with rules aimed at regulating the collective use of resources, shareholders have the right of common use of the land. As many mountainous areas still rely on firewood for the heating of homes, the right to gather firewood from common forests is the most important common property right. In the last few decades, renewable bio-energy production based on forest woody biomass has undergone significant development. In Italy, in communities where the right to gather wood still has economic, social, and cultural relevance, decision makers and community members have a different vision about the use of firewood. This paper focuses on this issue by presenting a case study located in the Italian Eastern Alps, characterised by a historical tradition of common property management. In order to define the optimal strategy to manage the common forests, taking into consideration the local community’s needs, a semi-structured questionnaire was submitted to the administrators of the common forests and to the shareholders. Different scenarios of wood use were developed to support managers and decision makers in identifying on-going trends in firewood demand. The results show that the economic scenario for the development of the bio-energy supply chain cannot be reconciled with the historical tradition and social needs.";"Paletto, Alessandro

One economist has been able to list over 50 different economic methods. A similar list has not been available for policy agents interested in drawing upon the rich and extensive experience of people in other disciplines such as agricultural extension and social marketing. Applied literature in a number of social science disciplines has been used in this paper to put such a list together. The author describes possible voluntary policy methods including those associated with adult learning, communication, networking and engineering. A typology of voluntary policy methods is combined with a knowledge of market segmentation and learning styles to design voluntary policy strategies that can be used to supplement or replace regulatory or market based methods.  It is apparent that the standard of voluntary policy design can be improved through a greater awareness of the attributes of the different voluntary policy methods and how they can be combined effectively. Through greater strategic use of voluntary policy methods, and a process of monitoring and continual improvement, the outcomes desired in Resource Management Act legislation could be achieved more effectively without any increase in the number of rules required.";"Parminter, Terry G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-08-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016219876";"http://purl.umn.edu/96950";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400138757";"Scale‐dependent effects of landscape variables on gene flow and population structure in bats";"";"AIM: A common pattern in biogeography is the scale‐dependent effect of environmental variables on the spatial distribution of species. We tested the role of climatic and land cover variables in structuring the distribution of genetic variation in the grey long‐eared bat, Plecotus austriacus, across spatial scales. Although landscape genetics has been widely used to describe spatial patterns of gene flow in a variety of taxa, volant animals have generally been neglected because of their perceived high dispersal potential. LOCATION: England and Europe. METHODS: We used a multiscale integrated approach, combining population genetics with species distribution modelling and geographical information under a causal modelling framework, to identify landscape barriers to gene flow and their effect on population structure and conservation status. Genotyping involved 23 polymorphic microsatellites and 259 samples from across the species' range. RESULTS: We identified distinct population structure shaped by geographical barriers and evidence of population fragmentation at the northern edge of the range. Habitat suitability (as captured by species distribution models, SDMs) was the most important landscape variable affecting genetic connectivity at the broad spatial scale, while at the fine scale, lowland unimproved grasslands, the main foraging habitat of P.� austriacus, played a pivotal role in promoting genetic connectivity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The importance of lowland unimproved grasslands in determining the biogeography and genetic connectivity in P.� austriacus highlights the importance of their conservation as part of a wider landscape management for fragmented edge populations. This study illustrates the value of using SDMs in landscape genetics and highlights the need for multiscale approaches when studying genetic connectivity in volant animals or taxa with similar dispersal abilities.";"Razgour, Orly

Rose (2003) comparespeople who hold intellectual property rights to poor villagers in India. They put effort and timeinto developing small but productive properties, only to have the wild tiger or rogue elephant ofthe public domain trample them or eat them up. In extreme cases, IP ""villages"" are abandonedand left to ""the jungle"" of public property. But Rose neglects another part of the story, and that isthat the villagers are also hungry, and while they do not directly consume tigers, they do consumethe environment a tiger needs to survive. This paper argues, from the perspective of legalpluralism, that both private and public properties are voracious. In recent western developments,they each expand by trying to 'eating the other up'. Western property theory promotes thisdualistic game of voracious property types. In exporting this game world wide throughprivatization, international agreements and regulations many other more balanced approaches toproperty, which fall between the public/private divide, are being consumed as well (as in kingroup corporate property, cultural property etc.).Such a dualistic model of property limits our understanding of the ways in which theproperty rights of different claimants are interdependent. This interdependence arises not onlyfrom legal institutions that mediate property rights, but also from social institutions thatdetermine and distribute rights, and how these legal and social institutions interface. The three-tieredmodel presented in this paper--ideological, legal, and social--reveals the systemic nature ofproperty rights. Issues concerning 'new' forms of intellectual property, as well as the managementof natural resources, highlight the limitations of the ideological approach to property rights,which largely ignores the legal and social relationships embedded in these forms of property.This paper explores the implications of such voracious property for biodiversity.";"Wiber, Melanie G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-07-31";"en";"property;legal pluralism";"";"";"IND";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016208551";"http://purl.umn.edu/50064";"";"";"";""

The Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to determine the strength of the relationships. Additionally, the authors used multiple and simple regression analyses with CIM being an exploratory variable. The period averages of CIM for individual countries were the highest in Slovenia, whereas the lowest in Latvia and Lithuania. Cross-country dispersion of this ratio has narrowed, especially from 2003 onwards. Overall, our results provide little empirical support for the notion that the better performance of the national economy is strongly related to the better enforcement of property rights. There was a statistically significant positive association between CIM and economic growth rate (Hungary), employment rate (the Czech Republic), FDI (Estonia); household consumption spending (the Czech Republic and Slovenia), new business density (Hungary) and gross fixed capital formation by private sector (the whole group of countries), and negative association with long-term unemployment (Slovakia).

Rates of successful seeding on arid rangeland, however, are low. The objective of this study was to determine the degree to which water availability, invasive plant abundance, and seeding technology influence postfire seedling establishment. Across four fire complexes, whole plots were either seeded using a rangeland drill, seeded by hand where seeds could be placed at an exact depth, or left as unseeded controls. Irrigation and weeding treatments were applied to subplots within whole plots in an incomplete factorial design. In three of the four fires, seeding method was the single factor limiting establishment with seedling density over sevenfold higher in the hand-seeded compared to the drill-seeded treatments. In contrast to our hypotheses, water and weeding had no positive effect on seedling establishment in any of the four fires; however, background weed density was relatively low. The native community recovered at all sites with minimal bunchgrass mortality. These results strongly suggest a need for a decision framework that evaluates postfire seeding needs relative to natural recovery. Based on these initial results, it appears modest improvements in seeding technology may yield substantial increases in seeding success.";"James, Jeremy J.

"AGRIS:US201301869294";"Vegetation Characteristics of Mountain and Wyoming Big Sagebrush Plant Communities in the Northern Great Basin";"";"Dominant plant species are often used as indicators of site potential in forest and rangelands. However, subspecies of dominant vegetation often indicate different site characteristics and, therefore, may be more useful indicators of plant community potential and provide more precise information for management. Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) occurs across large expanses of the western United States. Common subspecies of big sagebrush have considerable variation in the types of sites they occupy, but information that quantifies differences in their vegetation characteristics is lacking. Consequently, wildlife and land management guidelines frequently do not differentiate between subspecies of big sagebrush. To quantify vegetation characteristics between two common subspecies of big sagebrush, we sampled 106 intact big sagebrush plant communities. Half of the sampled plant communities were Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata subsp. wyomingensis [Beetle & A. Young] S. L. Welsh) plant communities, and the other half were mountain big sagebrush (A. tridentata subsp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) plant communities. In general, mountain big sagebrush plant communities were more diverse and had greater vegetation cover, density, and biomass production than Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities. Sagebrush cover was, on average, 2.4-fold higher in mountain big sagebrush plant communities. Perennial forb density and cover were 3.8- and 5.6-fold greater in mountain compared to Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities. Total herbaceous biomass production was approximately twofold greater in mountain than Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities. The results of this study suggest that management guidelines for grazing, wildlife habitat, and other uses should recognize widespread subspecies as indicators of differences in site potentials.";"Davies, Kirk W.

We address this challenge in the thermokarst landscape of Old Crow Flats (OCF) using a combination of remote sensing imagery and monitoring of stable isotope compositions of lake waters over three thaw seasons (2007–2009). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the hydrological behavior of lakes is strongly influenced by catchment vegetation and physiography. Catchments of snowmelt‐dominated lakes, typically located in southern peripheral areas of OCF, encompass high proportions of woodland/forest and tall shrub vegetation (mean percent land cover = ca. 60%). These land cover types effectively capture snow and generate abundant snowmelt runoff that offsets lake water evaporation. Rainfall‐dominated lakes that are not strongly influenced by evaporation are typically located in eastern and northern OCF where their catchments have higher proportions of dwarf shrub/herbaceous and sparse vegetation (ca. 45%), as well as surface water (ca. 20%). Evaporation‐dominated lakes, are located in the OCF interior where their catchments are distinguished by substantially higher lake area to catchment area ratios (LA/CA = ca. 29%) compared to low evaporation‐influenced rainfall‐dominated (ca. 10%) and snowmelt‐dominated (ca. 4%) lakes. Lakes whose catchments contain >75% combined dwarf shrub/herbaceous vegetation and surface water are most susceptible to evaporative lake‐level drawdown, especially following periods of low precipitation. Findings indicate that multiple hydrological trajectories are probable in response to climate‐driven changes in precipitation amount and seasonality, vegetation composition, and thermokarst processes. These will likely include a shift to greater snowmelt influence in catchments experiencing expansion of tall shrubs, greater influence from evaporation in catchments having higher proportions of surface water, and an increase in the rate of thermokarst lake expansion and probability of drainage. Local observations suggest that some of these changes are already underway.";"Turner, Kevin W.

"AGRIS:US201400183852";"Hydrological challenges to groundwater trading: Lessons from south-west Western Australia";"";"Perth, Western Australia (pop. 1.6m) derives 60% of its public water supply from the Gnangara groundwater system (GGS). Horticulture, domestic self-supply, and municipal parks are other major consumers of GGS groundwater. The system supports important wetlands and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Underlying approximately 2200km² of the Swan Coastal Plain, the GGS comprises several aquifer levels with partial interconnectivity. Supplies of GGS groundwater are under unprecedented stress, due to reduced recharge and increases in extraction. Stored reserves in the superficial aquifer fell by 700GL between 1979 and 2008. Over a similar period, annual extraction for public supply increased by more than 350% from the system overall. Some management areas are over-allocated by as much as 69%. One potential policy response is a trading scheme for groundwater use. There has been only limited trading between GGS irrigators. Design and implementation of a robust groundwater trading scheme faces hydrological and/or hydro-economic challenges, among others. Groundwater trading involves transfers of the right to extract water. The resulting potential for spatial (and temporal) redistribution of the impacts of extraction requires management. Impacts at the respective selling and buying locations may differ in scale and nature. Negative externalities from groundwater trading may be uncertain as well as not monetarily compensable. An ideal groundwater trading scheme would ensure that marginal costs from trades do not exceed marginal benefits, incorporating future effects and impacts on third-parties. If this condition could be met, all transactions would result in constant or improved overall welfare. This paper examines issues that could reduce public welfare if groundwater trading is not subject to well-designed governance arrangements that are appropriate to meeting the above condition. It also outlines some opportunities to address key risks within the design of a groundwater trading scheme. We present a number of challenges, focusing on those with hydrological bases and/or information requirements. These include the appropriate hydrological definition of the boundaries of a trading area, the establishment and defining of sustainable yield and consumptive pool, and the estimation of effects of extractions on ecosystems and human users. We suggest several possible design tools. A combination of sustainable extraction limits, trading rules, management areas, and/or exchange rates may enable a trading scheme to address the above goals.";"Skurray, James H.

Since they are early maturity species, they possess the potential to be used as phytoremediating agents. Also, synthetic chelates have been found to induce lead desorption from soil matrix, thereby enhancing uptake into plant tissues. Therefore, a study was carried out to determine the potential of Amaranthus cruentus as a soil lead remediating plant. The experiment was carried out using a randomized block design. Soil samples were subjected to five levels of lead contamination namely control, 600ppm, 600ppm + EDTA, 1800ppm and 1800ppm + EDTA, each treatment had five replicates. Three plants each were carefully transplanted from nursery to experimental pots and grown for 32 days. Ethylenediaminetetra acetic(EDTA) (3.0 mmole EDTA/kg soil) was applied to EDTA amended treatment 8 days before harvesting. The result showed that EDTA has some effect on lead solubility in soil as well as lead absorption by A.cruentus. However, there were variable increases in lead uptake from the contaminated soil to the plants. Lead contamination did not have significant effect on growth and yield parameters of A cruentus. Since the transfer factor (TF) of the plant is greater than one, it may be a promising species for phytoremediation.";"Opeolu, B.O.

Community-based agricultural land consolidation projects were developed to restructure the agricultural sector by pooling fragmented land and leasing it as consolidated plots or employing laborers to farm the land. Despite the rapid growth in the number of villages that generally adopt the approach, the relative amount of farmland managed under the program remains low, and empirical studies explaining this variation are scarce. We investigate the drivers of land coverage under the program with a particular interest in the role of local elites and village characteristics. Using primary data from 120 villages in Suzhou City and Yangzhou City, China, our study shows that projects led by government officials achieve greater coverage. Other local elites do not play an important role in the process. Further investigation indicates that the roles of different types of elites change over time. We also find that structural village characteristics such as distance to town, village land endowment, and off-farm market participation substantially affect project outcomes. The results are robust to different samples and different specifications of the econometric model. Rather than generally excluding elites from leadership positions, policymakers should actively promote certain types of elites whose involvement might be critical for project success.";"Liu, Ziming

This paper evaluates several of those analyses in detail. With regard to patent quality in the United States, analysis indicates that rising numbers of patent grants are a consequence of demand for patents rather than changes in patent examination standards. Internationally, protection options for living organisms (seeds, plants, and animals) are more limited than for other products, suggesting a relative underinvestment in the sector. In particular, the recent ""initial/essentially derived"" system, intended to provide incentives for background plant breeding, is judged to be inoperative. Finally, with regard to IPRs and foreign direct investment (FDI), the ""strength"" of national IPR systems was found to be strongly associated with levels of FDI for 44 developing countries in the post-TRIPs world.

In frame of research the correlation between expropriated land and total area of affected land parcels have been analyzed in two different projects of road development – project of new road and project of road reconstruction. There is made the conclusion that in case of reconstruction of existing road the expropriated land area is rather small, in 60% of cases it does not exceed 3% of total area of land parcel, but in case of construction of new road expropriated area of land is at least 30% of total area of land parcel. For expropriation of part of the land parcel have to be developed land survey project or detailed plan. Legislative acts define the cases when detailed plans have to be developed compulsory. However local municipality has the right to specify or define an extra area for its development. Wherewith land survey projects play more and more significant role in process of land expropriation for state or public needs. In the research was made the questionnaire of experts – land surveyors of local municipalities on actual problems of land management and real property expropriation, and was made an analysis of this questionnaire. Land survey projects for subdivision of the land as component of technical project of roads construction/reconstruction have been developed in 42%, but development of detailed plans for identical purposes – in 30% of respondent local municipalities.

"AGRIS:US201500192280";"Effects of “Grain for Green” reforestation program on rural sustainability in China: an AHP approach to peasant consensus of public land use policies";"";"Climate change will affect the regional ability to achieve the poverty reduction and sustainable development (SD) objectives. Thus, any action plans to achieve these objectives should make climate change policies an integral part of the development planning process. The best practices and measures of climate change policies should be implemented to ensure regional or community sustainability. In this paper, a case study that promotes the integration of carbon sequestration into sustainable forest management and rural development plan with multi-stakeholders participation is introduced. To achieve SD goals, appropriate tools and methods are required to address impacts of alternative forest land uses on carbon sequestration and rural sustainability, and to prioritise land use options. A range of forest land use scenarios that address various aspects of the forest carbon sequestration rate and rural sustainability are evaluated against a SD indicator system. Planting vegetation is one of the practical approaches in mitigating global warming by sequestrating carbon from the atmosphere to plant matter and soil. In order to protect environment, reduce excessive soil erosion, and decrease the propensity and frequency of flooding and other natural disasters, China has initiated nationwide pivotal projects such as “Grain for Green” to mitigate exacerbated environmental deterioration and degradation. Such ecological programs may affect the socio-economic livelihoods of peasants and the economic activities of the whole region. The impact and economic uncertainty associated with such projects urge policy makers to include all stakeholders in the decision making process so that an agreeable solution towards sustainable rural development can be identified. This study uses Liping County in Guizhou province as a case study to identify a consensus among peasants regarding planting selected tree-species. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used as a multicriteria decision making tool to rank sustainability criteria and determine the priority of options. The method helps policy makers to understand what the peasants want to achieve by participating in a Grain for Green program and what their priorities are with respect to particular types of vegetation. The case study finds that economic and financial concerns are the most important drivers of the decision of which trees to plant among the peasants who took part in the implementation of the Grain for Green program. As a result of this, Gingko, redpine, and Chinese chestnut were the predominant trees planted under the program. The integrated assessment based on the AHP method provides an effective tool to help understand how economic, social and environmental factors are related to each other in affecting the nature of rural sustainability.";"Xu, Wei

"AGRIS:US201600099626";"Short-term Response of Holcus lanatus L. (Common Velvetgrass) to Chemical and Manual Control at Yosemite National Park, USA";"";"One of the highest priority invasive species at both Yosemite and Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks is Holcus lanatus L. (common velvetgrass), a perennial bunchgrass that invades mid-elevation montane meadows. Despite velvetgrass being a high priority species, there is little information available on control techniques. The goal of this project was to evaluate the short-term response of a single application of common chemical and manual velvetgrass control techniques. The study was conducted at three montane sites in Yosemite National Park. Glyphosate spot-spray treatments were applied at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0% concentrations, and compared with hand pulling to evaluate effects on cover of common velvetgrass, cover of other plant species, and community species richness. Posttreatment year 1 cover of common velvetgrass was 12.1% ± 1.6 in control plots, 6.3% ± 1.5 averaged over the four chemical treatments (all chemical treatments performed similarly), and 13.6% ± 1.7 for handpulled plots. This represents an approximately 50% reduction in common velvetgrass cover in chemically- treated plots recoded posttreatment year 1 and no statistically significant reduction in hand pulled plots compared with controls. However, there was no treatment effect in posttreatment year 2, and all herbicide application rates performed similarly. In addition, there were no significant treatment effects on nontarget species or species richness. These results suggest that for this level of infestation and habitat type, (1) one year of hand pulling is not an effective control method and (2) glyphosate provides some level of control in the short-term without impact to nontarget plant species, but the effect is temporary as a single year of glyphosate treatment is ineffective over a two-year period.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; common velvetgrass, Holcus lanatus L.Management Implications: This study was designed to evaluate short-term effects of a single application of chemical and mechanical control techniques on Holcus lanatus L. (common velvetgrass) cover and nontarget plant cover and species richness. Our results showed that various glyphosate concentrations were equally effective at reducing cover of common velvetgrass, and that there were no statistically significant effects of treatments on nontarget cover and species richness. A one-time spot spray application was effective at reducing common velvetgrass in the post-treatment year 1, but not longer. These spot-spray herbicide treatments, even at the highest concentrations, did not have detrimental effects on nontarget species. This is particularly important where land management objectives are not just to control invasive plant infestations but also to support native species, special status plants, or traditionally used plants (i.e., plants species that are important in ongoing American Indian traditional cultural practices such as those involving ceremony, subsistence and artistry). Despite the lack of herbicide impacts to nontarget species at any of the concentrations evaluated, the lowest concentration (0.5%) would be recommended because higher concentrations were no more effective at controlling velvetgrass. Despite the statistically significant reduction in common velvetgrass cover during posttreatment year 1, 6.3% common velvetgrass cover still remained, and the reduced cover effect was gone by posttreatment year 2. This study suggests that glyphosate treatments could be an option to control common velvetgrass, but one application will not maintain control after the first year. In order to gain long-term control, managers could experiment with glyphosate treatments repeated annually or even multiple times per year to control infestations. Hand pulling common velvetgrass at these densities for only one year was ineffective at controlling common velvetgrass. Moreover, studies have suggested that repeated hand pulling of velvetgrass and the associated soil disturbance could promote local increases in non-native species.";"Jones, Laura J.

Until 2008, house prices, home construction and population growth appeared to be locked in an ever-increasing upward trend. With little historical experience to the contrary, water right market prices similarly appeared to be driven by real estate development. The collapse of the housing market in the last four years provides an opportunity to examine the connection between the real estate and water markets. It is found that Middle Rio Grande Basin water right prices are influenced by housing prices, per capita income in the buyer's county, buyer type, point of diversion, and transaction volume. However, significant price dispersion remains, raising the question of how efficiently this market is currently working.";"Payne, Matthew T.

"AGRIS:US2016210477";"Striga Management through Herbicide Resistance: A Public-Private Partnership in Action";"";"Striga is an indigenous parasitic weed that attacks cereals and other crops in Africa.  In maize croplands alone, Striga infests over 2.3 million ha resulting in 1.6 million tons of grain loss worth US $383 million annually.  An innovative approach to controlling the parasite was to induce herbicide resistance in maize and to coat the seed with herbicide to provide chemical protection from infection.  This breakthrough that was realized after 12 years of collaborative research and development by the International Maize and Wheat Centre (CIMMYT), the Kenya Agricultural Research Center (KARI) and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, is now ready for deployment in Sub-Saharan Africa.  This effort is most advanced in Kenya, where one variety of the Imazapyr-resistant (IR) maize hybrid aptly named Ua Kayongo (Striga Killer) was tested by over 13,000 households and registered for commercial release by Western Seed Company. Compared to a currently recommended commercial hybrid (H513), Ua Kayongo improved maize yields by 1,022 kg ha-1, reduced Striga expression by 81% and increased farmer’s net return by $143 ha-1 (+63%).  This technology occupies a central role in the design of comprehensive Striga Eradication Initiatives in maize fields, but hindrance to achieving this goal has emerged from unlikely sources.  Crop breeders committed to developing alternative, Striga-immune varieties self-indulgently dismiss IR maize as a technological dead-end single gene approach, while “green” interests unfairly label IR-maize a GMO.  A public-private partnership has formed to deploy IR maize to needy African farmers.  Differences in operational approaches are expected among these partners, given their underlying interests and organizational mandates, and it is important that these issues continue to be resolved in a manner that does not lose momentum or shift focus.  Now that Striga has become a preventable disorder in maize fields, it is time to minimize the drama and direct all available resources toward assisting Striga’s victims in Africa.";"Woomer, Paul L.

"AGRIS:US201600091909";"Tropical forest regeneration following land abandonment is driven by primary rainforest distribution in an old pastoral region";"";"CONTEXT: Tropical forest regeneration is increasingly prominent as agro-pastoral lands are abandoned. Regeneration is characterised as favouring ‘marginal’ lands; however, observations of its drivers are often coarse or simple, leaving doubt as to spatial dynamics and causation. OBJECTIVES: We quantified the spatial dynamics of forest regeneration relative to marginality and remnant forest cover in a 3000 km² pastoral region in northern tropical Australia. METHODS: Classification and regression trees related the extent and distribution of regeneration to soil agricultural potential, land-cover history, terrain slope, distance to primary forest, and primary forest fragment size, as defined by aerial photography. RESULTS: Secondary forest extent and distribution overwhelmingly reflect the proximity and size of primary forest fragments. Some 85 % of secondary forest area occurs <1 km of primary forest, and 86 % of secondary forest patches >50 ha are <400 m from primary forest and coincident with historic primary forest fragments. Where primary forest fragments are >8.5 ha, secondary forest area declines less rapidly with increasing distance from primary forest up to 1.5 km. Marginality inferred by soil potential and slope had no bearing on regeneration, except at the coarsest of spatial scales where regeneration is a proxy for primary forest cover. CONCLUSION: Findings underline the need to conserve even modest rainforest patches as propagule reservoirs enabling regeneration. Marginality per se may have a limited role in regeneration. As most secondary forest was an extension of primary forest, its unique conservation value relative to that of primary forest may likewise merit reconsideration.";"Sloan, Sean

"AGRIS:US201600091907";"Differentiating anthropogenic modification and precipitation-driven change on vegetation productivity on the Mongolian Plateau";"";"CONTEXT: The Mongolian Plateau, comprising Inner Mongolia, China (IM) and Mongolia (MG) is undergoing consistent warming and accelerated land cover/land use change. Extensive modifications of water-limited regions can alter ecosystem function and processes; hence, it is important to differentiate the impacts of human activities and precipitation dynamics on vegetation productivity. OBJECTIVES: This study distinguished between human-induced and precipitation-driven changes in vegetation cover on the plateau across biome, vegetation type and administrative divisions. METHODS: Non-parametric trend tests were applied to the time series of vegetation indices (VI) derived from MODIS and AVHRR and precipitation from TRMM and MERRA reanalysis data. VI residuals adjusted for rainfall were obtained from the regression between growing season maximum VI and monthly accumulated rainfall (June–August) and were used to detect human-induced trends in vegetation productivity during 1981–2010. The total livestock and population density trends were identified and then used to explain the VI residual trends. RESULTS: The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were negatively correlated to total livestock density (R² = 0.59 and 0.16, p < 0.05) in MG and positively correlated with total population density (R² = 0.31, p < 0.05) in IM. The slope of precipitation-adjusted EVI and EVI2 residuals were also negatively correlated with goat density (R² = 0.59 and 0.19, p < 0.05) and sheep density in MG (R² = 0.59 and 0.13, p < 0.05) but not in IM. CONCLUSIONS: Some administrative subdivisions in IM and MG showed decreasing trends in VI residuals. These trends could be attributed to increasing livestock or population density and changes in livestock herd composition. Other subdivisions showed increasing trends residuals, suggesting that the vegetation cover increase could be attributed to conservation efforts.";"John, Ranjeet

"AGRIS:US201300878355";"potential of remote sensing for monitoring land cover changes and effects on physical geography in the area of Kayisdagi Mountain and its surroundings (Istanbul)";"";"The effect of land cover change, from natural to anthropogenic, on physical geography conditions has been studied in Kayisdagi Mountain. Land degradation is the most important environmental issue involved in this study. Most forms of land degradation are natural processes accelerated by human activity. Land degradation is a human induced or natural process that negatively affects the ability of land to function effectively within an ecosystem. Environmental degradation from human pressure and land use has become a major problem in the study area because of high population growth, urbanization rate, and the associated rapid depletion of natural resources. When studying the cost of land degradation, it is not possible to ignore the role of urbanization. In particular, a major cause of deforestation is conversion to urban land. The paper reviews the principles of current remote sensing techniques considered particularly suitable for monitoring Kayisdagi Mountain and its surrounding land cover changes and their effects on physical geography conditions. In addition, this paper addresses the problem of how spatially explicit information about degradation processes in the study area rangelands can be derived from different time series of satellite data. The monitoring approach comprises the time period between 1990 and 2005. Satellite remote sensing techniques have proven to be cost effective in widespread land cover changes. Physical geography and particularly natural geomorphologic processes like erosion, mass movement, physical weathering, and chemical weathering features etc. have faced significant unnatural variation.";"Geymen, Abdurrahman

"AGRIS:US201600091902";"Genetic consequences of forest fragmentation by agricultural land in an arboreal marsupial";"";"CONTEXT: Increasing demands on land for agriculture have resulted in large-scale clearance and fragmentation of forests globally. In fragmented landscapes, species that tolerate or exploit the matrix will persist, while those that do not, frequently decline. Knowledge of matrix use is therefore critical to predicting extinction proneness of species in modified landscapes and defining the value of land for conservation management. OBJECTIVES: In a fragmented landscape consisting of seven remnant patches surrounded by agricultural land and a large Eucalyptus forest, we explored (i) population connectivity of common ringtail possums, Pseudocheirus peregrinus, to determine the permeability of the agricultural matrix, and (ii) genetic consequences of forest fragmentation. METHODS: 238 common ringtail possums were screened at 14 microsatellite markers and analysed using a range of genetic techniques. RESULTS: We observed significant genetic differentiation among all patches and limited dispersal through the agricultural matrix, even between neighbouring patches. Consequences of this were a six- to ten-fold increase in genetic dissimilarity over an equivalent geographic distance across patches compared with sites in the continuous forest and a significant reduction in genetic diversity, particularly in patches that were geographically more isolated from their neighbours. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the agricultural matrix has a number of characteristics that make it unsuitable for facilitating movement of possums through this landscape, and recommend several management strategies to mitigate the impacts of fragmentation on this and other arboreal species for their conservation.";"Lancaster, Melanie L.

In addition to providing improved understanding of the longâterm consequences of various management options, the results of these experiments show that positive benefits resulting from some management options are often associated with large tradeâoffs among individual objectives.

"AGRIS:US201400159606";"Species detection vs. habitat suitability: Are we biasing habitat suitability models with remotely sensed data?";"";"Remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used to model habitat suitability for a variety of taxa. We review habitat suitability models (HSMs) developed for both plants and animals that include remote sensing predictor variables to determine how these variables could affect model projections. For models focused on plant species habitat, we find several instances of unintentional bias in HSMs of vegetation due to the inclusion of remote sensing variables. Notably, studies that include continuous remote sensing variables could be inadvertently mapping actual species distribution instead of potential habitat due to unique spectral or temporal characteristics of the target species. Additionally, HSMs including categorical classifications are rarely explicit about assumptions of habitat suitability related to land cover, which could lead to unintended exclusion of potential habitat due to current land use. Although we support the broader application of remote sensing in general, we caution developers of HSMs to be aware of introduced model bias. These biases are more likely to arise when remote sensing variables are added to models simply because they improve accuracy, rather than considering how they affect the model results and interpretation. When including land cover classifications as predictors, we recommend that modellers provide more explicit descriptions of how habitat is defined (e.g., is deforested land considered suitable for trees?). Further, we suggest that continuous remote sensing variables should only be included in habitat models if authors can demonstrate that their inclusion characterizes potential habitat rather than actual species distribution. Use of the term ‘habitat suitability model’ rather than ‘species distribution model’ could reduce confusion about modelling goals and improve communication between the remote sensing and ecological modelling communities.";"Bradley, Bethany A.

Evaluation of the magnitude, composition, and temporal and spatial distributions of amphibian road-kills is a key step for mitigation planning, especially in peri-urban reserves. Once a month for 16 months, we surveyed, on foot, a 4.4 km section of state road ERS-389 bordering the Itapeva reserve in the southern Atlantic Forest. We recorded 1433 anuran road-kills and estimated a mortality rate of 9002 road-kills/km/year. The species most often recorded were the largest ones: Leptodactylus latrans, Rhinella icterica, Leptodactylus gracilis and Hypsiboas faber; 54.5% of the carcasses could not be identified. Anuran mortality was concentrated in summer, and was associated with temperature, rainfall and photoperiod. Leptodactylus road-kills were strongly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably because of its high abundance during the entire study period. Road-kill hotspots differed for anurans as a group and for single species, and we found an association among spatial patterns of mortality and types of land cover, distance from the nearest waterbody, roadside ditches, and artificial light. Traffic should be banned temporarily during periods of high mortality, which can be forecasted based on meteorological data. A comprehensive mitigation approach should take into account hotspots of all anuran records, and also of target species for selecting locations for amphibian passages and fencing. Roadside ditches, artificial waterbodies, and conventional street lights should be reduced as much as possible, since they may represent ecological traps for anuran populations.";"Coelho, Igor Pfeifer

This article explores the use of hedonic pricing as a tool for eliciting these values. We take a case study approach, valuing several services provided by ecosystems, namely aesthetic quality (views), access to outdoor recreation, and the benefits provided by tree cover in Dakota County, Minnesota, USA. Our results indicate that these services are valued by local residents and that hedonic pricing can be used to elicit at least a portion of this value. We find that many aspects of the aesthetic environment significantly impact home sale prices. Total view area as well as the areas of some land-cover types (water and lawn) in views positively influenced home sale prices while views of impervious surfaces generally negatively influenced home sale price. Access to outdoor recreation areas significantly and positively influenced home sale prices as did tree cover in the neighborhood surrounding a home. These results illustrate the ability of hedonic pricing to identify partial values for ecosystem services and amenities in a manner that is highly relevant to local and regional planning. These values could be used to increase policy-maker and public awareness of ecosystem services and could improve their consideration in planning and policy decisions.";"Sander, Heather A.

"AGRIS:US201301620457";"Practical Challenges in Private Stewardship of Rangeland Ecosystems: Yellow Starthistle Control in Sierra Nevadan Foothills";"";"Private landowners are often de facto stewards of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In California's Sierra Nevada foothills, ranchers frequently present the only defense against biological invasions in private rangelands. Although ranchers' land management goals (e.g., the desire to control invasive species) can be consistent with ecosystem protection, practical constraints often limit their success. Considerable research on the invasive weed, yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.), has produced numerous control strategies. Nevertheless, the range of this noxious weed continues to increase. We used surveys and interviews to document the weed control efforts of 202 ranchers and to identify practical limitations to their efficacy. Overall, 86% of ranchers who had experienced yellow starthistle infestation had attempted control, using one or more of 19 methods. Early response reduced negative effects from yellow starthistle. Control methods learned from agricultural advisors were reported more effective than those learned elsewhere. Limitations to yellow starthistle control in our study population resulted from incomplete information regarding control methods, complexity of weed control in heterogeneous landscapes, inconsistent application of methods, and lack of long-term planning for weed control. Such hindrances make it difficult for landowners to implement control methods promoted by researchers. This gap between science and practice contributes to the continued increase of yellow starthistle within the study region. To shrink this gap, researchers and agricultural advisors can incorporate environmental heterogeneity into applied agricultural research, use land stewards' knowledge and experience, and increase public education.";"Aslan, Clare E.

The work was conducted to evaluate the increase in sedimentation rate during Medieval and modern time periods. Correlation of sediments along the current channel belt allows identification of two most important synchronous changes in the channel structure over the past 1300years: in the 13th century and at the end of the 16th century. These changes could be related to central European climatic extremes rather than to land cover/land use practises. Analysis of the pollen record in peaty deposits at the floodplain edge allows excluded dramatic deforestation in Medieval times. Maps of the area from the last five centuries revealed direct and indirect signs of past avulsions and clearly show how the original multichannel system was transformed into a single meandering channel in the early 20th century. The extrapolated aggradation rate (net vertical accretion of floodplain fines except for levee sediments) increased from 0.2–0.3cm/year in 700AD to 0.3–0.4cm/year in 2000AD depending on the grain size of the sediment. This is the smallest yet reported enhancement of siliclastic deposition, although Morava River watershed has been intensively used for agriculture and its land cover has changed in a manner similar to west and central European rivers.";"Matys Grygar, T.

In this paper the productivity performance of the mature dairy industry in the Waikato region is investigated, using panel data at the sub-regional level from 1994 to 2007. Overall we show that, under a range of specifications, productivity growth independent of increasing land use and herd numbers has been significantly below the four percent industry target.

"AGRIS:US2016209209";"Using Land to Promote Urban Economic Growth in China";"";"This paper investigates the economic incentives for urban spatial expansion in China by estimating the value of urban land using an econometric model applied to data from the 220 largest Chinese cities for the period 1996-2003. The results are consistent with the proposition that the rapid rate of urban spatial expansion resulted from a combination of fiscal pressure on local governments and governance reforms that gave local governments greater control over land and investment policies. The estimated parameters of the model indicate that urban land generates far more than income per unit area than agriculture in eastern and central China, suggesting that local governments can profit substantially from conversion of farmland to urban use. The value of urban land in those regions increased in the period after 1999, an outcome that could be attributable to increased demand for land to accommodate economic growth, delayed development of land set aside speculatively into economic/industrial development zones, and/or implementation of stricter administrative controls on farmland conversion that restricted the supply of land for urban uses. Urban land appeared to have a low economic value in western China, a region that, taken as a whole, has lagged in terms of economic growth. The estimated parameters of the model are consistent with findings of previous studies regarding returns on foreign direct investment, domestic Chinese investment, and labor productivity.";"Ding, Chengri

The Japanese government subsequently outlined an evacuation zone around the power plant, and all residents were evacuated. In the absence of cropland or urban vegetation management, land cover was expected to change. The changes in vegetation cover following the nuclear disaster are presented using long-term time series data obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Utilizing MODIS 250 m spatial resolution observations, clear signals of vegetation changes were detected following the disaster in 2011. The areas affected were non-forest regions (mostly paddy fields) within the 20 km radius evacuation zone around the power plant. Multi-year comparisons of vegetation seasonality indicated that the changes can be explained by the natural succession of abandoned cropland. The affected area within the 20 km radius is equivalent to about 20% of the total area affected by the tsunami.";"Sekizawa, Ryo

Model-based surface reflectance predictions (e.g. 6S – Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) are highly dependent on the adjustment of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data. For regions with no or insufficient spatial and temporal coverage of meteorological ground measurements, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived AOT data are a valuable alternative, especially with regard to the dynamics of atmospheric conditions. In this study, atmospheric correction strategies were assessed based on the change in standard deviation (σ) compared to the raw data and also by machine learning land-cover classification accuracies. For three Landsat 8 OLI (acquired in 2013) and two RapidEye (acquired in 2010 and 2014) scenes, seven different correction strategies were tested over an agricultural area in southeast Ireland. Visibility calculated from daily spatial averaged TERRA-MODIS estimates (1° × 1° Aerosol Product) served as input for the atmospheric correction. In almost all cases the standard deviation of the raw data is reduced after incorporation of terrain correction, compared to the atmospheric-corrected data. ATCOR®-IDL-based correction decreases the standard deviation almost consistently (ranging from −0.3 to −26.7). The 6S implementation in GRASS GIS showed a tendency of increasing the variation in the data, especially for the RapidEye data. No major differences in overall accuracies (OAs) and kappa values were observed between the three machine learning classification approaches. The results indicate that the ATCOR®-IDL-based correction and MODIS parameterization methods are able to decrease the standard deviation and are therefore an appropriate approach to approximate the top-of-canopy reflectance.";"Raab, Christoph

Experimental results showed that the proposed framework could effectively extract the change nodes and change pixels, with correctness of 85.82% and completeness of 84.78%, outperforming the time-series-only (non-spatial) method, as well as traditional classification methods, and the same framework using shorter Landsat TM image time series.";"Wang, Yafei

A regional steady-state lake water balance model was developed that uses simple, yet easily estimated or obtained, data to generate an aridity index (potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio) to predict changes in lake basin area to lake surface area ratio, a non-dimensional lake-basin property that can be easily obtained from digital maps. In the model, lake water balance components include precipitation, lake evaporation, and runoff into the lake. Both basin runoff and evaporation are incorporated in the analytical model using an empirical equation (based on the Budyko hypothesis) that utilizes the aridity index and a calibration parameter to account for vegetative influence. Observed records of lake to basin area ratio, as a function of their evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio, for a range of climates and land cover conditions, were plotted and compared to a family of calculated steady-state curves. Dividing the domain of calculated curves into regions of permanent, land-cover change sensitive, and ephemeral lakes allows for comparison of model predicted lake classification with lake sediment records. The impact of land cover and climate change on lake persistence is also discussed. The model is most applicable for closed basin lakes in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid environments. The model can be used: (1) as a diagnostic tool to analyze lake response to climate change; (2) to assess environmental and anthropogenic factors leading to transient lake response; and (3) as a paleoclimatic research tool, to identify lakes that can potentially provide high-resolution paleorecords of water balance.";"Bracht-Flyr, Brandi

Here we present a transferable framework to model forest cover by major plant functional type using aerial photos, multi-date Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) imagery, and topographic variables. We developed probability of occurrence models for deciduous broad-leaved forest and needle-leaved evergreen forest using logistic regression in the southern portion of the Wyoming Basin Ecoregion. The model outputs were combined into a synthesis map depicting deciduous and coniferous forest cover type. We evaluated the models and synthesis map using a field-validated, independent data source. Results showed strong relationships between forest cover and model variables, and the synthesis map was accurate with an overall correct classification rate of 0.87 and Cohen’s kappa value of 0.81. The results suggest our method adequately captures the functional type, size, and distribution pattern of forest cover in a spatially heterogeneous landscape.";"Assal, Timothy J.

These images cover most of the world's land surface except Antarctica and Greenland. Most of these images came from the United States Geological Survey in level L1T (orthorectified). Four classifiers that were freely available were employed, including the conventional maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), J4.8 decision tree classifier, Random Forest (RF) classifier and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A total of 91,433 training samples were collected by traversing each scene and finding the most representative and homogeneous samples. A total of 38,664 test samples were collected at preset, fixed locations based on a globally systematic unaligned sampling strategy. Two software tools, Global Analyst and Global Mapper developed by extending the functionality of Google Earth, were used in developing the training and test sample databases by referencing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index (MODIS EVI) time series for 2010 and high resolution images from Google Earth. A unique land-cover classification system was developed that can be crosswalked to the existing United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) land-cover classification system as well as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) system. Using the four classification algorithms, we obtained the initial set of global land-cover maps. The SVM produced the highest overall classification accuracy (OCA) of 64.9% assessed with our test samples, with RF (59.8%), J4.8 (57.9%), and MLC (53.9%) ranked from the second to the fourth. We also estimated the OCAs using a subset of our test samples (8629) each of which represented a homogeneous area greater than 500 m × 500 m. Using this subset, we found the OCA for the SVM to be 71.5%. As a consistent source for estimating the coverage of global land-cover types in the world, estimation from the test samples shows that only 6.90% of the world is planted for agricultural production. The total area of cropland is 11.51% if unplanted croplands are included. The forests, grasslands, and shrublands cover 28.35%, 13.37%, and 11.49% of the world, respectively.

The objectives of this study were to compare impacts of public forage losses on ranches in areas experiencing rapid growth (Routt County) and minimal growth (Moffat County) in Colorado.  Thirty-five personal interviews  obtained detailed cost-and-return information on public, leased, and private land.  Enterprise budgets for seven distinct ranch averages were entered into a linear programming (LP) model to calculate impacts on ranches of public forage reductions of 25%, 50%, and 100%.  Changes in net ranch returns and livestock production reflect the economic impact of policy changes.  Grazing alternatives to hypothetical reductions in public grazing chosen by the ranchers were applied in the program to mimic rancher decisions.  The study found, as would be expected, that larger ranches with more public forage dependency would be the most affected by public forage losses.  Those with fewer sources of alternative forage, and ranches with low costs and high returns, experienced more difficulty in coping with the grazing reductions on public land.  Routt County, with its higher dependence on public forage and minimal alternative forage sources, would be more affected by federal forage reduction than Moffat County.";"Rowe, Helen Ivy

This paper analyzes to what extent migration patterns influence land-cover and land-use change at the watershed level. A RS-GIS and statistical approach was used to quantify and analyze both land-cover change and change in population per spatial unit. It was hypothesized that migration should exert a strong effect on land-cover change. The exercise was carried out in the Basin of Lake Cuitzeo, Michoacan, in Central Mexico, an area of high emigration to the USA, albeit showing a net increase in its total population. The expansion of scrubland areas at the expense of rain-fed agricultural land is associated with the abandonment of agricultural land with poor soils.

The forests of the East Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, are internationally recognized as one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems. However, despite past conservation efforts they face an ongoing threat from clearing for smallholder agriculture. One potential solution is a „payments for ecosystem services' (PES) program, where farmers are paid to protect forest that lies on their farms. To determine the design of PES program most likely to attract participation, careful documentation of farmer's policy preferences is required. We quantify these preferences and determine willingness to accept values using a choice experiment approach. Notable results are that payment for manure fertilizer (representing an investment in farm productivity) was highly effective at motivating farmer support, a group payment was highly ineffective, and that minimal program conditionality was not always preferred.

Factors that lead to poor acceptance of SAS by farmers can be broadly categorized as system specific factors and general factors that affect all systems commonly. This paper argues that although the general factors are less apparent, indirect, and difficult to recognize, they could be more important in Sri Lanka's case as the poor acceptance exists with many systems. The paper briefly discusses five such factors suggesting that major adjustments in the overall agriculture system are inevitable if the benefits of SAS are to be reaped by society. Such adjustments include strengthening of farmer participation at all levels; modification of research and extension systems and changing their priorities; proper land use and planning and screening of existing policies for their inconsistencies.

Monthly water samples were monitored for enzymatic activity (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, alkaline phosphatase, and substrate utilization), chemical and physical analysis (suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon, pH, nitrate, ammonium, orthophosphate, and electrical conductivity), phytoplankton and bacterioplankton populations. All of these parameters were influenced by the intrinsic nature of the watersheds, with some parameters shifting as management changes were imposed on the surrounding agricultural fields. Thighman lake water typically maintained the highest suspended solid levels, dissolved organic carbon, algal and bacterial populations, enzyme activities, and heterotrophic metabolic indexes. Introduction of reduced tillage practices and glyphosate-resistant crops in Beasley watershed resulted in lower levels of suspended sediments, but had minimal impact on overall ranking of biochemical or microbiological properties. Likewise, conversion of Deep Hollow watershed from reduced tillage to conventional tillage had little effect on suspended sediment, and most microbial activity parameters remained intermediate. However, canonical analysis indicated dynamic changes in the microbial community, suggesting that biological parameters of lake water quality were affected by changes in crop and soil management practices.";"Zablotowicz, R.M.

Bird species dwelling in woodland habitats that are embedded in agriculture-dominated landscapes are expected to be particularly sensitive to the loss of connectivity. This study aimed to determine the role of landscape connectivity in woodland bird species richness, abundance, and community similarity in north-east Brittany (north-west France). An exhaustive woodland selection protocol was carried out to minimize the effects of woodland size on the response variables. Connectivity of the woodland and forest network in the study area was evaluated using graph-theory, accounting for matrix permeability, and a characteristic median natal dispersal distance at the community level based on the bird species pool recorded in the sampled woodlands. Information-theoretic model selection, controlling for woodland size in all the cases, depicted the response of woodland birds at the community level to the connectivity of agriculture-dominated landscapes. On average, the sampled woodlands (n = 25) contained 15.5 Â± 2.4 bird species, with an abundance of 25.1 Â± 3.9, and had highly similar bird communities (species composition and proportion); eight species represented 57% of total abundance and were present in at least 22 woodlands. The performance of models improved when using effective, rather than Euclidean, interpatch distances in the connectivity assessment. Landscape connectivity was only significantly related to similarity of proportional species composition. Large woodlands contained communities with more similar species proportions in an inhospitable agricultural landscape matrix than in a more permeable one. Woodland size was the most relevant factor determining species abundance, indicating that the bird population sizes are primarily proportional to the local habitat availability. Connectivity in relation to landscape matrix permeability did not seem to induce the flow of woodland-dependent bird species that are dominant in the community but rather of matrix-dwelling bird species that are less dependent on woodland patch area. In conclusion, both habitat conservation and restoration (i.e., amount and quality), in combination with permeable landscape structures (such as heterogeneous land cover mosaics), are advocated for community level conservation strategies.";"Gil-Tena, A.

Spatial autocorrelation was found in the form of spatial lag dependence, not spatial error dependence. When spatial lag dependence is explicitly taken into account, on average the impact is reduced by 18%.  The magnitude of the spatial autoregressive parameter was about 0.2 for the 1-mile distance band, meaning one-fifth of the house value could be explained by the values of the neighboring houses.";"Kim, Jungik

"AGRIS:US201400187776";"Increasing Shrub Use by Livestock in a World with Less Grass";"";"Much of the world's rangelands are dominated by woody species. Competing land uses and continued encroachment of woody species into non-woody dominated rangelands have reduced grasslands in many parts of the world. Land use conversions to fuel and feed global populations, especially for increasing numbers of middle class people seeking broader, meat-based diets, will certainly continue. Halting and/or reversing further encroachment of woody species into grasslands is slow, expensive, and in some cases, not possible. Yet, global livestock numbers continue to increase to meet the growing demand for red meat and other livestock products. How do we reconcile a world with less grass and the concurrent increased demand for forages to feed livestock, either in extensive rangeland production systems or intensive confined feeding systems? Strategies and mechanisms are needed to safely enhance shrub use by ruminants in order to capitalize on a presently underutilized forage resource. Such strategies could provide important means for rural communities to adapt to changing land cover and climate.";"Estell, R. E.

The aim of this work is to quantify the role of biophysical factors in constraining the trajectories of land abandonment and urbanization in the last 50 years. A habitat suitability model borrowed from animal ecology was used to analyze the ecological niche of the following LULCC trajectories occurred in Emilia-Romagna (northern Italy) during 1954â2008: (i) land abandonment (LA) and (ii) urbanization (URB), both from agricultural areas (URB_agr) and from semi-natural areas (URB_for). Results showed that the different LULCC trajectories were driven by different combinations of biophysical factors, such as climate, topography and soil quality. In particular, slope and elevation resulted as the main driving factors for rural processes, while slope and temperatures resulted as the main constraints underlying urban processes. This approach may represent a conceptual and technical step toward the systematic assessment of LULCC processes, thus providing an effective support tool to inform decision makers about land use transformations, their underlying causes, as well as their possible implications.";"Bajocco, S.

Such conversion of land use type also promotes remediation of the polluted environment. Soil microbes reflect soil function and are therefore considered an essential component of ecosystem restoration. To evaluate the environmental effects of converting atrazine polluted farmland to secondary forest, we determined soil chemical properties, soil bacterial communities and their responses to three types of land use (primary forest, PF; secondary forest, SF; farm land, FL) in Wuying, China. Our results showed that soil organic matter significantly decreases in the order PF>SF>FL. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing revealed that the soil bacterial diversity level remained unchanged. However between FL and the two forested sites, we observed an increase of Actinobacteria, Î²-proteobacteria and Firmicutes; and a decrease of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, while in SF the bacterial community structure was similar to PF. We conclude that reforestation permits bacterial community, resetting from FL back to a state that resembles natural conditions. In addition, 20 years of natural attenuation degraded soil atrazine residues in SF but traces remained in the soil. Reforestation generally resulted in favorable ecological impacts on soil quality and the bacterial community compared with active farm fields.";"Liu, Xinxin

However, this monitoring rarely extends to the wider countryside, and there is no obligation for private landowners to detect trends in habitat condition. Using the diffusion of innovations model as an analytical framework we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews to consider the uptake of habitat impact assessment methods throughout a community involved in private land use pursuits in Scotland. It was found that although the community as a whole recognises the benefits of habitat impact assessments there are a number of barriers to their uptake, including the complexity of data gathering and interpretation, and uncertainty around who should be responsible for the conduct of assessments. Analysing the uptake of an innovation at an early stage, rather than retrospectively as is commonly done, highlights the potential for non-adoption and could therefore inform the reinvention of the innovation. In this instance reinvention could lead to more appropriate monitoring methods, which, if taken up, could reduce the need for legislative intervention in situations where both public and private interests need to be considered.";"Maffey, Georgina

Hydrology and nutrient loads are, in turn, influenced by socio-economic factors such as human habitation, water abstraction and land-management, within their catchments. Models provide a means of linking these different domains and also of forecasting and evaluating the effects of different management scenarios on lakes. This paper describes the application of such models to Loweswater, a well-studied lake with water quality problems in the English Lake District, where a community-based approach to catchment management is being undertaken. Three models were linked. Firstly, PLANET (Planning Land Applications of Nutrients for Efficiency and the environmenT), an ‘off the shelf’ farm nutrient budgeting model, was supplemented by local information on septic tanks and used to produce an annual nutrient load to the lake. Secondly, GWLF (Generalized Watershed Loading Function), a generic nutrient runoff model, was used to generate daily nutrient runoff values using input from PLANET plus additional information on land-cover, air temperature and rainfall within the catchment. Thirdly PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange), driven by input from GWLF and locally measured meteorology, was used to forecast the abundance of different algal types within the lake. The linked models were used to describe the current impact of catchment management on lake water quality, validated by in situ measurements, and to explore the potential impact of a number of alternative catchment management scenarios. Issues surrounding the use of generic modelling applications for catchment management and relevance for stakeholders living in and/or managing land within the catchment are discussed.";"Norton, Lisa

Two sets of panchromatic aerial photographs (1957 and 1982) and a Landsat TM image (2001) were the main input data from which three land-use and land-cover maps were produced by employing geographical information systems/remote sensing techniques. These data were complemented by some socio-economic data that were generated by using household survey, key-informant interview and group discussion methods. The results show that in regard to land-use and land-cover, the major change has been the reduction of areas under natural vegetation cover and expansion of open grassland, cultivated areas and settlements. Over the four and a half decades considered, areas of forest and dense tree cover and shrub grassland decreased by 64 and 6%, respectively. Forest and dense tree cover experienced the greatest change; from accounting for ∼9% of the total area of the watershed in 1957 to only ∼3% in 2001. In general, much of the de-vegetation occurred between 1982 and 2001. Cropland and rural settlement showed a small but consistent increase between 1957 and 2001. Riparian vegetation decreased during the first period, but increased almost to the same level during the second period by gaining land from the other land-use and land-cover types. The observed LUCCs were driven by a combination of proximate and underlying causes. These include increasing demographic pressure and associated demands on environmental resources, widespread rural poverty and inadequate management of common property resources owing to poorly defined ownership arrangements. There is a need for short-term and long-term strategies to ensure sustainable land management and agricultural development in the watershed.";"Bewket, Woldeamlak

Remote sensing and other data are used to globally characterize land as marginal based on predominantly biophysical features that render it ‘non-competitive’ for the purpose of commercial food agriculture. This paper explores the limitations of current geospatial technologies in determining whether marginal land is appropriate for bioenergy crops given that (i) people often have intentions behind land use that are not reflected in most routinely collected remote sensing data and (ii) a remote (and spatio-temporally static) characterization of marginality is unable to capture the shifting character of what constitutes marginality in an economic sense and is therefore a non-sequitur for guiding land use decisions on the ground. This paper also explores the latent values embedded in the ontology of a macro-scale ‘marginal land’ land cover class and advances the notion that ‘marginal land’ as an artificial spatial construct serves to re-frame land in a way that neglects socio-ecological processes in order to re-frame it in support of principles based in resource productivism.";"Nalepa, Rachel A.

Nearly all of it is dedicated to so-called ‘agro forestry’ projects that appear to be short-term salvage logging projects justified by the promise of a purely virtual form of large-scale agricultural production.

"AGRIS:US201600014026";"Green multiculturalism: articulations of ethnic and environmental politics in a Colombian ‘black community’";"";"This paper analyzes the intersection of two parallel developments that have had a curious impact on agrarian politics in Colombia: on the one hand, attempts to appropriate land for ‘green’ ends such as biofuel production, which have become ubiquitous all across Latin America, and on the other, the implementation of multicultural reforms, which in Colombia resulted in the collective titling of more than five million hectares of land for ‘black communities’. Although these two developments can be read as contradictory – with ‘green grabs’ threatening ethnic groups’ territorial rights and multicultural reforms purportedly safeguarding them – I argue that, together, they produce a unique political articulation which I term ‘green multiculturalism’. My analysis of oil-palm cultivation in a ‘black community’ in southwestern Colombia reveals three interrelated consequences. First, I suggest that green multiculturalism produces ‘black communities’ as ‘green’ collective subjects charged not only with being wardens of nature, but also bearers of the responsibility to right environmental wrongs. Second, I note that the agrarian practices associated with oil-palm cultivation act as disciplining technologies that seek to transform local rationalities into entrepreneurial ones.

"AGRIS:US201600014027";"Tourism and the politics of the global land grab in Tanzania: markets, appropriation and recognition";"";"This paper examines how tourism as a form of land use and economic development is a critical site of struggle over the meaning of neoliberalism, landscape and land rights in northern Tanzania. I examine two tourism arrangements in Loliondo: joint ventures between expatriate-owned ecotourism companies and predominately Maasai villages; and the leasing of a hunting concession on village lands by the central government to a powerful foreign investor from the United Arab Emirates. Despite the fundamental role of foreign investors in appropriating resources and surplus value from regional landscapes in each of these cases, I argue that the Maasai in Loliondo see contemporary land grabbing as firmly situated in state claims to property and territory. The Maasai in Loliondo have come to think of the market, expressed through their direct relationships with ecotourism investors, as the most promising space to legitimize and secure land rights and access to resources. Loliondo, an area in northern Tanzania bordering the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, has become one of the most important sites for tourism development in Tanzania. This region is home to the iconic Maasai people, who practice pastoralism and are part of what attracts tourists to Tanzania. These Maasai face increased pressure to assert their local vision of a landscape and their ability to commoditize it. I situate current land struggles within the political economy of tourism in Loliondo and show how different articulations of market–state–community become both materially and symbolically meaningful. Ultimately, I argue that the Maasai retain faith in market-based relationships in spite of increasingly limited room to maneuver.";"Gardner, Benjamin";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land use;land rights;right of access";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"TZA;ARE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014027";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.666973";"";"";"";"377-402"

A case study in southern Italy: the Tusciano River catchment";"";"The ESAs (Environmentally sensitive areas) procedure was recently developed in the framework of MEDALUS European project to identify desertification-sensitive areas and used in many Mediterranean countries (Greece, Portugal, Italy, Egypt). The identification of areas sensitive to desertification by using the ESAs model was carried out in the Tusciano River basin (261� km²) located in southern Italy (Campania region). All data characterizing the four groups of parameters related to soil quality, climate quality, vegetation quality and management quality were introduced in a geographical database, and superimposed using a GIS. A sensitivity analysis highlighted the impact of desertification on the river Tusciano catchment, highly diversified in terms of morphological, geological, climatic and land use features. The results of the ESAs model, showing that more than half of the area is sensitive to desertification, were compared with those related to soil loss, achieved by Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, based approximately on the same environmental factors. Nevertheless, ESAs procedure considers a wider range of parameters, allowing to characterize in greater detail the catchment in terms of climate, geomorphology, vegetation cover and socio-economic features. The drawn map therefore characterizes the sensitivity to erosion/desertification of the Tusciano catchment and can be regarded as a synthesis-sensitivity map, showing the areas with higher vulnerability on which mitigation measures should be focused.";"De Paola, F.

"AGRIS:US201500217769";"Forest cover, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat: policy review and modeling of tradeoffs among land-use change scenarios";"";"Local and regional governments have developed climate action plans with significant implications for forests and wildlife. The effectiveness of climate mitigation through forest carbon sequestration depends on understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC). Few studies project future LCLUC effects on forest carbon sequestration, and even fewer examine the resulting consequences for forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. First, we asked what forest-relevant climate mitigation strategies have been identified in US state climate mitigation plans, and do they consider implications for wildlife habitat and forest connectivity? Second, for Wisconsin, a partially forested state, what are the effects of three future LCLUC scenarios on afforestation, forest loss, carbon sequestration and storage, forest connectivity, and wildlife habitat? The 35 US states with climate mitigation plans recommended woody biomass for biofuels or energy production (27 states), forest loss prevention (24 states), and afforestation (17 states). Most plans (24 states) anticipated positive wildlife impacts while 7 plans indicated potential negative wildlife impacts from biomass energy; only 3 plans anticipated tradeoffs among afforestation and energy production. A LCLUC model for Wisconsin revealed substantial local variation in potential afforestation and forest loss, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat across LCLUC scenarios that range from no change in current conditions (Static Forest) to maximum afforestation potential (All Forest). Projected increases in forest cover under the Dynamic Forest scenario equated to 0.41TgC sequestered per year, or 1.3% of Wisconsin's emissions of 33TgC per year. Potential increases in core forest area and connectivity would increase habitat for 60 forest-associated species of greatest conservation need, but may decrease habitat for 48 grassland-associated species of greatest conservation need. These results indicate the importance of synergistic evaluation of multiple policy goals and LCLUC scenarios to examine tradeoffs and spatial dynamics of climate change mitigation strategies.";"Rittenhouse, Chadwick D.

Daily sediment load and flow data from 1950 to 2008 were collected from Yichang hydrometric station. The annual sediment load series was segmented by heuristic segmentation algorithm in 1986 and 2003, and the multi-year mean values of the three phases were 5.28� ×� 10⁸, 3.89� ×� 10⁸ and 0.57� ×� 10⁸� t, respectively. One change point was found by cross wavelet transform in 2003 when the cross wavelet power became insignificant, which indicates the interruption of the common annual cycle of the sediment load and flow series. The sediment regime from 1986 to 2002 was altered by a total of 41� % compared with the regime from 1950 to 1985. It may be mainly attributed to numerous dams constructed in the tributaries, the Gezhouba Dam constructed in the mainstream, and land use and land cover change, e.g., the increased grassland with a coverage density larger than 50� %. The sediment regime alteration after 2003, assessed to be a total of 83� %, may be mainly attributed to the Three Gorges Reservoir. It breaks the natural process of sediment transport, reduces sediment concentration and releases clear water to the downstream which may result in some environmental problems, e.g., limited nutrients availability, river bed erosion, benthic habitat destruction, etc. The assessment of sediment regime alteration may provide some references for the environmental management and conservation of the Yangtze River.";"Huang, Feng

"AGRIS:US201400063521";"Timber harvesting as ongoing disturbance in a landscape of diverse ownership";"";"Although the northeastern US includes extensive areas of aggrading forest, uncertainty regarding the intensity and pattern of forest harvesting hampers an understanding of important ecological processes and characteristics such as carbon and nitrogen storage, habitat quality, and forest dynamics, and impedes regional conservation and management planning. Due to the complex ownership pattern dominated by thousands of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners and the difficulty of detecting selective logging using remote sensing, details of the harvesting regime remain largely unknown to the scientific and policy communities. To examine the value of statewide regulatory data for Massachusetts as a unique source of this critical information, we analyzed 17 years of timber harvest data gathered for regulatory purposes for a 168,000 ha forested landscape in Massachusetts that is the focus of concerted conservation planning and intensive study of landscape and ecosystem pattern and process. The North Quabbin Region is heavily wooded with a complicated ownership pattern dominated by over 2500 NIPF owners, three state agencies, and diverse conservation and municipal holdings. The extent and intensity of harvesting were surprising, with an annual disturbance rate of 1.5% and a mean intensity of 44.7 m3 ha−1 (approximately one-fourth of average stand volume). The predominant form of harvesting was selective removal of commercially valuable tree sizes, grades and species (e.g., Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus). The spatial pattern of logging was random with regards to major physical, biological, or cultural factors. However, logging was strongly related to landowner class. NIPF owners control 60% of the forest area and were responsible for 64.1% of harvest area, but the highest logging intensity (volume per area harvested; 69.3 m3 ha−1) among major landowners was conducted by the state agency responsible for managing southern New England’s largest conservation property, the watershed of Boston’s drinking reservoir. This regime of chronic disturbance is occurring over the entire landscape and exerting a major influence on forest composition, dynamics, and habitat quality. However, dispersed selective harvesting is largely unnoticed by residents, is routinely overlooked by ecologists and conservationists, and would remain unrecognized in the absence of this previously unused regulatory data. These results identify the value of regional regulatory spatial information to estimate ecological trends and to assist in conservation planning. Given similarities among ownership and forest patterns for much of the northeastern US, we expect that the broad findings of this study to have regional application.";"Kittredge, David B. Jr.

Loglinear models were fitted to drought class transitions derived from standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized runoff index (SRI) time series to find which series was more suitable for hydrological drought class prediction 1 and 2 months ahead, respectively. Expected frequencies for two consecutive transitions between drought classes were first calculated, and based on this the predicted drought classes 1 and 2 months ahead were obtained. The results showed that despite the contingency tables of drought class transitions presented the maintenance of the precedent drought class, results of three-dimensional loglinear modeling presented good results when comparing predicted and observed drought classes. Only for a few cases predictions did not fully match the observed drought class, mainly for 2-month lead and when the SRI values are near the limit of the severity class predicted by SRI time series. Based on the correlation analysis of SPI and SRI, we presented the well-known method of hydrological drought class prediction by SPI time series. It was found that, using loglinear regression method, the accuracy of predictions for 2-month lead predicted by SPI time series was higher than those predicted by SRI time series. When we divided the SPI and SRI time series into 2 sub-periods (pre- and post-1980 where land cover changed), we got the same drought class prediction as that predicted by the entire SPI and SRI time series, which illustrated that changes in land use did not affect predictions of hydrological drought classes in the Luanhe river basin. It could be concluded that loglinear prediction of drought class transitions is a useful tool for short term hydrological drought warning, and the results could provide significant information for water resources managers and policy makers to mitigate drought effects.";"Li, Jianzhu

The increased use of mineral fertiliser may dramatically improve the food balance of many countries and result in lower food prices, higher food supply and consumption, and improved food security and nutritional status. In Benin, West Africa, political measures to improve farmers' access to fertiliser are biased in favour of cotton production. This article simulates the impact of universal tax exemptions for fertiliser use on crop yields, food balances, and the use of land resources for the most important staple crops in Benin using a crop growth model and an agricultural sector model. The simulation results indicate that tax exemptions on fertiliser use could have positive effects on physical productivity and would increase food security until 2025 as compared to a baseline scenario. At the same time, the pressure on land resources would not be aggravated, so that better access to fertiliser may help to curb excessive cropland expansion in Benin.";"Kuhn, Arnim

II: Economic assessment of CO₂ abatement through the use of phytoremediation crops for renewable energy production";"";"Phytoremediation could be a sustainable remediation alternative for conventional remediation technologies. However, its implementation on a commercial scale remains disappointing. To emphasize its sustainability, this paper examines whether and how the potential economic benefit of CO₂ abatement for different crops used for phytoremediation or sustainable land management purposes could promote phytotechnologies. Our analysis is based on a case study in the Campine region, where agricultural soils are contaminated with mainly cadmium. We use Life Cycle Analysis to show for the most relevant crops (willow (Salix spp), energy maize (Zea mays), and rapeseed (Brassica napus)), that phytoremediation, used for renewable energy production, could abate CO₂. Converting this in economic numbers through the Marginal Abatement Cost of CO₂ (€ 20 ton⁻¹) we can integrate this in the economic analysis to compare phytoremediation crops among each other, and phytoremediation with conventional technologies. The external benefit of CO₂ abatement when using phytoremediation crops for land management ranges between € 55 and € 501 per hectare. The purpose of these calculations is not to calculate a subsidy for phytoremediation. There is no reason why one would prefer phytoremediation crops for renewable energy production over “normal” biomass. Moreover, subsidies for renewable energy already exist. Therefore, we should not integrate these numbers in the economic analysis again. However, these numbers could contribute to making explicit the competitive advantage of phytoremediation compared to conventional remediation technologies, but also add to a more sustainably funded decision on which crop should be grown on contaminated land.";"Witters, N.

"AGRIS:US201301707478";"Future of Tropical Species on a Warmer Planet";"";"Modern global temperature and land cover and projected future temperatures suggest that tropical forest species will be particularly sensitive to global warming. Given a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, fully 75% of the tropical forests present in 2000 will experience mean annual temperatures in 2100 that are greater than the highest mean annual temperature that supports closed-canopy forest today. Temperature-sensitive species might extend their ranges to cool refuges, defined here as areas where temperatures projected for 2100 match 1960s temperatures in the modern range. Distances to such cool refuges are greatest for equatorial species and are particularly large for key tropical forest areas including the Amazon and Congo River Basins, West Africa, and the upper elevations of many tropical mountains. In sum, tropical species are likely to be particularly sensitive to global warming because they are adapted to limited geographic and seasonal variation in temperature, already lived at or near the highest temperatures on Earth before global warming began, and are often isolated from cool refuges. To illustrate these three points, we examined the distributions and habitat associations of all extant mammal species. The distance to the nearest cool refuge exceeded 1000 km for more than 20% of the tropical and less than 4% of the extratropical species with small ranges. The biological impact of global warming is likely to be as severe in the tropics as at temperate and boreal latitudes.";"WRIGHT, S. JOSEPH

Pinyon-juniper removal is one such technique; however, it is unclear which method of tree removal most effectively promotes forage species. We conducted an experiment to quantify understory responses to mechanical pinyon-juniper removal and seed additions in a blocked design using three different methods: anchor-chaining, rollerchopping, and mastication. Blocks contained each mechanical and seeding treatment along with an untreated control. Seven blocks across two sites, North Magnolia (NM, 4 blocks) and South Magnolia (SM, 3 blocks), were treated during the fall of 2011. Half of each plot was seeded before or during mechanical treatment with a mix of grasses, shrubs, and forbs. After two growing seasons, biomass of perennial grasses was 90â160 kg Â· haâ1 in mechanically treated plots compared with 10 kg Â· haâ1 in untreated controls. There were no differences, however, between mechanical treatments for any perennial plant species. Response of annual plant species depended on mechanical treatment type and site. Rollerchopping had higher exotic annual grass cover than mastication or control at NM and higher exotic annual forb cover than chaining or control at SM. Rollerchopping was the only treatment to have higher native annual forb cover than control in the absence of seeding. Seeding increased native annual forb biomass in mastication compared with control. Seeding also increased shrub density at SM, which had fewer shrubs pretreatment relative to NM. Results suggest any type of mechanical removal of pinyon-juniper can increase understory plant biomass and cover. Seeding in conjunction with mechanical treatments, particularly mastication, can initially increase annual forb biomass and shrub density. Finally, different understory responses between sites suggests that pretreatment conditions are important for determining outcomes of pinyon-juniper removal treatments.";"Stephens, Garrett J.

Frequent cloud cover in moist tropical regions poses challenges for using optical images to map and monitor forests. Recently, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) released a 50m orthorectified mosaic product from the Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). PALSAR data provides information about the land surface without cloud interference. In this study we use the fine beam dual (FBD) polarization PALSAR 50m mosaic imagery and a Neural Network (NN) method to produce a land cover map in Hainan Island, China. Subsequently, forest areas are classified into evergreen and deciduous forests and rubber plantations are mapped using vegetation and land surface water indices derived from 250 to 500m resolution MODIS products. The PALSAR 50m forest cover map, MODIS-based forest types and rubber plantation maps are fused to generate fractional maps of evergreen forest, deciduous forest and rubber plantation within 500m or 250m pixels. PALSAR data perform well for land cover classification (overall accuracy=89% and Kappa Coefficient=0.79) and forest identification (both the Producer’s Accuracy and User’s Accuracy are higher than 92%). The resulting land cover maps of forest, cropland, water and urban lands are consistent with the National Land Cover Dataset of China in 2005 (NLCD-2005). Validation from ground truth samples indicates that the resultant rubber plantation map is highly accurate (the overall accuracy=85%). Overall, this study provides insight on the potential of integrating cloud-free 50m PALSAR and temporal MODIS data on mapping forest types and rubber plantations in moist tropical regions.";"Dong, Jinwei

"AGRIS:US201500217500";"development of soil and water conservation policies and practices in five selected countries from 1960 to 2010";"";"Since the 1930s there has been worldwide concern about the effects and impacts of land degradation. After the problems experienced in the Dust Bowl in the USA, much attention was paid to soil and water conservation in both developed and developing countries. Initially Governments stimulated the establishment of physical control measures, such as terraces, check dams and reforestation. This was achieved through top-down regulations, and Forestry Departments were often in charge of the implementation. Subsequently the measures were implemented through more specialized agencies, and later with incentives, such as food aid in developing countries and subsidies in developed countries. In some cases farmers were mobilized to work together on the establishment of the conservation measures. Because of the low success rate of this top-down approach with line interventions, it was realized that a more participatory approach had to be followed. The emphasis then shifted to area interventions such as cover crops, mulching and composting. In some countries voluntary ways of collaboration between farmers were developed. More recently Conservation Agriculture has become popular, focusing on less soil disturbance, continuous land cover and crop rotations. This paper analyses whether and to what extent countries have followed such general trends in their soil and water conservation policies (since the 1990s often referred to as sustainable land management) or whether countries have also followed their own specific strategies. A historical (1960–2010) and comparative analysis of the development of these sustainable land management policies and practices is undertaken in five selected countries: Indonesia, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Spain and Bolivia.";"de Graaff, J.

In this article, we explore the implications of the sectoral and geographical coupling of soybean and cattle production frontiers for forest conservation in South America, with particular attention to the potential for policy‐induced deforestation leakage.

Landowners participate to fulfill a motivation or set of motivations but their satisfaction and commitment may hinge on other unforeseen motivations or factors. Understanding the relationship between motivations, satisfaction, and commitment is necessary for a successful retention strategy in any conservation program, especially on private lands where success depends on landowner commitment.

Since their development was driven by different national or international initiatives, they were developed for different purposes and hold diverse technical characteristics. Thus, comparison among products and quality monitoring is necessary in assessing their usefulness. This paper provides a methodology to compare global land cover maps that allows for differences in legend definitions among products. Two different approaches were considered for map comparison, a Boolean approach and a new methodology based on fuzzy set theory in which the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) acted as a general bridging system. The fuzzy approach let us reconcile legends in terms of a set of nine selected attributes. The methodology is illustrated over Europe using four different land cover products: CORINE, GLC2000, MODIS land cover (MODISLC) and GlobCover. Overall accuracies between datasets based on a generalized nomenclature ranged from 35% (GlobCover–MODISLC) to 57% (CORINE–GLC2000). A further assessment based on a flexible Boolean comparison allowed us to minimize part of the uncertainty introduced by ambiguity of legends, resulting in an overall increase of agreement of around 10% in absolute terms. Reduction of positional errors produced an agreement increase of around 5%. The fuzzy approach allowed us to examine certain criteria used in classification systems to better understand the causes of discrepancies among datasets and express them in terms of relevant land attributes, irrespective of class names. This method served to highlight the consistency of the land cover maps under consideration, especially for datasets that showed higher divergences. In particular, it allows the identification of areas that are very close in land attributes, even when a Boolean comparison shows them as different.";"Pérez-Hoyos, A.

The findings suggested that, given a supportive environment, there are opportunities for Indigenous people to benefit from employment in the forestry sector. These benefits included skill development and increased confidence, the opportunity for employment and participation in land management. The findings also highlighted constraints that could limit the delivery of these benefits. Constraints included an insufficient level of relevant skill or experience, lack of a supportive environment, the difficulty of balancing Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures, and limitations related to the nature of the forestry sector.

Due to rapid urbanization, large areas of land have been paved, and other areas have undergone rapid land use change. Evaluation of the impact of urbanization on carbon dynamics and carbon stock (30 cm) has become an issue of urgent concern. The soil carbon dynamics, due to rapid land use change in Tianjin Binhai New Area of China, have been simulated in this paper using the RothC model. Because this area is saline, a modified version of RothC that includes a salt rate modifier provided more accurate simulations than the original model. The conversion to urban green land was not accurately simulated by either of the models because of the undefined changes in soil and plant conditions. According to the model, changes of arable to grassland resulted in a decline in soil carbon stocks, and changes of grassland to forest and grassland to arable resulted in increased soil carbon stocks in this area. Across the whole area simulated, the total carbon stocks in 2010 had decreased due to land use change by 6.5% from the 1979 value. By 2050, a further decrease of 21.9% is expected according to the 2050 plan for land use and the continuing losses from the soils due to previous land use changes.";"Hao, Cui

Remote sensing offers a convenient means of monitoring this expansion as it covers a period of 40 years in the case of the LANDSAT satellite. In some parts of the globe, this is probably the only viable means of monitoring due to the lack of other types of data. In order to monitor expansion, first, urban land has to be separated from other land-cover types. Although this can be done by standard classification processes, it is much more efficient to establish an urban index (UI) analogous to the widely used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for vegetation. Existing efforts to establish such a UI are reviewed and compared in a common context. Following this, a novel, more efficient UI is introduced. The calculation of the new index is straightforward, based on combining the NDVI with the normalized difference built-up index. The results are promising as the index can efficiently segment urban areas, even in the presence of excessive bare land. The proposed method is evaluated on two test sites selected in different LANDSAT scenes. The new index is valid only for sensors with the same bands as those of LANDSAT.";"Stathakis, Demetris

Much focus should be on rethinking approaches for scaling-out of well-proved innovations rather than on generation of new technologies. This paper presents an empirical framework for scaling-out water system innovations at catchment level. The framework is built based on findings from studies that were conducted in the Makanya catchment in Northern Tanzania. The empirical data and information were collected through inter-related research methods entailing farmers’ questionnaire surveys and consultations with key NGOs involved in the promotion of agricultural land and water management technologies. The data collection involved 234 and 294 farmers in the first and second rounds, respectively. The framework has four stages, which are technology and community strength evaluation, partnership building, scaling-out process and uptake evaluation. Stage 1 evaluates the technology efficacy in conserving soil and water and increasing benefits, and community strength mainly in terms of social capital. Stage 2 entails partnering with the target community and change agents to champion the scaling-out process in the target community. Stage 3 is concerned with the actual innovation scaling-out process through effective pathways such as field demonstration, lead farmers and appropriate channels of communication. Stage 4 evaluates the outcome of the innovation scaling-out process. Though the framework is developed using field evidences related to scaling-out of terraces, it could be adapted to enhance scaling-out of other water system innovations.";"Tumbo, S.D.

"AGRIS:US201400155194";"Potential effects in multi-resolution post-classification change detection";"";"Change detection is one of the primary applications of remote-sensing data, and many techniques have been developed during the past three decades. Although frequently criticized and despite many alternatives, due to its simplicity and intuitive manner, post-classification change detection still remains one of the most applied techniques. Many studies in the field of change detection analysis acknowledge, for instance, the impact of misregistration, inconsistencies in classification schemes or differences in methods for image interpretation. However, there are additional, rarely studied influences that can cause large errors in change detection results, including integrating multi-resolution data, the adjacency effect and the minimum mapping units (MMUs) that are applied to the classification before change detection. This study demonstrates these effects for the complex land cover of the Alvarado mangrove area at the Mexican Gulf Coast, employing 10 m Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) high geometric resolution (HRG)‐based and 57 m Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) classifications. As a baseline, the proportion of the fine spatial resolution classes within the coarse spatial resolution cells were derived, from which proportional change matrices were computed. The analysis employs difference measures to compare change matrices and proportional maps. The impact of various tested resampling functions was negligible if coarse resolution data were refined. For coarsening fine spatial resolution data, change matrix comparison was comparatively small but yielded differences of approximately 20% in spatially explicit measures. Incorrect positional alignment indicated differences of up to 5% in the change matrix for a misregistration of 100 m and even higher spatially explicit differences (28%). The discrepancies due to the adjacency effect were rather low. MMUs of 25 ha resulted in differences of up to 36% in the change matrix. The magnitude of the discrepancies of all studied effects depends on the class diversity in the map, and some can also be related to the difference in spatial resolution.";"Colditz, René R.

Implementation of change in scale and scope ofenterprises is constrained by initial state conditions including resource endowments,access to credit, and regulation. In the presence of such constraints, the paper motivatesthe existence of thresholds that introduce cusps in the optimal paths of control variables.The evolution of enterprises is considered within the context of a multiple enterprise firmthat encompasses discrete and continuous processes that are interdependent onintermediate goods as well as their production of environmental effects. Response toopportunity is governed as well by adjustment costs and incomplete markets. Thespecification is consistent with manufacturing, crop and animal agriculture, as well asservice-oriented enterprises. Potential for structural change is considered within thecontext of changes in prices, regulation, and technological change. We discussmanagement options that maximize uncertain profit over the planning horizon subject tochanging price regimes, regulations, and existing and new technology. We considerincentive as well as quota type policy to regulate environmental effects. While the modelis one of optimal control, the presence of constraints opens the opportunity for timing ofadjustment and constrains adjustment. We derive thresholds for change and show theirprincipal determinants. Based on this specification, we derive an indicator of flexibilityas well as real options style valuation of the benefits of postponement of adjustment.The model’s specification is sufficiently complex as to preempt analytical consideration.Instead, we specify a numerical example and present illustration of the implications of themodel based on numerical computation. The example illustrates both unbundling ofenterprises as conditions encourage reduction in scope as well as formation of relationallinks to recover what might be viewed as economies-of-scale by specialized enterprisesspawned by unbundling. The example also illustrates conditions necessary to induce ashift from traditional grazing animal operations integrated with crops to intensive feedlots.

Regressions for weekly rents are conditioned on house size, quality, and recreation features including lakefront proximity and ski-slope access. Percentage effects and marginal implicit prices indicate that access to recreation is reflected importantly in rental offers. Evaluated at the means, lakefront locations command a premium of $1,100–1,200 per week, and the premium for ski-slope access is $500–600 per week. Unit recreation values are about $18 per person per day for a lakefront location with a private dock and $7 per person per day for a ski-slope location. There are small differences in the unit values for three real estate management agencies.

"AGRIS:US201300824583";"Managing the Commons Texas Style: Wildlife Management and Ground-Water Associations on Private Lands";"";"As nearly all of Texas' rural lands are privately owned, landowner associations for the management of white-tailed deer and ground-water have become increasingly popular. Deer are a common-pool resource with transboundary characteristics, requiring landowner cooperation for effective management. Ground-water reserves are economically important to landowners, but are governed by the ""rule of capture"" whereby property rights are not defined. One ground-water association and four wildlife management associations (WMAs) were surveyed to characterize their member demographics, land use priorities, attitudes, and social capital. Members of the ground-water cooperative were part of a much larger, more heterogeneous, and more recently formed group than members of WMAs. They also placed greater importance on utilitarian aspects of their properties, as opposed to land stewardship for conservation as practiced by members of WMAs. If ground-water association members could be more locally organized with more frequent meetings, social capital and information sharing may be enhanced and lead to land stewardship practices for improved hydrologic functions and sustained ground-water supply. This, coupled with pumping rules assigned by the local ground-water district, could yield an effective strategy that is ecologically and hydrologicaly sound, and that allows rural provision of water supply to urban consumers.";"Wagner, M.

Family Land, Forests and Trees in Saint Lucia, West Indies";"";"Property rights are a central topic in conservation debates, but their influence on environmental outcomes is rarely carefully assessed. This study compared land use, tree planting practices and arboreal vegetation on government, estate private, smallholder private and communal “family” lands in Saint Lucia. The influence of tenure was apparent, but overall not a strong predictor of either farmer practices or vegetation characteristics. Higher abundance of planted trees on smallholder private lands was offset by greater abundance of natural forest trees on estate and family lands. Tree planting and abandonment of cultivation (with ensuing afforestation) were commonplace on all three types of land. The influence of tenure was swamped by other factors shaping farmer decisions to plant trees, cut trees or abandon cultivation, including local topography and changing commodity and labor markets.

Obtaining timely and reliable information on the status of these resources will support planning and early response to climatic variability. This study in Karamoja pastoral sub-region of Uganda identified herbaceous and woody forage species in different grazing land cover types, quantified forage in different grazing land covers, analyzed long-term land use/cover change (from 1986 to 2013) and determined the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and herbaceous biomass. Results showed that the sub-region has over 30 grass species that provide forage. During the wet season, woodlands, grasslands and thickets and shrublands recorded a wet weight of 1,342.5 ± 104.5 kg/ha, 857.5 ± 29.4 kg/ha and 501 ± 43.9 kg/ha, respectively. In the dry season, 542.5 ± 57.6 kg/ha, 273 ± 6.4 kg/ha and 140 ± 9.2 kg/ha were realized in the woodlands, grasslands and thickets and shrublands, respectively. However, in the transitionary season, 276, 512.5 and 529.2 kg/ha were obtained in the woodlands, grasslands and thickets and shrublands accordingly. Similar trends were observed in dry matter biomass in the respective land cover type. Seasonality, land cover type and location accounted for the variations in the observed forage quantities. Analysis of land cover and land use change revealed a tenfold increase in croplands in the last 13 years. The expansion of crop cultivation is attributed to interventions by the Government of Uganda and development partners to promote food security in the sub-region. Heightened bushland encroachment was similarly observed in the last 13 years. The study also found a significant positive relationship between NDVI and herbaceous biomass, indicating that remote sensing offers reliable resource assessment and monitoring options for informing planning and interventions in semi-arid areas.";"Egeru, Anthony

We used nationwide datasets on anthropogenic disturbance to perform a quantitative assessment of habitat stressors in US estuaries. Habitat stressors were characterized by four categories of indicator datasets: (1) land cover/land use, (2) alteration of river flows, (3) pollution sources, and (4) eutrophication. These datasets were combined using a multiscale hierarchical spatial framework to provide a composite stressor index for 196 estuaries throughout the contiguous USA. Investigation of indicator patterns among 13 defined USA coastal subregions revealed clear differences across the USA attributable to both natural variation as well as differences in anthropogenic activities. We compared the mean composite scores for each subregion and found the lowest stressor index scores in the Downeast Maine and the Oregon Coast subregions. Subregions with the highest stressor index scores were the Southern California Bight (due to land cover changes, river flow alteration, and pollution) and Mid-Atlantic Bight (due to land cover changes, pollution, and eutrophication). Inland-based measures of pollutants, river flow, and land use all showed strong correlations with eutrophication measured within estuaries. Our approach provides an indicator-based assessment for a larger number of estuaries than has been possible in previous assessments, and in the case of river flow, for variables which previously have not been evaluated at a broad spatial scale. The results of this assessment can be applied to help prioritize watershed and estuarine restoration and protection across the contiguous USA.";"Greene, Correigh M.

But, census data for any given area are neither always available nor adequately reflect the internal differences of population. The authors tried to overcome this problem by spatializing the population across China through utilizing integer night-time imagery (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System, DMSP/OLS) and land-use data. In creating the population linear regression model, night-time light intensity and lit areas, under different types of land use, were employed as predictor variables, and census data as dependent variables. To improve model performance, eight zones were created using night-time imagery clustering and shortest path algorithm. The population model is observed to have a coefficient of determination (R²) ranging from 0.80 to 0.95 in the research area, which remained the same in different years. A comparison of the results of this study with those of other researchers shows that the spatialized population density map, prepared on the basis of night-time imagery, reflects the population distribution character more explicitly and in greater detail.";"Zeng, Chuiqing

Moreover, NAADS programme faces implementation weaknesses such as nepotism that affects the selection of beneficiaries as well as enterprises, to the extent that some farmers are apathetic about the success or failure of NAADS Programme.Other observed weaknesses in NAADS implementation include late disbursement of funds, very low counterpart funding by the local government and the farmers, and poor monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the programme.

This study is primarily concerned with the planning and management of a multipurposereservoir. An economic optimization model using non-linear programming is developed andsolved using Risk Solver to maximize the net economic benefits derived from different use of reservoir water under uncertainties. Marketed: urban and rural water supply and hydropower generation and non-marketed: lake recreation uses are considered directly in the maximization problem while flood control and downstream releases are incorporated as constraints. Stochastic inflows to the reservoir are considered to be log normally distributed. Lake Tenkiller because ofits clear water and scenic beauty is chosen for this study. A mass balance equation is used to determine the level and volume of water in the lake for each period over the year 2010. Both the value of a visitor day and the number of visitor are the function of lake level which makes it completely unique. Results show that for Lake Tenkiller it is beneficial to maintain the lake levelat around 634 feet above mean sea level (famsl) until mid-August, and then start drawing down for hydropower generation. A sensitive analysis is also performed with different values of visitor day and peak electricity prices. However, the results remain the same for all different scenariosmaking the model completely robust and the solution also satisfies the equi-marginal principle.

Results demonstrate that runoff would be reduced due to the land-use changes by 51.65 mm yr⁻¹, 110.29 mm yr⁻¹ and 59.48 mm yr⁻¹ for scenarios S₁, S₂ and S₃, respectively. However, scenarios S₄ and S₅ could increase streamflow by 57.63 mm year⁻¹ and 156.78 mm year⁻¹, respectively.

The first estate possessed 2365 and the second 1423 yokes of forests. The distribution of the tree species and the state of the forest stands, which were with some exceptions generally bad, are described. Detailed use of the forests, that were shared on one side between the bondmen, in the form of servitude rights (rights for felling the trees for firewood and building material, rights for the pasture of livestock and swines separately, and the rights to rake up the strewing) and on the other side the rights of the estate owners, are discussed. In that time the forests were to a great extent included in the husbandry of the bondsmen farms. The estates did not have the power to reduce the servitude rights, which were in force for ages. To small extent they attempted to regulate them, but with little success. The servitude rights were a great obstacle for good administration of the forests. The estate _iče tryed to solve this problem through the cession (separation) of their forests parts to the bondsmen, which should denounce to their servitude rights on the remaining estate forests. But during the period in question the intention was not realized. These problems are extensively discussed in archival sources. On the estate Fraj_tanj the cession (separation) of the forests to bondsmen, for their denouncing to the servitude rights, has not been a topic yet. On both estates there  no traces can be observed about contemporary forest managing and the incomes from their forests were negligible.

For the study two areas were selected: area of Triglav national park (TNP), as area with highly diversified rural tourism and area of Kozjansko regional park (KRP) as area with low level of rural tourism diversification. The primary data collection was conducted with use of in-depth interviews among relevant stakeholders. In each area some interviews were carried out, where some interviews were representing multiple stakeholders also. The results of the analysis mostly confirmed our hypothesis. We could recognize that the diversity of actors and social roles are essential as sources of stabilty, resilience, robustness and integrity in the social dimension of natural resource management, that an ecological regime shift or collapse does not necessarily result in a regime-shift or collapse of the social-ecological system, that an adaptive governance framework relies critically on the collaboration of a diverse set of stakeholders operating at different social and ecological scales, that good governance of the socio-economic domain does not necessarily imply maintaining a stable / resilient / robust / integer social-ecological system and that institutions, social networks and organisation interact across scales. On the other hand a hypothesis that more diverse tourism leads to higher stabilty, resilience, robustness and integrity of social-ecological systems was not confirmed.

AFLP Data from Maize Inbreds and Comparison with SSR Data";"";"Genetic distance (GD) estimates based on molecular markers are a preferred approach to estimate genetic conformity between putative essentially derived varieties (EDVs) and their initial varieties (IVs). The objectives of our study were to (1) estimate the variation in the marker-estimated parental contribution (p) to the genome of the progeny, (2) investigate the power of AFLP-based GD estimates for discriminating between homozygous lines with F2, BC1, and BC2 relationships, and (3) compare AFLP data with SSR data from a companion study, as well as with theoretical and simulated results. In total, 104 European maize inbred lines comprising 66 triplets were analyzed with 20 AFLP primer combinations and 100 SSR primer pairs. Each triplet consisted of one F2-, or BC1-derived progeny line and both parental lines. For lines with both F2 and BC1 relationship, mean estimates of p based on AFLP (pF2 = 0.46; pBC1 = 0.70) or SSR data (pF2 = 0.45; pBC1 = 0.67) were lower than the respective expected values of 0.50 and 0.75. Considerable differences were detected between AFLP- and SSR-based mean GD estimates for unrelated inbred lines due to the lower degree of polymorphism of AFLPs compared with SSRs. With each marker system, the GD between progeny lines and parents was little affected by the variation in GD between the parents, particularly for lines with BC1 relationship. Substantial differences in Type I (α) and Type II (β) errors were detected between flint and dent germplasm pools with different marker systems and when fixed EDV thresholds were considered. To counterbalance advantages and disadvantages of AFLP and SSRs, a complementary application of the two marker systems is suggested for discrimination between EDVs and independently derived varieties (IDVs).";"Heckenberger, M.

The Sodsaver provision of the 2008 farm bill could deny crop insurance on converted land in the Prairie Pothole states for 5 years. Supplemental Revenue Assistance payments, which are linked to crop insurance purchases, could also be withheld. Using representative farms, we estimate that Sodsaver would reduce expected crop revenue by up to 8% and expected net return by up to 20%, while increasing the standard deviation of revenue by as much as 6% of market revenue. Analysis based on elasticities from the literature suggests that Sodsaver would reduce grassland conversion by 9% or less.";"Claassen, Roger

This study was conducted to determine the impact of fertilizer sources, land management practices, and fertilizer placement methods on greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions. A new prototype implement developed for applying poultry litter in subsurface bands in the soil was used in this study. The field site was located at the Sand Mountain Research and Extension Center in the Appalachian Plateau region of northeast Alabama, USA, on a Hartsells fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Typic Hapludults). Measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions followed GRACEnet (greenhouse gas reduction through agricultural carbon enhancement network) protocols to assess the effects of different tillage (conventional vs. no-tillage) and fertilizer placement (subsurface banding vs. surface application) practices in a corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system. Fertilizer sources were urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), ammonium nitrate (AN) and poultry litter (M) applied at a rate of 170 kg ha-1 of available N. Banding of fertilizer resulted in the greatest concentration of gaseous loss (CO2 and N2O) compared to surface applications of fertilizer. Fertilizer banding increased CO2 and N2O loss on various sampling days throughout the season with poultry litter banding emitting more gas than UAN banding. Conventional tillage practices also resulted in a higher concentration of CO2 and N2O loss when evaluating tillage by sampling day. Throughout the course of this study, CH4 flux was not affected by tillage, fertilizer source, or fertilizer placement method. These results suggest that poultry litter use and banding practices have the potential to increase greenhouse gas emissions.";"Smith, K.

Soil erosion is a widely recognized threat to their sustainability. However, the variability of short-term soil erosion measurements and the limited understanding of driving processes result in a considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of soil erosion. This study aims at measuring and modelling soil erosion rates in olive orchards over a 250-year period, and relating these to changes in management practices and yield, as documented from historical sources. In three study areas in S-Spain, the height of relic tree mounds was measured in olive orchards dated between 153 and 291 years old to determine soil profile truncation. Measured average soil erosion rates were between 29 and 47tha⁻¹year⁻¹. Historical documents allowed characterizing land management since 1752 in eight distinct periods. This information was then used to calibrate a soil erosion model, combining water and tillage erosion. The model reproduced the temporal patterns in soil erosion rates and showed considerable historical variation: between 8 and 124tha⁻¹year⁻¹ for water and between 3 and 42tha⁻¹year⁻¹ for tillage. Mainly due to improved agronomic practices, yield was not affected by soil erosion and has continuously increased over time.";"Vanwalleghem, Tom

"AGRIS:US201400140443";"Fire Management, Managed Relocation, and Land Conservation Options for Long‐Lived Obligate Seeding Plants under Global Changes in Climate, Urbanization, and Fire Regime";"";"Most species face multiple anthropogenic disruptions. Few studies have quantified the cumulative influence of multiple threats on species of conservation concern, and far fewer have quantified the potential relative value of multiple conservation interventions in light of these threats. We linked spatial distribution and population viability models to explore conservation interventions under projected climate change, urbanization, and changes in fire regime on a long‐lived obligate seeding plant species sensitive to high fire frequencies, a dominant plant functional type in many fire‐prone ecosystems, including the biodiversity hotspots of Mediterranean‐type ecosystems. First, we investigated the relative risk of population decline for plant populations in landscapes with and without land protection under an existing habitat conservation plan. Second, we modeled the effectiveness of relocating both seedlings and seeds from a large patch with predicted declines in habitat area to 2 unoccupied recipient patches with increasing habitat area under 2 projected climate change scenarios. Finally, we modeled 8 fire return intervals (FRIs) approximating the outcomes of different management strategies that effectively control fire frequency. Invariably, long‐lived obligate seeding populations remained viable only when FRIs were maintained at or above a minimum level. Land conservation and seedling relocation efforts lessened the impact of climate change and land‐use change on obligate seeding populations to differing degrees depending on the climate change scenario, but neither of these efforts was as generally effective as frequent translocation of seeds. While none of the modeled strategies fully compensated for the effects of land‐use and climate change, an integrative approach managing multiple threats may diminish population declines for species in complex landscapes. Conservation plans designed to mitigate the impacts of a single threat are likely to fail if additional threats are ignored.

"AGRIS:US201400140440";"Downgrading, Downsizing, Degazettement, and Reclassification of Protected Areas in Brazil";"";"Protected areas (PAs) are key elements for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Brazil has the largest PA system in the world, covering approximately 220 million ha. This system expanded rapidly in the mid‐1990s to the mid‐2000s. Recent events in Brazil, however, have led to an increase in PA downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD). Does this reflect a shift in the country's PA policy? We analyzed the occurrence, frequency, magnitude, type, spatial distribution, and causes of changes in PA boundaries and categories in Brazil. We identified 93 PADDD events from 1981 to 2012. Such events increased in frequency since 2008 and were ascribed primarily to generation and transmission of electricity in Amazonia. In Brazilian parks and reserves, 7.3 million ha were affected by PADDD events, and of these, 5.2 million ha were affected by downsizing or degazetting. Moreover, projects being considered by the Federal Congress may degazette 2.1 million ha of PA in Amazonia alone. Relaxing the protection status of existing PAs is proving to be politically easy in Brazil, and the recent increase in frequency and extension of PADDD reflects a change in governmental policy. By taking advantage of chronic deficiencies in financial and personnel resources and surveillance, disputes over land tenure, and the slowness of the Brazilian justice, government agencies have been implementing PADDD without consultation of civil society. If parks and reserves are to maintain their integrity, there will need to be investments in Brazilian PAs and a better understanding of the benefits PAs provide.

Hong Kong as an ultra-compact city generates intense interactions between trees and urban fabric to highlight urbanization effects on tree communities. The study areas cover public housing estates which accommodate about half of the 7.26 million population. Thirteen site factors related to estate, landform and habitat traits were measured or computed as surrogate urbanization effects. Species composition and diversity of tree communities in 102 estates were assessed by field surveys, including four estate groups: older or newer ones situated respectively in urban core or new towns. They contain 48,823 trees belonging to 232 species with heavy exotic representation. Total tree density and native tree density in newer estates were significantly higher than older ones. Differences in species richness and diversity and native species richness between older and newer estates were not significant, expressing to a certain extent the floristic-homogenization phenomenon. Multi-response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) results showed significant difference in species composition between older and newer estates, which could be explained by variations in development age, density, town plan and pre-urbanization land cover. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) results found tree distribution patterns in four estate groups strongly associated with estate area, open space area, estate population, estate age, Shannon index (H′) at planting strip and tree pit, and tree site quality index. Urban-forest management could be improved by adopting more native species and providing high-quality and spacious planting sites to accommodate more and larger trees. The research methods and findings could be used by policy makers and planners in similar large and developing cities to evaluate, design, maintain and enhance urban biodiversity.";"Jim, C. Y.

Abundance and diversity of butterflies is an indicator of good environmental health. Understanding how different butterfly species respond to habitat degradation is a necessary step towards the development of effective measures to enhance environmental protection. This study investigated the impact of land use patterns on the diversity, abundance, and conservation status of butterflies in the Kisii highlands; a densely-populated region in Kenya that has received little attention in ecological studies. Sampling was done through a line transect of 300 m. A total of 2799 individual butterflies comprising 67 species were recorded across seven land cover types; secondary forest, grasslands, riverine, human settlement, mixed farmlands, monoculture, and mining areas. The secondary forest, riverine and mixed farmlands recorded more butterflies (37.0, 26.0, and 15.5 %, respectively), followed by grasslands (12.5 %), while monoculture, human settlements, and mines had the least number of butterflies (3.0 % each). Moreover, the secondary forest, riverine and mixed farmland land cover types were the most species rich. Nymphalidae were the most abundant (38 species) whereas, Papilionidae the least (3 species) in the region. Junonia sophia was the dominant species. Butterflies were most diverse in the secondary forest (Shannon–Weaver diversity index, H′ = 2.89), while the human settlement had the least (H′ = 1.25). One-way ANOVA analysis indicated a higher species similarity between secondary forest, mixed farming and riverine land cover types compared to a low species similarity between secondary forest and mining, grassland, monoculture and human settlement. Butterfly abundance and distribution was different between the dry and wet season among the land cover types. Therefore, land use patterns had effects on butterfly abundance and diversity and their conservation is threatened if proper management practices are not put in place. Planning of land use activities should thus encourage agro-forests/secondary forests interspaced with other land use activities to enhance environmental health and improve on biodiversity conservation.";"Sagwe, Rose Nyakemiso

However, little is known about the impact of intensification of coffee farming on arthropod diversity in Vietnamese coffee agroecosystems. We conducted an in-depth study of the termite presence in five land-uses along a gradient of increased land-use intensity in the Central Highlands of Vietnam: mixed deciduous forest (MF), secondary forest (SF), planted pine forest (PF), rubber plantation (RP), and coffee plantations (CP). The estimated number of termite species decreased along the land-use gradient. In coffee agroecosystems, the termite species richness was 20–50 % lower than that of the forested areas and monoculture rubber plantation. In terms of beta diversity, the termite faunal composition in CP was significantly separated from those of the other land-uses, in which the similarity was only 28.67 %. Litter depth, canopy cover, and wood basal area were positively associated with the termite communities present in MF and SF, whereas the termite community in PF was positively associated with soil bulk density, leaf litter, and understory vegetation. The ecological characteristics in RP and CP appeared to be negatively associated with wood basal area, leaf litter, and understory vegetation where well represented by Ancistrotermes pakistanicus (Ahmad).

However, much of the current debate on the effects of IPR protection involves large developing countries with high threat of imitation. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the impact of the strengthening of patent laws in China on its bilateral trade flows. We estimate the effects of patent rights protection on China’s imports at the aggregate and detailed product categories for both OECD (developed) and non-OECD (developing) countries. The empirical results suggest that increased patent rights protection stimulate China’s imports, particularly in the knowledge-intensive product categories.

An important consideration in the development of sustainable practices is the maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC). Critical assumptions, with unknown errors, are used to calculate SOC maintenance requirements. This study investigated the impact of three approaches for estimating belowground nonharvested carbon (NHC) on SOC maintenance requirements, SOC and nonharvested C mineralization rate constants, and the capacity of the soil to sequester carbon. Common protocols were used to develop databases from eight historical carbon studies. The SOC to CO2 (kSOC) and NHC to SOC (kNHC) rate constants were calculated using the model NHCa/SOCi = kSOC/kNHC + dSOC/dt(1/kNHCSOCi), where NHCa is the amount of applied NHC, SOCe is SOC at the equilibrium point, t = time, and SOCi is the initial SOC value. Analysis showed that (i) despite the difficulty in measuring belowground biomass, it is needed to calculate the SOC and NHC mineralization rate constants when using nonisotopic approaches; (ii) decreasing NHC by reducing the relative contribution of roots to NHC reduced the calculated SOC maintenance requirements and the amount of corn stover that could be sustainably harvested; iii) changes in the belowground NHC calculation approach do not result in a consistent impact on calculated rate constants; iv) changes in the belowground NHC calculation approach had a minimal impact on the calculated carbon sequestration potential (kNHCNHC)/kSOC; (v) SOC at the beginning of the experiments was negatively correlated with temperature, while kSOC was positively correlated with tillage intensity; and (vi) the kSOC and kNHC rate constants can be used to directly assess the impact of different management scenarios on carbon turnover.";"Clay, David

The existence of annual rings was shown by a combination of anatomical examination and radiocarbon estimations. With tree ring analysis, forest inventories and destructive sampling the above-ground biomass increment of secondary forest stands of age between 9 and 48 years in the dry forest region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica were estimated. The above-ground biomass increment of the tree layer varies between 2.4 and 3.2Mg/hayr in different stands. Lianas contribute with up to 23% additional production.

"AGRIS:US201400184073";"Creating a ‘Conservation with Chinese Characteristics’";"";"As China becomes increasingly influential in international affairs, it is important to understand the unique characteristics of Chinese environmental values and policy processes. This is especially true given the rate and scale of China’s environmental impacts on natural ecosystems from local to international levels. Currently, however, Chinese conservation values, policies and practices are not well-integrated. We identify four systemic barriers to conservation in China that contribute to this poor integration: weak rule of law; unclear land tenure; top down government authority; and disconnects between scientific research and management implementation. To advance China toward an environmentally secure future, we suggest that combining traditional Chinese environmental values with contemporary science and international conservation practices will help to create a ‘Conservation with Chinese Characteristics’. We do not believe that traditional values should replace modern science and management. Rather, we suggest that, given the cultural and political conditions in China today, using traditional values to frame contemporary environmental science and ecosystem-based management may create stronger societal support for conservation implementation.";"Edward Grumbine, R.

Opportunities exist to improve the efficiency by which parties interested in conservation easement transactions are matched, which may contribute to the overall protection of agricultural landscapes. This study utilizes stated choice questions to elicit preferences for conservation easements by both landowners, as potential easement suppliers, and land trust professionals as potential easement demanders. A random utility model is estimated for landowners and for land trust professionals. Results indicate both preference overlap and preference divergence between these two sets of respondents. Significant opportunities exist to reduce search and transactions costs, improve easement acceptance, and increase environmental protection via increased transaction frequency of conservation easements in this emerging market. When negotiating with landowners, land trusts need to be aware of concerns related to issues such as managerial control, public access, lack of trust, and financial compensation. Moreover, heterogeneity amongst participants regarding these issues suggests some agricultural landowners may be more or less concerned about these issues.";"Bastian, Christopher T.

The TTOP model is based on regional observations of air temperature and heat transfer functions involving vegetation, soil, and snow; whereas the frost number model is based on site-specific ratios of ground temperature measurements of frozen and thawed degree-days. Thirty HOBO© temperature data loggers were installed near the surface as well as at depth (30 to 85cm). From mid-July 2008 to 2010, the mean annual soil temperature (MAST) for all surface sites was −1.5°C. Frost numbers averaged 0.56; TTOP averaged −1.8°C. The MAST was colder on western-facing slopes at high elevations. Surface and deeper probes had similar MASTs; however, deeper probes had less daily and seasonal variation. Another model developed at the regional scale based on proxy indicators of permafrost (rock glaciers and land cover) classified 5.1km² of permafrost within the study area, whereas co-kriging interpolations of frost numbers and TTOP data indicated 2.0km² and 4.6km² of permafrost, respectively. Only 0.8km² were common among all three models. Three boreholes drilled within 2m of TRR indicate that permafrost does not exist at these locations despite each borehole being classified as containing permafrost by at least one model. Addressing model uncertainty is important because nutrients stored within frozen or frost-affected soils can be released and impact alpine water bodies. The uncertainty also exposes two fundamental problems: empirical models designed for high latitudes are not necessarily applicable to mountain permafrost, and the presence of mountain permafrost in the alpine tundra of the Colorado Front Range has not been validated.";"Janke, Jason R.

At that point, the seemingly inexorable trends toward increased intensities of exploitation and management will be recognized as having taken their tolls of biodiversity and other forest values. Celebrations when a country passes this ‘forest transition’ will then be tempered by realization that what has been accepted as ‘forest’ spans the gamut from short‐rotation mono‐clonal stands of genetically engineered trees to fully protected old growth natural forest. With management intensification, climate change, species introductions, landscape fragmentation, fire, and shifts in economics and governance, forests will vary along gradients of biodiversity, novelty of composition, stature, permanence, and the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forces. Management intensity will increase with the increased availability of financial capital associated with economic globalization, scarcity of wood and other forest products, demand for biofuels, improved governance (e.g., security of property rights), improved accessibility, and technological innovations that lead to new markets for forest products. In a few places, the trend toward land‐use intensification will be counterbalanced by recognition of the many benefits of natural and semi‐natural forests, especially where forest‐fate determiners are compensated for revenues foregone from not intensifying management. Land‐use practices informed by research designed and conducted by embedded scientists will help minimize the tradeoffs between the financial profits from forest management and the benefits of retention of biodiversity and the full range of environmental services.";"Putz, Francis E.

Earth Observation (EO) data offers a potential solution to long-term biodiversity monitoring through direct mapping of habitats or by integrating Land Cover/Use (LC/LU) maps with contextual spatial information and in situ data. Therefore, it appears necessary to develop an automatic/semi-automatic translation framework of LC/LU classes to habitat classes, but also challenging due to discrepancies in domain definitions. In the context of the FP7 BIO_SOS ( www.biosos.eu ) project, the authors demonstrated the feasibility of the Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy to habitat class translation. They also developed a framework to automatically translate LCCS classes into the recently proposed General Habitat Categories classification system, able to provide an exhaustive typology of habitat types, ranging from natural ecosystems to urban areas around the globe. However discrepancies in terminology, plant height criteria and basic principles between the two mapping domains inducing a number of one-to-many and many-to-many relations were identified, revealing the need of additional ecological expert knowledge to resolve the ambiguities. This paper illustrates how class phenology, class topological arrangement in the landscape, class spectral signature from multi-temporal Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and plant height measurements can be used to resolve such ambiguities. Concerning plant height, this paper also compares the mapping results obtained by using accurate values extracted from LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data and by exploiting EO data texture features (i.e. entropy) as a proxy of plant height information, when LIDAR data are not available.

These two locations, with a proven potential to contain and preserve archaeo-environmental remains, were of interest because they had different hydrological and land-management history. In addition, for one of the sampling years, the structure of soil bacterial communities was monitored using polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene-coding fragments amplified from soil DNA, using primers specific for eu bacteria, actinomycetes, and α-proteobacteria. The physicochemical monitoring data indicated that at Sutton Common the buried conditions were less stable and more heterogeneous throughout the soil profile than at Hatfield Moor. Extracellular enzyme activities decreased with depth at both sites and higher average enzyme activity was found at Hatfield Moor than at Sutton Common. Phosphatase and leucine aminopeptidase were the most active enzymes throughout the soil profile. Our results indicated that the enzymatic potential for organic matter (OM) degradation at both sites was strongly correlated to pH and OM content in the soil. DGGE patterns for eubacterial, α-proteobacteria, and actinomycete populations indicated intra-site changes in community structure with time of sampling and depth. The sampling site with a high and stable water table, Hatfield Moor, showed higher enzyme activities above 50 cm depth and as a consequence had more potential for OM degradation than the site with fluctuating hydrological conditions. These trends provide insight into the potential for biodegradation over time and with depth at these two sites, information that is relevant to the in situ preservation of buried organic archaeological artefacts in wetland soils.";"Douterelo, Isabel

The impacts of including the agricultural sector in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) depend on how farmers change their behaviour in response to the increased cost of emissions. Yet most analyses of the ETS do not allow for a behavioural response. This paper partially addresses the gap in the literature: it allows for farmers to change their land use to reflect the reduced returns from pastoral agriculture as well as the potential to earn carbon credits for sequestration performed by plantation forestry and scrub. Simulations performed in the Land Use in Rural New Zealand (LURNZ) model allow us to answer questions about the likely spatial and temporal distribution of the socio-economic impacts of the ETS.

The sediments, dredged from Livorno port (Italy), had previously been phytotreated, using a salt-tolerant plant cover and earthworms, with the aim of reducing the salt level and improving the texture and microbiology. In this study, sediments were investigated in order to: (1) test their capability to be used as a revitalised soil-like substrate (techno-soil), and (2) assess the human exposure risks associated with sediment management. Results obtained after 6 months of experiments performed with biological indicators composed of an association of graminae grass (Paspalum vaginatum), legumes (Trifolium alexandrinum) and earthworms (Eisenia foetida), showed that the substrate behaves like a natural soil capable of supporting biological life (total N=0.2%; total P=0.7%; EC=1.5 mS·cm ⁻¹; β−glucosidase=20 μ g PNP·g *h ⁻¹). It was also found that plants accumulate small amounts of heavy metals in shoot tissues (120 mg Zn·kg⁻¹; 25 mg Cu·kg⁻¹). In detail, risk analysis was performed considering: (1) sediment storage in a sealed disposal basin inside the Livorno port area, and (2) off-site phyto-remediation.

The paper presents an original method dealing with the forest site types delineation. The suggested method consists in integrating a typological key in a GIS aiming at producing a thematic map that describes forest site types. Data used are the soil map of Belgium (digitized at the scale 1:20,000) and a digital elevation model built from a topographic map (scale 1:10,000). The typological key is mainly based on the methodology used by Thill et al. (1988) in the site types system for central Ardenne, the potential vegetation map of Sougnez and Dethioux (1975) and the ecoregion map of Delvaux and Galoux (1962). In that respect, site types are closely linked to the soil map and the phytosociological classification. So, they can be connected to the afforestation guide and different phytosociological and autecological studies concerning forest species. It is then possible to map the potential habitats or the site potentialities related to tree species. The key is valid for the Ardenne ecoregion located in Southern Belgium (elevation higher than 300 m). It has to be validated through an intensive use in the field, taking into account its imprecision linked to the types of collected data, chieffly those being digitized. The integration of such a tool in a SIG can be considered as an original way in terms of integrated forest management or forest sites description in the context of the project """"Natura 2000"""" launched by the European Union.

When well managed, these ecosystems provide relevant ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. In the northern part of the Mediterranean Basin, cork oak areas are mainly privately owned and a source of income to landowners, chiefly through cork and livestock production. Sustainable use is essential to maintain the ecological sustainability and socio-economic viability of these ecosystems. Biodiversity conservation and non-provisioning ecosystem services may generate additional incentives promoting sustainable use and conservation of montados, but require adequate mapping and identification. The high conservation value forest (HCVF) framework allows systematic inventory of biodiversity and non-provisioning ecosystem services and is widely applied in forest ecosystems. Here we exemplify the application of HCVF to the cork oak landscape of southern Portugal using a WebGIS tool that integrates the HCVF framework, in conjunction with Pareto optimization, to identify areas important for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We present a case study using threatened bird and reptile species, as examples of biodiversity attributes, and carbon storage and water recharge rate of aquifers, as examples of ecosystem services attributes. We identify those areas in a cork oak landscape of southern Portugal where biodiversity and ecosystem services attributes are optimized. These areas can be prioritized for implementing conservation mechanisms, such as payment for ecosystem services, to promote sustainable forest management.";"Bugalho, M. N.

Quantitative measures of network size and diversity, along with a qualitative understanding of network content and function are discussed and compared for active and passive forest managers. We find that active managers (people who had a recent timber harvest) had at least twice as many social ties related to forest management compared to passive managers, particularly after accounting for parcel ownership size, forest area, and total landholding size. Learning and service were the main functions of these networks, with learning being the most frequently cited reason for talking to others regardless of the management profile of forest owners.

The present study assesses and diagnoses the performance of 22 small and medium size community-managed irrigation schemes, mainly devoted to rice production, in different locations along the Mauritanian banks of the Lower Senegal River. The evaluations followed the Rapid Appraisal Process in which semi-structured interviews were held with representatives of the Cooperatives’ Boards in charge of each scheme to obtain information about the organisation of the cooperative, land tenure, irrigation system and organization, cropping pattern and soils. Additionally, for each irrigation scheme, the water-delivery service was characterized by making qualitative and comparative observations during field inspections; the pumping station's performance was diagnosed by a local specialist; the discharge at the head of the system was measured; daily irrigation time was recorded; and crop yields were determined by plot sampling. Then a set of performance indicators was computed. Water delivery capacity referred to irrigated areas was insufficient in a third of the schemes, and this insufficiency was exacerbated by poor maintenance. Irrigation intensity in habilitated areas was rather low being less than 0.66 in 50% of the schemes. The average productivity of land, irrigation water, and fuel (3.38tha⁻¹, 0.30kgm⁻³ and 2.37kgkWh⁻¹, respectively) were well below potential.";"García-Bolaños, Mariana

Fragmentation may be especially detrimental to social insects because inhibited gene flow has important consequences for cooperation and competition within and among colonies. Army ants have winged males and permanently wingless queens; these traits imply male‐biased dispersal. However, army ant colonies are obligately nomadic and have the potential to traverse landscapes. Eciton burchellii, the most regularly nomadic army ant, is a forest interior species: colony raiding activities are limited in the absence of forest cover. To examine whether nomadism and landscape (forest clearing and elevation) affect population genetic structure in a montane E.� burchellii population, we reconstructed queen and male genotypes from 25 colonies at seven polymorphic microsatellite loci. Pairwise genetic distances among individuals were compared to pairwise geographical and resistance distances using regressions with permutations, partial Mantel tests and random forests analyses. Although there was no significant spatial genetic structure in queens or males in montane forest, dispersal may be male‐biased. We found significant isolation by landscape resistance for queens based on land cover (forest clearing), but not on elevation. Summed colony emigrations over the lifetime of the queen may contribute to gene flow in this species and forest clearing impedes these movements and subsequent gene dispersal. Further forest cover removal may increasingly inhibit Eciton burchellii colony dispersal. We recommend maintaining habitat connectivity in tropical forests to promote population persistence for this keystone species.";"Soare, Thomas W.

It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator ‘LUCCA 4—Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding’, how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change. The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.";"Helbron, Hendrike

"AGRIS:US201400042361";"Observing System Simulation Experiment for Hydros Radiometer-Only Soil Moisture Products";"";"Based on 1-km land surface model geophysical predictions within the United States Southern Great Plains (Red-Arkansas River basin), an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) is carried out to assess the impact of land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and parameter uncertainty on soil moisture products derived from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Hydrosphere State (Hydros) mission. Simulated retrieved soil moisture products are created using three distinct retrieval algorithms based on the characteristics of passive microwave measurements expected from Hydros. The accuracy of retrieval products is evaluated through comparisons with benchmark soil moisture fields obtained from direct aggregation of the original simulated soil moisture fields. The analysis provides a quantitative description of how land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and inversion parameter uncertainty impacts propagate through the measurement and retrieval process to degrade the accuracy of Hydros soil moisture products. Results demonstrate that the discrete set of error sources captured by the OSSE induce root mean squared errors of between 2.0% and 4.5% volumetric in soil moisture retrievals within the basin. Algorithm robustness is also evaluated for the case of artificially enhanced vegetation water content (W) values within the basin. For large W(>3 kg· m-2), a distinct positive bias, attributable to the impact of sub-footprint-scale land cover heterogeneity, is identified in soil moisture retrievals. Prospects for the removal of this bias via a correction strategy for inland water and/or the implementation of an alternative aggregation strategy for surface vegetation and roughness parameters are discussed.";"Crow, Wade T.

This major phenomenon is often accompanied by an expansion of a green component. Urban green can itself be considered as a most important but often ignored land cover category. With this study we investigate how IKONOS data can be used more exhaustively for the detection and more importantly the quantification of urban green, compared to state-of-the art investigations. This paper demonstrates how a combination of specific techniques, including pansharpening, the use of vegetation indices and object detection can enhance the possibilities to map vegetated elements and even estimate volumes of woody patches in the southern fringe of Roeselare (Belgium). The values of the soil adjusted MSAVI index are found to be related to the increase in volume of the trees (coniferous and deciduous). To analyze the vegetation in more detail, we use an object-oriented classification with MSAVI to exclude the sealed areas from the further analysis. With a rule set of segmentation and classification steps, the vegetation is defined on a higher level. Especially textural measures are of importance to separate grass from high vegetation.";"Van Delm, An

However, the legacy of these land-use practices on current ecosystem functioning remains unclear. We studied legacy effects of former human land use on soil physical and chemical properties in a South African savanna. We did this by comparing soil properties in grazing lawns (patches of short grass maintained by the positive feedback between grazing intensity and forage quality) with the surrounding less grazed bunch grasslands within three different human land-use history contexts: (i) Abandoned bomas: permanent stone enclosures where livestock were kept overnight, and dung and urine accumulated for several years or decades. (ii) Old fields: areas where vegetation was cleared, soil tilled, and cultivated, but received little or no fertilization. (iii) Natural grasslands: not cultivated but grazed by livestock before the establishment of the reserve and wildlife thereafter. Former human land use rather than soil texture was the main determinant of grazing lawn location. Moreover, lawn soil properties also varied among land-use histories. In all grazing lawns, soil nutrient concentrations were higher than in adjacent grasslands but abandoned bomas contained three times more phosphorus, and twice as much nitrogen and carbon than old fields and natural grassland lawns. In addition to past land use, soil texture influenced lawn soil nutrients: Concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, total nitrogen, and carbon in lawns were higher on clayey soils than sandy soils, whereas phosphorus, C:N ratio, and pH did not change with soil texture. Our study confirms previous findings on the effect of human land use on savanna heterogeneity, but also highlights how legacy effects may vary among different historic land-use practices.";"Valls Fox, Hugo

With restoration increasingly key to global conservation, it is important to understand the landscape attributes and bird community characteristics that most influence avian seed dispersal in human-altered landscapes. We examined bird community structure and seed-dispersal patterns in agricultural countryside in Costa Rica that is typical of much of the Neotropics. Contrary to expectations, bird abundance, not richness, best predicted the richness of bird-dispersed seeds. Neither forest patch size or proximity, nor total tree cover, influenced seed dispersal. The richness and abundance of dispersed seeds, however, was strongly correlated with “wetness,” a remotely-sensed metric of vegetation, at several scales. These results suggest that in this human-dominated tropical region: (1) bird abundance, not species richness or size, may drive seed dispersal, and (2) remote-sensing combined with field verification can detect landscape elements that are helpful for maintaining the option of bird-mediated reforestation.";"Pejchar, Liba

The objective was to evaluate two monthly ET(0) models (Hargreaves-Samani, HS; Droogers-Allen HS, DAHS) and compare the results with an improved model (reference evapotranspiration model for complex terrains, REMCT). HS and DAHS are both based on the monthly temperature range (delta)(T), while REMCT replaces (delta)T with a monthly adjusted function (reference minimum air temperature). The test area was peninsular-insular Italy, where 13 stations with sufficient data to calculate FAO-56 Penman-Monteith ET(0) were available. The three models were evaluated against FAO-56 over a validation data set of six stations, using a multiple-statistics indicator: 0 (best) <or= IET <or= 1 (worst). The REMCT estimates generally compared well with the FAO-56 estimates (mean I(ET) = 0.029 against 0.187 and 0.255 with HS and DAHS, respectively). The three models performed similarly at low-altitude sites. REMCT was superior at sites higher than 500 m above sea level, where the ET(0) - (delta)T relationship was distorted (e.g., by an asymmetric lapse rate between maximum and minimum air temperatures).";"Diodato, N.

"AGRIS:US201500168446";"Combining solar photovoltaic panels and food crops for optimising land use: Towards new agrivoltaic schemes";"";"The need for new sources of renewable energies and the rising price of fossil fuels have induced the hope that agricultural crops may be a source of renewable energy for the future. We question in this paper the best strategies to convert solar radiation into both energy and food. The intrinsic efficiency of the photosynthetic process is quite low (around 3%) while commercially available monocristalline solar photovoltaic (PV) panels have an average yield of 15%. Therefore huge arrays of solar panels are now envisaged. Solar plants using PV panels will therefore compete with agriculture for land. In this paper, we suggest that a combination of solar panels and food crops on the same land unit may maximise the land use. We suggest to call this an agrivoltaic system. We used Land Equivalent Ratios to compare conventional options (separation of agriculture and energy harvesting) and two agrivoltaic systems with different densities of PV panels. We modelled the light transmission at the crop level by an array of solar panels and used a crop model to predict the productivity of the partially shaded crops. These preliminary results indicate that agrivoltaic systems may be very efficient: a 35–73% increase of global land productivity was predicted for the two densities of PV panels. Facilitation mechanisms similar to those evidenced in agroforestry systems may explain the advantage of such mixed systems. New solar plants may therefore combine electricity production with food production, especially in countries where cropping land is scarce. There is a need to validate the hypotheses included in our models and provide a proof of the concept by monitoring prototypes of agrivoltaic systems.";"Dupraz, C.

"AGRIS:US201400103667";"Cattle as ecosystem engineers: New grazing management enhances rangeland biodiversity";"";"A confluence of factors has shaped the composition and structure of vegetation on rangelands in the American West. These factors include climate, soils, topography, history of grazing and fire (both wildfire and prescribed fire) as well as legacy effects from prior land management practices. Despite the inherent differences in vegetation of rangelands resulting from these factors, sustainable management practices involving matching forage availability to forage demand have resulted in managing large acreages in a similar fashion for livestock production. Due to the focus on sustainable grazing practices and livestock production, there is often high similarity in vegetation composition and structure within local landscapes. In contrast to management that increases “sameness”, and in an attempt to increase desired habitats for grassland birds that need low or high vegetation structure, livestock can be used as a tool to “engineer” rangelands to produce differences in vegetation Attaining greater use of livestock as ecosystem engineers to obtain differences in vegetation composition and structure can be accomplished with current management practices. Livestock managers can alter timing and intensity of grazing, length of rest periods, and type of livestock as well as combining grazing with use of prescribed fire and/or existing colonies of prairie dogs. Livestock mangers can control when livestock graze certain areas, for how long, and how much vegetation is left ungrazed (to a certain height or residue level). Using livestock to engineer rangelands entails focusing grazing management activities to create desired levels of differences in composition and/or structure of vegetation with decision-making encompassing both provision of ecosystem services and livestock weight gains. Providing the economic markets for these ecosystem services is the nexus for facilitating more widespread engineering by livestock of rangeland ecosystems in the American West. What is needed is a confluence of conservation and production outcome goals into marketable commodities from these rangelands in the American West. Then, development of markets to place economic value on these commodities for the land manager, as well as for the general public, should provide the foundation on which to foster more engineering of rangeland vegetation by livestock.";"Derner, Justin D.

In the pre-reform era, the city was defined as a productive space under the system of urban-rural segregation established for securing rapid industrialization. Urban planning was thus only concerned with the development of urban areas. In the 1980s and 1990s after the reform, institutional change and economic transformation mobilized the urban-rural linkages. The development of suburban areas was then considered by urban planning, but this consideration was a passive response to urban problems such as population explosion and water resources protection. Since the new millennium, the agenda for sustainable development and problems of uneven urban-rural development have called for the development of urban-rural integration. In this context, the city is conceptualized as a complex of mountain, city, river, farmland and sea, reconstructing the ideology of urban-rural division in defining urban development. Urban planning has therefore sought in an active way to develop a sustainable city embracing rural and natural elements, and to balance economic growth and environmental protection. It is argued that developing the concept of city as a complex of urban and rural elements contributes to the urban planning for sustainable urban development, while this conceptualization relies on the recognition of the integrated urban-rural relationship.";"Xue, Desheng

"AGRIS:US2016214384";"The Impact of Property Rights Imperfections on Resource Allocation and Welfare: Co-ownership of Land in Bulgaria";"";"This study used a unique 2003 survey dataset to analyse the developments in land use and exchange in Bulgaria. The survey analysis yields several results. Land is highly fragmented in Bulgaria which increases the need for an efficient exchange of land between owners and users of land. However, the land sales market is not well developed. In contrast, land rental agreements are very widespread. Land rental is widely used to exchange land between owners and users of the land. The users include a variety of farm types, including cooperatives, farming companies, and individual farms. While land titles are distributed and land plots clearly defined and delineated, an important property rights problem exists under the form of so-called ""co-ownership"". By law, certain plots are undividable among heirs because the plot size after division would fall under the imposed minimum plot size. Our estimation results show that co-ownership has a major impact on land use and allocation. Land under co-ownership and which is undividable by law, is more likely to be left abandoned or used by large enterprises - the default users of land given the history of land use in Bulgaria - compared to owner-cultivation or renting out to another household. Our analysis shows that solving co-ownership problems would not only stimulate efficient land allocation which in turn affects the household's welfare level. Land that is cultivated by the household or rented to an other household contributes more to its welfare than land that is rented to a cooperative or left abandoned.";"Vranken, Liesbet

In the Mediterranean area, the significance of high percentages of Cichorieae pollen from archaeological layers is still questioned. We assessed the presence of Cichorieae as indicators of open habitats and pasturelands in current plant communities by comparing data on vegetation composition with pollen spectra from two Hellenistic sites of Basilicata (southern Italy): Difesa San Biagio in the low valley of the river Bradano and Torre di Satriano in the Lucanian Apennines. We also analysed the pollen morphology bringing to the discrimination of size classes within the fenestrate type of Cichorieae. Pollen spectra from the considered archaeological sites have low forest cover (7% on average); Asteraceae and Poaceae are prevalent; Cichorieae account to ca. 23%; coprophilous fungal spores are varied and present high concentrations. In surface soil samples collected near the sites, Cichorieae pollen is about 12%. In current vegetation types, an increasing abundance of Cichorieae was observed from salt marshes, forests and shrublands to open habitats and grasslands. This is coherent with the actual land cover around the study sites and the findings of the archaeological sample that point to an open landscape dominated by pastures and cultivated fields. Our integrated approach confirmed that today Cichorieae are common in secondary pastures and in some types of primary open habitats of southern Italy: hence, high percentages of this pollen can be considered a good indicator of these habitats even in past environment reconstructions.";"Florenzano, A.

However, agriculture has experienced low productivity over the years. Poor access to agricultural finance has been identified as a contributing factor to low crop productivity. Kenyan agriculture has undergone some fundamental changes which have profoundly affected agricultural financial services. In addition, most financiers shy away from lending to the agricultural sector because of the covariant risks related to rain-fed agriculture. Given this background, we undertake a comparative analysis of emerging models of agricultural finance that have expanded the agricultural finance frontier to the smallholder farmers. Key findings indicate that demand for farming credit takes the highest proportion of the credit needs among the rural households, thus accentuating the importance of agricultural finance. The state run model of agricultural financing has the lowest financial sustainability. On the contrary, the community financing models are the most likely drivers of change in the rural finance landscape.";"Kibaara, Betty

"AGRIS:US201400065122";"From Metaphor to Measurement: Resilience of What to What?";"";"Resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a socioecological system (SES) moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes. Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the domain of attraction or the frequency of events that could push the system across the boundaries. Examples are soil phosphorus content in lake districts woody vegetation cover in rangelands, and property rights systems that affect land use in both lake districts and rangelands. (b) The ability of an SES to self-organize is related to the extent to which reorganization is endogenous rather than forced by external drivers. Self-organization is enhanced by coevolved ecosystem components and the presence of social networks that facilitate innovative problem solving. (c) The adaptive capacity of an SES is related to the existence of mechanisms for the evolution of novelty or learning. Examples include biodiversity at multiple scales and the existence of institutions that facilitate experimentation, discovery, and innovation.";"Carpenter, Steve

The ownership restitution of land on small noncontiguous and spatially dispersed parcels prevents establishing of viable and profi table farms and hence becomes a holdback to an effi cient agriculture. This negative effect becomes increasingly stronger. The small land parcels impede applying of new technologies and production models, as well as the labor and machines’ efficient use. The scattered parcels make diffi cult the planned operation of land. Notwithstanding the land reform in Bulgaria is already completed, the resulting fragmentation continues to exist and exerts negative impact on the rural regions’ sustainable development.

Assessments of an ecosystem's capacity to regulate and to prevent floods relative to human demands for flood regulating ecosystem services can provide important information for environmental management. In this study, the capacities of different ecosystems to regulate floods were assessed through investigations of water retention functions of the vegetation and soil cover. The use of the catchment based hydrologic model KINEROS and the GIS AGWA tool provided data about peak rivers’ flows and the capability of different land cover types to “capture” and regulate some parts of the water. Based on spatial land cover units originating from CORINE and further data sets, these regulating ecosystem services were quantified and mapped. Resulting maps show the ecosystems’ flood regulating service capacities in the case study area of the Malki Iskar river basin above the town of Etropole in the northern part of Bulgaria. There, the number of severe flood events causing significant damages in the settlements and infrastructure has been increasing during the last few years. Maps of demands for flood regulating ecosystem services in the study region were compiled based on a digital elevation model, land use information and accessibility data. Finally, the flood regulating ecosystem service supply and demand data were merged in order to produce a map showing regional supply-demand balances. The resulting map of flood regulation supply capacities shows that the Etropole municipality's area has relatively high capacities for flood regulation. Areas of high and very high relevant capacities cover about 34% of the study area. The flood regulation ecosystem service demand map shows that areas of low or no relevant demands far exceed the areas of high and very high demands, which comprise only 0.6% of the municipality's area. According to the flood regulation supply-demand balance map, areas of high relevant demands are located in places of low relevant supply capacities. The results show that the combination of data from different sources with hydrological modeling provides a suitable data base for the assessment of complex function–service–benefit relations.";"Nedkov, Stoyan

We applied this approach to a model region in Saxony, Eastern Germany. For the estimation of the potentials of the model region to provide ecosystem services, we used a modified approach compared to the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). We then employed a benefit transfer and a purely expert driven approach to assess contribution of the land cover classes in our model region to the provision of ecosystem services. In a subsequent step, the services in our set were combined to ecosystem services groups that were designed together with regional actors, while considering their ideas, concerns and experiences in regional decision making. The latter was analyzed in a weighting experiment, in which different weighting approaches were tested. Based upon this, we analyzed the performance of the model region to provide ecosystem services and generated ecosystem services distribution maps. We could show that the different data gathering methods “benefit transfer” and “expert-based assessment” have a considerable impact on the evaluation outcomes. The results of our study show that the combination of selected services and land cover data can contribute to regional planning by communicating the effect of land cover change on ecosystem services groups, especially when applied as an evaluation basis in the tool Pimp Your Landscape (PYL). The approach supports also the assessment of the performance of a region to provide ecosystem services and the comparison of regions towards this aspect. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our approach that are related to coarse land cover data, lacking knowledge on the provision of ecosystem services at a landscape scale, and the difficulty to make relevant the ecosystem services concept in regional planning processes.";"Koschke, Lars

Stand relating to 1995 and 2006, geological and topographical maps and climatic data were used in this study. According to results, while forest area covered 14.5 % of the total area in 1955 was increased (35.8 %), degraded coppice, degraded blackpine and agricultural lands were decreased 5.7, 1.8 and 15.8% respectively. Besides, physical, chemical and morphological soil properties were determined and soils were classified as Entisol ve Inceptisol. In addition to, according to the study results, some suggestions were also given to sustain unique ecosystem considering water, soil, climate, land use characteristics and to provide guidance for planner or decision makers.

The ultimate aim of those engaged in cassava biotechnology is to develop and deliver improved planting materials to farmers in the tropical regions. Transgenic plants are now being produced that express traits with potential agronomic importance. Although good science will remain an essential basis for this goal, if farmers are to benefit from this investment, it is essential that researchers and others involved in these programs adopt a mindset geared towards product development and delivery. The first field trials of cassava are now under way.

"AGRIS:US201500007300";"Increased rainfall variability reduces biomass and forage quality of temperate grassland largely independent of mowing frequency";"";"Climate models indicate that global warming will stimulate atmospheric exchange processes and increase rainfall variability, leading to longer dry periods and more intense rainfall events. Recent studies suggest that both the magnitude of the rainfall events and their frequency may be as important for temperate grassland productivity as the annual sum. However, until now interactive effects between land management practice, such as mowing frequency, and rainfall variability on productivity and forage quality have not been studied in detail. Here, we present the data from a field experiment (EVENT II) in which a Central-European grassland was subjected to increased spring rainfall variability (low, intermediate and extreme rainfall variability without any change to the rainfall amount) and increased mowing frequency (four times compared to twice a year). We assessed biomass production, forage quality parameters, root-length and shoot–root ratio. Enhanced spring rainfall variability reduced midsummer productivity and the leaf N and protein concentrations of a target species, but did not exert any long-term effects on biomass production and forage quality in late summer. However, the increased spring rainfall variability reduced aboveground net primary productivity by 15%. More frequent mowing increased productivity in the first year of the study, but decreased productivity at the end of the second year, showing a decline in the potential for overcompensation after a history of more intense mowing. Generally, more frequent mowing decreased the shoot–root ratio and increased the concentration of leaf N. Increased mowing frequency neither buffered, nor amplified the adverse effects of rainfall variability on productivity, but made leaf N concentrations in early summer more responsive to altered rainfall patterns. These results highlight the fact that even relatively small and short-term alterations to rainfall distribution can reduce production and forage quality, with little buffering capacity of altered mowing frequency. Comparisons with productivity data from the first year of the study, in which both, rainfall distribution and rainfall amount were modified, demonstrate the crucial role of sufficient moisture (annual rainfall amount) for grassland resilience: in this first year, negative effects of extreme rainfall variability lasted until the end of the year. To conclude, increased rainfall variability under climate change will likely affect agricultural yield in temperate meadows. Management strategies to buffer these effects have yet to be developed.";"Walter, Julia

"AGRIS:US201500007301";"Carbon management of commercial rangelands in Australia: Major pools and fluxes";"";"Land-use emissions accompanying biomass loss, change in soil organic carbon (ΔSOC) and decomposing wood-products, were comparable with fossil fuel emissions in the late 20th century. We examine the rates, magnitudes and uncertainties for major carbon (C) fluxes for rangelands due to commercial grazing and climate change in Australia. Total net C emission from biomass over 369Mha of rangeland to-date was 0.73 (±0.40)Pg, with 83% of that from the potentially forested 53% of the rangelands. A higher emission estimate is likely from a higher resolution analysis. The total ΔSOC to-date was −0.16 (±0.05)Pg. Carbon emissions from all rangeland pools considered are currently 32 (±10)Tgyr⁻¹—equivalent to 21 (±6)% of Australia's Kyoto-Protocol annual greenhouse gas emissions. The ΔSOC from erosion and deforestation was −4.0 (±1.6)Tgyr⁻¹—less than annual emissions from livestock methane, or biomass attrition, however it will continue for several centuries. Apart from deforestation a foci of land degradation was riparian zones. Cessation of deforestation and onset of rehabilitation of degraded rangeland would allow SOC recovery. If extensive rehabilitation started in 2011 and erosion ceased in 2050 then a ΔSOC of −1.2 (±0.5)Pg would be avoided. The fastest sequestration option was maturation of regrowth forest in Queensland with a C flux of 0.36 (±0.18)Mgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ in biomass across 22.7Mha for the next 50yr; equivalent to ∼50% of national inventory agriculture emissions (as of mid 2011); and long-term sequestration would be 0.79 (±0.40)Pg. Due to change in water balance, temperature and accompanying fire and drought regimes from climate change, the forecast ΔSOC from the forested rangelands to 0.3m depth was −1.8 (0.6)Pg (i.e. 38 (12)% of extant SOC stock) resulting from a change in biomass from 2000 to 2100. For improved management of rangeland carbon fluxes: (a) more information is needed on the location of land degradation, and the dynamics and spatial variation of the major carbon pools and fluxes; and (b) freer data transfer is needed between government departments, and to the scientific community.";"Dean, Christopher

"AGRIS:US201500015612";"urban metabolism and ecological footprint assessment of Metro Vancouver";"";"As the world urbanizes, the role of cities in determining sustainability outcomes grows in importance. Cities are the dominant form of human habitat, and most of the world's resources are either directly or indirectly consumed in cities. Sustainable city analysis and management requires understanding the demands a city places on a wider geographical area and its ecological resource base. We present a detailed, integrated urban metabolism of residential consumption and ecological footprint analysis of the Vancouver metropolitan region for the year 2006. Our overall goal is to demonstrate the application of a bottom-up ecological footprint analysis using an urban metabolism framework at a metropolitan, regional scale. Our specific objectives are: a) to quantify energy and material consumption using locally generated data and b) to relate these data to global ecological carrying capacity. Although water is the largest material flow through Metro Vancouver (424,860,000 m³), it has the smallest ecological footprint (23,100 gha). Food (2,636,850 tonnes) contributes the largest component to the ecological footprint (4,514,400 gha) which includes crop and grazing land as well as carbon sinks required to sequester emissions from food production and distribution. Transportation fuels (3,339,000 m³) associated with motor vehicle operation and passenger air travel comprises the second largest material flow through the region and the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions (7,577,000 tonnes). Transportation also accounts for the second largest component of the EF (2,323,200 gha). Buildings account for the largest electricity flow (17,515,150 MWh) and constitute the third largest component of the EF (1,779,240 gha). Consumables (2,400,000 tonnes) comprise the fourth largest component of the EF (1,414,440 gha). Metro Vancouver's total Ecological Footprint in 2006 was 10,071,670 gha, an area approximately 36 times larger than the region itself. The EFA reveals that cropland and carbon sinks (forested land required to sequester carbon dioxide emissions) account for 90% of Metro Vancouver's overall demand for biocapacity. The per capita ecological footprint is 4.76 gha, nearly three times the per capita global supply of biocapacity. Note that this value excludes national government services that operate outside the region and could account for up to an additional 2 gha/ca.";"Moore, Jennie

Such a private conservation tool is yet to be established in the UK, but innovation by an environmental charity seeks to mitigate the impacts of diffuse pollution from agriculture on water quality. Under the agreements a one-off payment would be made for agreed restrictions on use of targeted areas of farmland. This paper places the proposed agreements within a hierarchy of approaches for water resources protection, and characterises them as a variant of Payments for Ecosystems Services. It reports the results of an innovative two-stage deliberative survey of the attitudes of a small sample of landowners located evenly across three catchments in South West England. A majority of respondents were receptive to the propositions and characteristics of the agreements. Seventy-five percent expressed interest in entering land into a scheme based on such agreements, but observed variation by landowner profile and farm type merits further investigation. Respondents interested in the agreements referred to current land values as a starting point for compensation required. The longevity of proposed agreements is an obstacle for some landowners; a cause for concern given the objective of ‘permanent’ water resource protection.";"Smith, Laurence

"AGRIS:FR2016210890";"Les exploitations agricoles familiales sont-elles des institutions ?";"";"Faced with a changing economic environment (poor functioning of the groundnut sector, economic liberalization, etc.), rural households seek first and foremost to secure food for their families by diversifying their production and their economic activities in the village and in urban centres through temporary migration. In this context, the farm seen as an institution cannot be considered as a company in the sense of the classical economic theory. It corresponds more to a system of activities whose operation takes into account both market and family objectives. After looking at the concept of institution and its application to the family farm, this paper highlights the changes that have taken place in groundnut farms in terms of social organisation and operation. In addition, envisaging the family farm as an institution, the authors show how the coordination pattern has evolved within the farm and the family as a whole.

Face aux changements de l’environnement économique (dysfonctionnement de la filière arachide, désengagement de l’État, etc.), les ménages ruraux recherchent avant tout la sécurité alimentaire de leur famille en diversifiant leurs productions et leurs activités économiques au village et dans les centres urbains grâce à la migration temporaire. Dans ce contexte, l’exploitation agricole, vue comme une institution, ne peut pas être considérée comme une entreprise, au sens de la théorie économique classique. Elle correspond plus à un système d’activités dont le fonctionnement tient compte des logiques marchandes et familiales. Après un éclairage sur le concept d’institution et son application à l’exploitation agricole familiale, nous préciserons les changements survenus dans les exploitations du Bassin arachidier en termes d’organisation sociale et de fonctionnement. Ensuite, en considérant l’exploitation agricole comme une institution, nous montrerons comment la nature des formes de coordination a évolué au sein de l’exploitation et de la famille élargie.";"Chia, Eduardo

For the purpose of enhancing adoption of the new cassava varieties, two strategies were used: (1) a participatory research approach and (2) public awareness raising activities. This paper attempts to evaluate the results of these two diffusion strategies. Within the first strategy, the factors found to enhance adoption rates were: awareness of the new varieties' advantages, public entities as the main information sources and involvement in participatory research. Within the second strategy, trends were found between adoption rates and producer characteristics including: ownership of land, middle-level income, advanced education level and use of information media, namely the Internet.

"AGRIS:US201400158744";"Redistributions of ¹³⁷Cs and soil components on cultivated hill slopes with hedgerows as conservation measures";"";"¹³⁷Cs tracing technique combined with soil composition characterization was used to investigate the mechanism and effectiveness of conservation measures for cultivated hill slopes of strongly weathered acidic Acrisol. The results of analysis of 66 soil samples taken across six plots showed much lower losses of ¹³⁷Cs, soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrients in the four treatments of alley cropping with hedgerows compared to the two control treatments of bare land and without conservation measures. No-tillage cultivation combined with vetiver grass hedgerows was most effective in securing high levels of ¹³⁷Cs, SOC, N, P, K, and CEC while reducing considerably the contents of dissolved cations and anions. Within the plots of alley cropping, ¹³⁷Cs, SOC, nutrients, dissolved ions, and sand were accumulated in the areas immediately upslope of the hedgerows, whereas the clay content and bulk density were highest downslope of the hedgerows. SOC inversely correlates with clay in concurrence with observations for the soils derived from basaltic parent materials, in which clay minerals are predominated by kaolinite. The correlations of ¹³⁷Cs with dissolved Ca, Mg, and P indicate that in the highly leaching Acrisol ¹³⁷Cs may partly occur in the soil solution that is susceptible to leaching and loss. The interrelationships among soil components were interpreted as being driven by the redistribution of soil aggregates which were fractionated in situ according to their sizes and specific densities by erosion forces combined with tillage and conservation measures (hedgerows).";"Hien, P.D.

"AGRIS:US201300816296";"rhythm of savanna patch dynamics";"";"1. Patch dynamics is a new, potentially unifying mechanism for the explanation of tree-grass coexistence in savannas. In this scale-explicit paradigm, savannas consist of patches in which a cyclical succession between woody and grassy dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The growing ecological and economic problem of shrub encroachment is a natural transient phase in this cycle. 2. An important step towards understanding patterns at the landscape scale is achieved by investigating mechanisms at a smaller scale. We developed the spatially explicit individual-based simulation model SATCHMO to test the null hypothesis that cyclical succession cannot emerge from a realistic patch scale simulation model of the population dynamics of savanna woody species. 3. We calculated the partial temporal autocorrelation coefficient for 100 simulated time series of shrub cover over 500 years for time lags of up to 200 years to establish the existence and duration of successional cycles. We found a significant positive autocorrelation indicating the existence of cycles with a typical duration of about 33 years. 4. The shrub size frequency distributions over the course of a cycle showed shifts from dominance of small shrub sizes towards larger sizes during the increasing phase of a cycle and the reverse in the declining phase. This supports the three phase explanation as follows: (i) an initial phase when spatially and temporally overlapping favourable conditions lead to mass recruitment of shrubs; (ii) a build-up phase when the shrub cohort grows; and (iii) a break-down phase when increased competition due to crowding and unfavourable conditions lead to the break-down of the shrub cohort. The frequency distribution of shrub age at death over 10 simulations was also in agreement with this explanation. 5. We investigated the relationship between shrub cover, annual precipitation and time-lagged shrub cover to identify the driver of the cyclical successions. More than 90% of the variation in shrub cover was explained by shrub cover of the previous year, precipitation, and their interaction. 6. With the demonstration of precipitation-driven cyclical succession at the patch scale, we show that the mechanistic, temporal component of patch dynamics can be used to explain tree-grass coexistence in semi-arid savannas.";"MEYER, KATRIN M..

"AGRIS:US201600191460";"Assessment of the cover changes and the soil loss potential in European forestland: First approach to derive indicators to capture the ecological impacts on soil-related forest ecosystems";"";"The Member States of the European Union have committed to the maintenance and protection of forest lands. More precisely, the Member States aim to ensure the sustainable development and management of the EU's forests. For 2013, Eurostat's statistics about primary and secondary wood products in the European forest land (65% thereof privately owned) estimate a roundwood production of 435 millionm3 in total. Harmonised information, i.e., spatially and temporarily differentiated, on forestry and wood harvesting activities in the European forests are missing however. This lack of information impedes the scientific assessment of the impacts that forest management practices have on the soil-related forest ecosystems (e.g., accelerated water soil erosion, delivery of inert sediments and pollutants within the drainage network, pauperization of aquatic ecosystems). It also prevents national and European institutions from taking measures aimed at an effective mitigation of the rapidly advancing land degradation. This study provides a first pan-European analysis that delineates the spatial patterns of forest cover changes in 36 countries. The first dynamic assessment of the soil loss potential in the EU-28 forests is reported. The recently published High-resolution Global Forest Cover Loss map (2000â2012) was reprocessed and validated. Results show that the map is a powerful tool to spatiotemporally indicate the forest sectors that are exposed to cover change risks. The accuracy assessment performed by using a confusion matrix based on 2300 reference forest disturbances distributed across Europe shows values of 55.1% (producer accuracy) for the algorithm-derived forest cover change areas with a Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 0.672. New insights into the distribution of the forest disturbance in Europe and the resulting soil loss potential were obtained. The presented maps provide spatially explicit indicators to assess the human-induced impacts of land cover changes and soil losses on the European soil-related forest ecosystems. These insights are relevant (i) to support policy making and land management decisions to ensure a sustainable forest management strategy and (ii) to provide a solid basis for further spatiotemporal investigations of the forestry practicesâ impacts on the European forest ecosystems.";"Borrelli, P.

Moreover, sea level rises also threaten the viability of many coastal zones and small islands. In the Shiroishi lowland plain, southwestern Kyushu Island of Japan, some environmental problems such as land subsidence and salinity intrusion due to over pumping of groundwater have long been recognized as water problems and become causes for public concern. In this study, an integrated surface and groundwater model was established and applied to the Shiroishi site to simulate groundwater flow hydraulics and predict the salinity intrusion process in the alluvial lowland plain. The simulated results show that groundwater levels in the aquifer greatly vary in response to varying climatic and pumping conditions. It is also found that sea water intrusion would be expected along the coast if the current rates of groundwater exploitation continue. Furthermore, sea water intrusion with a relative rise in sea water level due to aquifer compression and global climatic change was also considered. As a result, sea water intrusion appears to extend much farther in land from the coast compared to a reference case. The study also suggests a possible alternative to mitigate the inverse effects by pumping groundwater.";"Don, Nguyen Cao

"AGRIS:US201400128970";"Effects of cropping systems and irrigation on the bio-agronomic and quality rsponse of industrial tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)";"";"This paper shows the results obtained in 2009 of a study carried out by the Dipartimento di Agronomia Ambientale e Territoriale (D.A.A.T.) aimed at identifying and evaluating various low input cropping systems for industrial tomato varieties, a traditional farming crop in Sicily. The tests were carried out on the Sparacia experimental farm (Cammarata AG, 37°37’N, 13°42’E). The farm is located in a sub-arid area with average rainfall levels of approx. 500 mm and average min/max temperatures of 9 and 21°C. The soils, typical of soil types in the area, are Eutric Vertisols. A split-split plot design with three repetitions was adopted and the following variables were studied: 1) management of crop residue from wheat (MR) in the main plots which has two levels: burning of crop residues (BR) and ploughing in of crop residues (P-in). 2) Land management (ML) (sub plots) with two levels: transplanting the tomato into fallow land (FAL) and into cover crop land (GM) after the cover crop has been ploughed in. 3) Irrigation (IRR) (sub-sub plot) with two levels: restoring 75% of evapotranspiration losses (V1) and 45% of evapotranspiration losses (V2). A drop irrigation system was used at the rate of 2.5 L•h-1 with an inter-dripper spacing of 33 cm and at two-day intervals. During the initial soil preparation for the tomato, the biomass of the cover crop (Trifolium alexandrinum ‘Lilibeo’) was ploughed in at a rate of 6.5 t•ha-1, providing an estimated 52 kg•ha-1 of N. The tomato cultivar used was the industrial hybrid Joy. Data analysis showed an improvement in the physical and chemical properties of the soil, as increases in the soil carbon content of all of the test treatments showed. The production levels and quality of the tomato were found to be highly dependent upon water availability. The most productive test scenario was that of the combination P-in x GM x V1 (83.8 t•ha-1). A reduction in the volume of water supplied to the crop resulted in a fall in quantity but an improvement in the quality of the tomato produced – as shown by a the Brix value which resulted higher in V2 combined with all the other study variables.";"Poma, I.

The experimental diets were sole grazing, grazing + hay, grazing + silage and grazing + Leucaena leucocephala leaves. The calves were divided into four groups of three animals each and were randomly assigned to the four experimental diets. Crude protein (CP) contents of the forages ranged from 59 to 171� g/kg dry matter (DM). Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents of the forages ranged from 560 to 705� g/kg DM and 363 to 440� g/kg DM, respectively. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher values in mineral contents (Ca, K, P and Mg) were recorded for L. leucocephala leaves compared to other forage resources. Variations (P < 0.05) were observed in the average daily gain. Animals on grazing + L. leucocephala leaves diet had the highest (113� g/day) average daily gain, while those on sole grazing showed the least value (26.2� g/day). Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein, urea and calcium concentration showed significant differences (P < 0.05). Effective utilization of forage resources from the natural pasture by the calves was attained on supplementation with conserved forages and L. leucocephala leaves without any deleterious effects on the haematological and serum parameters.";"Ojo, Victoria Olubunmi A.

"AGRIS:US201500071537";"Economic Integration, Rural Hardship, and Conservation on Guatemala's Agricultural Frontier";"";"Despite decades of attention by conservationists, deforestation remains a critical problem in Latin America, particularly in agricultural frontiers like the Amazon and the lowlands of Central America. The limited impact of conservation initiatives in such regions stems partly from a poor understanding of the socioeconomic and land use dynamics that typify frontiers. Moreover, conservation organizations tend to disregard the economic and policy factors at various scales that contribute to deforestation pressures in developing countries. This article describes a study of recent socioeconomic and land use changes associated with the ongoing, rapid economic integration of Petén, Guatemala's main frontier region, and considers their implications from the standpoint of sustainable land use and forest conservation. The research relied on a range of primary and secondary data, including a comparison of survey data gathered by the author in one agriculturally important area of Petén before and after roads to the region were paved in the late 1990s, leading to tighter links with other parts of the country. The resulting economic integration of this once isolated region has made it more difficult for its farmers to compete with larger, more efficient producers elsewhere in Guatemala and beyond, and to survive in the face of downward pressures on farm gate prices. Most of the households in the study area have thus become poorer, their farming systems less diverse, and the concentration of land ownership and landlessness have increased. Such socioeconomic marginalization limits the ability of farmers to manage their land in a sustainable manner. It also forces a growing number of people to migrate in search of a decent livelihood, in some cases into remaining “protected” areas of forest in the Maya Biosphere Reserve.";"Shriar, Avrum J.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"deforestation;farming systems;land ownership;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"013;GTM;005";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500071537";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811003738777";"";"";"";"133-157"

"AGRIS:US201301727061";"Housing growth in and near United States protected areas limits their conservation value";"";"Protected areas are crucial for biodiversity conservation because they provide safe havens for species threatened by land-use change and resulting habitat loss. However, protected areas are only effective when they stop habitat loss within their boundaries, and are connected via corridors to other wild areas. The effectiveness of protected areas is threatened by development; however, the extent of this threat is unknown. We compiled spatially-detailed housing growth data from 1940 to 2030, and quantified growth for each wilderness area, national park, and national forest in the conterminous United States. Our findings show that housing development in the United States may severely limit the ability of protected areas to function as a modern ""Noah's Ark."" Between 1940 and 2000, 28 million housing units were built within 50 km of protected areas, and 940,000 were built within national forests. Housing growth rates during the 1990s within 1 km of protected areas (20% per decade) outpaced the national average (13%). If long-term trends continue, another 17 million housing units will be built within 50 km of protected areas by 2030 (1 million within 1 km), greatly diminishing their conservation value. US protected areas are increasingly isolated, housing development in their surroundings is decreasing their effective size, and national forests are even threatened by habitat loss within their administrative boundaries. Protected areas in the United States are thus threatened similarly to those in developing countries. However, housing growth poses the main threat to protected areas in the United States whereas deforestation is the main threat in developing countries.";"Radeloff, Volker C.

"AGRIS:US201600184096";"Synergistic effects of spring temperatures and land cover on nest survival of urban birds";"";"Climate change has the potential to influence avian population dynamics through nest-fate sensitivity to temperatures during the breeding season. Nest fate also varies across spatially heterogeneous habitat, and changing land uses may independently introduce stressors on reproductive outcome. Identifying the individual and synergistic effects of climate change and land-use change is necessary for understanding the impact of global change on native species. We studied the nest fate of 3 sympatric species breeding in urban habitat in an arid region of the western United States. We monitored nests (n = 371) of American Robin (Turdus migratorius), Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), and Black-headed Grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus) over 4 yr on an urban-to-rural gradient and analyzed nest fate in relation to temperatures at the time of egg laying and after eggs hatched. Habitat measurements included nest height and the amounts of canopy cover and impervious surfaces at 3 spatial scales of 20-m, 100-m, and 500-m radii from the nest. Our data most strongly supported models that included temperature deviation after hatching, nest stage, fine-scale canopy cover, and pedestrian traffic. Nest survival increased at slight temperature increases during the nestling stage, which suggests that in a climate-change context, moderate warming in spring temperatures may be beneficial for some breeding birds. Nests were more likely to survive at locations with more canopy cover in a 20-m radius and at sites with more pedestrian traffic, which suggests that increasing cover of native riparian tree canopy at fine scales may enhance habitat quality in multiuse urban reserves. Our results demonstrate that effects of climate change on avian populations must be considered synergistically with land-use and land-cover characteristics of the urban landscape, including tree canopy cover and level of human disturbance.";"Becker, Miles E.

Probit models are estimated to determine the relative importance of variables representing credit constraint, agency problem, and risk aversion factors. Regression models then estimate the impact of site, landlord, and tenant characteristics on contract terms  the percentage of crop and cost sharing arrangements between landlord and tenant. Probit results suggest credit constraint factors influence lease-type selection. Risk aversion, managerial ability, and social capital factors are also supported. Regression models show that land and crop characteristics are significant determinants of contract terms.";"Rainey, Ronald L.

Lessons from the case of the British Columbia Great Bear Rainforest initiative";"";"Much has been written about a supposed shift 'from government to governance' in many policy areas, including forest policy. However, the idea remains very much at the level of hypothesis as few empirical studies have confirmed the transition. Part of the problem is the multi-dimensional character of governance itself, which includes traditional 'government' as one of many possible governance modes. By providing a three dimensional picture of these potential governance modes, including overlapping institutional, political and regulatory dimensions, this article analyses the complex and incomplete character of moves towards any new governance mode in a high-profile land use planning exercise in British Columbia, that of the “Great Bear Rainforest” protected area strategy on the province's mid-coast region in 2006. Little evidence of such a shift is uncovered, despite much rhetoric to the contrary.";"Howlett, Michael

An observational study to determine the different factors affecting male and female decisions to change land use at the individual level in a forest margin landscape in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia) was combined with a set of role playing games (RPGs) designed to assess participant responses in a simulated social setting of women-only and men-only groups. The RPG included simulated agents offering new opportunities to convert or conserve agroforest. In the study area, rubber (Hevea braziliensis) agroforests that support high biodiversity and carbon storage are giving way to monoculture rubber and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations. When women from both the upland and lowland villages played the RPGs, external investors proposing logging or oil palm conversion were approached very positively and the resulting land use change was more dynamic and extensive than in the equivalent men-only groups. Consequently, women outperformed men in achieving income targets. In lowland areas gender is strongly associated with land use change, while in the uplands the level of conservation awareness plays a more crucial role in the maintenance of rubber agroforests. Based on the data, and contrary to expectations and gender stereotypes, it is expected that the greater involvement of women in landscape level decision making will increase emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in the area, posing further challenges to efforts to reduce such emissions.";"Villamor, Grace B.

An impediment to broader use of remote sensing science for monitoring has been the need for resource managers to understand the specialized capabilities of an ever-expanding array of image sources and analysis techniques. Here, we provide guidelines that will enable land managers to more effectively collaborate with remote sensing scientists to develop and apply remote sensing science to achieve monitoring objectives. We first describe fundamental characteristics of remotely sensed data and change detection analysis that affect the types and range of phenomena that can be tracked. Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps. We articulate a four-phase process that guides natural resource and remote sensing specialists through a collaborative process to articulate goals, evaluate data and options for image processing, refine or eliminate unrealistic paths, and assess the cost and utility of different options.";"Kennedy, Robert E.

"AGRIS:US201301925196";"Inhibition of an invasive plant (Mikania micrantha H.B.K.) by soils of three different forests in lower subtropical China";"";"Biological invasion represents one of the most serious threats to biodiversity, and invasion ecology research has become one of the central issues of contemporary environmental science. However, the relative role of soil development as correlated with succession in influencing variation in invasion resistance has seldom been examined. We hypothesized that the invasion potential of exotic plants depends on soil conditions. In this study, we explored variation among soils of three forest types in their resistance to invasion by Mikania micrantha H.B.K. in lower subtropical China; this species is one of the top ten most invasive weeds in the world. In model systems of soils from different forests, M. micrantha performed worst on undisturbed late-successional stage forest (monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest, MEBF) soils and did not appear to take advantage of abundant soil nutrients. These results could reflect that a potential inhibitory effect was driven by MEBF soil. Plant litter is an important component of soils, litter bioassay and addition experiments demonstrated native plant species from different forests differentially confer invasion resistance and affect the performance of exotic plants. Naturally, other factors such as the relative abundances of nutrients, microbial feedbacks, could have contributed to these results as well. Our results challenge the notion that forests are not immune to invasion and suggest that maintaining late-successional plant communities in lower subtropical China, which could be related to increased productivity and stability, should be a primary objective of land managers.";"Hou, Yu-Ping

They are invaluable for their long-term data and capacity to foster collaborative, interdisciplinary research. The San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) was established to develop appropriate land management practices on foothill rangelands in California. SJER has a long and rich history of avian research. Natural history observations recorded since 1935 demonstrate that oak woodlands are one of the most diverse habitat types in North America. Early avian studies focused on California quail (Callipepla californica) as a game species and led to insights on quail diet and habitat requirements. Starting in the late 1970s, the focus of avian research shifted to methods for detecting changes in wildlife populations over time and response to management practices. This research has led to important recommendations for implementing bird monitoring programs. Using data collected on bird numbers, in conjunction with monitoring reproductive success of all species, recent studies have examined life history strategies, source–sink dynamics, the effects of livestock grazing, and the impacts of an invasive species on native cavity-nesting species. We are currently in the process of examining population trends and predicting the effects of climate change using long-term data.

However, the relative importance of these patterns on biological assemblages among different habitats is not well known. We investigated the relative roles of local, catchment and spatial variables based on overland and watercourse distances in explaining the variation of community structure of lake and river macrophytes in two large river basins at two spatial extents (within and across river basins). Partial redundancy analysis was used to explore the share of variability in macrophyte communities attributable to local environmental conditions, catchment land cover and space (generated with Principle Coordinates of Neighbour Matrices). We found that local variables had the highest effect on both lake and river macrophyte communities, followed by catchment variables. Space had no or only marginal influence on the community structure regardless of used distance measure. Total phosphorus, conductivity and turbidity of the local variables contributed most for lake macrophytes, whereas pH and color had largest independent contribution for variation in river macrophytes. Size of catchment area and proportion of lakes and agriculture were the most important catchment variables in both habitats. The strong importance of environmental control suggests that both lake and river macrophyte communities are structured by species sorting. This finding gives support to the validity of assessment systems based on the European Water Framework Directive.";"Alahuhta, J.

"AGRIS:US201600191097";"Suitability index for restoration in landscapes: An alternative proposal for restoration projects";"";"Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class âwood sitesâ increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects.";"Bortoleto, Ludmila Araujo

"AGRIS:LV2014000103";"Research in geodesy and land management at the Latvia University of Agriculture";"";"The paper gives an overview of the directions and results of research carried out in geodesy and land management at the Latvia University of Agriculture from the year 1939, when the Surveying Department (later the Department of Geodesy) was established, up to the present day. Since the beginnings of the Department, researches in geodesy have been associated with problems of precise levelling: vertical movements of the earth crust, deformation of buildings and structures, as well as accuracy evaluation of geodetic instruments. Researches in land management started with the establishment of the Department of Land Management in 1951, and traditionally they are associated with rational land use issues. After the merger of both the Departments in 2001 and Latvia’s integration into the European Union, the research topics have expanded: Now they include assessment of the accuracy of the levelling core network and the measurements associated with it, as well as evaluation of the aspects of land property formation and improvement.";"Jankava, A., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia).

"AGRIS:US2016206867";"Technology, preferences and the sustainable intensification of agricultural production";"";"This paper addresses the relationship between agrobiodiversity conservation and sustainable agricultural intensification. A stylised theoretical model is used to explore the conditions by which both agrobiodiversity and conventional input intensification may increase through optimal adjustments of input use in biodiversity poor agroecosystems. The model shows that this result can arise in quite general circumstances where there is (1) an agricultural production technology that allows a positive relationship between ecological integrity of a given agricultural area and agricultural productivity in that area, and (2) decision maker preferences that recognise this positive relationship and generate resource allocation decisions that support it. While increase in agrobiodiversity conservation is a necessary condition for optimal resource adjustments, whether input use will increase or decrease along this optimal path depends on the buffering effect of agrobiodiversity on ecosystem damage and the relative societal welfare impacts of reduced agricultural output and ecosystem damage. A provocative hypothesis derived from the model points at the possibility that ecosystem damage (agrobiodiversity loss) can optimally decline even while agriculture is being intensified.";"Russell, Noel P.

"AGRIS:US2016202366";"The Provision of Ecosystem Services by Agriculture – a Spatially Explicit DEA Approach";"";"According to the concept of ecosystem services, agriculture not only provides commoditiesbut also cultural and regulating services. While it is easy to value commodity production bymarket prices, the valuation of cultural and regulating services is complex because of theirpublic good character. Non-parametric approaches such as the Data Envelopment Analysis(DEA) allow for estimating the contribution of agriculture to such services. However, it isnot enough to know the extent of ecosystem services provided; it is also necessary to beaware of which farmers provide these services and where they are provided. In this paper,we suggest a plot-specific approach combining GIS analysis and DEA models. This allows aspatially explicit assessment of agricultural land use for different subject matters such as ecologyand the contribution of a single plot to landscape diversity. The approach is undertakenin a marginal low-mountain region in Germany on 95 farms involving more than 5,800 plots.The results show the spatial distribution of externalities supplied by agriculture and the degreeof segregation between “production areas” and “protection areas”. The results also allowa deeper understanding of the spatial impact of policy measures on the provision of ecosystemservices by agriculture.";"Kapfer, Martin

Kereslet elsősorban az egyes megyék kiváló és jó minőségű, kedvező fekvésű területei, illetve a nagyobb kiterjedésű, egybefüggő szántók és erdők iránt van. A gyengébb minőségű, kedvezőtlen fekvésű, nehezen megköze-líthető területeken, a zsáktelepülések és az elöregedő falvak környékén túlkínálat jellemző. Nehezen értékesíthetők a beékelődő, szórtan elhelyezkedő, kis méretű, illetve a rendezetlen tulajdonviszonyú (osztatlan közös tulajdonú) területek. Az eladók között nagy számban találhatók megélhetési gondokkal küzdő idősebb, il-letve öröklés, vagy kárpótlás útján földhöz jutott, gazdálkodni nem kívánó tulaj-donosok. A földvásárlók között egyre több tőkeerős gazdálkodó jelenik meg, akik birtoknövelési, birtokegyesítési (földcsere) szándékkal vásárolnak földet. A földvásárlók másik jelentős csoportja a nagyobb városok környékén, frekventált helyen, főutak, autópályák mellett lévő, befektetési célú területeket keresi.A felmérés eredménye szerint az EU csatlakozást közvetlenül megelőző évek-től a földárak és bérleti díjak jelentősen, az adottságok függvényében többszörös különbségeket mutatva növekedtek. A földárak növekedésében az uniós árakhoz való közelítés, az egységes földpiac előnyeinek majdani kihasználása jelenik meg. A bérleti díjak növekményében pedig, a földalapú támogatások bérlők és tulaj-donosok közötti megosztása játszik szerepet. A földügyi szakemberek egybe-hangzó véleménye az, hogy a következő 5-10 évben a földpiac élénkülése, a bérle-ti díjak és a földárak emelkedése várható, ennek mértéke azonban ma még nem prognosztizálható.     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX      The survey shows that the landed property market in Hungary is in a state of anticipation. Demand is primarily for outstanding and good quality land of favourable location in certain counties or larger plots of arable and forestry land. Characteristically poorer quality, less accessible land of less favourable location in the neighbourhood of depopulated, cul-de-sac villages is in oversupply. Scattered, wedged properties of small size or of unclear ownership (undivided common land) are difficult to sell. Many of the vendors are older people with subsistence worries or people who obtained the title by compensation but do not wish to get involved in cultivation. Increasingly more buyers are well capitalised farmers, who wish to increase their holdings or to unite their property (by land swap). Another significant group of buyers wish to invest into landed property located in the neighbourhood of larger cities, at popular sites, next to main roads or motorways.According to our survey in the immediate years before EU accession land and lease prices increased significantly, many fold in relation to quality. Increases in land prices are due to a process of convergence to EU prices intending to take advantage of a projected unified land market. Increases in lease prices are due to apportioning of a projected land based support between owner and lease holder. According to land sale experts (estate or realty agents) the land market will in the 5-10 years liven up resulting in increases in land and lease prices, although the extent of this cannot yet be prognosticated.";"Hamza, Eszter

"AGRIS:US201500213210";"Methods and applications for ecological vulnerability evaluation in a hyper-arid oasis: a case study of the Turpan Oasis, China";"";"The Turpan Oasis is a typical fragile environment that lies in an arid region of eastern Xinjiang and is affected by natural conditions and human activities. The severity of the land degradation and desertification in this area is increasing; therefore, ecological vulnerability evaluations are important for environmental management of the region. In this study, theories and methods of evaluating ecological vulnerability and the typical characteristics of ecological vulnerability were summarized. By combining the environmental characteristics of the research area and the driving factors of ecological vulnerability, a multilayer vulnerability evaluation index system was built, and a pressure-state-response model was established to evaluate the ecological vulnerability. GIS and remote sensing technologies were applied to extract each index and create a spatial distribution map of vulnerability. The results showed that the vulnerability index values ranged from 3.08 to 6.59, with an average value of 5.19. Regions with moderate vulnerability accounted for 81.85 % of the total area, whereas regions with light and serious vulnerability accounted for 4.19 and 13.95 % of the total area, respectively. Thus, more than 80 % of the area had moderate vulnerability, and nearly 14 % of the area had serious vulnerability. The degree of vulnerability increased from east to west, and the ecological vulnerability in the inner oasis was significantly lower than that in the outer oasis. The key factors for ecological restoration and reconstruction are to control desertification and to ensure ecological water use to the greatest extent.";"Pei, Huan

The paper examines the extent to which this has materialized by exploring systematic differences over time between certified and non-certified ejidos as well as the private sector. We find that land rental markets function better in ejidos that underwent Procede, where there was also a marked increase in households' use of common pasture land. At the same time, neither the reforms nor Procede appear to have had much impact on land sales markets and ejidatarios' credit access. Implications for policy and program design are discussed.";"Deininger, Klaus W.

The effect of seawater intrusion and irrigation water on a coastal unconfined aquifer beneath naturally preserved mangrove and deforested mangrove-barren belt was investigated in Carey Island. Analysis of the total dissolved solids (TDS) and earth resistivity (ER) using a geochemistry-electrical integrated technique gave a TDS–ER relationship capable of predicting freshwater lens morphology affected by sea-irrigation water. The study result shows freshwater was fourfold thicker in close proximity of the mangrove forest than the mangrove barren area; the further the shoreline from the mangrove thickest section, the less vulnerable was the seawater intrusion and the more fresh the irrigation water, and hence the greater the freshwater availability potential.";"Tajul Baharuddin, M.

The spatial distribution of soil pH provides basic and useful information relevant to soil management and agricultural production. To obtain an accurate distribution map of soil pH on the Loess Plateau of China, 382 sampling sites were investigated throughout the region and four interpolation methods, i.e., inverse distance weighting (IDW), splines, ordinary kriging, and cokriging, were applied to produce a continuous soil pH surface. In the study region, soil pH values ranged from 6.06 to 10.76, with a mean of 8.49 and a median of 8.48. Land use type had a significant effect (p� <� 0.01) on soil pH; grassland soils had higher pHs than cropland and forestland soils. From a regional perspective, soil pH showed weak variation and strong spatial dependence, indicated by the low values of the coefficient of variation (0.05) and the nugget-to-sill ratios (<0.25). Indices of cross-validation, i.e., average error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and model efficiency coefficient were used to compare the performance of the four different interpolation methods. Kriging methods interpolated more accurately than IDW and splines. Cokriging performed better than ordinary kriging and the accuracy was improved using soil organic carbon as an auxiliary variable. Regional distribution maps of soil pH were produced. The southeastern part of the region had relatively low soil pH values, probably due to higher precipitation, leaching, and higher soil organic matter contents. Areas of high soil pH were located in the north of the central part of the region, possibly associated with the salinization of sandy soils under inappropriate irrigation practices in an arid climate. Map accuracy could be further improved using new methods and incorporating other auxiliary variables, such as precipitation, elevation, terrain attributes, and vegetation types.";"Liu, Zhi Peng

It also estimates the extent to which socio-economic characteristics of farmers affect the use of tsetse control techniques, using a maximum Likelihood-Binary Logit model. The results show that farmers will benefit if they invest in control and treatment of the disease. We find that the farmer accepting the challenge that the tsetse fly is a threat to cattle production, the number of dependants the farmer has, and the farmer agreeing that the bite of the tsetse fly causes the nagana disease are significant factors that affect adoption of control practices including the use of prescribed drugs. Our findings suggest that there is potential for farmers’ response and participation in tsetse control activities in Northern Ghana. What seems to be lacking is the relevant information that farmers need to encourage them to participate. We recommend therefore that more extension services be provided livestock farmers to help them derive maximum benefit from disease control practice";"Wahab, S.

The relationship and spatial congruence between services were assessed. The congruence between primary production and these five services was tested to evaluate its value as a surrogate or proxy ecosystem service measure. This study illustrates that (1) most of South Africa's land surface is important for supplying at least one service, (2) there are low levels of congruence between the service ranges and even lower levels between the hotspots for different ecosystem services, and (3) primary production appears to show some potential as a surrogate for ecosystem service distribution.

"AGRIS:US201500220755";"Combining asset- and species-led alien plant management priorities in the world’s most intact Mediterranean-climate landscape";"";"Minimising the spread and impact of alien plants is a crucial component of land management for biodiversity conservation. Alien plant management typically focuses on either controlling selected alien species (‘species-led’), or on minimizing invasions within selected biodiversity or cultural assets (‘asset-led’). Here, we compare and combine species- and asset-led approaches to prioritise alien plant management activities in the world’s largest Mediterranean-climate woodland, located in south-western Australia. Our species-led approach focused on identifying aliens likely to be increasingly problematic in future with a changing climate. Our asset-led approach used comprehensive flora survey data to identify key predictors of contemporary alien presence, with the purpose of minimising alien occurrence across the asset of a relatively little-disturbed landscape. Most aliens were associated with climates more mesic than are predicted to occur in the region in future. A limited range of alien taxa (12 %) are predicted to be both highly invasive in the future and feasibly eradicated or contained, and it is these that should be subject to species-led management. A consistent set of management-related predictors of contemporary alien presence were identified, including closer proximity to towns, buildings and water points, and occurrence on a geology and soil type associated with prospective mineral deposits. Addressing the highest management priorities of each approach would appear to be a complementary and parsimonious way forward for regional-scale alien management for biodiversity conservation, as this tackles the processes associated with contemporary alien spread (asset-led approach) while taking a precautionary approach to pre-empt future problematic invasions (species-led approach).";"Gosper, Carl R.

Similarly human activities in agricultural and urban sustainable developments have also led to the development of waterlogging and subsequent salinization of soils leading to many geo-environmental problems. Thus, it is important to be able to monitor, assess and map waterlogged and salt-affected areas at an early stage to develop an effective soil reclamation programme that helps to reduce and prevent a future increase in areas of wasteland. Remote sensing and GIS tools and techniques have been found to outperform more traditional methods for assessing the impact of soil salinity and waterlogging, thereby providing extremely useful, informative, and professional rapid assessment techniques for monitoring and accurate mapping and the quantification of waterlogged areas and salt-affected soils. This study applies digital image processing and GIS tools to monitor, assess, and map the waterlogged and salt-affected areas, to establish the main causes that lead to widespread wastelands, and to suggest approaches to mitigation in the eastern Nile Delta region in Egypt. Multi-temporal Landsat 5, 7 and 8 data for 1984, 2000, 2006 and 2013 and ASTER GDEM were selected to monitor, assess and map the waterlogged and salt-affected areas, and to determine and map the rate of change of land-use/land-cover, the status of wasteland, and the use of geomorphological terrain analyses based on enhanced digital images processing and field verification. Image band combinations, PCA, change detection, and image classification techniques, together with many indices such as NDVI, NDSI, NDWI and NDBI were applied, together with statistical analysis, to construct various thematic and spatial distribution change maps of the wasteland hazard indicators. Spatial distribution maps of waterlogging, salt-affected areas, permanent and temporarily waterlogged areas, surface changes, and their rate of change in addition to integrated relationships between terrain analyses, water table, depth to water and landform maps over a timespan of 29 years based on the analysis and interpretation results of image processing, field investigation and ancillary geological and hydrogeological data. The results reveal that changes to land-cover caused by human activities - particularly irrigated agriculture and land reclamation as well as urban expansion - will lead to a serious deterioration in the environment through waterlogging and salinization presenting future difficulties for any sustainable development of the study area. In addition; the existence of natural factors such as areas of low-lying land, topographic depressions, and rising water tables will increase the threat of waterlogging and salinization. It is concluded that it is essential for planners and decision makers to seriously consider taking appropriate action now concerning the recommended mitigation measurements from this study to avoid serious future problems in these areas.";"Arnous, Mohamed O.

When supply of water falls short of commitments to fulfil demand in terms of water quality and quantity within the basin and at the river mouth, for part or all of the year, basins are said to be closing. Basin closure is an anthropogenic process and manifested at societal as well as ecosystem levels, and both its causes and consequences are analyzed.

"AGRIS:US201301925993";"Impacts of extensive grazing and abandonment on grassland soils and productivity";"";"Two long-term (16 year) experiments on intensively managed pastures compared extensive grazing, abandonment and continued intensive grazing and were assessed for impacts on soil parameters, plant nutrient content and ecological indicator values. There was a reduction in soil carbon and nitrogen in the abandoned treatment compared to the intensively managed treatment at the wetter site. At the drier site, extensive grazing resulted in a build up of soil carbon. There was a build up of dead organic matter and a reduction in the nutritive value of the vegetation as grazing was reduced. Indicator values confirmed the reduced soil nutrients and a fall in site pH. There was also a rise in the dominance of plants preferring moist conditions, especially at the wetter site. As biodiversity gains are small, the management of these systems could be seen as a trade-off between managing for production and for soil organic carbon. At the drier site this trade-off is apparent, whereas at the wetter site managing for production also maximises soil carbon content.";"Marriott, C.A.

"AGRIS:US201400192778";"Thermodynamic resource indicators in LCA: a case study on the titania produced in Panzhihua city, southwest China";"";"PURPOSE: While life cycle assessment (LCA) has standardized methods for assessing emission impacts, some comparable methods for the accounting or impact assessment of resource use exist, but are not as mature or standardized. This study contributes to the existing research by offering a comprehensive comparison of the similarities and differences of different resource indicators, in particular those based on thermodynamics, and testing them in a case study on titania (titanium dioxide pigment) produced in Panzhihua city, southwest China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system boundary for resource indicators is defined using a thermodynamic hierarchy at four levels, and the case data for titania also follow that hierarchy. Seven resource indicators are applied. Four are thermodynamics-based—cumulative energy demand (CED), solar energy demand (SED), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment (CEENE)—and three have different backgrounds: abiotic resource depletion potential, environmental priority strategies, and eco-indicator 99. Inventory data for the foreground system has been collected through on-site interviews and visits. Background inventory data are from the database ecoinvent v2.2. Characterizations factors are based on the CML-IA database covering all major methods. Computations are with the CMLCA software. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The scores of resource indicators of the chloride route for titania system are lower than that of the sulfate route by 10–35 %, except in terms of SED. Within the four thermodynamic indicators for resources, CED, CExD, and CEENE have similar scores, while their scores are five orders of magnitude lower than the SED score. Atmospheric resources do not contribute to the SED or CEEND score. Land resources account for a negligible percentage to the SED score and a small percentage to the CEENE score. Non-renewable resources have a dominant contribution to all seven resource indicators. The global production of titania would account for 0.12 and 0.14 % of the total anthropogenic non-renewable resource demand in terms of energy and exergy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: First, we demonstrate the feasibility of thermodynamic resource indicators. We recommend CEENE as the most appropriate one within the four thermodynamic resource indicators for accounting and characterizing resource use. Regarding the case study on the titania produced in China, all the resource indicators except SED show that the sulfate route demands more resource use than the chloride route.";"Liao, Wenjie

"AGRIS:US201400047712";"Ecogeographical land characterization maps as a tool for assessing plant adaptation and their implications in agrobiodiversity studies";"";"Information on plant adaptation can be very useful in agrobiodiversity studies. Ecogeographical land characterization (ELC) maps constitute a new tool in this direction with great potential. To assess the usefulness of this approach, an ELC map of Spain was created through multivariate methods. Its performance to characterize plant habitat preferences was compared with existing ecological regions and land cover maps. Collecting sites and seed weight from eight plant species were used to test the ELC map. Categories from each map were assigned to accessions using collecting sites. Chi-square tests were applied to test if category frequency distributions for each species followed a distribution proportional to the relative frequency of categories in each map. The tests found significant differences in the eight species studied. Thus, Bonferroni confidence intervals (BCI) classified categories from maps in preferred, neutral or avoided habitats. Seed weight was used as a proxy for plant adaptation. Comparison between observed and expected ranking of BCI and quartile classes in terms of seed weight means, and GLM and post-hoc tests carried out to test the effect of these classes upon seed weight showed consistently better results for the ELC map. Species results and applications of ecogeographic maps in plant genetic resources conservation are discussed.";"Parra-Quijano, Mauricio

"AGRIS:US201301961104";"Using 137Cs to estimate wind erosion and dust deposition on grassland in Inner Mongolia-selection of a reference site and description of the temporal variability";"";"AIMS: The aims of this study were to identify areas of wind erosion and dust deposition and to quantify the effects of different grazing intensities on soil redistribution rates in grasslands based on the 137Cs technique. Because the method uses a reference inventory as threshold for erosion or deposition, the classification of any other site as source or sink for dust depends on the accurate selection of this reference site. METHODS: Measurements of 137Cs inventories and depth distributions were carried out at pasture sites with predominant species of Stipa grandis and Leymus chinensis which are grazed with different intensities. Additional measurements were made at arable land, plant-covered sand dunes and alluvial plains. Wind-induced soil erosion and dust deposition rates were calculated from 137Cs inventories by means of the “Profile-Distribution” and the “Mass Balance II” models. RESULTS: The selection of the reference site was based on fluid dynamical and process-determining parameters. The chosen site should meet the following four conditions: (i) located at a summit position with obviously low deposition rates, (ii) sufficient vegetation cover to prevent wind erosion, (iii) plane to exclude water erosion and (iv) in the wind/dust shadow of a higher elevation. The measured reference inventory of 137Cs was 1967(±102) Bqm−2 located at a summit position of moderately grazed Leymus chinensis steppe. The 137Cs inventories at other sites ranged from 1330 Bqm−2 at heavily grazed sites to 5119 Bqm−2 at river deposits, representing annual average soil losses of up to 130 tkm−2 and deposits of up to 540 tkm−2, respectively. The calculated annual averages of dust depositions at ungrazed Leymus chinensis sites were related to the dust storm frequencies of the last 50 years resulting in a description of the temporal variability of annual dust depositions from about 154 tkm−2 in the 1960s to 26 tkm−2 at recent times. Based on this quantification already 80% of the total dust depositions can be related to the 20 years between the 1960s and the end of the 1970s and only 20% to the time between 1980 and 2001. CONCLUSIONS: 137Cs technique is a promising method to assess the effect of grazing intensity and land use types on the spatial variability of wind-induced soil and dust redistribution processes in semi-arid grasslands. However, considerable efforts are needed to identify a reliable reference site, because erosion and deposition induced by wind may occur at the same places. The combination of the dust deposition rates derived from 137Cs profile data with the dust storm frequencies is helpful for a better reconstruction of the temporal variability of dust deposition and wind erosion in this region. The calculated recent deposition rates of about 20 tkm−2 are in good agreement with data of other authors.";"Funk, Roger

"AGRIS:US201600124095";"Different bat guilds perceive their habitat in different ways: a multiscale landscape approach for variable selection in species distribution modelling";"";"CONTEXT: Unveiling the scale at which organisms respond to habitat features is crucial to understand how they are influenced by anthropogenic environmental changes. We implemented species distribution models (SDMs) based on multiple-scale landscape pattern analysis for four bat species representative of different foraging guilds: Nyctalus leisleri, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis emarginatus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus. OBJECTIVES: (a) to assess the environmental factors and the influence of scale on the habitat suitability of bats; (b) to develop an objective methodology to select the best performing variables from a large variable dataset. METHODS: We performed the study in central Italy (Tuscany): 381 variables were derived from topographical and habitat maps using a moving windows analysis set at three spatial scales (1, 5 and 10 km) that are ecologically meaningful for bats. For each species, we ran 381 univariate models to select the variables for multivariate SDMs. RESULTS: All the variables retained in the SDMs described spatial pattern indices underlining the importance of landscape structure for species distribution. Species reacted differently in terms of both scale and landscape pattern. P. pipistrellus only responded to variables at 10 km; N. leisleri and M. emarginatus did so at two scales (5 and 10 km); whereas R. hipposideros also responded to variables at 1 km. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings make it possible to tailor SDMs according to species-specific landscape pattern requirements at appropriate scales. Our approach, which can be easily extended to other taxa and different spatial scales, represents a significant step towards more effective land management planning.";"Ducci, Laura

"AGRIS:US201301961458";"Farmers’ perception and adaptation to climate change: a case study of Sekyedumase district in Ghana";"";"Climate change is projected to have serious environmental, economic, and social impacts on Ghana, particularly on rural farmers whose livelihoods depend largely on rainfall. The extent of these impacts depends largely on awareness and the level of adaptation in response to climate change. This study examines the perception of farmers in Sekyedumase district of Ashanti region of Ghana on climate change and analyzes farmers’ adaptation responses to climate change. A hundred and eighty farming households were interviewed in February and October 2009. Results showed that about 92% of the respondents perceived increases in temperature, while 87% perceived decrease in precipitation over the years. The major adaptation strategies identified included crop diversification, planting of short season varieties, change in crops species, and a shift in planting date, among others. Results of logit regression analysis indicated that the access to extension services, credit, soil fertility, and land tenure are the four most important factors that influence farmers’ perception and adaptation. The main barriers included lack of information on adaptation strategies, poverty, and lack of information about weather. Even though the communities are highly aware of climate issues, only 44.4% of farmers have adjusted their farming practices to reduce the impacts of increasing temperature and 40.6% to decreasing precipitation, giving lack of funds as the main barrier to implementing adaptation measure. Implications for policymaking will be to make credit facilities more flexible, to invest in training more extension officers and more education on climate change and adaptation strategies.";"Fosu-Mensah, B.

Risk-based land  management is a concept that stands out more and more frequently in soil policies adopted by different European countries,  as well as within the framework of the future European directive on soil protection. This concept intends to act as a lever for  sustainable solution development in terms of rehabilitation by ensuring the following principles: (1) reduction of risks  (human health, ecosystems) allowing sites to be reused safely (concept of fitness for use); (2) prevention of any pollutant  dispersion risk (concept of environmental protection); (3) long-term care while minimising the burden of controlling,  maintenance and monitoring. These ideas have been taken as backdrop for the Walloon decree on soil remediation and  rehabilitation of disused economic activity sites. Risk control has been taken as a key point for any decision related to  historically polluted sites. However, to be effective, this option stands out that reliable and efficient methodological tools are  available for land evaluation (risk assessment). Three decision-making tools, specifically developed for the intended  applications in the Walloon Region, are presented in the paper: (1) a global risk evaluation method allowing ranking of  polluted sites; (2) a method to decide, at the end of the first step of the investigation procedure (preliminary soil  investigation), whether further investigations are required or not; (3) a methodological procedure to proceed to a detailed risk assessment at the end of the in-depth investigation step. Perspectives are proposed to improve these first tools. It has also  been shown that the challenge of sustainable solutions for the management of polluted sites finally depends on answers that  will be progressively developed by the scientific community. These have to take into account all aspects of the Walloon  context.";"Halen H.

"AGRIS:US201500082757";"Developing robust field survey protocols in landscape ecology: a case study on birds, plants and butterflies";"";"Sustainable land management requires scientists to provide reliable data on diversity distribution patterns. Resource restrictions limit the affordable sampling effort, both with respect to number of survey sites and amount of effort per site. We compared different levels of survey effort in a case study in Central Romania, varying the number of repeats per site and number of survey sites. Target taxa were plants, birds and butterflies. For plants, we surveyed three 10 m²plots and ten plots of 1 m²at each site. For birds, we used point counts and for butterflies Pollard walks, in both cases with four repeats. We fitted hierarchical community models to estimate true species richness per site. Estimates of true species richness per site strongly correlated with observed species richness. However, hierarchical community models yielded unrealistically high estimates of true species richness per site, hence we used observed richness for further analyses. For each species group, we compared diversity indices from subsets of the dataset with the full dataset. Findings obtained with a reduced survey effort reflected well those obtained with full effort. Moreover, we conducted a power analysis to assess how the number of survey sites affected the minimum detectable effect of landscape heterogeneity on species richness, and found there was an exponential decrease in the minimum detectable effect with increasing number of sites. In combination, our findings suggest that assessing broad diversity patterns in abundant and readily detectable organisms may be possible with relatively low survey effort per site. Our study demonstrates the utility of conducting pilot studies prior to designing large-scale studies on diversity distribution patterns.";"Loos, Jacqueline

"AGRIS:US201301961103";"Integrative approach for landscape-based graph connectivity analysis: a case study with the common frog (Rana temporaria) in human-dominated landscapes";"";"Graph-based analysis is a promising approach for analyzing the functional and structural connectivity of landscapes. In human-shaped landscapes, species have become vulnerable to land degradation and connectivity loss between habitat patches. Movement across the landscape is a key process for species survival that needs to be further investigated for heterogeneous human-dominated landscapes. The common frog (Rana temporaria) was used as a case study to explore and provide a graph connectivity analysis framework that integrates habitat suitability and dispersal responses to landscape permeability. The main habitat patches influencing habitat availability and connectivity were highlighted by using the software Conefor Sensinode 2.2. One of the main advantages of the presented graph-theoretical approach is its ability to provide a large choice of variables to be used based on the study’s assumptions and knowledge about target species. Based on dispersal simulation modelling in potential suitable habitat corridors, three distinct patterns of nodes connections of differing importance were revealed. These patterns are locally influenced by anthropogenic barriers, landscape permeability, and habitat suitability. And they are affected by different suitability and availability gradients to maximize the best possible settlement by the common frog within a terrestrial habitat continuum. The study determined the key role of landscape-based approaches for identifying the “availability-suitability-connectivity” patterns from a local to regional approach to provide an operational tool for landscape planning.";"Decout, Samuel

"AGRIS:US201400190048";"Development of Variable Threshold Models for detection of irrigated paddy rice fields and irrigation timing in heterogeneous land cover";"";"Accurate monitoring of irrigated paddy field area and irrigation timing are of a great concern in agricultural water management due to the substantial consumption of fresh water when irrigating paddy fields. Spectral threshold methods (Xiao et al., 2005) have been widely applied to detect irrigated paddy fields and irrigation timing using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). These methods applied constant additive threshold values (T) to LSWI and compared it to EVI to detect the irrigated paddy fields. In this study, we developed Variable Threshold Models that utilized different pixel-based threshold values depending on sub-pixel land cover heterogeneity and hence, improve detection performance on distributed small-scale paddy fields. Non-irrigated sub-pixels were quantified with irrigation maps produced by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) microwave images. Significant positive correlation between EVI and the sub-pixel numbers of non-irrigated area were found (r=0.87), which resulted in higher T for MODIS pixels with more non-irrigated sub-pixels. Accordingly, a Variable Threshold Model, i.e. a regression model between T and EVI, was developed. With the Variable Threshold Model, agreement rates between MODIS and SAR-based irrigated small-scale paddy field classification doubled compared with that from a fixed threshold value. In comparison with field observations, the Variable Threshold Models showed a mean error of +0.9 days, an improvement over the mean error of +2.8 days from a fixed threshold model. Combined utilization of SAR and MODIS images provides a useful tool for developing a Variable Threshold Model that can enhance accurate monitoring of irrigation dates across heterogeneous paddy field regions.";"Jeong, S.

"AGRIS:RU2015A11481";"MELIORATION OF SOILS IN FOREST NURSERY WITH THE USE OF NON-TRADITIONAL ORGANIC FERTILIZERS";"";"It is important to reclam degraded soils in forest nurseries to get quality planting material. Organic wastes and fertilizers on their base may be used for it. The aim of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness of influence of non-traditional fertilizers on the basis of organic waste on fertility of sod-podzolic soils, growth of seedlings and saplings of trees in forest nurseries. In the course of the research such problems as influence of non-conventional fertilizers on properties of sod-podzolic soils were studied. Use of non-conventional fertilizers does not lead to accumulation of heavy metals in the soil and it improves water and physical and agrochemical properties of the plow layer. The effectiveness of non-conventional fertilizers depends on their composition, physical and chemical characteristics of the primary components, rate of application, initial soil fertility. Sharing of a non-traditional fertilizer and sand allows for optimization of almost all indicators of soil fertility of medium loamy soils, sharing of non-traditional fertilizers and clay allows for optimization of almost all indicators of soil fertility of light soils. An optimum dose of application of non-traditional fertilizer depends on soil texture, type of trees and composition of the fertilizer. It is 50-80 tons / ha for Norway Spruce in light loamy soils, 149-182 tons / ha - in medium loamy soils. It is 50 tons / ha for Scotch Pine in sandy clay soil, 100 tons / ha in sandy and light loamy soil. It is 150 tons / ha for Siberian Larch in the light loamy soil. For amelioration of light in soil texture soils it is recommended to use composts containing more than 50% (by weight) of the wastes of category II (substrate). There should be over 40% (by weight) of heavy soils in the compost of the waste of category I (filler). This will optimize the properties of soil and let grow better seedlings in the nurseries.

"AGRIS:US201500217248";"Urban agriculture and land use in cities: An approach with the multi-functionality and sustainability concepts in the case of Antananarivo (Madagascar)";"";"Urban planners are increasingly interested in agriculture around cities and have to decide whether to maintain or not areas of agricultural land use within and close to growing cities. There is therefore a need for researchers to design tools to guide public decision-making on land use. Various approaches, originating from different disciplines, may be adopted in this respect. We designed an interdisciplinary research program in order to test two related concepts: the “sustainability” and the “multi-functionality” of agriculture. We show that these concepts provide a useful framework for obtaining appropriate knowledge about urban agriculture, which urban planners could apply in real situations. In close collaboration with urban planners, we applied an interdisciplinary research methodology, based on common farm surveys and territorial approaches, to the Antananarivo area (Madagascar). The main functions analyzed were the food production and environmental roles of urban agriculture. Two aspects of sustainability were assessed: the farm sustainability and the territorial sustainability, with expert scores. This approach identified a wide diversity of farming systems that performed differently, depending on their intra- or suburban location. The food supply function appeared to be important not only for fresh produce but also for rice consumption. The function of protection against flooding is now important and this importance will increase with climate change. A diagnosis of sustainability was made and discussed with urban planners: several farming systems and zones were identified in which agriculture was considered important as a means of maintaining or developing the food supply, employment and incomes, and even landscape or environmental quality. We also identified other areas in which poor production conditions and/or the negative effects of urbanization on agriculture jeopardized its sustainability. This methodology appeared to be useful for determining the most appropriate role of urban agriculture in the land-use planning of this city. Our study raises new questions on the subject and should lead to more focused research programmes. We discuss several points of interest and the limitations and possible extension of this method.";"Aubry, C.

"AGRIS:US201400121545";"Site Productivity, the Key to Crop Productivity";"";"If we call a significant yield increase in single crops a ‘green revolution’, then the first green revolution took place about 10 000–12 000 years ago, when humans started to cultivate land. This was also the beginning of civilization. Since then, humans have increasingly transformed the land and natural vegetation and have risen to be the main creators of the biogeosphere. Today, there is hardly any ecosystem around the globe that has not been influenced by humans. It was only in 1930 that the world population reached 2 billion, and since then it has increased to 6 billion in the year 2000. Because of this rapid increase, the demand for food, feed and industrial crops has grown enormously. Half of the 1.5 billion ha of arable land – 18 % of the biologically productive land area of the earth – was first cultivated only in the 20th Century, and mostly forest was sacrificed to meet this requirement. The second green revolution started only in the late 1960s when high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice were designed to overcome the predicted hunger crisis. Great achievements were made, especially in relation to irrigated agriculture, while rain-fed farming was hardly affected by this revolution. World agriculture today faces two major constraints to which not enough attention is paid by scientists and decision makers. First, we increasingly restrict our food basis to a limited number of plant species. Today, 65 % of the world's arable land is reserved for only 21 annual crops. Even more worrying is the fact that 60 % of our food energy and protein comes from only three cereals – wheat, rice and corn. Designing ‘functional’ food using gene technology to improve food quality, for example in rice, will speed up this process of constriction since diversified ingestion is no longer necessary to meet the daily required balance of food types. Secondly, arable land resources are under-utilized because of poor management. Yields of rice, for example, are below the world average of 3.8 t ha(−1) (1998) in 70 countries. If those countries achieved only the average level for their continent, for example 2.2 t ha(−1) in Africa, world rice production could be increased by 17 %. There is a need to invest in better management of arable land to prevent further loss in productivity and simultaneously to investigate under-explored plants to broaden our future food basis.";"Sauerborn, J.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400121545";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-037X.2002.00585.x";"";"";"";"363-367"
"AGRIS:US201600074940";"Bracken distribution in Great Britain: strategies for its control and the sustainable management of marginal land";"";"Bracken is often perceived as a widespread and increasing land management problem. The pollen record of a wide range of sites in Great Britain suggests that the current abundance of bracken is less than or, at worst, equivalent to maximum historical levels. Recently gathered data also suggest that bracken cover is declining. Results of risk assessments of land use change, and experimental and modelling investigations into the effects of climate change are synthesized. This synthesis suggests that there is the potential for increased bracken dominance in northern Britain, spread into new areas at high altitudes, and possible spread into areas with reduced grazing. However, this must be set against any changes in the extent of other vegetation types at the expense of bracken. There is now a long history of bracken control, both in Great Britain and globally. Conventional methods of control (cutting, asulam application) are well understood, but many control attempts do not result in long-term success, as control is often not followed by aftercare. Bracken control is just one part of the process to ensure a sustainable use of resources and to maintain biodiversity. A coherent strategy for bracken control is put forward, a necessary part of which includes the restoration of vegetation and subsequent land management which takes into account an understanding of bracken ecology.";"Pakeman, R.J.

A case study in which a Decision Tree classification method with a boosting algorithm was used in spatially locating individual soil capability classes as estimated in the complex symbol of the CLI database was conducted in Saskatchewan Canada. The input metrics used for the classification include the first four principal components of the original NDVI images, phenological parameters, topographic factors, land cover and spatial dependence images. Validation showed high Kappa coefficients for the mapped soil capability classes within homogeneous soil polygons and high R-squares between the mapped soil area and CLI-estimated area within heterogeneous polygons. Results confirm the hypothesis that integrating parameters derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) 250m time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with ancillary data may serve as a comprehensive tool for classification of soil capability.";"Li, Zhe

Future land-use change in the region could have dramatic impacts on ecological resources and processes. A scenario-based modeling framework is needed to support the analysis of potential land-use change in an uncertain future, and to mitigate potentially negative future impacts on ecosystem processes. We developed a scenario-based modeling framework to analyze potential future land-use change in the Great Plains. A unique scenario construction process, using an integrated modeling framework, historical data, workshops, and expert knowledge, was used to develop quantitative demand for future land-use change for four IPCC scenarios at the ecoregion level. The FORE-SCE model ingested the scenario information and produced spatially explicit land-use maps for the region at relatively fine spatial and thematic resolutions. Spatial modeling of the four scenarios provided spatial patterns of land-use change consistent with underlying assumptions and processes associated with each scenario. Economically oriented scenarios were characterized by significant loss of natural land covers and expansion of agricultural and urban land uses. Environmentally oriented scenarios experienced modest declines in natural land covers to slight increases. Model results were assessed for quantity and allocation disagreement between each scenario pair. In conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey's Biological Carbon Sequestration project, the scenario-based modeling framework used for the Great Plains is now being applied to the entire United States.";"Sohl, Terry L.

"AGRIS:US2016221725";"New Migration Needs a NEMP (A New European Migration Policy)";"";"In almost all European countries there is a wide and growing gap between the goals of national immigration policy and its actual outcomes. The main reason for the failure of national migration policies is the loss of effective competence to control today's migration flows on a national level. Once national governments had closed the front door of legal immigration more or less strictly, most of the entries to fortress Europe occurred through the side door (asylum seekers, refugees, family reunion) or through the back door (illegal immigrants). As a result, there is an increasing need for a common European migration policy. This paper outlines the framework of a NEMP - a New European Migration Policy. NEMP is a first step from national ad hoc regulations towards a more conceptual European migration strategy. The basic idea of NEMP is that it is not the entry or the movement of people from abroad that generates migration problems. Rather, it is ""stay"" and ""work"" that may become a controversial issue. Consequently, NEMP advocates a shift of the policy focus from the control of moves to the control of residence and especially control of the illegal activities of illegal foreign workers.In nahezu allen Ländern der EU öffnet sich eine Schere zwischen den Zielen einer nationalen Migrationspolitik und den tatsächlichen Ergebnissen. Der entscheidende Grund für dieses Versagen liegt im faktischen Kompetenzverlust, den Nationalstaaten erlitten haben. Sie glauben zwar, Migration regulieren zu können. Tatsächlich aber finden Einwanderungswillige Alternativen, um ihr Ziel zu erreichen. Wird die Fronttür der legalen Wirtschaftsmigration geschlossen, drängen Menschen durch die Seitenpforte in das Europäische Haus. Sie machen dann nicht wirtschaftliche, sondern humanitäre Motive geltend. Dazu gehören Asylsuchende, Flüchtlinge und Familienangehörige. Wem auch dieser Weg verbaut ist, kann es dann noch durch die verbotene Hintertür versuchen. Als Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass in einem Wirtschaftsraum ohne innere Grenzen eine gemeinsame Migrationspolitik erforderlich wird. Dieses Diskussionspapier skizziert die Eckpfeiler einer NEMP - einer Neuen Europäischen Migrationspolitik. NEMP ist ein erster Schritt von einer nationalen ad hoc zu einer konzeptionellen europäischen Migrationsstrategie. NEMP basiert auf dem Grundsatz, dass nicht das ""Gehen"", sondern das ""Stehen"" und das ""Arbeiten"" zu Migrationsproblemen führen kann. Deshalb sollte das migrationspolitische Schwergewicht nicht so sehr bei der Eingangskontrolle liegen, sondern bei Aufenthalt und Beschäftigung der Menschen von außerhalb Europas.";"Straubhaar, Thomas";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2000-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"150";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016221725";"http://purl.umn.edu/26171";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500217247";"Assessing the fragmentation of construction land in urban areas: An index method and case study in Shunde, China";"";"The fragmentation of construction land due to decentralised urban development, disorderly mixed land use, and large-scale transportation infrastructure poses a threat to urban integrity. There is a need to quantify the fragmentation level in a consistent way for inclusion in planning-related decisions. In the context of China's urban sprawl, this study develops a quantitative and intuitive index approach that planners can use to analyse multiple fragmentation features of construction land within urban areas. The approach can be used in planning policy reviews for timely land-use assessment and can be integrated into urban planning processes for developing strategic land-use scenarios. The method was applied in Shunde, a typical urban area in southern China, and construction-land fragmentation and its impacts on environmental quality were analysed. The results show that the entire built-up area in Shunde displays a high level of fragmentation. Patches of industrial and rural residence have been identified specifically higher fragmentation level. The shortage of available construction land makes land consolidation within built-up areas very important in planning Shunde's future development. Moreover, the land shortage requires the progressive reduction of construction land fragmentation. The results of the study also indicate that although land fragmentation has been affected by transportation infrastructure and the existence of rivers and hills in this region, decentralised decisions from hierarchical local governance regimes have greatly exacerbated this situation. Shunde provides examples of typical land-use problems associated with quasi-urbanised regions in China; construction-land fragmentation is a greater determinant for the sustainable development of urban and rural areas than construction-land growth.";"Wei, Yaping

"AGRIS:US201400160611";"Hydrological modelling of drained blanket peatland";"";"Open ditch drainage is a commonly implemented land management practice in upland blanket peatlands, particularly in the UK, where policy decisions between the 1940s and 1970s led to widespread drainage of the uplands. The change in the hydrological regime associated with the drainage of blanket peat is poorly understood, yet has perceived importance for flooding, low flows and water quality. We propose a new simplified physics-based model that allows the associated hydrological processes and flow responses to be explored. The model couples four one-dimensional models to represent a three-dimensional hillslope, allowing for the exploration of flow and water table response throughout the model domain for a range of drainage configurations and peat properties. The model is tested against a data set collected from Oughtershaw Beck, UK, with results showing good model performance for wet periods although less conformity with borehole observations during rewetting periods. A wider exploration of model behaviour indicates that the model is consistent with the hydrological response reported in the literature for a number of drained blanket peat sites, and therefore has potential to provide guidance to decision makers concerning the effects of management practices. Through a global sensitivity analysis, we conclude that further field investigations to assist in the surface and drain roughness parameterisation would help reduce the uncertainty in the model predictions.";"Ballard, C.E.

Several drivers have been implicated including climate change, land management change, nitrogen and sulphur deposition and CO2 enrichment. Analysis of stream water data, supported by evidence from laboratory studies, indicates that an effect of declining sulphur deposition on catchment soil chemistry is likely to be the primary mechanism, but there are relatively few long term soil water chemistry records in the UK with which to investigate this, and other, hypotheses directly. In this paper, we assess temporal relationships between soil solution chemistry and parameters that have been argued to regulate DOC production and, using a unique set of co-located measurements of weather and bulk deposition and soil solution chemistry provided by the UK Environmental Change Network and the Intensive Forest Monitoring Level II Network. We used statistical non-linear trend analysis to investigate these relationships at 5 forested and 4 non-forested sites from 1993 to 2011. Most trends in soil solution DOC concentration were found to be non-linear. Significant increases in DOC occurred mostly prior to 2005. The magnitude and sign of the trends was associated qualitatively with changes in acid deposition, the presence/absence of a forest canopy, soil depth and soil properties. The strongest increases in DOC were seen in acidic forest soils and were most clearly linked to declining anthropogenic acid deposition, while DOC trends at some sites with westerly locations appeared to have been influenced by shorter-term hydrological variation. The results indicate that widespread DOC increases in surface waters observed elsewhere, are most likely dominated by enhanced mobilization of DOC in surficial organic horizons, rather than changes in the soil water chemistry of deeper horizons. While trends in DOC concentrations in surface horizons have flattened out in recent years, further increases may be expected as soil chemistry continues to adjust to declining inputs of acidity.";"Sawicka, K.

To increase the productiveness of the forests, administration staff from abroad was employed, whose expertise should introduce new forest management based on the principles of the German forest school. The methods of  the forest management should be changed as much as possible, but the bondsmen raised against all such solutions and they hindered mostly very effectively every realization of these  innovations. All these measures were punishable according to the laws valid in that time in the region,  the direction of the estate being at the same time also administrative, juridical, police and recruiting authority. The feudal order was already   pretty weak in that time and so the estate authorities could not exhibit the expected strictness and expediousness in the processing the  denunciations of the forest management staff dealing with  forests  and pasture excesses.

We draw insights from discursive institutionalism and use a comparative case study approach to analyse and compare a situation of social conflict over the Natural Park declaration in the Sierra de Urbión, and a civil society led collaborative process to develop management plans for the “Sierra de Cabrejas” in Soria. The implementation of the EU Habitats Directive generated different outcomes in these two cases, which unfolded in the context of the same nature conservation legislation and national and provincial administrative structures but differed in terms of types of forests involved, property rights arrangements and forest use histories. We critically examine the influence of the institutional context and dominant discourses on the emergence of outcomes: conflict emerged where local institutions and discourses were threatened by the EU directive, while collaboration was possible where local institutions and counter-discourses were weak. We find that the institutional context plays an important part in determining local discourses in the implementation of forest conservation policies. Yet local counter-discourses have limited influence in the implementation and policy processes in the face of contestation by the discourses of regional civil servants conservation activists.";"Pecurul-Botines, Mireia

Ecosocial systems are the units for management. The accumulation of ecological, economic, and social capital is the objective of management, the reduction of maintenance costs is the key strategy, and technologies must satisfy ecological, economic, and social criteria. Interacting social system components are communities, facilitators, scientists, and political as well as administrative organizations. An adaptive approach to management allows flexibility in human and financial resource allocation and results in changes in knowledge and efficacy of management operations. The implementation strategy at two sites in Ethiopia relies on a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, human and cattle health management set the conditions for development. In Stage 2, the ecosocial system is kept on a trajectory to enhanced ecological, economic, and social capital. In each stage, the assignment of responsibilities leads to four implementation phases. In Stage 1, successful precision targeting of tsetse and drug-based Trypanosoma spp. control increased the economic and social capital at the Luke site in southwestern Ethiopia but threatened the ecological capital because of overstocking and land degradation. In Stage 2, a women’s group living in the outskirts of Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) transformed barren land into a horticultural enterprise to enhance ecosystem service provision, including production of horticultural goods, and increase soil fertility expressed by nutrients and water availability.

To quantitatively evaluate accuracies of the new surface type product, a visual interpretation-based validation was performed in which high-resolution satellite images and other ancillary data were used as the reference. The validation result based on the large validation data set indicated that (78.64 ± 0.57)% overall classification accuracy was achieved.";"Zhang, Rui

"AGRIS:US201301872371";"Management strategies for maximizing carbon storage and tree species diversity in cocoa-growing landscapes";"";"How do we manage the trade-offs between agricultural yields, biodiversity and ecosystem services? One option is to adopt high yield, intensive farming that allows land to be spared elsewhere for conservation (land sparing); another is to adopt low yield, extensive farming over a greater area that retains more biodiversity and protects ecosystem services (wildlife-friendly farming). We examine which is likely to be the best option to achieve high carbon storage and tree species richness in tropical cocoa-growing landscapes. Increased management intensity explained higher yield and in turn this explained a reduction in carbon storage and species richness. Substantial differences in species richness between forest and cocoa farms suggested that land sparing would conserve more tree species than wildlife-friendly farming. The optimal strategy for carbon storage depends on the cocoa yield in the wildlife-friendly farming system. At low cocoa yields, wildlife-friendly farming is the best option; whereas at higher yields land sparing is best. Our results suggest that the best land management strategy for biodiversity and ecosystem services might differ depending on details of the farming systems involved. Management of the trade-offs between agriculture, biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical forest landscapes needs to consider current and expected future yields.";"Wade, Amy S.I.

This study presents findings on household food security in the North Central Nigeria (NCN). The first objective was to review and highlight the commonly used measures of households' food security with their pros and cons; second, to determine the food security status of households; and third, to analyse the determinants of household food security status in the study area. This study employed a well-structured questionnaire to obtain data from a cross-sectional survey of 396 households selected from Kwara and Kogi States of NCN with a multi-stage sampling technique. To analyse the data, descriptive statistics and multivariate-ordered logit analyses were used. The descriptive results revealed that only 16% of the households were food secure (FS), 36% food insecure without hunger, 28% FS with moderate hunger and 21% food insecure with severe hunger. The results from the ordered logit revealed that geographical location, marital status, gender of the household head, household size, food dietary diversity, total household expenditure, level of education, occupation of household head, household dependency ratio, social capital and agricultural land-holding size significantly affect households food security status. To transit from food insecure to FS, birth control, participation in agriculture, gender-sensitive food insecurity alleviation policies that enhance endowments of female-headed households are imperative.";"Obayelu, Abiodun Elijah";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"food security;land ownership";"Land & Food Security";"";"NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600085330";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2164828X.2013.845559";"";"";"";"241-256"

"AGRIS:US201500220970";"Woodland habitat structures are affected by both agricultural land management and abiotic conditions";"";"CONTEXT: The identification of habitat structures with biologically meaningful links to habitat quality has enabled an increased understanding of wildlife distributions in fragmented landscapes. However, knowledge is lacking of where these structures occur in the landscape. OBJECTIVES: For a broad-scale agricultural landscape, we investigated how the occurrence and abundance of wildlife habitat structures is related to abiotic conditions and land management practices, and whether this differed between old growth and regrowth woodland. METHODS: We used generalised linear mixed models to investigate the distribution of eight habitat structures in the South-West Slopes bioregion of south-eastern Australia. RESULTS: Only one habitat structure, canopy depth, was related to abiotic conditions alone, whereas only leaf litter cover was related to land management practices only. Each of the other structures (abundance of logs, large trees, hollow-bearing trees, mid-sized trees and dead trees, and amount of native grass cover) was related to a combination and/or interaction of abiotic conditions and land management practices. Old growth woodland had higher log, large tree and hollow-bearing tree abundance, whereas regrowth woodland had higher mid-sized tree and dead tree abundance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings inform key management prescriptions that can be used to improve conservation efforts so they have strong, quantifiable effects on wildlife habitat in temperate agricultural landscapes. Our case study shows that by understanding how management actions in specific abiotic conditions lead to the increased occurrence or abundance of particular habitat structures, management can be spatially targeted to alternative conservation strategies relevant to the landscape of interest.";"Ikin, Karen

In the present study, we aimed to assess the regional scale impact of LULC on climate change using Jiangxi Province, China, as a case study. To obtain reliable climate trends, we applied the standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT) to surface air temperature and precipitation data for the period 1951–1999. We also compared the temperature trends computed from Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) datasets and from our analysis. To examine the regional impacts of land surface types on surface air temperature and precipitation change integrating regional topography, we used the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method. Precipitation series were found to be homogeneous. Comparison of GHCN and our analysis on adjusted temperatures indicated that the resulting climate trends varied slightly from dataset to dataset. OMR trends associated with surface vegetation types revealed a strong surface warming response to land barrenness and weak warming response to land greenness. A total of 81.1� % of the surface warming over vegetation index areas (0–0.2) was attributed to surface vegetation type change and regional topography. The contribution of surface vegetation type change decreases as land cover greenness increases. The OMR precipitation trend has a weak dependence on surface vegetation type change. We suggest that LULC integrating regional topography should be considered as a force in regional climate modeling.";"Wang, Qi

"AGRIS:US2016203540";"Supply-side Policies to Conserve Biodiversity and Save the Orangutan from Oil Palm Expansion: An Economic Assessment";"";"Tropical forests are biodiversity-rich but are dwindling at a rapid rate, not only in Southeast Asia but elsewhere also. The result is a loss of natural ecosystems, a reduction in carbon sequestration, and increasing global extinction of wild species, including iconic species. While several developments contribute to the destruction of tropical forests, the main threat comes from their clearing for the purpose of agricultural production, for example in the Amazon Basin for the expansion of the beef industry and soya bean cultivation. In Borneo and Sumatra, the principal threat to tropical forests comes from the expansion of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation. This is expected to result in significant biodiversity loss and is a danger to the continuing existence of the iconic orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). The preferred route for oil palm expansion is by the conversion of lowland tropical forests to plantations. Lowland tropical forests are the prime habitat of the orangutan and this species is especially at risk as a result of oil palm expansion. Two supply-side policies have been suggested in the literature as ways to reduce this expansion and reduce pressure on species such as the orangutan. It has been recommended that Imperata cylindrica grasslands be used to help accommodate future oil palm expansion in Borneo and Sumatra and that emphasis be placed on raising the yield of oil palms. It is hypothesised that this will reduce the demand for clearing tropical forest for the purpose of oil palm expansion. Both of these hypotheses are critically evaluated by means of economic analysis. It is concluded that neither of these policies are likely to be very effective in reducing the clearing of tropical forests in Borneo and Sumatra in order to grow oil palm.";"Tisdell, Clement A.

"AGRIS:US201600181021";"Simulation of vegetation feedbacks on local and regional scale precipitation in West Africa";"";"Planned changes to land use in West Africa have been proposed to both combat desertification and to preserve biodiversity in the region, however, there is an urgent need for tools to assess the effects of these proposed changes on local and regional scale precipitation. We use a high-resolution, convection-permitting numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to study how the initiation and propagation of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) depends on the surface vegetation cover. The simulations covered a 4-day period during the West African monsoon in August 2006. In many aspects of the simulations, there was evidence of vegetation type exerting a significant influence on the location of precipitation where the influence of orography and coastal water was minimal. In this study, vegetation was classified according to the fractional coverage of tree (>30%) and grass (>30%) plant functional types. Tree-grass boundary cover was defined where more than 3 grid cells of both tree and grass occurred in a moving 3Ã3 window, which was further enlarged using a 3 grid cell (â¼12km) buffer. We found that over the whole study region (5N to 17N and 11W to 9E) 33.8% of convective initiations occur over tree-grass boundaries that cover only 28.4% of the land surface. This is significantly more than would be expected by chance (p=0.0483), providing support to the hypothesis that vegetation gradients provide heat and moisture gradients, of a similar magnitude to that of soil moisture. Additionally, we found that on average, more time under an MCS occurred over boundary cover and orography, followed by tree cover, during the afternoon and evening period, thus supporting the hypothesis that land cover type influences the location of larger propagating systems. Contrasting patterns were found in the quantity of precipitation between small-scale convective cells and larger scale MCS. More small-scale precipitation accumulated, on average, over grass cover during the afternoon period, indicating a tendency for small-scale convection, initiated over boundaries, to prefer the drier and warmer grass side of vegetation boundaries in the afternoon period. However, once these smaller scale convective cells merge together to form larger MCS, a tendency for the most intense precipitation to fall over tree cover was observed. When intense precipitation (>10mm per hour) occurred simultaneously over tree, boundary and grass cover, we found the highest precipitation rate to be most frequently over tree cover (48.4%), and least frequently over boundary cover (19.9%), indicating a preference of MCS for cooler, more moist forest cover. These results show for the first time that convection-permitting NWP models do exhibit responses to vegetation similar to those observed in the real world, and therefore are useful tools to assess the impacts of proposed future land use changes.";"Hartley, Andrew J.

The paper provides an overview and a comparison of land markets covering the three candidate countries for European Union membership: Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia and Turkey. We analyse and compare agricultural land structures and factors driving land markets. The analyses are based on the available cross-section and time-series evidence on agricultural land structures and land productivity (yields). The land productivity measured by production per hectare of agricultural land varies between the three countries. Agricultural land structures are the result of historical evolution in land markets and land-leasing developments with additional different institutional environments and agrarian and land reforms.

Past stand-scale structures at Siggaboda nature reserve in southern Sweden";"";"Fossil pollen and plant macrofossils over the last 2000 years are documented from three small forest hollows in Southern Sweden. One of the sites is inside a 5 ha highly prized old growth mixed Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies forest of high biodiversity which has been protected since 1940. The other two hollows are located 400 and 700 m away in an outlying buffer zone established in 1995 which is mainly coniferous plantation forest. The results show that the area has been forested for at least 2000 years, but that forest composition has been under continuous change, most rapid over the last 200 years. The reduction of deciduous tree pollen particularly Quercus, Tilia, Alnus and Corylus, and the immigration of Fagus and Picea can be observed at all three sites. However, the temperate deciduous trees (Quercus or Fagus) have been much more common in the ‘hotspot' than in the surrounding forests over the last c. 200 years, and significantly more common at least 2000 years before that. Even though the vegetation has been dynamic through time, the lower human intervention in the ‘hotspot' area compared with the surrounding matrix forests has facilitated the longevity of deciduous trees and the many rare species which are associated with them. The palaeoecological record of key species and information on past use of the wider forest area revealed in this study, indicates how future management will require flexibility to maintain conservation ‘hotspots'.";"Hannon, Gina E.

This study examined the condition and projected yields of nine different site preparation treatments on two high-elevation sites in central British Columbia. Treatments included the following: raw planting (i.e., no site preparation); scalping; mounding; chemical site preparation; chemical brushing; and combinations of mounding and chemical treatments. All treatments were manually planted with 2+1 bare-root interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) seedlings. By age 15, trees growing on prepared sites had significantly greater survival, larger stem diameters, and taller tree heights than did trees that were raw planted as seedlings. Moreover, site preparation generally led to earlier and less costly compliance with mandatory reforestation requirements. Growth and yield simulations predicted raw-planted timber volumes that were just 33%-51% of the volumes in the most productive treatments. Financial returns varied as well. Site preparation typically resulted in larger land expectation values than that resulting from raw planting; however, the results were sensitive to rotation length and discount rate. Collectively, these results suggest that moderate investments in site preparation may lead to a more profitable allocation of regeneration resources and a greater future timber supply.";"Hawkins, C.B.D.

"AGRIS:US201400004613";"Assessing the soil erosion control service of ecosystems change in the Loess Plateau of China";"";"Soil erosion in terrestrial ecosystems, as an important global environmental problem, significantly impacts on environmental quality and social economy. By protecting soil from wind and water erosion, terrestrial ecosystems supply human beings with soil erosion control service, one of the fundamental ecosystem services that ensure human welfare. The Loess Plateau was one of the regions in the world that suffered from severe soil erosion. In the past decades, restoration projects were implemented to improve soil erosion control in the region. The Grain-to-Green project, converting slope croplands into forest or grasslands, launched in 1999 was the most massive one. It is needed to assess the change of soil erosion control service brought about by the project. This study evaluated the land cover changes from 2000 to 2008 by satellite image interpretation. Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was employed for the soil erosion control assessment for the same period with localized parameters. Soil retention calculated as potential soil erosion (erosion without vegetation cover) minus actual soil erosion was applied as indicator for soil erosion control service. The results indicate that ecosystem soil erosion control service has been improved from 2000 to 2008 as a result of vegetation restoration. Average soil retention rate (the ratio of soil retention to potential soil loss in percentage) was up to 63.3% during 2000–2008. Soil loss rate in 34% of the entire plateau decreased, 48% unchanged and 18% slightly increased. Areas suffering from intense erosion shrank and light erosion areas expanded. Zones with slope gradient of 8°–35° were the main contribution area of soil loss. On average, these zones produced 82% of the total soil loss with 45.5% of the total area in the Loess Plateau. Correspondingly, soil erosion control capacity was significantly improved in these zones. Soil loss rate decreased from 5000tkm−2yr−1 to 3600tkm−2yr−1, 6900tkm−2yr−1 to 4700tkm−2yr−1, and 8500tkm−2yr−1 to 5500tkm−2yr−1 in the zones with slope gradient of 8°–15°, 15°–25°, and 25°–35° respectively. However, the mean soil erosion rate in areas with slope gradient over 8° was still larger than 3600tkm−2yr−1, which is far beyond the tolerable erosion rate of 1000tkm−2yr−1. Thus, soil erosion is still one of the top environmental problems that need more ecological restoration efforts.";"Fu, Bojie

Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of drought events, with uncertain consequences for soil microbial communities. In this study we tested the hypothesis that agricultural management used to enhance soil carbon stocks would increase the stability of microbial community structure and activity in response to water-stress. Soil was sampled from a long-term field trial with three soil carbon management systems and was used in a laboratory study of the effect of a dry–wet cycle on organic C mineralisation and microbial community structure. After a drying–rewetting event, soil microcosms were maintained wet and microbial community structure and abundance as well as microbial respiration were measured for four weeks. The results showed that the NO-TILL management system, with the highest soil organic matter content and respiration rate, had a distinct bacterial community structure relative to the conventional and the TILL without fertiliser systems. In all management systems, the rewetting event clearly modified microbial community structure and activity. Both returned to their pre-drought state after 28 days. However, the magnitude of variation of C mineralisation was lower (i.e. the resistance to stress was higher) in the NO-TILL system. The genetic structure of the NO-TILL bacterial communities was most modified by water-stress and exhibited a slower recovery rate. This suggests that land use management can increase microbial functional resistance to drought stress via the establishment of bacterial communities with particular metabolic capacities. Nevertheless, the resilience rates of C mineralisation were similar among management regimes, suggesting that similar mechanisms occur, maybe due to a common soil microbial community legacy.";"Kaisermann, Aurore

The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5 km² (93.8 % of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6 km² (24.5 % of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of >0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920–1973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of >75 ha of forest loss during 1920–1973 while, only 15 grids have shown >75 ha loss during 1973–1989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of reserve in the long term under the current forest management practices. The present work will stand as the most up-to-date assessment on the forest cover of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity.";"Satish, K.

"AGRIS:US201600123395";"Multi‐Taxa Assessment of Biodiversity Change After Single and Recurrent Wildfires in a Brazilian Amazon Forest";"";"In the last decades, due to human land management that uses fire as a tool, and due to abnormal droughts, many tropical forests have become more susceptible to recurrent wildfires with negative consequences for biodiversity. Yet, studies are usually focused on few taxa and rarely compare different fire frequencies. We examined if the effects of single and recurrent fires are consistent for leaf litter ants, dung beetles, birds (sampled with point‐counts PC and mist net‐MN), saplings, and trees. Recurrent fires had a great effect on forest structure, reducing live tree biomass and number of lianas, and increasing canopy openness and numbers of saplings alive. Recurrent fires had consistently stronger effects on species richness and composition across all sample groups than single fires, except ants. Birds and plants were more grouped in the congruence analysis. The average dissimilarities between control and recurrent‐burned forest were higher than between control and once‐burned forest for all sample groups, furthermore birds and vegetation communities in recurrent‐burned forest are almost entirely dissimilar from the unburned forest. While beta diversity of ants, birds (MN), and trees was not affected by the frequency of fire, it changed for dung beetles, birds (PC), and saplings. Effects of fire on faunal community structure were more due to indirect effects, through vegetation, than through the fire itself. These results reinforce the effect of single and recurrent fires on tropical forests, and highlight the mechanisms acting behind them. Policy‐makers need to explicitly address protection of tropical forests from wildfires in conservation planning.";"Silveira, Juliana M.

"AGRIS:US201500066230";"Mitigating soil erosion through farm-level adoption of soil and water conservation measures in Samanalawewa Watershed, Sri Lanka";"";"Soil erosion by water is currently one of the most notable types of land degradation in Samanalawewa Watershed in Sri Lanka, creating copious environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Thus, with the aim of detecting and mapping the rates of human-induced soil erosion in the watershed, remote sensing and geographic information system based modelling and field experiments were carried out. The results of the assessment disclosed that the present rate of human-induced soil erosion varies from 0 to 289 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ with the majority of the area exceeding the natural rate of soil erosion by 14 to 33 times at present. However, the average rate of human-induced soil erosion has declined dramatically from 19.8 to 4.3 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ from 1986 to 2008. In order to analyse the significant determinants of farm-level adoption of soil and water conservation measures, binary logistic regression procedure was applied using the data collected through a household survey (n = 201). The most significant (p<0.01) variables of the study were the farmers’ perceptions of soil erosion problems, gender of the household head, training on soil and water conservation, and ascertained advice from agricultural extension officers while the variables regarding past awareness about soil conservation technologies and off-farm income were significant at p<0.05. Furthermore, the study revealed that the majority (60.2%) of the farmers in the study area had been adopting different types of soil and water conservation measures for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, owing to the current decreasing rate of soil erosion, the soil and water conservation costs and the ratios of human-induced soil erosion vs natural soil erosion had declined significantly while the productivity of their lands had gone up.";"Udayakumara, E.

"AGRIS:US201600007892";"Density and distribution of a colonizing front of the American black bear Ursus americanus";"";"Effective management of small expanding populations is aided by the availability of reliable estimates of distribution, as well as by demographic characteristics such as population density, genetic diversity and sex ratio. The range of the black bear Ursus americanus in the southeastern United States is expanding to include areas from which it has been extirpated for more than a century. Lack of baseline demographic data in recently reoccupied areas leaves little information on which to base emerging management needs. We estimated the current extent of expansion at the colonizing front of a black bear population in the central Appalachian Mountains and identified landscape-scale habitat characteristics affecting the expansion. In 2007, we genotyped hair samples collected throughout a 8,205-km² area at six microsatellite loci to identify individual black bears and estimate genetic diversity. We used capture-recapture and occupancy analyses to estimate density and distribution of black bears in our study area. Our results suggest that black bears were not uniformly distributed, but were localized to high elevations and protected public conservation lands. Limited availability of high elevations to the west, north and northeast of our study area may limit further expansion. Despite a limited distribution and low estimated population density (7.51 bears/100 km²), genetic diversity at genotyped loci was high (mean Hₒ == 0.81). Until the population grows further, the small number of individuals in the region may be sensitive to management practices that result in mortalities, especially to females. Our research exemplifies the utility of remote genetic sampling to estimate population demographics of wide-ranging mammals throughout a large study area, particularly where private land ownership hinders intensive study.";"Frary, Vincent J.

"AGRIS:US201400138512";"Effects of large native herbivores on other animals";"";"Large mammalian herbivores are major drivers of the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems world‐wide, and changes in their abundance have resulted in many populations being actively managed. Many empirical studies have identified that abundant mammalian herbivores can have negative impacts on biodiversity, but there has been no specific review of the impacts of native mammalian herbivores. We assessed the peer‐reviewed literature on the effects of large native herbivores on other animals. We aimed to quantitatively synthesize current knowledge, identify gaps and limitations in the literature, and highlight priorities for future research. Most empirical studies of herbivory effects compared only two levels of herbivory (76%), and meta‐analysis showed that very high densities of herbivores, when compared with very low densities, had mostly negative effects on other animal species. These negative effects were usually attributed to changes in the quantity and/or structure of vegetation. Only 24% of papers studied animal responses across a gradient of herbivore densities, and nonlinear responses to herbivory, as well as responses to low and moderate herbivore densities, remain poorly understood. The literature also was dominated by short‐term studies (76% sampled animal responses for 2� years or less), and there was a high incidence of confounding factors among studies (38% of studies). In addition, many studies used only coarse metrics to assess effects (e.g. only 33% of studies assessed species composition) and few included community‐level synthesis (only 31% of studies reported results from more than one animal class). Synthesis and applications. Critical questions remain for both basic ecology and the management of large native herbivores for biodiversity. Key knowledge gaps include (i) nonlinear responses to herbivore pressure, (ii) how responses differ between different herbivores, (iii) the spatial and (iv) the temporal variation of responses, (v) how the effects of herbivores interact with other land management activities and (vi) the mechanisms driving cascading effects through ecosystems. We identify ways to address these gaps and emphasize the need for studies which employ contrasts over a gradient of ecologically relevant herbivore densities and biologically meaningful time frames.";"Foster, Claire N.

As a result, the rationale for land protection to achieve floodplain conservation and restoration has shifted to require that lands must also have multiple and systemic threat abatement benefits. The Mississippi River Flood of 2011 highlighted the need for increased floodplain complexes along the Mississippi River to provide both systemic threat abatement and conservation benefits. We used spatial analysis, landowner outreach, and market assessment to examine ways to enhance land protection in the Atchafalaya River Basin Floodway, the largest river basin swamp North America and the site of two employed floodway locations during the 2011 flood. We identified six Priority Conservation Areas (77,084 ha) in the floodway that are largely privately owned (mean 78.2 ± 6.4%), with forest dominated by Taxodium distichum (baldcypress) and hydrologic and water quality characteristics considered most suitable for baldcypress regeneration (31.2 ± 2.4% and 10.2 ± 3.0% of area, respectively). Landowners expressed high (80%) interest in land protection programs and found the range of property values derived from market analyzes (minimal protection—$346 USD/ha; additional protections—up to $2,223 USD/ha) to be reasonable. We seek to: (1) enhance current land protection in the Atchafalaya River Basin and (2) provide a model for using land protection to increase the number of floodplains for both systemic threat abatement and conservation benefits.";"Piazza, Bryan P.

A study was undertaken to determine the effects of heavy grazing primarily on richness of vascular plant species across the arid and semi-arid rangeland biomes of South Africa. Major grazing contrasts were systematically identified for sampling in rangelands of Succulent Karoo, Nama-Karoo, Thicket, Grassland, Kalahari dune savanna and Mopane savanna. The related parameters of species diversity, evenness and turnover were also examined and analysed at the whole site level. The study represents a new site-level comparison of earlier individual studies that also necessitated recalculation and standardization of original data, where appropriate. Impacts of heavy grazing on plant species richness were found to vary from negligible or slightly positive to distinctly negative, depending on site. The sharp reductions in richness may have been associated with special secondary conditions that can occur in arid areas. Species diversity did not track species richness well and was often dominated by species evenness patterns. Moderate to substantial turnover of species occurred, even with negligible change in species richness. Species turnover was largely associated with replacement of species, except on one site where turnover was more evenly split between its replacement and nestedness components. Heavy grazing altered species composition on all study sites, usually with reduced grazing quality and favouring annual plants. Surprisingly few of the replacement species on most of the study areas were alien or exotic. Remarkably, the magnitude of change in species richness across the limited rainfall gradient of the study often greatly exceeded changes associated with the heavy grazing levels at each site. Use of the significant non-linear relationship found between loss of plant canopy cover through grazing and the relative decline in species richness needs further exploration.";"Rutherford, M.C.

The primary objective of the current study is to determine the effects of soil type and land use-land cover on SOC in Maden Dere Watershed. To determine land use and land cover of the study area, Geoeye satellite image was used. Four main land use and land cover that are forest, pasture, orchard and cultivated land were determined. Results indicate soil types and land use-land cover were two influencing factors of SOC density spatial variation. SOC density of soil profiles, Haplustept (37.58 kg/m2) was significantly higher than other soil great groups. Main reasons of this result are indicated as profile depth and pedological development. In addition, it was determined land use and land cover affect on SOC by taking soil samples. For surface soils SOC density, the lowest average carbon storage (5.05 kg/m2) was found in cultivated soils. In conclusion, it should be developed proper land use policy and sustainable soil management and cropping practices to combat the ongoing soil degradation and improve soil fertility in the study area.";"Dengiz, Orhan; Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, Samsun

Where mechanisms to pay for ES exist, they may serve as incentives to embark on habitat restoration projects. We evaluated the potential of newly established carbon markets in the United States to incentivize afforestation along riparian corridors, by comparing the income earnable by carbon offset credits with the costs of planting, maintaining, and registering such a restoration project in California. We used a 20‐year chronosequence of riparian forest sites along the Sacramento River as our model project. We found that carbon credits can repay more than 100% of costs after two decades of regrowth, if sufficient effort is put into sampling intensity in the first post‐restoration decade. However, carbon credits alone are unlikely to entice landowners currently engaged in agricultural activities to switch from farming crops to farming habitat.";"Matzek, Virginia

"AGRIS:US201600180378";"impact of expanding flooded land area on the annual evaporation of rice";"";"The amount of published data on annual evaporation on rice remains extremely limited despite the role of rice as a key food source. We report on six years of rice evaporation measurements, based on the eddy covariance method. This rice was cultivated in the hot dry climate of California, where water is a scarce and precious resource. During the first year, we found that rice evaporation exceeded potential evaporation rates and summed to 1155mmyâ1. In following years, we found that annual evaporation decreased yearly, yielding a 15% reduction (to 982mmyâ1) by the sixth year. The remainder of the paper examined the how and why of this unexpected decreasing trend in annual evaporation occurred.We inspected trends in variations in biophysical variables (net radiation, temperature, leaf area index) associated with evaporation and potential biases in the flux measurements using energy balance closure and co-spectral analysis. None of the biophysical variables varied enough to explain this observation. What did change was the area of rice, and nearby flooded wetlands. During the first year, the flooded rice field was less than 1km2 in area and was relatively isolated. This situation promoted an âoasis effectâ that enabled warm dry air to be entrained from across the top of the planetary boundary layer; this contention was supported by the co-spectral analysis and analysis with a coupled surface energy balance-planetary boundary layer model. By the sixth year of this project, the area of flooded rice and wetlands approached 6km2, a horizontal scale that seemed to inhibit the âoasis effectâ. We conclude that the amount of water used, on an area basis, by wetland restoration projects will depend upon the spatial extent of these projects.";"Baldocchi, Dennis

In this study, degraded sodic land was rehabilitated through afforestation and cropping for 50years. We assessed physico-chemical (bulk density, water holding capacity, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, exchangeable cations and exchangeable sodium percent [ESP]), biological (microbial biomass-C, N, and P, quotients and counts), and biochemical (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, acidic phosphatase and protease) properties of rehabilitated forest land (R-FL) and rehabilitated crop land (R-CL) in two depths (0–15 and 15–30cm) and three seasons. The changes were compared with degraded sodic land (D-SL), control site. At 0–15cm soil depth in the R-FL and R-CL, compared to D-SL, water holding capacity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable cations, ESP, microbial counts (bacteria and fungus) and biomass (C, N and P) and enzymatic activities were significantly greater, while bulk density and microbial quotient were significantly lower. Soil pH, EC, Na⁺, ESP and alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly, while other soil properties increased significantly in both rehabilitated lands (R-FL and R-CL). Afforestation with multiple tree species and long-term cropping system improved the soil fertility status and restored the degraded site to different levels. Furthermore, seasonal variations were land use specific and showed different trends across land use types. The study concluded that afforestation with multiple tree species induced greater changes in soil properties during restoration of degraded sodic lands in comparison to cropping system.";"Singh, Kripal

Commencing in the early 1960s the primary strategy used to stabilise gully and other associated forms of erosion on degraded pastoral hill country was to establish exotic forest. We compare the status of gully erosion before reforestation commenced with that at the end of a ~40year reforestation period (1957–1997) during which ~1350km² of exotic forest was planted. Trends in gully area and distribution by land cover (vegetation), but particularly in response to exotic reforestation, are examined for two contrasting geologic terrains. Over this ~40year period, the incidence and extent of gully erosion in areas of hill country that have remained in pastoral use has declined. This was primarily due to the retirement and conversion of extensive areas of gully-prone farmland to exotic forest. Where implemented, the reforestation of this degraded pastoral hill country has proven to be efficient and successful in stabilising existing gullies. However, with the initiation of new gullies and growth of gullies that have remained untreated, the extent of land affected by gully erosion has increased by ~27% to ~0.9% of the regions' hill country area. To reverse this trend, further areas of severely eroding pastoral land will need to be retired with the aim of escalating the rate at which remaining gullies are treated and to prevent new ones developing, primarily through reforestation with exotic tree species or indigenous reversion.";"Marden, Michael

The location of potential areas of erosion where these processes occur is vital to land management and conservation. The study of the relationship between the local slope (S) and the drainage area (A) through the geomorphological relationship S=αAᵇ, combined with hydrologic simulation models, has proved to be appropriate for the identification and characterisation of potential areas of incision, especially when it takes into account the spatial distribution of soil properties and the evolution of hydrological processes. However, physical properties of soil, digital elevation models (DEMs) and flow algorithms used may affect the results. This study employs a distributed, physically-based hydrological model to evaluate the infiltration–runoff relationships and their influence on selecting critical area from three DEMs with different resolutions. The results show a significant scale effect on flow distribution and the location of threshold points on slopes. The results obtained from a 30-m DEM significantly differ from those obtained from 10 and 5-m DEMs because the former was unable to capture the spatial variability of geomorphic processes. The selected set of critical points shows high S–A correlations for different values of critical shear stress.

"AGRIS:US2012201613";"Targeting Agricultural Drainage to Reduce Nitrogen Losses in a Minnesota Watershed";"";"Agricultural nitrogen losses are the major contributor to nitrogen loads in the Mississippi River, and consequently, to the existence of a hypoxic, or dead, zone in the Gulf of Mexico.  Focusing on two small agricultural watersheds in southeast Minnesota, simulation results from the Agricultural Drainage And Pesticide Management (ADAPT) model were combined with a linear-optimization model to evaluate the environmental and economic impact of alternative land-use policies for reducing nitrogen losses.  Of particular importance was the studys explicit focus on agricultural subsurface (tile) drainage, which has been identified as the major pathway for agricultural nitrogen losses in the upper Midwest, and the use of drainage-focused abatement policies.  Results indicate that tile-drained land plays a key role in nitrogen abatement, and that a combined policy of nutrient management on tile-drained land and retirement of non-drained land is a cost-effective means of achieving a 20- or 30-percent nitrogen-abatement goal.  Results also indicate that although it is cost-effective to abate on tile-drained land, it is not cost-effective to undertake policies that plug or remove tile drains from the landscape, regardless of whether the land would be retired or kept in production.  Therefore, results imply that although tile-drained land is a major source of nitrogen lost to waterways, it is not cost-effective to remove the land from production or to remove the drainage from the land.  Because of its value to agricultural production, it is better to keep tile-drained land in production under nutrient management and focus retirement policies on relatively less-productive, non-drained acres.";"Petrolia, Daniel R.

This study reports results from a discrete choice experiment conducted with pastoralists and graziers across northern Australia. The experiment was designed to explore the willingness of pastoralists and graziers to sign up to voluntary biodiversity conservation contracts. Understanding preferences for contractual attributes and preference heterogeneity were additional objectives. Such knowledge can increase effectiveness and efficiency of conservation programs by informing contract design, negotiation and administration. Random parameter logit modelling showed that of contract attributes, conservation requirement, stewardship payment, contract duration and flexibility in contract conditions significantly influenced choices. Land productivity was a significant factor as were attitudes. There was significant heterogeneity of preferences for all contract attributes. Models were run for best–worst scaling responses and the first preferences subset, with the latter model deemed superior. Latent class modelling distinguished four classes of decision‐makers and illustrated different decision heuristics. Conservation investment strategies, which offer farmers contract options that meet biodiversity requirements while accommodating heterogeneous attribute preferences, are likely to lead to increased participation rates. Complementary suasion efforts are also required which espouse the benefits that pastoralists derive from biodiversity and participation in voluntary conservation contracts.";"Greiner, Romy";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"farmers";"";"";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600089953";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12098";"";"";"";"1-21"

Parameters such as geology, physiography, slope angle, slope length, slope aspect, slope type, generic landforms, lineament distance, road distance, drainage distance, altitudinal zones and land cover are used for landslide-susceptibility zonation. The quantitative relation between landslides and the selected parameters is established through the landslide index method of the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), The Netherlands, by assigning weights. A weight value for a certain parameter class is defined as the natural logarithm of the landslide density in the class divided by the landslide density in the entire map. The final layer containing the composite index is divided into seven landslide-susceptibility categories. The maximum portion of the study area experiences moderately low to moderate landslide susceptibility, and each portion occupies an area of 91 km², representing 30% of the total area. High concentrations of very high and extremely high-susceptibility landslide areas are noticed in the steep slope areas, especially in the Sub-Himalayas. The settlements are found in the safe areas of very low, low and moderately low landslide-susceptibility categories. About 9% and 1.99% of the roads are exposed to high and very high landslide-susceptibility areas, respectively. About 15% of the slash-and-burn cultivation (jhum) is found along the high-susceptibility areas, 3.89% is found in very high-susceptibility areas and 0.19% is prone to extremely high susceptibility. The high-susceptibility zones are also found under dense and moderately dense forests.";"Rawat, Jawan Singh

Some wildlife species reportedly retain juniper flavor when consumed. We determined if juniper consumption affected meat quality or flavoring of Boer-cross kid carcasses. Twenty recently weaned, Boer-cross wethers were randomly assigned to one of four treatments with treatments fed different amounts of juniper (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% juniper in the diet). All goats were fed juniper for 28 d at the Angelo State University (ASU) Management, Instruction, and Research Center. All goats were also fed a feedlot ration to meet maintenance requirements (2% body weight). Juniper intake varied (P < 0.05) between all treatments (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%) primarily because treatments were fed different amounts of juniper. Following a 28-d trial, goats were harvested at the ASU Food Safety and Product Development Laboratory. Carcass characteristics including live weight, hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, loineye area, body wall fat thickness, and leg circumference were similar (P > 0.05) among treatments. Sensory characteristics including tenderness, juiciness, flavor intensity, off-flavor, and overall acceptability were also similar (P > 0.05) among treatments.

"AGRIS:US201400189409";"Depoliticizing land and water “grabs” in Colombia: the limits of Bonsucro certification for enhancing sustainable biofuel practices";"";"As concerns heighten over links between biomass production and land grabs in the global south, attention is turning to understanding the role of governance of biofuels systems, whereby decision-making and conduct are not solely determined through government regulations but increasingly shaped by non-state actors, including multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSI). Launched in 2005, Bonsucro is the principal MSI that focuses on sustainability standards for sugar and sugarcane ethanol production. Bonsucro claims that because it is free from government interference and draws on scientific metrics, their standards transcend localized, political–economic contexts. In this paper, we illustrate how the local context shapes the prospects for Bonsucro sustainably certified biofuel production in relation to land and water grabs. To accomplish this, our case focuses on Colombia, which has used a range of national policy mandates to establish itself as one of the larger producers of agrofuels in Latin America. We draw on interviews with stakeholders in the sugar and ethanol industries, paired with an examination of Bonsucro principles on land rights and water use, to illustrate how the sugar industry is framing their participation in Bonsucro, and the effects of the increasing intensification of sugarcane for ethanol production on land and water access for communities. We find that within the context of Colombia, efforts such as Bonsucro provide a veil of legitimacy and authority to a system that is premised on deeply entrenched historical patterns of inequitable land ownership patterns and access to natural resources.";"Selfa, Theresa

"AGRIS:US201500163275";"Borders without barriers – Structural functionality and green infrastructure in the Austrian–Hungarian transboundary region of Lake Neusiedl";"";"Many ongoing processes in today's landscapes impact our environment considerably. Thus, it is enormously important to gather information on qualitative characteristics of our landscapes in order to effectively counteract the negative developments. Structural functionality as proxy for the assessment of habitat quality and species patterns has already proven potential to successfully describe ecological values. Completed by the measurement of green infrastructure information for a defined profile of a functional trait, a rapid and rough assessment of the qualitative state of habitats seems feasible. We therefore present in this study (i) an assessment of structural functionality based on the statistical analysis of landscape metrics, (ii) the measurement of green infrastructure and travelling costs for the ecoprofile of a Disturbance Sensitive Species Group (DSG) and (iii) an investigation if functionality and green infrastructure change between different types of landscapes and protection status. In the Lake Neusiedl region we selected 41 landscape samples based on a stratified random process. Based on orthophoto interpretation, we calculated landscape metrics with FRAGSTATS and reduced them to a core set of 13 indices by combining statistical results with literature review. Their relation to main ecological processes determined if the individual metric related positively or negatively with the land cover category and structural functionality was given by the average value of the landscape metrics. Green infrastructure elements were allocated with GUIDOS, whereas the travelling costs to move between them was also considered. Landscape elements of valuable matrix and connecting corridors ranked highest in structural functionality based on the calculated landscape indices but showed large differences between different land use regimes. Correlation and regression analysis confirmed the dependence of green infrastructure elements (corr. r²=0.877) as well as travelling costs (corr. r²=0.669) to functionality values. Protection status of the landscape samples proved to be a determining factor because functionality values as well as green infrastructure differed significantly (both with a p-value<0.05) with the exception of dissecting corridors, stepping stones and travelling costs. We conclude that one simple guideline for a holistic assessment of structural functionality is hardly reachable but we did set up a comprehensive rule set. Based on a transparent sampling procedure, a qualitative assessment of habitats and landscapes can easily be conducted. The complementary use of an ecoprofile enables the valuation of green infrastructure elements and the identification of major driving forces along with scenario development for sustainable landscape planning.";"Kuttner, Michael

"AGRIS:US201500163274";"Mountain vegetation change quantification using surface landscape metrics in Lancang watershed, China";"";"Land cover and vegetation change are among the most important aspects of environmental change. Vegetation change can be quantified by landscape pattern indices (LPI). Landscape indices are routinely calculated using planar land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps, obtained by the projection of a non-flat landscape surface into a two-dimensional Cartesian space. Especially in mountainous areas, quantification on planar maps can lead to underestimation of vegetation and land cover changes. Hoechstetter et al. (2008) developed a method to compute LPIs in a surface structure by calculating landscape patch surface area and surface perimeter from digital elevation models (DEM). As yet there have been no applications of these surface landscape indices on land use/land cover and vegetation change quantification. The objectives of this study are to (1) choose a LPI method (surface metrics pattern analysis or common planimetric metrics pattern analysis) for vegetation change quantification; and (2) employ the selected surface LPI method to assess vegetation pattern change in two mountainous areas of the Lancang watershed, Yunnan Province, China. The results show that the surface approach to estimate changes of class area (CA), mean patch area (MPA), and mean Euclidean Near-Neighbor distance (MENN) may obtain more accurate results for quantifying vegetation change in steep mountain areas. Forest fragmentation increased significantly over time in the two different mountainous study areas. The patches of two land cover classes, (i) agricultural land and (ii) low density forest and tall shrubs, became more aggregated in the northern (temperate) study area. In the southern (tropical) study area, rubber plantations increased considerably in size and became more aggregated.";"Zhang, Zhiming

"AGRIS:US201500163271";"Impacts of edge density of field patches on plant species richness and community turnover among margin habitats in agricultural landscapes";"";"In intensive agricultural environments, arable field margins are important habitats as reservoirs of various beneficial wild species. Many studies of species diversity in field margins have focused on the local habitat level. However, relationships between the network of the margin habitats and species diversity are less studied. Edge density index of field patches is a class-level landscape metric used as one measure of habitat network. This study focused on edge density index and its impacts on plant species richness and community turnover among the margins in agricultural landscapes. We examined how effectively the index of edge density can be used as a class-level indicator for species diversity in margins. This study introduces a method for indicating plant species diversity of the margin habitats by using an easily measured spatial indicator without comprehensive analysis of land use/land cover. A total of 29 landscape-square pairs, each consisting of two 25ha squares, were sampled across southern Finland. Vascular plant species were sampled in each square. In GIS, field patch edges were divided into two types: those within crop fields, referred to as within-field edges, and those between crop fields and non-crop lands, referred to as non-crop field edges. By comparing the roles of three landscape groups (the two different edge types as well as all edges grouped together) in explaining plant species richness (at alpha and gamma level) and community turnover (at beta level) in the sampled landscape squares, we found that density index of non-crop field edges surrounded by contrast land use is an effective indicator of species diversity at beta and gamma level. This study suggested that field margins surrounded by contrast land use shall be considered as a priority landscape element in agricultural edge network design, whereas simply using the density of all field edges to indicate species diversity without separating the different effects of various edge types shall not be recommended.";"Ma, Maohua

This research examines landowner preferences toward these policy tools and asks specifically: Do private forest landowners in New Brunswick and Maine believe that regulations and/or incentives are effective means to motivate responsible stewardship? Can landowners identify explicit regulations and policies that restrict property rights? Also, we were interested to see if any discernible differences existed between these adjacent jurisdictions from different countries, but that share similar forests and a similar settlement history. We identified and interviewed diverse landowners, recorded and transcribed our discussions, and analyzed the results using a grounded theory approach. Findings suggest that both New Brunswick and Maine participants are fairly comfortable with most regulations and many agreed that a combination of incentives and regulations are in fact useful. Furthermore, landowners in New Brunswick discussed non-monetary incentives as a mechanism to reward “good” stewardship; while Maine respondents articulated a degree of responsible stewardship that transcends a need to incentivize landowners. This study demonstrates that diverse landowners may be more comfortable with environmental regulations than previously understood and may be interested in non-monetary incentives.";"Quartuch, Michael R.

"AGRIS:US201600200965";"Saving land to feed a growing population: consequences for consumption of crop and livestock products";"";"PURPOSE: The expected increase in demand for food raises concerns about the expansion of agricultural land worldwide. To avoid expansion, we need to focus on increasing land productivity, reducing waste, and shifting human diets. Studies exploring diet shifts so far have ignored competition for land between humans and animals. Our objective was to study the relation between land use, the share of animal protein in the human diet, population size, and land availability and quality. METHODS: We used linear programming to determine minimum land required to feed a population a diet with 0â80Â % of the protein derived from terrestrial domestic animals. Populations ranged from 15 million to the maximum number of people that could be supported by the system. The agricultural system in the Netherlands was used as illustration, assuming no import and export of feed and food. Daily energy and protein requirements of humans were fulfilled by a diet potentially consisting of grain (wheat), root and tuber crops (potato, sugar beet), oil crops (rapeseed), legumes (brown bean), and animal protein from ruminants (milk and meat) and monogastrics (pork). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Land is used most efficiently if people would derive 12Â % of dietary protein from animals (% PA), especially milk. The role of animals in such a diet is to convert co-products from crop production and the human food industry into protein-rich milk and meat. Below 12Â % PA, human-inedible products were wasted (i.e., not used for food production), whereas above 12Â % PA, additional crops had to be cultivated to feed livestock. Large populations (40 million or more) could be sustained only if animal protein was consumed. This results from the fact that at high population sizes, land unsuitable for crop production was necessary to meet dietary requirements of the population, and contributed to food production by providing animal protein without competing for land with crops. CONCLUSIONS: A land use optimization model including crop and animal production enables identification of the optimal % PA in the diet. Land use per capita was lowest at 12Â % PA. At this level, animals optimally consume co-products from food production. Larger populations, furthermore, can be sustained only with diets relatively high in % PA, as land unsuitable for crop production is needed to fulfil their food demand. The optimal % PA in the human diet depended on population size and the relative share of land unsuitable for crop production.";"Van Kernebeek, Heleen R. J.

Since the research is conducted on two sides of an international border, it also illuminates the potential role of culture, nationality and economics in formulating perceptions on ES in deserts. The results show that, although deserts are often considered to be lacking in ES, local residents feel that their environment is abundant in services, particularly cultural services. Furthermore, although they live in a nearly identical ecosystem, local residents from two sides of the border showed distinct differences, as well as some shared patterns, in how they use and value ES. The study highlights the importance of applying social methods for ES identification and characterization in tandem with other disciplinary approaches, in order to avoid common problems including disregard of the importance of social and cultural perspectives, leading to undervaluing of intangible cultural services.";"Sagie, Hila

Empirical Evidence from Rural Ghana";"";"The implications of migrant agricultural production for the environment have interested policy makers in sub-Saharan Africa of late. The impacts in the region of migrant destination may be short-term including initial felling of trees, intensive land use, and application of techniques. In the longer term, tenants are expected to adjust their techniques to that of the indigenous landowners. This paper explains how migrant tenants manage the quality of rented plots in the absence of clearly defined property rights with a survey data from rural area in Ghana. An empirical model explaining the probability to invest in land improvements is formulated. The empirical results indicate that tenure differences and income levels of migrants and indigenous landowners play a critical role in investments in land improvements.";"Owusu, Victor

Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners form the dominant forest ownership group in the southern United States. These forests often tend to have large quantities of small diameter trees. Use of logging residues and non-marketable small diameter trees for bioenergy production can create economic opportunities for NIPF landowners. The results demonstrated that landowners’ willingness to harvest woody biomass was influenced by their ownership objectives, size of the forest, structure and composition of tree species, and demographic characteristics. The model found that relatively younger landowners who owned large acres of forestland with pine plantations or mix forests had the potential to become a preferable choice for contractors, extension foresters and bioenergy industries as they were more likely to supply woody biomass for bioenergy. Findings of this study will be useful to bioenergy industries, extension foresters, nonindustrial private forest landowners and policy makers.";"Joshi, Omkar

"AGRIS:US201301107508";"Future European agricultural landscapes--What can we learn from existing quantitative land use scenario studies";"";"The structure of agricultural production and spatial patterns of agricultural land use in Europe are expected to face major changes over the next decades due to changes in global trade, technology, demography and policies. This paper presents a set of 25 scenarios comprising information on quantitative land use changes in Europe. The scenarios have been selected from studies with different foci, operating on both different spatial scales and different time horizons. Given the diversity of quantitative scenarios this review illustrates the scenario design and its quantification, and evaluates the results of land use/cover changes on a European level. Major gaps of current scenario exercises and suggestions for improvement are topics of the discussion section (Section 4). The focus of this review is on the comparison of selected driving forces and on agricultural land use/cover change in “Western Europe” (i.e. EU-15 plus Switzerland and Norway for some studies). Results show large differences in future land use/cover changes ranging from moderate decreases (15%) to large increases (30%) depending on the assumptions about global trade, increase in agricultural productivity and biofuel production. Domestic demand is a minor factor of land use/cover change since population is only changing slightly, and the consumption level is stable and decoupled from economic growth. Scenarios show that the rate and direction of land cover change differ over time. Considerable shifts towards grassland abandonment in many scenarios reflect the changes in agricultural management. Increasing biofuel production as a result of both increasing energy demand and pro-active climate policies takes up considerable areas in many scenarios and prevents substantial abandonment of agricultural land. Although comparable quantitative results concerning European agricultural land use/cover change are only available on a very aggregated level, the results are important to be dealt with when discussing future challenges of rural areas.";"Busch, G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"land use planning;climate change;land use;rural areas";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"150;CHE;NOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301107508";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2005.11.007";"";"";"";"121-140"
"AGRIS:US201301107504";"vulnerability of ecosystem services to land use change";"";"Terrestrial ecosystems provide a number of vital services for people and society, such as biodiversity, food, fibre, water resources, carbon sequestration, and recreation. The future capability of ecosystems to provide these services is determined by changes in socio-economic characteristics, land use, biodiversity, atmospheric composition and climate. Most published impact assessments do not address the vulnerability of the human-environment system under such environmental change. They cannot answer important multidisciplinary policy relevant questions such as: which are the main regions or sectors that are vulnerable to global change? How do the vulnerabilities of two regions compare? Which scenario is the least, or most, harmful for a given region or sector? The ATEAM project (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) uses a new approach to ecosystem assessment by integrating the potential impacts in a vulnerability assessment, which can help answer multidisciplinary questions, such as those listed above. This paper presents the vulnerability assessment of the ATEAM land use scenarios. The 14 land use types, discussed in detail by Rounsevell et al. (this volume), can be related to a range of ecosystem services. For instance, forest area is associated with wood production and designated land with outdoor recreation. Directly applying the vulnerability methodology to the land use change scenarios helps in understanding land use change impacts across the European environment. Scatter plots summarising impacts per principal European Environmental Zone (EnZ) help in interpreting how the impacts of the scenarios differ between ecosystem services and the European environments. While there is considerable heterogeneity in both the potential impacts of global changes, and the adaptive capacity to cope with these impacts, this assessment shows that southern Europe in particular will be vulnerable to land use change. Projected economic growth increases adaptive capacity, but is also associated with the most negative potential impacts. The potential impacts of more environmentally oriented developments are smaller, indicating an important role for both policy and society in determining eventual residual impacts.";"Metzger, M.J.

Data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) were used to classify farm types in 100 regions of the EU15, according to agricultural intensity. For the ten New Member States (EU10), which are not yet considered by the FADN, country level data were used to obtain similar farm types. Three processes were considered for the assessment of future trends in agricultural land-use intensity: (1) land-use change, (2) conversion into organic farming, and (3) changes in productivity of crop and grassland production. An ecosystem quality value was attributed to each farm type according to dose-effect relationships between pressure factors and biodiversity compared to the value for an undisturbed situation. The biodiversity in agricultural landscapes was then calculated as the average ecosystem quality multiplied by the relative area size of each farm type within a region. A similar method of attributing ecosystem quality values to other land-use types allowed comparison between different land-use types. Referring to the current situation, results indicate the lowest ecosystem quality values to be found in intensively used agricultural areas in lowlands (e.g. The Netherlands and northern France) and irrigation systems (e.g. Greece), whereas relatively high values are found in Spain and the New EU Member States. Scenario results show that for the A1 scenario (Global economy), the highest loss in ecosystem quality will take place in all regions in croplands and grasslands. The B2 scenario (Regional communities) provides the best opportunities to improve ecosystem quality of agricultural landscapes. In most scenarios, agricultural land is decreasing, while the remaining agricultural areas tend to be used more intensively. The negative impact of intensification on biodiversity is partly set off by (active or spontaneous) nature development on abandoned agricultural areas, but the overall trend seems to be generally negative. The strength of this methodology is that it provides a quick overview of land-use intensity change and biodiversity trends. Through the use of this farm-type level of analysis we have provided a good picture of the differences in land-use intensity and the related biodiversity between the EU regions and the scenarios.";"Reidsma, P.

However, communicating different proposed policy options in a manner that facilitates informed decisions from stakeholders can be far from straightforward. This is particularly true with more abstract and uncertain issues such as potential impacts of climate change. Scenarios depicting the possible outcomes of policy options provide a useful tool to evaluate the potential consequences of choices. This paper documents an approach to constructing scenarios that can incorporate potential climate change impacts, and reflect the uncertainty in climate change projections due to different environmental policies. It describes the construction of scenarios using the Humberhead Levels in the UK as a case study and portrays the scenarios using two forms of visualisation--digital photo-montage and a real-time landscape model. The method is equally applicable to other study areas across Europe where suitable data are available. Preliminary reactions from an audience to scenario images are discussed, as well as the technical and practical challenges of using visualisation techniques to support decision making.";"Dockerty, T.

It argues that where institutional designations of ‘nature’ tended to invoke a generalised temporal stasis, local and regional understandings of ‘landscape’ emphasise specific histories, transience, and movement. Seeking these regional senses of landscape through an ethnographic approach, the paper presents some personal histories of responses to nature conservation that have a context in local cultural understandings of landscape. The continuing importance of the udal land tenure heritage in Orkney in relation to this is described. Finally, the ways that farmers and recreational walkers move around farm land are presented as further evidence for the importance of localised concepts of landscape in contrast to institutional designations of nature, while recognising that environmentalists themselves have come to take on aspects of such concepts. Agri-environment schemes seeking to be relevant in particular landscapes should propose the kind of active, participative management that the farmers engage in with the rest of their land.";"Vergunst, Jo";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"farming systems;farmers;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400185717";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2011.652808";"";"";"";"173-190"
"AGRIS:US201600091924";"Incorporating animal spatial memory in step selection functions";"";"Memory is among the most important and neglected forces that shapes animal movement patterns. Research on the movement–memory interface is crucial to understand how animals use spatial learning to navigate across space because memory‐based navigation is directly linked to animals' space use and home range behaviour; however, because memory cannot be measured directly, it is difficult to account for. Here, we incorporated spatial memory into step selection functions (SSF) to understand how resource selection and spatial memory affect space use of feral hogs (Sus scrofa). We used Biased Random Bridge kernel estimates linked to residence time as a surrogate for memory and tested four conceptually different dynamic maps of spatial memory. We applied this memory‐based SSF to a data set of hog relocations to evaluate the importance of land cover type, time of day and spatial memory on the animals' space use. Our approach has shown how the incorporation of spatial memory into animal movement models can improve estimates of habitat selection. Memory‐based SSF provided a feasible way to gain insight into how animals use spatial learning to guide their movement decisions. We found that while hogs selected forested areas and water bodies and avoided grasslands during the day (primarily at noon), they had a strong tendency to select previously visited areas, mainly those held in recent memory. Beyond actively updating their memory with recent experiences, hogs were able to discriminate among spatial memories encoded at different circadian phases of their activity. Even though hogs are thought to have long memory retention, they likely relied on recent experiences because the local food resources are quickly depleted and slowly renewed, yielding an uncertain spatial distribution of resources.";"Oliveira‐Santos, Luiz Gustavo R.

Colorado provides one example of a region that has been heavily affected. The Colorado State Forest Service estimates that 769,000ha of Colorado's forests, of all jurisdictions, have been infested with MPB since the outbreak began in 1996 (Leatherman, 2009). An important consequence of this damage is declining utility (i.e. a reduction in the level of satisfaction derived from goods and services, both market and nonmarket) for residents of the wildland-urban interface (WUI). Specifically, beetle infestations lower utility by reducing the value of forest amenities and increasing the risk of wildfire. We use a hedonic pricing model to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) to prevent MPB damage in Grand County, Colorado. The hedonic model establishes a statistical relationship between property prices and various characteristics. In this case, the characteristic of interest is the number of trees killed by MPB infestations. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to determine the number of these trees within 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 kilometer buffers of each property. Marginal implicit prices for MPB damage are calculated, after controlling for structural and spatial characteristics. Results indicate that property values decline by $648, $43, and $17 for every tree killed by MPB infestations within a 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0km buffer, respectively.";"Price, James I.

"AGRIS:US201301870049";"Swedish forest commons — A matter of governance";"";"Around 100years ago, when Crown land in the interior of northern Sweden was privatized, part of the forest land was set aside as forest commons. Today, there are 33 such forest commons jointly managed and owned in common mainly by private forest owners. The forest commons may be looked upon as a means by which the state controls the production of and returns from the forests belonging to small and less affluent forest owners. Further, an attempt has been made to use the forests as a tool to move the self-interests of these small forest owners closer to providing public goods. Forest commons thus hold a contested status, as private lands under public control and as a partly de-regulated form of ownership. This paper examines the extent to which forest commons are currently managed directly by the government, comparing this with the general trend in forest policy towards governance and less prescriptive measures, which often take account of market and participative goals. Building upon Appelstrand (2007), this paper describes the major policy instruments relevant for forest commons from 1861 to 2005. We conclude that direct government management remains dominant, with the major legislation pertaining to forest commons dating back to the 1950s. While governance may seem to be inherent in the forest commons concept, the development of governance has not been fully realised given the relatively strict government-steered framework.";"Holmgren, Eva

The HYDE dataset was reconstructed by Goldewijk and his colleagues at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in Netherland, covering the past 12 000 years. The KK dataset was reconstructed by Kaplan and his colleagues, the Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Research Group at the Institute of Environmental Engineering in Switzerland, covering the past 8000 years. The Pongratz dataset was reconstructed by Pongratz and her colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, covering AD 800–1992. The results show that the reconstructed datasets are quite different from each other due to the different methods used. The three datasets all allocated the historical ALCC according to human population density. The main reason causing the differences among the three datasets lies on the different relationships between population density and land use used in each reconstructed dataset. The KK dataset is better than the other two datasets for two important reasons. First, it used the nonlinear relationship between population density and land use, while the other two used the linear relationship. Second, Kaplan and his colleagues adopted the technological development and intensification parameters and considered the wood harvesting and the long-term fallow area resulted from shifting cultivation, which were neglected in the reconstructions of the other two datasets. Therefore, the KK dataset is more suitable as one of the anthropogenic forcing fields for climate simulation over the past two millennia that is recently concerned by two projects, the National Basic Research Program and the Strategic and Special Frontier Project of Science and Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.";"Yan, Mi

Recent interest in producing energy from wood has raised questions about how a vibrant wood-energy market will impact the traditional southern wood supply chain. By using a survey of consulting foresters, this study examined how harvest tract size, forest ownership, and forest industry structure have changed within the U.S. South and how foresters expect the wood-energy market to impact the wood supply chain in the future. Results indicate that there are currently inadequate markets for timber as a result of expanded timber supply and reduced forest products industry capacity. Only 12% of respondents reported having sold timber to an energy facility, although 98% of respondents report their clients are willing to sell to an energy facility. In addition, 89% of respondents believe that a vibrant wood-energy market will provide an additional market for timber and will not displace forest products industry capacity. This study found excess logging capacity as evidenced by frequent mill quotas; however, an aging logging workforce and tight credit markets make logging capacity uncertain in the long term as the U.S. economy rebounds from recession and wood-energy demand increases. The percentage of respondents reporting an average harvest tract size over 16ha (40ac) decreased from 95% in 1999, to 70% in 2009, and only 47% predict an average harvest tract size over 16ha (40ac) in 2019. This study suggests that the southern wood supply chain is in position to take advantage of an expanded wood-energy market; however, decreasing harvest tract sizes, increasing urbanization, and a decline in the forest products industry are lingering issues for landowners, mills, foresters, and loggers in the South.";"Conrad, Joseph L.

"AGRIS:US201400147554";"Contemporary land use/land cover types determine soil organic carbon stocks in south-west Rwanda";"";"Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes a large pool within the global carbon cycle. Land use change significantly drives SOC stock variation. In tropical central and eastern Africa, how changes in land use and land cover impact on soil C stocks remains unclear. Variability in the existing data is typically explained by soil and climate factors with little consideration given to land use and management history. To address this knowledge gap, we classified the current and historical land cover and measured SOC stocks under different land cover, soil group and slope type in the humid zone of south-west Rwanda. It was observed that SOC levels were best explained by contemporary land cover types, and not by soil group, conversion history or slope position, although the latter factors explained partly the variation within annual crop land cover type. Lack of the influence of land use history on SOC stocks suggests that after conversion to a new land use/land cover, SOC stocks reached a new equilibrium within the timestep that was observed (25� years). For conversion to annual crops, SOC stocks reach a new equilibrium at about 2.5� % SOC concentration which is below the proposed soil fertility threshold of 3� % SOC content in the Eastern and central African region. SOC stock declined under transitions from banana-coffee to annual crop by 5� % or under transitions from natural forest to degraded forest by 21� % and increased for transitions from annual crops to plantation forest by 193� %. Forest clearing for agricultural use resulted in a loss of 72� %. Assuming steady states, the data can also be used to make inferences about SOC changes as a result of land cover changes. We recommend that SOC stocks should be reported by land cover type rather than by soil groups which masks local land cover and landscape differences. This study addresses a critical issue on sustainable management of SOC in the tropics and global carbon cycle given that it is performed in a part of the world that has high land cover dynamics while at the same time lacks data on land cover changes and SOC dynamics.";"Wasige, John Ejiet

The study area is a forested bottomland hardwood site, with remnant pockets of the dominant presettlement bald cypress - tupelo (Taxodium-Nyssa) vegetation. Ditch drainage was installed in 1919, with agricultural clearing and abandonment varying throughout the early and mid-twentieth century. Commercial agricultural activities ceased after the site became part of a conservation area ca. 1950. The hydrology of the site was further modified in 1957 when it was inundated for waterfowl management. Both drainage and land clearing for agriculture were associated with increased fire frequency. Although drainage was a necessary precursor to agriculture across much of this landscape, land improvement played the stronger role in determining fire frequency. The mean fire interval for the study period (1895-1965) was 1.73 years, with a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 15 years. This frequency contrasts with the complete fire exclusion that has prevailed in the area since 1965. These results have important implications for the maintenance and restoration of forested wetland ecosystems where the present fire regime differs dramatically from that under which the now-dominant forest vegetation developed.";"Nelson, John L.

"AGRIS:US201600190625";"Across the grain: Multi-scale map comparison and land change assessment";"";"Changes in the spatial distribution of land cover and land use can have significant impacts on ecological processes at multiple scales; estimating these changes provides critical data for both monitoring and understanding land-use effects on these processes. One approach to mapping landcover changes, particularly useful over longer periods of time, is comparison of existing landcover maps, (post-classification change analysis). The accuracy of these maps is often unknown and varies depending on data sources and interpretation techniques; therefore, separating change on the ground from differences attributable to sensors and methods is both critical and problematic. Through a novel map comparison method applying major axis regression at multiple spatial grains of analysis, this study partitioned accuracy into components of bias and precision in comparing maps, which aided selection of an optimal analytical grain size. Comparisons between contemporaneous maps showed the magnitude and distribution of error alone, while between-period analyses indicated both cumulative map error and change on the ground. These methods enable exploration of the nature of error and identification of differences between maps, while accounting for the imprecision and bias inherent in the source documents. Mapping landcover change delineates landscapes under recent disturbance pressure, and these measures are more effective as performance indicators for broad-scale evaluation of natural heritage policies and habitat restoration initiatives when error in the data is identified and accounted for.";"Pond, Bruce A.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land use planning;land cover;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600190625";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.06.056";"";"";"";""

Statistical data from two institutions, namely the Agricultural Property Agency (APA) and the Central Statistical Office (CSO) as well as the author’s research have been used in the paper. The time horizon of the analysis covers the years 1992-2012. The lower limit was determined by the start of operation of the Agency of Agricultural Property of the State Treasury and the launching of a process of transformation in agriculture state. Completion of the analysis for 2012 is related with the availability of statistical data used. Among the main factors which govern the management of farmland in Poland in the new institutional economic context are: formal norms (legal enactments; amendments to enactments; and the formation and modification of functions of a state institution responsible for the market turnover of agricultural land on the public and private markets, such as the Agricultural Property Agency of the State Treasury, transformed into the Agricultural Property Agency). Among some non-formal institutions there are historically shaped attitudes to agricultural land, which go beyond the market value of this land resource, in addition, encompassing its special cultural and symbolic value. The results of the author’s empirical research indicated that as many as 78.90% of the 943 questioned farmers received at least some of the farmland from their parents or parents-in-law, and as many as 73.49% would like to pass their farm to children or grandchildren (this intention was expressed by nearly all farmers who had children/grandchildren).";"Marks-Bielska, R., University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (Poland)";"";"Latvia University of Agriculture";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"ground rent;land policies;land management;land economics;farmland";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"POL;LVA";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=LV2014000601";"http://llufb.llu.lv/conference/economic_science_rural/2014/ESRD_35_2014_Marketing_Home_economic.pdf";"";"";"";"189-198"

A species geographic range is influenced by various factors including physiological tolerance to temperature change. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature variation on thermal preference and standard metabolic rates (SMR) of two species of larval salamanders, Eurycea cirrigera (Southern Two-Lined Salamander) and Eurycea wilderae (Blue Ridge Two-Lined Salamander). These species share similar life histories, but E. cirrigera is broadly distributed and E. wilderae occupies a smaller range. We measured SMR using volume of oxygen consumption during closed-circuit respirometery trials conducted at 5Â°C increments between 5Â°C and 25Â°C. Standard metabolic rates were influenced by temperature, with a range of temperature-independent SMRs observed at those temperatures above each species laboratory-determined thermal preference. Concordant with their thermal preference (15.70Â°C) and more-narrow geographic range, E. wilderae exhibited a smaller scope of temperatures at which SMR was temperature-independent, relative to E. cirrigera, and metabolic rates were depressed at 25Â°C. Therefore, preferred thermal temperatures corresponded with physiological maxima and environmental temperatures in each species. Our results support the importance of behavioral thermoregulation in maintaining optimal physiological function. Further, these findings indicate that the physiological specialization that occurs in species of narrow geographic ranges may preclude favorable responses to changing environmental temperatures caused by land-cover changes, including loss of riparian forest in the Eastern United States.";"Strickland, Justin C.

"AGRIS:US201500219961";"Differential effects of environmental heterogeneity on global mammal species richness";"";"AIM: Spatial environmental heterogeneity (EH) is an important driver of species richness, affecting species coexistence, persistence and diversification. EH has been widely studied in ecology and evolution and quantified in many different ways, with a strong bias towards a few common measures of EH like elevation range. Here, we calculate 51 measures of EH within grid cells world‐wide across three spatial grains to investigate similarities and differences among these measures. Moreover, we compare the association between species richness of terrestrial mammals and each EH measure to assess the impact of methodological choices on EH–richness relationships found by standard macroecological modelling approaches. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: We derive 51 measures of EH from nine variables related to the five subject areas land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography, using nine calculation methods. We first explore differences among these EH measures with correlation and principal components analyses. We then analyse the relationship between mammal species richness and each EH measure alone and while accounting for effects of current climate, regional biogeographic history and human influence. We assess the impact of subject area and method of calculation of EH measures on model support using conditional inference trees. RESULTS: Despite some redundancy, correlations (rₛ = −0.45 to 1.00, median 0.35) and spatial patterns indicate clear differences between the EH measures. We find clear effects of subject area and calculation method on the importance of EH measures for mammal species richness. Measures of climatic and topographic EH and measures calculated as counts and ranges (as against, for example, coefficient of variation) receive particularly high model support across all spatial grains. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of broad‐scale EH–richness studies is greatly determined by methodological decisions on calculation of measures and statistical analysis. These decisions should therefore be made carefully with regard to the hypothesis and mechanism of interest.";"Stein, Anke

The considered cutterbar realizes the no-prop cutoff of the crop stems following their grinding and transportation from the cleaning plot. The objective of the theoretical study was to determine the optimal height of the knives for a given type of a screw cutterbar. In the course of the technological operation study of the screw cutterbar the constructive and kinematic scheme of its operation was considered. The equations for the trajectory of the tips and roots of the knives were described and the pattern of the changes for operation height of the knives during the screw rotation was determined. As a result of the conducted theoretical study the formula for optimal height of the knives for a given type of a screw cutterbar was obtained depending on the forward speed of a cutterbar, rotation speed and the screw diameter, helix angle of the screw. The obtained formula is meant for the calculation of the height of the knives for constructing the screw cutterbar and was used for the constructing of the meliorative clipper КОС-2,5, which successfully has passed the state approval tests at the North Caucasus machinery testing station. The height of knives calculated according to formula was 47 mm with a screw diameter of 516 mm.

Рассмотрен технологический процесс работы шнекового режущего аппарата (ШРА) мелиоративной косилки с горизонтальной осью вращения, состоящего из ленточного шнека, на периферии витков которого установлены ножи. Рассмотренный ШРА осуществляет бесподпорный срез стеблей растений на корню с последующим их измельчением и транспортировкой за пределы очищаемого участка. Целью теоретических исследований являлось определение оптимальной высоты ножей данного типа ШРА. В ходе исследования технологического процесса работы ШРА рассмотрены его конструктивная схема и кинематическая схема его работы, описаны уравнения траекторий вершин и основания ножей при работе аппарата и определена закономерность изменения рабочей высоты ножа при вращении шнека. В результате проведенных теоретических исследований получена формула для определения оптимальной высоты ножей данного типа ШРА в зависимости от поступательной скорости режущего аппарата, скорости вращения и диаметра шнека, шага и угла подъема винтовой линии шнека. Полученная формула предназначена для расчета высоты ножей при конструировании ШРА и была использована при создании мелиоративной косилки КОС-2,5, которая успешно прошла государственные приемочные испытания на Северо-Кавказской машиноиспытательной станции.

This study evaluated the consequences of this land-use change on the activity density, taxa richness and composition of functional groups (herbivores, predators and detritivores) of ground-dwelling beetles and spiders, which include some important ecological groups of natural enemies of insect pests (e.g. predatory spiders and beetles), pollinators and decomposers (e.g. detritivorous beetles). Ground-dwelling beetles and spiders were collected using pitfall traps in native steppe habitats and adjacent irrigated farmland of different ages (cultivated either for 27 or at least for 90� years). It was found the conversion of native steppe to farmland, regardless of farmland age, led to a significant increase in activity density of predators, with a greater increase in 90-year-old farmland than in 27-year-old farmland, but did not affect their taxa richness. However, native steppe conversion to farmland, regardless of farmland age, led to significant declines in activity density and taxa richness of both detritivores and herbivores, with a much greater decrease of activity or richness in detritivores than in herbivores in both farmland types. We also observed taxa-specific responses to the land conversion within functional groups. The functional composition of the beetle and spider community shifted from a community dominated by detritivores in the native steppe sites to one dominated by predators in the irrigated farmland sites. Our results suggest that the different functional groups of ground-dwelling beetles and spiders responded in a different way to the land conversion. The remarkable increase in predators and the dramatic decline in detritivores by converting natural vegetation to agricultural land are expected to strongly affect the desert ecosystem services such as biological pest control, pollination and decomposition.";"Li, Feng-Rui

For owner-operators, a common form of tenure in the U.S. and most other countries, most land costs are implicit and involve few cash outlays, i.e., are opportunity costs that are important in the long-run but that may not affect production decisions in the short-run.  To the extent that land is rented or where the owner is making mortgage payments, however, larger explicit land costs are incurred and can be a very significant factor in the cost of production and competitiveness. U.S. cost of production data for most crops in recent years indicate that the returns on equity, including land and other owned resources are zero or negative, i.e., the prices of many farm products are too low to cover total costs when opportunity costs are included as part of the cost of production.  Thus, land costs may not be a significant factor in competitiveness in the current policy framework where government payments are a significant part of the net returns of farm operators.";"Colyer, Dale";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012204391";"http://purl.umn.edu/19099";"";"";"";""

The area is characterized by low input cultivation of millet, sorghum and sesamé combined with livestock grazing. By integrating the database with the CENTURY ecosystem model, we were able to estimate historical, current and future pools of SOC as a function of land management and climate. The SOC (upper 20 cm) decrease from 1900 to 2000 was estimated to be 6·8 Mt and the maximum potential carbon sink (SOC increase) for the period 2000 to 2100 was estimated to be 17 Mt. Cropland and grassland lost 293 and 152 t SOC km−2 respectively whereas the savannahs gained 76 t SOC km−2 from 1900 to 2000. The SOC sequestration scenario simulated during 2000–2100 recovered 94, 84 and 75 t km−2 for cropland, grassland and savannah respectively. In addition to climate and soils, cropping intensity, fallow periods, fire frequency and grazing intensity also influence cropland SOC variation. Grassland and savannah SOC variations depend on grazing intensity and fire return interval. Land management may affect future amounts of SOC in semi-arid areas thereby turning them from sources into sinks of carbon. SOC estimates were reasonably consistent with measurements (r2=0·70, n=13).";"Ardo, Jonas

These woodlands are important from a conservation perspective and are habitat for numerous species of conservation concern. Recent developments have seen a large increase in interest in woodland restoration and a dramatic increase in regeneration and woodland spread. The proximate factor enabling this regeneration is a reduction in grazing pressure from sheep and, particularly, deer. However, this has only been possible as a result of a complex interplay between ecological, political and socio-economic factors. We are currently seeing the decline of land management practices instituted 150-200 years ago, changes in land ownership patterns, cultural revival, and changes in societal perceptions of the Scottish landscape. These all feed into the current move to return large areas of the Scottish Highlands to tree cover.

Small sized and highly fragmented ecosystems such as wetlands, streams and rivers are particularly underestimated when coarse resolution land cover datasets are used. However, even at finer resolution, a large fraction of the economic value provided by freshwater ecosystems may not be adequately captured by remote sensed data because, other than technical and methodological problems, the provision of many freshwater services is strictly dependent on the interactions and contacts of these ecosystems with contiguous environments. The paper analyzes and discusses the effectiveness of the CORINE land cover (CLC) dataset to represent the spatial extension and, indirectly, the economic value of freshwater biomes in Italy, with emphasis on rivers and streams. Using a georeferenced national hydrographic network database and applying a stream buffer of variable width to more than 20,000 water courses, we demonstrated that less than 10% of the estimated surface is captured by the CLC dataset with heavy negative consequences on the overall evaluation of ES at local, regional and national scale. Our approach, easily applicable also to other geographical and spatial contexts, may contribute to improve proxy-based methodologies in ES mapping/evaluation and may help to limit errors in the estimation of freshwater services.";"Di Sabatino, Antonio

Riparian buffers impose a restriction on the use of private property limiting harvest and development, but buffers can also provide for aesthetic and recreational benefits that may accrue to property owners. With data from the Neuse River Basin in North Carolina, this study attempts to provide empirical evidence on the effect of a mandatory buffer rule on the value of riparian properties. Spatial autoregressive hedonic models are estimated within a quasi-experimental framework using the imposition of the buffer rule as the treatment and nonriparian properties as a control group. Results indicate that a riparian property generally commands a high premium. We find no evidence, however, that the mandatory buffer rule has had a significant impact on riparian property values when compared with the control group.";"Bin, Okmyung

This is the case of Cistus ladanifer shrublands, one of the most widespread shrub communities in the Iberian Peninsula and a poor, uniform and resilient system. Here, we analyse the impact of several management practices in the recovery of territories largely occupied by this shrubland. We tested “non-intervention”, “cut”, “fire”, “mechanical mobilisation” and “pasture” in 100-m ² plots of Cistus ladaniferus L., in Central Portugal, and followed them from 1993. Flora were analysed using Braun–Blanquet's methodology and the plots were compared with hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis. An analysis of variance was also performed to investigate differences in management practices, both between plots and between two periods of time. The results show that extensive grazing or continuous cut have a high impact on plant diversity and community structure, with extensive grazing being the best way to improve plant diversity in a short period of time, using fewer resources.";"Mendes, P.

"AGRIS:US201301619372";"Land degradation and soil and water conservation in tropical highlands";"";"Land degradation is not uniform, even in the same landscape, but nevertheless an overall consensus seems to grow on the fact that many areas are under way of rehabilitation. It is a debateable question whether the improving areas are improving because of interventions--or whether this has more to do with processes of innovation and adaptation. The international symposium 'HighLand2006' on land degradation and land rehabilitation, held in Mekelle (Ethiopia), from 21 to 25 September 2006, created a forum for those conducting research in East African Highlands as well as in similar regions around the globe to discuss findings. Tropical highlands (>1000m a.s.l.) cover 4.5 million km² with an average population density of 33 inhabitants km⁻². Nearly all tropical highlands suffer from land degradation, especially medium to very high water erosion. Exchange of experiences during in-door sessions and excursions led to results which are condensed in this special issue. Studies presented tend to invalidate hypotheses on irreversibility of land degradation in tropical mountain areas. Circumstances are that in highly degraded environments, with high pressure on the land, no other alternatives are left open but to improve land husbandry; and that this is particularly successful in places where decision making processes at different levels in society give the highest priority to the implementation of soil and water conservation and other land rehabilitation, in situ and at catchment level.";"Nyssen, Jan

"AGRIS:US2016205853";"Fertilizer Impacts on Soils and Crops of Sub-Saharan Africa";"";"Successful agricultural development has resulted in substantial alleviation of poverty and food security in Asia and Latin America since the 1960s. Much of this success can be attributed to the introduction of high-yielding varieties of crops, especially wheat and rice, which have addressed the constraints faced by farmers using traditional varieties. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), however, productivity levels have remained stagnant despite the introduction of new crop germplasm. In recent years, scientists have recognized that low soil fertility is the primary constraint blocking agricultural development in SSA. Major findings from this study may be summed up in five key points. Declining fertility and SOM in SSA are a result primarily of agriculture-induced degradative processes that can be reversed using high levels of nutrient inputs as part of ""agro-ecological"" farming systems to recapitalize the soil. Fertilizer is recommended for recapitalization because nutrients available from organic sources in low-fertility African ecosystems are not adequate. The primary positive impact of fertilizers is to increase the biological base of the plant/soil system resulting in increased crop yields. Fertilizers and organic matter are complements rather than substitutes - both are recommended to recapitalize SSA soils. Fertilizer can increase crop yields and residues, but maximum levels of residues should be returned to the soil. Because of the very high quantities of residue or manure required to reverse declines in SOM and inadequate supplies of these materials, integrated ""eco-intensive"" systems are recommended to create an aggrading system, including mulch or conservation tillage and agroforestry/cover crops.";"Weight, David

"AGRIS:US201400182384";"importance of accurate visibility parameterization during atmospheric correction: impact on boreal forest classification";"";"Observation of the Earth's surface from spaceborne platforms is complicated by the various layers of the Earth's atmosphere that reflect, scatter, and attenuate electromagnetic radiation passing through them, thus influencing (upward or downward) the signal strength recorded at the sensor relative to the true quantity of radiance reflected from the observed surfaces. The magnitude and spatial distribution of atmospheric effects is non-stationary and will vary due to numerous factors. While the effect of these factors cannot be eliminated completely, the understanding of radiative transfer physics, atmospheric states, and electromagnetic wave propagation permits much of these effects to be appropriately modelled and minimized. Such corrections for atmospheric effects permit the extraction of more accurate physical properties of surface materials and states from imagery than if atmospheric effects were ignored. Modelling of atmospheric effects with radiative transfer models, however, requires appropriate parameterization. We explore the sensitivity of the important visibility parameter of the popular Atmospheric and Topographic Correction (ATCOR) model for atmospheric correction over boreal forest land cover. Further, we provide a methodology for estimating reasonable values for the visibility parameter in the event that this information is not readily available. Our sensitivity analyses, performed on Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery from northern Québec and Ontario, rely on both incremental adjustments to the visibility parameter to assess the degree of atmospheric effect removal and the cascading effect on land-cover classification. We build confidence around our measures using a spatial bootstrapping analysis within each of the two images we analyse. Our analysis demonstrates that exceeding a magnitude of error of approximately 2 km in estimating a visibility parameter values can decrease classification accuracy by nearly 10%. Our assessments of the spatial structure of the mitigated atmospheric component within our scenes, testing for complete spatial randomness, clustering of like values, or evenness in value distributions are inconclusive, but hint towards more clustered results with greater magnitudes of parameterization error.";"Remmel, Tarmo K.

We show that although emigration from the South may directly result in the well-known concept of brain drain, it also causes a brain gain effect, the extent of which depends on the level of IPRs protection in the sending country. We argue this to come from a diaspora channel through which the knowledge acquired by emigrants abroad can flow back to the South and enhance the skills of the remaining workers there. By increasing the size of the innovation sector and the skill-intensity of emigration, IPRs protection makes it more likely for diaspora gains to dominate, thus facilitating a potential net brain gain. Our main theoretical insights are then tested empirically using a panel dataset of emerging and developing countries. The findings reveal a positive correlation between emigration and innovation in the presence of strong IPRs protection.";"Naghavi, Alireza

"AGRIS:US2016218653";"Linkages between land management, land degradation, and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: The case of Uganda";"";"Poverty reduction and sustainable land management are two objectives that most Africancountries strive to achieve simultaneously. In designing policies to achieve theseobjectives concurrently a clear understanding of their linkage is crucial. Yet there isonly limited empirical evidence to demonstrate the linkage between poverty and land managementin Africa. Using Uganda as a case study, this analysis seeks to better understand thislinkage. We used several poverty measures to demonstrate the linkage between poverty and anumber of indicators of sustainable land management. In general we found a strong linkage.The results for many poverty indicators give credence to the land degradation–poverty trap,although some indicators showed negative association with land degradation.These results suggest that certain poverty reduction strategies being implemented throughagricultural modernization in Africa can achieve win-win-win outcomes, simultaneouslyincreasing productivity, reducing poverty, and reducing land degradation. Examples of suchstrategies include promoting investments in soil and water conservation and agroforestry.Some strategies—such as road development, encouragement of nonfarm activities, and promotionof rural finance—appear to contribute to positive outcomes without significant tradeoffs.Other strategies are likely to involve trade-offs among different objectives.The presence of such trade-offs is not an argument for avoiding these strategies; ratherit suggests the need to recognize and find ways to ameliorate such negative impacts wherethey occur. For example, incorporating teaching of the principles of sustainable agricultureand land management into educational curricula, and into the technical assistance approachof the National Agricultural Advisory Services and other organizations, is one important wayof addressing such trade-offs. Investment in poverty reduction and agricultural modernizationby itself is not sufficient to address the problem of land degradation in Uganda; it must becomplemented by greater efforts to promote sustainable land management practices.";"Nkonya, Ephraim M.

Historic LU/LC information was extracted from aerial photos taken in 1976 and IKONOS imagery was acquired in 2002 to determine the current LU/LC pattern. The remotely sensed aerial and satellite data were classified by integrating spectral information with measures of texture, in the form of statistics derived from the variance, co-occurrence matrix and variogram. The performance of these classification approaches was evaluated in terms of error matrices. The accuracy of the classification was greater when using the variogram texture measure and spectral data together than when using spectral data alone or incorporating with co-occurrence matrix texture for both image classifications. Co-occurrence texture measures did not result in a significant increase in accuracy with the maximum likelihood classifiers in the classification of IKONOS imagery. The addition of variogram texture information in particular, with variogram lags of 1, 2 and 3 pixels, increased the overall classification accuracy by 11.3%. The principal conclusion of this paper is that the accuracy of agricultural land cover and semi-natural vegetation classification can be maximised by incorporating textural information with remotely sensed spectral data in the Mediterranean coastal environment.";"BERBEROĞLU, Süha";"";"TUBITAK";"AGRIS";"2003-03-01";"en";"";"";"";"TUR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=TR2016002297";"http://dergipark.ulakbim.gov.tr/tbtkagriculture/article/view/5000028198";"";"";"";""

A multiple endmember approach (MESMA) is used for unmixing both original hyperspectral CHRIS/Proba and SR enhanced CHRIS/Proba data. Validation based on high resolution orthophotos (25cm) shows that land-cover fraction maps generated from SR-enhanced CHRIS/Proba data (9m) have a lower overall fractional error compared to the land-cover fractions produced from the original CHRIS data (18m), when validating both results at the 18m resolution. Validation of SR results at the 9m resolution produces an overall mean absolute error (OMAE) of 16.7% compared to an OMAE of 14.3% at the 18m resolution, with the original data, yet the impervious surface map produced at 9m has a much higher level of detail than the original map, better representing the built-up pattern of the urban environment. Detailed analysis of impervious surface mapping results for different reference proportion intervals points at smaller average fractional errors for impervious surface fractions produced from SR-enhanced data when validation is done at the original 18m resolution, over the entire range of proportions. Only for pixels not containing any impervious surface cover the fractional error is marginally higher than with the original data. These results demonstrate the potential of SR-enhanced data for more accurate impervious surface mapping in dense and heterogeneous urban areas.";"Demarchi, Luca

The sampling sites were classified and grouped according to the following soil type: Leptosols, weathered soils (Ferralsols, Acrisols, Lixisols and Nitosols), Luvisols and Cambisols/Phaeozems. Likewise, they were classified in the following groups with respect to land use/land cover (LU/LC): oak–evergreen cloud forest, fragmented forest, pine and pine–oak forest, and open land (cultivated land and pasture). No clear influence of soil-type grouping on amounts of SOC was revealed, between soil-type groups (soil type). The weathered soils had higher amounts of SOC and RC in the upper 50 cm than the other soil types and the lowest amounts of SOC and RC in the 50–100 cm layers. The LU/LC groups showed marked differences in amounts of SOC. Open land had between 20 and 60% less soil carbon than the different types of forests. Oak–evergreen cloud forest had the largest amounts of SOC at all depths. The differences in amounts of carbon (SOC and RC) between oak–evergreen cloud forest and the other LU/LC classes were proportionally larger in the 50–100 cm layer. This suggests that the amounts of SOC in deep soil layers may be influenced by changes in LU/LC. The considerably smaller amounts of SOC and RC, 174 and 38.5 Mg ha−1, and 31 and 24.8 Mg ha−1, exhibited in open land compared to oak–evergreen cloud forest and pine and pine–oak forests, respectively, suggest that conversion of forests to open land reduces SOC and RC. Despite the magnitude of the differences, evaluation with ANOVA (nested design) did not reveal a statistically significant influence of LU/LC. The large spatial variability in amounts of soil carbon prevented precise estimates. Changes induced by a gradient in altitude among the plots may have contributed to the large variability between the plots.";"Mendoza-Vega, Jorge

Soil type and land use (pristine, fallow, and cultivated soils) influenced physicochemical characteristics of the soils that are relevant to denitrification activity and N₂O fluxes from soils and affected potential denitrification activity. Potential denitrification activity was assessed by using the denitrifier enzyme activity (DEA) assay as a proxy for denitrification activity in the soil. Soil type and land use influenced C and N contents of the soils. Pristine soils that had never been cultivated had a particularly high C content. Cultivation reduced soil C content and the abundance of denitrifiers and changed the composition of the denitrifier communities. DEA was strongly and positively correlated with soil C content and was higher in pristine than in fallow or recently cultivated soils. Soil type and the composition of both the nirK- and nirS-type denitrifier communities also influenced DEA. In contrast, other soil characteristics like N content, C:N ratio, and pH did not predict DEA. These findings suggest that due to greater availability of soil organic matter, and hence a more effective N cycling, the natural semiarid grasslands emit more N₂O than managed lands in Namibia.";"Braker, Gesche

Thirteen repeat landscape photographs, taken during the dry seasons of 1868 and 2008, were analyzed for various environmental indicators and show a significant improvement of vegetation cover. New eucalypt woodlands, introduced since the 1950s are visible and have provided a valuable alternative for house construction and fuel-wood, but more importantly there has also been locally important natural regeneration of indigenous trees and shrubs. The situation in respect to soil and water conservation measures in farmlands has also improved. According to both historical information and measured climatic data, rainfall conditions around 1868 and in the late 19th century were similar to those of the late 20th/early 21st century. Furthermore, despite a ten-fold increase in population density, land rehabilitation has been accomplished over extensive areas by large-scale implementation of reforestation and terracing activities, especially in the last two decades. In some cases repeat photography shows however that riparian vegetation has been washed away. This is related to river widening in recent degradation periods, particularly in the 1970s-1980s. More recently, riverbeds have become stabilized, and indicate a decreased runoff response. Environmental recovery programmes could not heal all scars, but this study shows that overall there has been a remarkable recovery of vegetation and also improved soil protection over the last 140 years, thereby invalidating hypotheses of the irreversibility of land degradation in semi-arid areas. In a highly degraded environment with high pressure on the land, rural communities were left with no alternative but to improve land husbandry: in northern Ethiopia such interventions have been demonstrably successful.";"Nyssen, Jan

We developed a model to predict Brook Trout population status within individual stream reaches throughout the species’ native range in the eastern USA. We utilized hierarchical logistic regression with Bayesian estimation to predict Brook Trout occurrence probability, and we allowed slopes and intercepts to vary among ecological drainage units (EDUs). Model performance was similar for 7,327 training samples and 1,832 validation samples based on the area under the receiver operating curve (∼0.78) and Cohen's kappa statistic (0.44). Predicted water temperature had a strong negative effect on Brook Trout occurrence probability at the stream reach scale and was also negatively associated with the EDU average probability of Brook Trout occurrence (i.e., EDU-specific intercepts). The effect of soil permeability was positive but decreased as EDU mean soil permeability increased. Brook Trout were less likely to occur in stream reaches surrounded by agricultural or developed land cover, and an interaction suggested that agricultural land cover also resulted in an increased sensitivity to water temperature. Our model provides a further understanding of how Brook Trout are shaped by habitat characteristics in the region and yields maps of stream-reach-scale predictions, which together can be used to support ongoing conservation and management efforts. These decision support tools can be used to identify the extent of potentially suitable habitat, estimate historic habitat losses, and prioritize conservation efforts by selecting suitable stream reaches for a given action. Future work could extend the model to account for additional landscape or habitat characteristics, include biotic interactions, or estimate potential Brook Trout responses to climate and land use changes.

"AGRIS:US201600057377";"Ground reference data error and the mis-estimation of the area of land cover change as a function of its abundance";"";"Area estimation is a common application of remote sensing especially in relation to studies of land cover change. The use of an imperfect, nongold-standard, reference is shown to be a source of substantial error in estimates of change area. The relationships between the accuracy of land cover classifications, both real and perceived, together with area of change are explored over the full range of change abundance. The magnitude of mis-estimation varies with the abundance of change and the quality of the data sets used but may be large. For scenarios based on realistic values of data set quality for the common situation in which change is rare, ≤1%, change area was overestimated by up to two orders of magnitude because of reference data error. The results highlight that the ability of remote sensing to provide accurate information on change area is limited by reference data error and is, in part, a function of change abundance.";"Foody, Giles M.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600057377";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.798708";"";"";"";"783-792"

Although the normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI) has shown the potential to extract impervious surface areas (ISA) from multi-spectral imagery, it may lack robustness due to the spectral heterogeneity within urban impervious materials and confusion between other land covers. In this letter, a multi-source composition index is proposed to overcome the limitations of the original method. Three data sources: night-time light luminosity, land surface temperature and multi-spectral reflectance are integrated to create a modified NDISI (MNDISI), which aims to enhance impervious surfaces and suppress other unwanted land covers. Experimental results reveal that the MNDISI offers a stable and close relationship with ISA and is shown to be an effective index for mapping and estimating impervious surfaces in heterogeneous urban land cover environment.";"Liu, Chong

We investigated nest site selection and the effects of land use on its distribution in a multi-scale approach using nest positions obtained during three consecutive breeding seasons. We identified two environmental predictors, namely Tasseled cap 1 (a range value of land brightness) and slope, and three variables derived from human use (house densities, unpaved roads and fences) as the best predictors of occurrence of the species. Only slope had a positive and significant effect on stonechat occurrence; the rest being negative. Results were not restricted by the scale, indicating that design of special protection areas should be developed considering the landscape scale. Our results provide a robust prediction of the species distribution throughout Fuerteventura, demonstrating that our approach can also cope for the low vegetation signal within small arid regions such as islands. Future land use planning and management for the island should avoid the presence of negative impact elements such as opening new roads and new urbanisations in nearby habitats with the highest probabilities of species occurrence.";"Illera, J.C.

"AGRIS:US201500041934";"Quantifying surface gradients with a 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2)";"";"Quantification of spatial and temporal heterogeneity has been given much attention in order to link ecological patterns to processes. The patch mosaic model, as an operational paradigm, has led to major advances in the field of quantitative landscape ecology. However, it is more realistic to conceptualize landscapes based on continuous rather than discrete spatial heterogeneity. While a conceptual shift has been proposed to supplement the patch mosaic model, few studies use the surface gradient model as a context. This paper explores some comparatively less-utilized metrics to quantify surface gradients in a protected landscape in Central India. Since surface metrics would require continuous variables capable of representing landscape characteristics, this study also explores the utility of a 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) as a gradient surface. Findings suggest EVI2 relates strongly with discrete land cover classes and thus has potential to describe landscape characteristics without incorporating error through subjectivity. Surface metrics used in this study show potential to be effectively used in landscape level studies. However, these metrics were not developed for landscape level studies and should be used with caution, especially when dealing with multi-scale patterns and processes. Nevertheless, with the rapidly emerging field of surface metrology more studies need to apply these tools to quantify surface gradients and test the robustness of such metrics.";"Mondal, Pinki";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500041934";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.10.006";"";"";"";"918-924"
"AGRIS:DJ2012086093";"Land management strategies for the long-term persistence of boreal woodland caribou in central Saskatchewan";"";"We investigated landscape changes and their potential effects on woodland caribou-boreal ecotype (Rangifer tarandus caribou) within a portion of the Smoothstone-Wapaweka Woodland Caribou Management Unit (SW-WCMU). The SW-WCMU is one of eight areas delineated by the Province of Saskatchewan for potential recovery planning efforts for boreal caribou, and is one of four management units located on the Boreal Plain Ecozone. The Prince Albert Greater Ecosystem (PAGE) study area was selected within the SW-WCMU for intensive study from 2004 - 2008. Studies focused on quantifying a suite of landscape and population parameters. This paper presents a summary of study results to date and recommends land management strategies intended to contribute to the long-term viability of boreal caribou in the central boreal plain ecoregion of Saskatchewan. The PAGE study area has undergone structural changes from an area that historically presented a lesser amount but well connected mature coniferous forest, to a currently larger amount of mature coniferous stands fragmented by a highly developed network of roads and trails. Movement data pointed to highly clustered use of the landscape by small groups of caribou and smaller home ranges when compared to 15 years ago. Calving sites were located within each individual home range in treed peatland and distant from hardwood/mixedwood forest stands, roads and trails access. Adult annual survival rates were low, averaging 73% over the course of the study. In order to ensure a self-sustaining population level, study results clearly point to the need for landscape restoration to reduce the level of anthropogenic disturbances in some key parts of the study area. Key strategies include retention of mature softwood forest interior proximate to local areas of caribou activity, protection of calving habitat, improving structural connectivity, planning disturbances (forest harvesting, fire salvage, resource exploration, access development) in ways to minimize the anthropogenic footprint, and recovery action planning integrated with other land-use planning initiatives.";"A.

"AGRIS:US201500003940";"Landscape pattern and sustainability of a 1300-year-old agricultural landscape in subtropical mountain areas, Southwestern China";"";"The Hani terrace landscape located in the mountainous areas of Southwestern China has a history of 1300 years and is a classic example of human–environment harmony. This study investigates the spatial distribution and pattern characteristics of land cover in the landscape using geographical information system and remote-sensing techniques. With the synthetic consideration of both physical and cultural factors, the ecological stability of the landscape was discussed. The results showed that ‘terrace’ and ‘forest’ are dominant in the landscape accounting for 43.80% and 44.90% of the total area, respectively. A clear vertical land-cover distribution of ‘higher forest–middle village–lower terrace–lowest river’ can be found on steep slopes. The local climate and its variation with elevation are essential for the stable local water cycle, and the spatial layout of the landscape elements allows for effective material and energy flow within the landscape. Moreover, the obligatory forest and water resource conservation due to the unique history and culture of Hani adds a social layer of protection. The sustainable development of the Hani landscape is expected to provide valuable insights for the present land and environmental management.";"Cao, Yu

"AGRIS:US201500213408";"Reflectance spectroscopic approach for estimation of soil properties in hot arid western Rajasthan, India";"";"Periodic and regular assessment of land degradation in arid regions of the world is essential for implementing suitable corrective measures in time. Assessment of soil properties based on soil sampling from hot arid tracts followed by laboratory analysis is a formidable task. Reflectance spectroscopy appears to be an emerging technology for the assessment of soils in extreme environment. In this study, soil spectral library of 138 soil samples from hot arid western Rajasthan have been created in visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (350–2500 nm) region of the electromagnetic spectrum along with the measurements of basic soil properties. Further, spectral reflectance-based algorithms have been developed for rapid assessment of soil resources of arid regions. Results showed that sand and clay content may be satisfactorily estimated from linear models involving principal components (PCs) or derived band reflectance as the input variables (R ² = 0.41–0.43). Organic carbon (OC) content of soil was also found satisfactorily correlated with spectral data (R ² = 0.27). Derived band reflectance corresponding to Operational Land Imager bands of Landsat-8 has been found best to predict soil properties. Soil OC content has been found to be best estimated by derived spectral band data corresponding to spectral bands of IRS-P6 satellite. Partial least square regression-based models were found even better than the PCs-based and band reflectance-based multiple regression models for estimating soil properties. Thus, the present study indicates that soil spectral reflectance data captured by remote sensing satellites may have a great potential for rapid assessment of soil resources in arid regions.";"Santra, Priyabrata

The spatial distribution of climatic suitability for grape growing in Husi wine-growing Centre (Romania)";"";"This paper is part of a GIS-based approach aiming to develop the map of ecological suitability for grape growing in Huşi wine-growing centre, Huşi vineyard (Romania). The database underlying this study includes ten climatic factors and indicators that are considered to be defining for the climatic suitability of a geographic area. They are: solar radiation (kcal/cm2/1.04-30.09), solar insolation (hours/1.04-30.09), annual average temperature (°C), the hottest month average temperature (°C), the sum of fractions of average daily temperatures above 10°C for the period from 1st April to 30 September (Σtu°C), average rainfall for the period from 1st April to 30 September (mm), the length of bioactive period (mm), the heliothermal index (IHr), the bioclimatic index (Ibcv) and the index of oenoclimatic aptitude (IAOe). The values of climatic factors were grouped in three suitability classes, according to their influence on the grapes quality for wine grapes varieties, and included in a GIS database that has been used to generate the climatic suitability map of the wine-growing centre. The GIS-based analysis shows that 76.29% of Huşi wine-growing centre area has climatic potential for white qualitative wines production, 16.95% for red table wines production and 2.03% for white table wines, sparkling wines and distillates. No part of Huşi wine-growing centre has the climatic potential to produce red quality wines.

Four soils were selected for the present studies, i.e.: Eutric Fluvisol originating from silty formations, Haplic Phaeozem developed from loess, Haplic Luvisol (non-uniform) developed from silt, Haplic Luvisol developed from loess. Five study sites were chosen, i.e.: apple orchards, hop gardens, fields, grasslands and natural woodland ecosystems. Samples were collected from the depth of 0-10 cm. In the samples the content of 16 PAHs was determined by means of the HPLC-UV method. The total PAHs content was at a low level. Depending on the soil and object type, the total PAHs content ranged from 72.5 to 764.0 μg·kg-¹. The pollutant level determined together with composition of individual PAHs suggested a limited anthropogenic influence relating mainly to pyrolytic processes. The total PAH content as well as the content of individual PAHs depended on agricultural land use and management. It has been shown that PAH level was influenced by environmental conditions specific for a given type of land use. In the soils in which organic carbon content differed only slightly among locations, a higher influence of the soil utilisation method on the content of individual PAHs was observed.";"Oleszczuk, Patryk

In order to quantify the discriminant information derived from selected MIVIS subsets we classified a monitored scenario by progressively increasing the feature space dimensionality. The hyperspectral subsets are defined through the Sequential Forward Selection algorithm, while mapping processes have been performed through the Maximum Likelihood, Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Information Divergence classifiers. Impacts of spectral bands on the overall classification accuracies and single land cover-scale reliability, as well as possible dimensionality effects (Hughes phenomenon) are investigated. The analysis is tested on a 20-km stretch of the Marecchia River (Emilia Romagna, Italy) by using MIVIS data acquired in autumn 2009 and 2010 for a 17-class mapping including complex urban/rural areas. For the considered dataset, the MIVIS sensor showed an equipment failure: of the nominal 102-band MIVIS dataset, only the first 24 bands, spanning within the 0.441–1.319μm spectral range, were exploitable. Nevertheless, the available information provided valuable discriminant contributions in land cover mapping (Maximum Likelihood Overall Accuracy ∼85%) with encouraging reliability on mixed forests, croplands, and no-vegetated floodplain patterns, whereas riparian vegetation and urban zones exhibited low classification accuracies. The relationship between the spectral space dimensionality and the minimum training-set size that is necessary to achieve a given inter-class separability has also been experimentally investigated by progressively under-sampling the original training set. The maximum under-sampling factor that avoided a decrease in the overall accuracy turned out to be, at maximum, 15 for the considered data set.";"Forzieri, Giovanni

"AGRIS:US201600059966";"Super-resolution image analysis as a means of monitoring bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) distributions";"";"The bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) fern is environmentally significant due to its great abundance and swift colonisation, and its perception as a problem plant in degrading agricultural or ecologically sensitive land. Various attempts have been made to map bracken using remote sensing, but these have proved relatively unsuccessful, often apparently constrained by the lack of spatial detail associated with medium spatial resolution satellite sensors such as the Landsat series. In this study, bracken was characterised using a combination of 30m Landsat sensor imagery and 4m IKONOS imagery. Different classification techniques were compared, including hard maximum likelihood classification and a super-resolution approach comprising soft classification and sub-pixel contouring. These techniques were applied to a range of image dates, including summer, winter and multitemporal images. Image analysis was supported by extensive field data collection, comprising both a land cover survey and stakeholder interviews. For the hard classified Landsat sensor imagery, the summer image proved least able to characterise bracken, due largely to the spectral similarity between (green) growing bracken and grasses and other vegetation. The winter images were more successful for identifying bracken due to the strong contrast between dead (brown/red) bracken and other vegetation. However, the multitemporal Landsat image was considerably more accurate than any of the single date images. The hard classified IKONOS image was more accurate overall than the Landsat sensor images for classifying land cover. Surprisingly, though, it was not comprehensively more accurate for mapping the bracken class. Notably, the producers accuracy of bracken was lower for the IKONOS image than the Landsat sensor images. This suggests image spatial resolution, although influential on the success of bracken characterisation, is not necessarily the sole or main determinant of classification accuracy. Also important are the temporal nature of image acquisition (here the multitemporal Landsat sensor image proved of considerable benefit) and the spectral characteristics of the imagery (here IKONOS’s four visible and near infrared spectral wavebands proved limited compared to the Landsat sensors’ six visible, near and shortwave infrared bands). Following soft classification of the multitemporal Landsat image, super-resolution sub-pixel contouring was applied to identify the boundary of bracken patches. Predicted bracken boundaries were assessed against actual boundaries identified using field observation and IKONOS image interpretation. For comparison, the bracken boundaries identified through hard classification (i.e. using pixel edges) were also assessed against the actual boundaries. Overall, the spatial accuracy of the super-resolution approach proved considerably higher than that of hard classification.";"Holland, Jennie

"AGRIS:US201500217521";"Assessing, mapping, and quantifying cultural ecosystem services at community level";"";"Numerous studies underline the importance of immaterial benefits provided by ecosystems and especially by cultural landscapes, which are shaped by intimate human–nature interactions. However, due to methodological challenges, cultural ecosystem services are rarely fully considered in ecosystem services assessments. This study performs a spatially explicit participatory mapping of the complete range of cultural ecosystem services and several disservices perceived by people living in a cultural landscape in Eastern Germany. The results stem from a combination of mapping exercises and structured interviews with 93 persons that were analyzed with statistical and GIS-based techniques. The results show that respondents relate diverse cultural services and multiple local-level sites to their individual well-being. Most importantly, aesthetic values, social relations and educational values were reported. Underlining the holistic nature of cultural ecosystem services, the results reveal bundles of services as well as particular patterns in the perception of these bundles for respondent groups with different socio-demographic backgrounds. Cultural services are not scattered randomly across a landscape, but rather follow specific patterns in terms of the intensity, richness and diversity of their provision. Resulting hotspots and coldspots of ecosystem services provision are related to landscape features and land cover forms. We conclude that, despite remaining methodological challenges, cultural services mapping assessments should be pushed ahead as indispensable elements in the management and protection of cultural landscapes. Spatially explicit information on cultural ecosystem services that incorporates the differentiated perceptions of local populations provides a rich basis for the development of sustainable land management strategies. These could realign the agendas of biodiversity conservation and cultural heritage preservation, thereby fostering multifunctionality.";"Plieninger, Tobias

This paper discusses the changes in land use and land cover for the past twenty-three years in the region altering the rich cultural heritage, revealing by the presence of numerous painted rock-shelter sites in the region. The land cover and land use changes in terms of deforestation, urban growth and development and sandstone mining have been evaluated in the present study. Some of the above-mentioned parameters have been quantified using remote sensing and GIS data by peeping into the past and the present demonstrating sufficient practical and scientific value for the present work. The use of landsat satellite data of appropriate spectral and spatial resolution are imperative in this research where two supervised classificatory schemes viz. MLC (maximum likelihood classification) and SVM (support vector machine) are implemented for image classification. Landsat images of the years 1989, 2000 and 2011 have been processed to detect the current and historical changes of cultural heritage sites in its structural and spectral aspects in one of the remote regions of central India that matched the ground truthing from the present day survey and field work. The techniques provided differential results and in terms of accuracy SVM performed better than MLC while detecting natural and archaeological change estimation of the contested landscape of rock art. The change analysis suggests the gradual and steady destruction of natural and cultural wealth of this area leading to complete fragility. The deforestation led to the exposure of painted sandstone rock-shelters with in situ archaeological deposits. In the recent past intensive sandstone mining till the present years is obliterating unique cultural heritage sites in this region of Central India. Finally, a set of guidelines has been recommended to employ good policies to align heritage conservation and development on the right track to promote sustainable land use cost-effectively.";"Banerjee, Ruman

Lower disease incidence and higher yields were recorded on fungicide-treated plots than on the untreated plots. The profitability of fungicide application depended on the level of farm management, nature of land tenure and labour arrangements for farm operations. The challenges involved in conducting trials with active participation by farmers are discussed.

In Alpine valleys remnant natural areas are increasingly affected by habitat fragmentation and loss. In these contexts, there is a growing risk of local extinction for wildlife populations; hence assessing the consequences on biodiversity of proposed land use changes is extremely important. The article presents a methodology to assess the impacts of land use changes on target species at a local scale. The approach relies on the application of ecological profiles of target species for habitat potential (HP) assessment, using high resolution GIS-data within a multiple level framework. The HP, in this framework, is based on a species-specific assessment of the suitability of a site, as well of surrounding areas. This assessment is performed through spatial rules, structured as sets of queries on landscape objects. We show that by considering spatial dependencies in habitat assessment it is possible to perform better quantification of impacts of local-level land use changes on habitats.";"Scolozzi, Rocco

"AGRIS:FR2016223588";"Designing management options to reduce surface runoff and sediment yield with farmers: An experiment in south-western France";"";"To preserve the quality of surface water, official French regulations require farmers to keep a minimum acreage of grassland, especially bordering rivers. These agro-environmental measures do not account for the circulation of water within the catchment. This paper examines whether it is possible to design with the farmers agri-environmental measures at field and catchment scale to prevent soil erosion and surface water pollution. To support this participatory approach, the hydrology and erosion model STREAM was used for assessing the impact of a spring stormy event on surface runoff and sediment yield with various management scenarios. The study was carried out in collaboration with an agricultural committee in an area of south-western France where erosive runoff has a major impact on the quality of surface water. Two sites (A and B) were chosen with farmers to discuss ways of reducing total surface runoff and sediment yield at each site. The STREAM model was used to assess surface runoff and sediment yield under current cropping pattern at each site and to evaluate management scenarios including grass strips implementation or changes in cropping patterns within the catchment. The results of STREAM simulations were analysed jointly by farmers and researchers. Moreover, the farmers discussed each scenario in terms of its technical and economical feasibility. STREAM simulations showed that a 40 mm spring rainfall with current cropping patterns led to 3116 m(3) total water runoff and 335 metric tons of sediment yield at site A, and 3249 m(3) and 241 metric tons at site B. Grass strips implementation could reduce runoff for about 40% and sediment yield for about 50% at site A. At site B, grass strips could reduce runoff and sediment yield for more than 50%, but changes in cropping pattern could reduce it almost totally. The simulations led to three main results: (i) grass strips along rivers and ditches prevented soil sediments from entering the surface water but did not reduce soil losses, (ii) crop redistribution within the catchment was as efficient as planting grass strips, and (iii) efficient management of erosive runoff required coordination between all the farmers using the same watershed. This study shown that STREAM model was a useful support for farmers' discussions about how to manage runoff and sediment yield in their fields.";"Furlan, Adriana

We examined the observations, experiences, and actions of landowners and managers concerning feral hogs on their property. We used purposive sampling of landowners and managers who fit 1 or more of 3 selection criteria. Landowners and managers were either sent a self-administered, mail-out questionnaire or given a copy of the questionnaire during pesticide applicator workshops. There were 775 survey participants. The effective response rate from those landowners and managers who received a mailed questionnaire was 62% (n=284). Nearly all (95%, n=491) of the pesticide applicator workshop participants turned in a completed questionnaire. Sampling error based on the farms (includes ranches) in Texas and in each region was ±3%, α =0.05. The majority (74%) of respondents were ranchers, and 18% were farmers. Most respondents felt that feral hogs came from the neighbor's property and were an agricultural pest. Rooting, wallowing, and crop damage were the major forms of damage caused by feral hogs. The average economic loss due to hog damage, over the lifetime ownership of the land by the respondent, was $7,515 (U.S). Hog control was an incidental process. The average cost for hog control over the lifetime ownership of the land by the respondent was $2,631 (U.S.). There was strong support for programs related to feral hog management and control, but only half of the survey participants responded to the question. The average quiz score of 11.5 indicated that respondents could correctly respond to <50% of the 26 questions. Region was found to have an effect (P <or= 0.05) on all questions tested except one. Management implications included the need for educational programs about feral hogs, how landowners can make better use of feral hogs on their property, ongoing education efforts about feral hogs, and the impact of this study on the public policy and decision-making process.";"Adams, Clark E.

"AGRIS:US2016208012";"Sources of Agricultural Productivity Growth in Central Asia: The Case of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan";"";"The paper examines agricultural production and productivity growth in two Central Asian countries – Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Both countries are characterized by a significant shift of resources from the traditional Soviet model of collective agriculture to more market-compliant individual and family farming. In both countries, the beginning of the policy-driven switch to family farming around 1997 coincided with the beginning of recovery in agriculture, namely resumption of agricultural growth after a phase of transition decline since 1991. In addition to growth in total agricultural production, we also observe significant increases in productivity of both land and labor since 1997. These observations suggest that productivity growth may be attributable to the changes in farming structure in Central Asia. To check this conjecture we assess the sources of growth by applying the standard Solow growth accounting methodology. Using time series of country statistics for farms of different organizational forms, we decompose the growth in output into growth in the resource base (extensive growth) and growth in productivity (intensive growth). Solow growth accounting clearly shows that, first, much of the growth at the country level is attributable to increases in productivity rather than increases in resources and, second, the increases in productivity in family farms (especially household plots) outstrip the increases in productivity in former collective and state farms. These findings confirm that the recovery of agricultural production in Central Asia has been driven largely by productivity increases, and it is the individual farms that are the main source of agricultural productivity increases.";"Lerman, Zvi

Multivariate statistical analyses including correlation analysis, stepwise multiple linear regression models, and principal component and factor analysis (PCA/FA) were employed to examine the land use influences on trace metals, and a receptor model of factor analysis-multiple linear regression (FA-MLR) was used for source identification/apportionment of anthropogenic heavy metals in the surface water of the River. Our results revealed that land use was an important factor in water metals in the snow melt flow period and land use in the riparian zone was not a better predictor of metals than land use away from the river. Urbanization in a watershed and vegetation along river networks could better explain metals, and agriculture, regardless of its relative location, however slightly explained metal variables in the upper Han River. FA-MLR analysis identified five source types of metals, and mining, fossil fuel combustion, and vehicle exhaust were the dominant pollutions in the surface waters. The results demonstrated great impacts of human activities on metal concentrations in the subtropical river of China.";"Li, Siyue

We study the period 1976–2005. The analysis is based on duality applied to the production theory. The output supplies and conditioned input demands are estimated from a translog multi‐output, multi‐input restricted profit function, where the total production credit is used as proxy of the total expenditure. Farmer expectations with respect to crop prices are incorporated to the estimation based on the quasi‐rational expectation model. The output and input responses to the total expenditure are positive and statistically significant except for cotton, wheat, fertilizer, and pesticides. The short‐run output supply response to own prices is inelastic, except for wheat, which presents elastic response to its price. Acreage has a positive impact on the output supply and it is influenced by land productivity. The main conclusion is that farmers face budget restrictions to purchase inputs, and a government credit program might increase the agricultural supply.";"de Castro, Eduardo Rodrigues

A study was carried out in the village Dargakona, Barak Valley, northeast India to understand the pattern of litter production and litter decomposition in the traditional homegardens. Annual litter production was 6.27 Mg ha⁻¹ with a bimodal distribution pattern and the nitrogen input through litterfall accounted for 48.17 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. Litter decomposition studies for ten multipurpose trees revealed Sapium baccatum and Toona ciliata to be the most labile litter species and the decay rate coefficients varied among the species with differing rates of nutrient release pattern.

These ecosystems are under many stresses due to unsustainable management practices, lack of clarity on tenure and access rights, and persistent pressure for land-use change. Climate change is exacerbating the impact of these stresses on both forest ecosystems and forest dependent people. What are the current forest coping strategies of different livelihoods? What is the role of forest ecosystems in increasing the resilience of rural communities? Over a two-year period, an interdisciplinary team of civil society researchers and development practitioners made an attempt to address these questions in a systematic manner through the use of the CRiSTAL tool – Community-based Risk Screening Tool for Adaptation and Livelihoods – in different countries. For this publication, case studies conducted in three African countries –Zambia, Mali and Tanzania – are presented. Particular focus is given to the coping strategies used forest, livestock and agriculture based livelihoods. In all cases, forest ecosystems provided key goods and services during extreme events (droughts and floods) and become key assets for reducing vulnerability in the context of climate change However, issues related to unclear land tenure, as well as legislation forbidding forest use, strengthen underlying conflicts over natural resources and therefore increase the high pressure on forest ecosystems and thus the overall vulnerability of poor rural communities. This paper analyzes the corresponding challenges and offers a number of recommendations for decision- and policy-makers, on how to support local adaptation to climate change.";"Robledo, Carmenza

An Impact Evaluation of a Non-Experimental Irrigation Project in Peru";"";"This paper analyses the effect of a set of irrigation rehabilitation projects conducted over the last 10 years in Peru. The projects were conducted without the aim or the tools for a full-fledged impact evaluation. Nevertheless, this paper attempts an evaluation through the use of alternative data sources such as household surveys and geographic information, a strategy of identification of beneficiaries and control households based on spatial proximity to the projects' sites, and an econometric approach consisting of a double-differencing technique. The empirical analysis is guided and interpreted with the help of a theoretical model that considers the effects of an irrigation project on the distribution of production, employment and income for different types of landowners. The paper concludes that the irrigation projects implemented in Peru had a positive impact on intended beneficiary households, but not in the way it could have been simplistically expected. The project did benefit the poor but not by increasing production in their own small plots but by providing them with better employment opportunities in larger farms.";"Del Carpio, Ximena V.

Nevertheless, many of these areas, whether or not rights have been recognized, are subject to threats from colonists, illegal loggers, mining and oil interests and others, whose practices endanger not only the forests but also indigenous people’s territory as a whole. In this context, REDD could constitute a new threat or intensify others, particularly in places where indigenous tenure rights have not been recognized, but REDD could also offer new opportunities. This article describes the limitations of thinking only in terms of communities, rather than territories, and examines the extent to which REDD has been conceived considering the characteristics of this new territorial configuration. It also identifies the challenges that REDD may face with this new ‘stakeholder’, such as numerous specific characteristics of territories, given their heterogeneity, in the context of past experiences regarding ‘forest options’.

Four extruded feeds were tested in a 2 * 2 factorial model, with or without ABP protein sources and with or without poultry oil. The control feed contained a mix of marine and plant ingredients. Initial feed intake was highest in the ABP protein‐based diets, whereas poultry oil had a weak opposite effect. No differences were seen in growth rate or body weight. Addition of PBM and BM led to increased FCR, and lower retention of crude protein and energy. This could be explained by lower digestibility of amino acids and crude protein, and a slightly lower energy level in these diets. Reduced igf1 mRNA levels in liver and muscle were seen in fish fed dietary ABP protein and oil. Despite lower protein digestibility of ABP protein, this study confirms the suitability of ABP protein and lipid in combination with plant ingredients in feed for Atlantic salmon growers.";"Hatlen, B.

Both were initially governed by the same permit system, are situated in the same ecosystem, use similar harvesting technology, and have overharvested similar species. One community changed to a common property-right regime, enabling the emergence of access controls and avoiding overexploitation of benthic resources, while the other community, still relies on the permit system.

"AGRIS:US201400185695";"European Landscape Convention, Wind Power, and the Limits of the Local: Notes from Italy and Sweden";"";"The European Landscape Convention is the first international agreement to deal with all aspects of landscape planning, protection, and management. It emphasizes transparency, democracy, and good governance as integral parts of ‘landscape’. The ELC may inspire member states of the Council of Europe to develop better tools for planning land use and the environment; however its utility in practice is still largely untested. This article considers the relevance of the ELC to a major land use conflict in Europe today: the development of wind power. Two countries are used as case studies of this conflict. Italy and Sweden both contain iconic European landscapes, and both have become important sites of large-scale wind power development over the last decade. But the two countries also have divergent political, economic, and institutional traditions. The debate around wind power and landscape has therefore unfolded differently in the two countries. The article consists of three parts. The first part gives an overview of the growth in wind power, and the forms that opposition to wind power have taken, in Italy over the past decade. It is argued that implementation of the ELC's clauses on democratic, locally-based landscape planning process will encounter in Italy a major impediment in the form of political and economic corruption. The second part summarizes the development of wind power as part of the Swedish national energy strategy. Using a case study of a wind power planning process guided by the ELC, it is argued that what appear to be common landscape values in local communities often conceal fundamental conflicts among individuals, groups, and institutions. On the basis of these two cases, the third and concluding part sketches both the potential of the ELC to transform the planning process for wind power, and the real challenges it will face, as a non-binding, ‘global’ agreement, in ‘local’ places with their own histories, traditions, and social actors.";"Oles, Thomas

For assembling a multi-temporal Landsat TM data set, we applied a regression analysis model to remove cloud cover and cloud shadows. Then, through a hybrid classification approach, a nine-class land use/land cover (LULC) map was generated. We identified two types of coffee plantations (‘open-canopy’ and ‘close-canopy’) along with natural forest/shrubland, mangrove, water bodies, sandy coastal soils, bare soil, urban areas and agriculture. Notwithstanding the small sample size of the accuracy data, our assessment revealed an overall accuracy of 76.7% (Kappa coefficient = 0.68), considering only the four classes with independent field data. The overall classification accuracy for distinguishing coffee plantations from non-mangrove natural forest was 81.6% and the classification accuracy for distinguishing ‘open-canopy’ from ‘close-canopy’ coffee plantations was 85.7%. We are encouraged by the results of this prototype study. They indicate that remote-sensing techniques can be used to distinguish different classes of coffee production systems and to differentiate coffee from natural forest.";"Ortega-Huerta, Miguel Alfonso

The water governance landscape in New Zealand has been significantly reconfigured in the last 25 years, with wide-ranging changes precipitated by the neo-liberal agendas of recent governments. Running alongside this neo-liberal agenda was the revival of indigenous rights language during the 1970s, a reflection of growing political recognition of the aboriginal customary natural resource ownership and management rights. Set within this geo-political context, we argue that three factors, property rights, globalisation and the regulatory planning environment for management, both enable and constrain indigenous people to govern natural resources within a post-colonial society such as New Zealand.";"Memon, P.A.

Specifically, we discuss the contribution of geomorphological field survey and adapted matrix methodology (in combination with understanding of geology) to identification, study and evaluation of those abiotic nature elements which represent geological and geomorphological heritage. We describe a case study carried out in that part of the protected landscape area “Augsdaugava” which encompasses the Upper Daugava spillway valley. The study programme reported in this paper was realized to perform inventory of landforms and geological features for recognition of objects of particular interest in terms of including them in the list of protected nature monuments. After the field reconnaissance and survey of such objects in situ, the assessment based on several criteria like scientific, aesthetic and paleogeographic value, type, rareness, integrity and representativeness was performed. Obtained data is sufficient to make a well-founded selection of the abiotic nature elements and components of geodiversity, including geological and geomorphological features, e.g. particular landforms as protected nature objects, and to substantiate the need for their conservation. Hence, the output of performed study can be used for enhancing environmental management and conservation of nature diversity and values in this region.";"Muizniece, E., University of Latvia, Riga (Latvia)

"AGRIS:US201600090724";"Informing conservation by identifying range shift patterns across breeding habitats and migration strategies";"";"A species distribution combines the resources and climatic tolerances that allow an individual or population to persist. As these conditions change, one mechanism to maintain favorable resources is for an organism to shift its range. Much of the research examining range shifts has focused on dynamic distribution boundaries wheras the role of species breeding habitat or migration strategies on shift tendencies has received less attention. We expand on previous research by using a large suite of avian species (i.e., 277), analyzing observed abundance-weighted average latitudes, and categorizing species by breeding environment and migration strategy. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey dataset to address two questions: (1) Has the center of observed abundance for individual species shifted latitudinally? (2) Is there a relationship between migration strategy or breeding habitat and range shifts? Results indicate the majority of species have experienced poleward range shifts over the last 43 years, and birds breeding in all habitat showed trends of poleward shift but only those species breeding in scrub-shrub and grassland environments were different from zero. Additionally, species that are short distance migrants are experiencing significant poleward shifts while Neotropical and permanent residents had shifts that were not different from zero. Our findings do support the general trend expected from climate driven changes (i.e., > 52 % shifting poleward), however, the proportion of species exhibiting equatorial shifts (24 %) or no significant shifts (23 %) illustrates the complex interplay between land cover, climate, species interactions, and other forces that can interact to influence breeding ranges over time. Regardless of the mechanisms driving range shifts, our findings emphasize the need for connecting and expanding habitats for those species experiencing range shifts. This research describes the patterns of breeding birds through central North America and we encourage future research to focus on the mechanisms driving these patterns.";"Hovick, Torre J.

These benefits may affect incentives for landowners to cooperate in their forest management decisions. Landowner survey data is used to examine incentives to cooperate concerning joint forest management and coordination of harvesting. We find spatial factors to be particularly important to these incentives. The percentage of neighboring land employed in agriculture or crop uses and the number of bordering landowners are important positive predictors of willingness to cooperate concerning joint forest management, while the latter has a negative effect on willingness to coordinate timing of harvest. We also find that the non-timber values an individual receives from adjacent land are important positive predictors of cooperation incentives in general. Our results confirm, first, that cross parcel externalities modeled in theoretical work do in fact exist, and, second, that there is merit to formulating future policies with the incentives of landowners to participate in cooperative agreements with neighbors in mind. Such information could be important to addressing landscape level threats to forest health and sustainability.";"Vokoun, Melinda

Although varied, these interventions are premised on the assumption that natural resources are most effectively managed and preserved while benefiting livelihoods if the market-incentives of a liberalised economy are correctly in place. By examining three nationally supported payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes in Vietnam we show how insecure land tenure, high transaction costs and high opportunity costs can undermine the long-term benefits of PES programmes for local households and, hence, potentially threaten their livelihood viability. In many cases, the income from PES programmes does not reach the poor because of political and economic constraints. Local elite capture of PES benefits through the monopolization of access to forestland and existing state forestry management are identified as key problems. We argue that as PES schemes create a market for ecosystem services, such markets must be understood not simply as bald economic exchanges between ‘rational actors’ but rather as exchanges embedded in particular socio-political and historical contexts to support the sustainable use of forest resources and local livelihoods in Vietnam.";"To, Phuc Xuan

"AGRIS:LV2016011750";"Les exploitations agricoles familiales sont-elles des institutions ?";"";"Faced with a changing economic environment (poor functioning of the groundnut sector, economic liberalization, etc.), rural households seek first and foremost to secure food for their families by diversifying their production and their economic activities in the village and in urban centres through temporary migration. In this context, the farm seen as an institution cannot be considered as a company in the sense of the classical economic theory. It corresponds more to a system of activities whose operation takes into account both market and family objectives. After looking at the concept of institution and its application to the family farm, this paper highlights the changes that have taken place in groundnut farms in terms of social organisation and operation. In addition, envisaging the family farm as an institution, the authors show how the coordination pattern has evolved within the farm and the family as a whole.

Face aux changements de l’environnement économique (dysfonctionnement de la filière arachide, désengagement de l’État, etc.), les ménages ruraux recherchent avant tout la sécurité alimentaire de leur famille en diversifiant leurs productions et leurs activités économiques au village et dans les centres urbains grâce à la migration temporaire. Dans ce contexte, l’exploitation agricole, vue comme une institution, ne peut pas être considérée comme une entreprise, au sens de la théorie économique classique. Elle correspond plus à un système d’activités dont le fonctionnement tient compte des logiques marchandes et familiales. Après un éclairage sur le concept d’institution et son application à l’exploitation agricole familiale, nous préciserons les changements survenus dans les exploitations du Bassin arachidier en termes d’organisation sociale et de fonctionnement.

Our goal is to review spatial assessments of ESs, with an emphasis on the socioecological drivers of ESs, the spatial datasets commonly used to represent those drivers, and the methodological approaches used to spatially model ESs. We conclude that diverse strategies, integrating both spatial and aspatial data, have been used to map ES supply and human demand. Model parameters representing abiotic ecosystem properties can be supported by use of well-developed and widely available spatial datasets. Land-cover data, often manipulated or subject to modeling in a GIS, is the most common input for ES modeling; however, assessments are increasingly informed by a mechanistic understanding of the relationships between drivers and services. We suggest that ES assessments are potentially weakened by the simplifying assumptions often needed to translate between conceptual models and widely used spatial data. Adoption of quantitative spatial data that more directly represent ecosystem properties may improve parameterization of mechanistic ES models and increase confidence in ES assessments.";"Andrew, Margaret E.

Soil water regimes of reclaimed upland slopes in the oil sands region of Alberta. Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 117â129. Large oil sands deposits in the Athabasca oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, are recovered through surface mining, creating a large-scale disturbance. Reclamation requires reconstruction of soil profiles to return the land to equivalent land capability and support the required end land use. Soil water regimes must be understood to allow for planting of appropriate vegetation species. This study quantified soil water regimes on reclaimed upland slopes of various reclamation prescriptions and determined whether soil water was affected by slope position. Slope position did not have a consistent effect on soil water. Spatial variability in soil characteristics and vegetation distribution likely had a greater influence on soil water than did slope position. The upper slope soil profiles had highly dynamic water regimes and a greater response to precipitation events than the lower soil profiles. Differences in water-holding capacity among sites were attributed to differences in clay, sand and organic matter content. Overwinter soil water recharge varied dramatically by site. Capillary barriers resulting from the textural discontinuities created by the reclamation prescriptions enhanced soil water retention within the profiles in at least two sites, and hence are desirable in reclamation scenarios, especially where reclamation material is coarse textured.";"Leatherdale, J.

A clear sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient, measured by both sensors, to the leaf area index (LAI) of green plants of wheat and barley (at both HH and VV polarizations) was observed, and it did not seem to be greatly affected by the variations in soil moisture, even in HH polarization. As expected, the sensitivity to LAI of dry plants was, instead, almost negligible. The decreasing trend of backscattering as vegetation grows, which has already been observed in past investigations, also at lower frequencies, was confirmed.

Using field vegetation sampling and ground-based reflectance measurements, the knowledge base for relating the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the vegetation water content was extended to a greater diversity of agricultural crops, which included dryland and irrigated wheat, alfalfa, and canola. Critical to the generation of vegetation water content maps, the land cover for this region was determined from satellite visible/infrared imagery and ground surveys with an accuracy of 95.5% and a kappa coefficient of 0.95. The vegetation water content was estimated with a root mean square error of 0.33 kg/m2. The results of this investigation contribute to a more robust database of global vegetation water content observations and demonstrate that the approach can be applied with high accuracy.";"Cosh, Michael H.

"AGRIS:US201600024537";"Mapping near-surface soil moisture on regional scale using ERS-2 SAR data";"";"Soil moisture is an important hydrologic variable of great consequence in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to accurately assess the spatial and temporal variability of surface soil moisture using conventional, point measurement techniques. Remote sensing has the potential to provide areal estimates of soil moisture at a variety of spatial scales. This investigation evaluates the use of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) C-band, VV polarization, synthetic aperture radar data for regional estimates of surface soil moisture. Radar data were acquired for three contiguous ERS-2 scenes in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of central Oklahoma from June 1999 through October 2000. Twelve test sites (each approximately 800 m x 800 m) were sampled during the ERS-2 satellite overpasses in order to monitor changes in soil moisture and vegetation on the ground. An average radar backscattering coefficient was calculated for each test site. Landsat 5 and 7 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the experimental sites close in time to the ERS-2 acquisition dates were also analyzed. The TM scenes were used to monitor land cover changes and to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Land cover and ground data were used to interpret the radar-derived soil moisture data. Linear relationships between soil moisture and the backscattering coefficient were established. Using these equations, soil moisture maps of the Little Washita and the El Reno test areas were produced.";"Oldak, A.

"AGRIS:US2016215547";"Management System for Harvest Scheduling: The Case of Horticultural Production in Southeast Spain";"";"This article analyzes the programming of farm production, understood not only as the choice among several crops, but also as their temporal distribution. The empirical study takes as a reference the horticultural sector in southeast Spain, since this area constitutes the highest concentration of small-scale farm production in Europe, where the climatic conditions allow the possibility of several harvests in year-round production, as well as several alternative crops. Firstly, we study the production programming for an individual farmer, under the assumption that their decisions do not affect the balance of market prices. In this case a modified Markowitz model is used for the scheduling of crop marketing. Secondly, we study the sales arrangements for a farming-marketing cooperative, under the assumption that their sales volume is such that the entity is capable of altering the market balance. A model of monthly revenues and margins is proposed, and the results show a clear improvement in both margins and revenues if the harvest is programmed in this way.

This research evaluated how urbanization affected nutrient dynamics in the subtropics. We established 17–0.04 ha plots in five different land cover types—slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations (n = 3), rural natural pine forests (n = 3), rural natural oak forests (n = 4), urban pine forests (n = 3) and urban oak forests (n = 4) in the Florida panhandle, a subtropical region that has experienced rapid urbanization. On each plot, we measured the decomposition of mixed species foliar litter, the nutrient release patterns in decomposing litter, foliar litter quality, and forest floor temperatures. Aboveground net primary productivity and soil carbon and nitrogen contents were also measured to characterize the carbon and nitrogen stocks and fluxes in the urban and rural sites. Litter decay rates, liter quality indices and nutrient release patterns in decomposing litter did not differ among urban and rural forests despite differences in forest floor temperatures between urban and rural sites. Urban forest floor temperatures are on average warmer by 0.63 °C in the winter (p = 0.005) and tend to have a more narrow temperature range than those of the rural forested sites. Foliar mass was measured over an 82 week period that was characterized by drought, which may have masked an urbanization effect. Urban forest land covers had higher aboveground net primary productivity and foliar productivity compared to rural land covers. This increased input of foliar carbon is not reflected in statistically different forest floor or surface soil (0–7.5 cm) carbon contents between urban and rural sites. Understanding how drought interacts with other drivers of change in urban systems may be a necessary component of city specific ecological knowledge.";"Enloe, Heather A.

Single-family housing areas constitute a substantial part of most cities and may as such play an important role for sustainable urban development. From aerial photos we performed detailed GIS-based mapping of land cover in three detached single-family housing areas in Denmark of different urban form but comparable housing densities (ranging from 10.0 to 11.3 houses per hectare). The findings were subjected to statistical analysis and landscape metrics. Land cover varied with urban form: A traditional spatial configuration with rectangular parcels contained significantly more vegetation and less impervious surfaces per parcel than newer Radburn-inspired configurations with more quadratic parcels. Correlation analysis showed size of paved access ways to be positively correlated with distance from road to carports in all parcels, and number of trees to be positively correlated with garden size in rectangular parcels. Correlation analysis also showed that higher trees were located further from houses, and that rectangular parcels could support more trees than quadratic parcels. These results suggest that the urban form of neighbourhoods to some degree predicts the long term land cover composition. We conclude that strategies for maximizing the ecological performance of single-family housing areas can be informed by knowledge on urban form, and that digital mapping of land cover based on aerial photography is a useful tool.";"Nielsen, Mette Boye

"AGRIS:US2016210440";"EVALUATING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF LAND RETIREMENT PROGRAMS";"";"This paper extends an integrated framework that combines economic, environmental and GIS modeling to evaluate the cost effectiveness of land retirement programs. The modeling framework is applied to the Lower Sangamon Watershed in Cass County of Illinois to examine the economic costs and environmental benefits of three land retirement scenarios: land actually enrolled in the Illinois CREP, land selected by a land rental cap mechanism and land identified by a least cost model. We find that land retirement in the watershed successfully achieved the program goal of 20% sediment abatement. However, in achieving the same level of sediment abatement, the costs of actual land retirement are 1.3 times and 2.1 times of those in a land rental cap mechanism and a least cost model respectively. The model results also reveal that cost effective land retirement parcels are more sloping, close to river, with higher upland sediment inflow, more on-site erosion and lower quasi-rents. The results indicate that governments may improve the cost effectiveness of land retirement program through targeting. And there is a need to modify current Illinois CREP eligibility criteria to include sloping cropland adjacent to the river in the program. Furthermore our results suggest that in the program implementation land retirement contracts could be selected based on several measurable parameters such as distance from the river and slope.";"Khanna, Madhu

The work demonstrates that novel CSSI techniques have the potential to provide important support for soil resource management policies and inform sediment risk assessment for the protection of aquatic habitats and water resources. Analysis of soil material from a range of crop covers in a mixed land-use agricultural catchment shows that the carbon CSSI signatures of particle-reactive fatty acids label surface agricultural soil with distinct crop-specific signatures, thus permitting sediment eroded from each land-cover to be tracked downstream. High resolution sediment sampling during a storm event and analysis for CSSI and conventional geochemical fingerprints elucidated temporal patterns of sediment mobilisation under different crop regimes and the specific contribution that each crop type makes to downstream sediment load. Pasture sources (65% of the catchment area) dominated the sediment load but areal yield (0.13±0.02tha⁻¹) was considerably less than that for winter wheat (0.44±0.15tha⁻¹). While temporal patterns in crop response matched runoff and erosion response predictions based on plot-scale rainfall simulation experiments, comparison of biomarker and geochemical fingerprinting data indicated that the latter overestimated cultivated land inputs to catchment sediment yield due to inability to discriminate temporary pasture (in rotation) from cultivated land. This discrepancy, however, presents an opportunity since combination of the two datasets revealed the extremely localised nature of erosion from permanent pasture fields in this system (estimated at up to 0.5tha⁻¹). The novel use of CSSI and geochemical tracers in tandem provided unique insights into sediment source dynamics that could not have been derived from each method alone. Research into CSSI signature development (plant and soil processes) and the influence of cultivation regimes are required to support future development of this new tool.";"Blake, William H.

This structure allows transport of soil resources and propagules through the ecosystem (primarily by wind and water but also by animals), thus making the connectivity for the flow of these materials a key component of ecosystem function in drylands. We argue that, as the fertile island concept before it, the concept of connectivity explains many phenomena observed in drylands. Further, it serves as an organizing principle to understand dryland form and function at scales from the plant-interspace to the landscape. The concept also serves to structure thinking about interactions of processes occurring at different scales, such as when processes occurring at one scale are overridden by processes occurring at another scale. The connectivity framework has practical implications for land management, especially with respect to decision-making concerning the scale and location of production or restoration in the world’s drylands.";"Okin, Gregory S.

The theoretical basis for the empirical analysis is a spatial city model with stochastic returns to future land development. From the theoretical model, we derive an expression for the current price of agricultural land in terms of annual returns to agricultural production, the price of recently developed land parcels, and expressions involving model parameters that are represented in the empirical model by nonlinear functions of observed variables and parameters to be estimated. We estimate the model of agricultural land values with a cross-section on approximately three thousand counties in the contiguous U.S. The results provide strong support for the model, and provide the first evidence that option values associated with irreversible and uncertain land development are capitalized into current farmland values. The empirical model is specified in a way that allows us to identify the contributions to land values of rents from near-term agricultural use and rents from potential development in the future. For each county in the contiguous U.S., we estimate the share of the current land value attributable to future development rents.

We develop a simple analytic framework to decompose the intended emissions impacts ofbiofuel policy from four sources of carbon leakage: domestic fuel markets, domestic land markets, world land markets and world crude oil markets. A numerical simulation model illustrates the magnitude of each source of leakage for combinations of two current US biofuel policies: the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). In the presence of both land and fuel market leakage, current US biofuel policies are unlikely to reduce greenhouse gases. Four of the five policy scenarios we consider lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. That is, total leakage was greater than 100%. The single scenario that generates emissions savings, the removal of the VEETC in conjunction with a binding RFS, only does so because negative leakage in the domestic fuel market offset the remaining positive sources of leakage.";"Bento, Antonio M.

Like other types of sagebrush shrublands, large areas dominated by the common but little-studied mountain silver sagebrush may have shifted to a less productive shrub-dominated alternate state under heavy livestock grazing in the 19th century. The goals of this study are to 1) describe long-term vegetation change in a silver sagebrush mountain park and 2) evaluate evidence that these changes constitute alternate states. We examined vegetation change over the last 57 yr in California Park, Colorado, USA, using monitoring data from 15 permanent transects at six sites. We analyzed change in species composition over time and related it to management and climatic drivers using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. We found that management practices influenced species composition. Spraying herbicides resulted in decreases of sagebrush and a dominant, unpalatable forb (Wyethia amplexicaulis), but sagebrush recovered. Spraying also triggered a temporary increase in native palatable grasses and forbs. Native grasses have since decreased again, coinciding with increases in the cattle stocking rate and elk population. The nonnative pasture grass Phleum pratense has increased to become one of the dominant grasses in 2010. Sagebrush and herbaceous understory dynamics were not consistent with a shrub-dominated alternate state: changes were gradual and not persistent. However, historic Wyethia dominance and the widespread increase in the nonnative grass Phleum were persistent and may represent alternate states. We used these findings to update a state-and-transition model of high-elevation silver sagebrush shrubland dynamics for land management decision making. Our analysis differentiated gradual, nonpersistent changes from potentially irreversible changes, as is necessary for identifying alternate states that are important for land management and ecosystem function. The gradual but persistent increase in the nonnative grass Phleum reinforces others' observations that even incremental changes may lead to irreversible shifts.";"Kachergis, Emily

We assessed the distribution of introduced, invasive species as related to anthropogenic infrastructure and environmental conditions across southwestern Wyoming. to discern direct correlations as well as covariate influences between land use, land cover, and abundance of invasive plants, and assess the supposition that these features affect surrounding rangeland conditions. Our sample units were 1 000 m long and extended outward from target features, which included roads, oil and gas well pads, pipelines, power lines, and featureless background sites. Sample sites were distributed across the region using a stratified, random design with a frame that represented features and land-use intensity. In addition to land-use gradients, we captured a representative, but limited, range of variability in climate, soils, geology, topography, and dominant vegetation. Several of these variables proved significant, in conjunction with distance from anthropogenic features, in regression models of invasive plant abundance. We used general linear models to demonstrate and compare associations between invasive plant frequency and Euclidian distance from features, natural logarithm transformed distances (log-linear), and environmental variables which were presented as potential covariates. We expected a steep curvilinear (log or exponential) decline trending towards an asymptote along the axis representing high abundance near features with rapid decrease beyond approximately 50–100 m. Some of the associations we document exhibit this pattern, but we also found some invasive plant distributions that extended beyond our expectations, suggesting a broader distribution than anticipated. Our results provide details that can inform local efforts for management and control of invasive species, and they provide evidence of the different associations between natural patterns and human land use exhibited by nonnative species in this rural setting, such as the indirect effects of humans beyond impact areas.";"Manier, D.

Complete, full-coverage vegetation surveys are often used for this purpose, but these are expensive undertakings. We have presented a method to downscale information from regional sampling surveys by poststratification using a land cover map derived from satellite-based measures of reflectance values. This approach opens new prospects for landscape-level evaluation of productivity. We applied this method to eight grazing districts (19–245 km²) in Setesdal Vesthei, Norway, in 2006. Sheep densities in three of eight grazing districts of Setesdal Vesthei fluctuated above the estimated grazing capacity. We fitted 43 sheep with Global Positioning System collars in two contrasting grazing districts in 2007–2008 to assess their selection of the land cover productivity classes in the map used for poststratification. In the area with high vegetation coverage, sheep selection increased in areas with an overall higher productivity, supporting the main basis of the approach. However, in the grazing districts with lower vegetation coverage, selection was higher for areas of overall low vegetation productivity. The likely explanation is the presence of small areas of snow bed vegetation with high-quality forage in areas with a generally rocky surface. Our study provides a first step toward a grazing capacity evaluation to achieve a sustainable management of sheep on alpine ranges of Scandinavia, and our approach is likely applicable to other open alpine ranges in the northern hemisphere.";"Mysterud, Atle

Governance and SD have thus become an interconnected challenge to be applied to WFM (as a sub-area in forest policy), amongst other policies. An overspread weakness in WFM is lack of real participation of stakeholders. Absence of (or deficient) participation can seriously impair contribution of this group to WFM in high-risk areas and runs counter governance and the SDS. Further, this weakness might prevent an efficient use of fire as a land management tool (prescribed burning, PB) and as a technique for fighting wildfire (suppression fire, SF). Even though these fire practices have been well known in many different places, they have been increasingly neglected or prohibited over time in Southern Europe. At present, forest and fire fighting administrations are turning their eyes back on them and analyzing the benefits of using fire in relation to preventive and suppressive actions. Therefore, participatory and diffusion mechanisms (the latter adopting the shape of national and international experts’ networks) are required in order to solve the socalled fire paradox: that is, the need to move from a one-dimensional perception of the negative impacts of fire to a more sophisticated one that also stresses its positive effects. Governance, based on broad social participation, and diffusion, through fire networks, are of utmost importance in order, first, to diminish long-standing suspicion amongst different interests as to the use of fire and, secondly, to diffuse best practices associated with PB and SF. Most importantly, the EU should exercise its environmental leadership so that these new fire practices and sustainable WFM are diffused across the international arena.";"Aguilar, Susana

Land cover/land use was classified by using a recursive partitioning and regression tree with MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data, which were reconstructed based on the Savitzky-Golay filtering approach. The MODIS product Quality Assessment Science Data Sets (QA-SDS) was analyzed and all scenes with valid data covering more than 75% of the Sanjiang Plain were selected for the SEBAL modeling. This provided 12 overpasses during 184-day growing season from May 1st to October 31st, 2006. Daily ET estimated by the SEBAL model was misestimaed at the range of −11.29% to 27.57% compared with that measured by Eddy Covariance system (10.52% on average). The validation results show that seasonal ET from the SEBAL model is comparable to that from ground observation within 8.86% of deviation. Our results reveal that the time series daily ET of different land cover/use increases from vegetation on-going until June or July and then decreases as vegetation senesced. Seasonal ET is lower in dry farmland (average (Ave): 491 mm) and paddy field (Ave: 522 mm) and increases in wetlands to more than 586 mm. As expected, higher seasonal ET values are observed for the Xingkai Lake in the southeastern part of the Sanjiang Plain (Ave: 823 mm), broadleaf forest (Ave: 666 mm) and mixed wood (Ave: 622 mm) in the southern/western Sanjiang Plain. The ET estimation with SEBAL using MODIS products can provide decision support for operational water management issues.";"Du, Jia

"AGRIS:US201400151341";"Discretization approach in integrated Hydrologic Model for surface and groundwater interaction";"";"The commonly used discretization approaches for distributed hydrological models can be broadly categorized into four types, based on the nature of the discrete components: Regular Mesh, Triangular Irregular Networks (TINs), Representative Elementary Watershed (REWs) and Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs). In this paper, a new discretization approach for landforms that have similar hydrologic properties is developed and discussed here for the Integrated Hydrologic Model (IHM), a combining simulation of surface and groundwater processes, accounting for the interaction between the systems. The approach used in the IHM is to disaggregate basin parameters into discrete landforms that have similar hydrologic properties. These landforms may be impervious areas, related areas, areas with high or low clay or organic fractions, areas with significantly different depths-to-water-table, and areas with different types of land cover or different land uses. Incorporating discrete landforms within basins allows significant distributed parameter analysis, but requires an efficient computational structure. The IHM integration represents a new approach interpreting fluxes across the model interface and storages near the interface for transfer to the appropriate model component, accounting for the disparate discretization while rigidly maintaining mass conservation. The discretization approaches employed in IHM will provide some ideas and insights which are helpful to those researchers who have been working on the integrated models for surface-groundwater interaction.";"Zhang, Jing

Much social research into, and policy development for, weeds has conceptualised their control as a problem facing individual landowners, rather than as a collective action problem. In the case of serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma), a highly invasive, noxious weed that is widespread in southeastern Australia, landowners and government staff are acutely aware that this weed is a communal problem. Analysis of semi-structured interviews revealed that landowners and agency staff believe there are three pathways available for communities to achieve greater weed control collectively. These involve sharing information, providing support and applying pressure. These pathways provide two options for future policy development. Firstly, future policies could use the findings to make minor adjustments to the way information is distributed, funding is provided and enforcement is administered. Alternatively, future policies could be refocused to acknowledge good farm management, encourage better relationships among neighbours and build on the social capital that exists in Landcare groups.";"Graham, S.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"landowners";"";"";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500211017";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14486563.2013.774681";"";"";"";"116-129"

Based on the Engerman & Sokoloff hypothesis and the use of GIS, I use plausible exogenous variation in land endowments to design an instrumental variable strategy. In contrast to recent studies, I find that more unequal municipalities in the XIX and XX century are associated with better growth, human capital and public goods provision measures today.

In municipalities where land was historically more concentrated, powerful landowners were more successful in solving their collective action problem of accessing political power to influence theallocation economic resources in their interests.";"Galan, Juan Sebastian";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-02-06";"en";"";"";"";"COL";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016218539";"http://purl.umn.edu/107398";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400064849";"Shifting cultivation in the mountains of South and Southeast Asia: regional patterns and factors influencing the change";"";"Shifting cultivation, which long provided the subsistence requirements of a large number of people in the mountains of South and Southeast Asia under a situation of low population, has been shown to be an environmentally and economically unsuitable practice. Efforts have been made throughout the region to replace it with more productive and sustainable land-use systems. Experiences have been mixed. Shifting cultivation has been almost entirely replaced by sedentary agriculture in Nepal, a considerable change has taken place in Thailand, and moderate changes have taken place in Indonesia and Malaysia. However, shifting cultivation is still being widely practised in the mountains of Bangladesh and Laos, and northeastern India. Such interregional variations are explained by several socio-economic, institutional and policy factors, including population growth, government control of common property resources, the land tenure system, physical infrastructure, technology and necessary support services. This paper concludes that the change from shifting to permanent cultivation does not take place automatically with increasing population pressure as postulated by Boserüp (1965). It takes place when the favourable condition created by population growth is reinforced by other appropriate measures, including ownership rights to land, development of infrastructure and provision of necessary support services and facilities.";"Rasul, G.

"AGRIS:US201400064847";"Biology and establishment of mountain shrubs on mining disturbances in the Rocky Mountains, USA";"";"The Rocky Mountains of the western United States contain many economically important natural resources. Increasing development of these resources has lead to land degradation, which often requires restoration efforts. A common type of disturbance in this region is mineral extraction and these activities often occur in zones of vegetation dominated by shrubs. These mined lands have proven to be particularly challenging to restore to native shrub cover. Mountain shrubland species such as big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata), Saskatoon serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia), black chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos sp.) are crucial species for wildlife in this region due to the seasonal dependence of many wildlife species on the mountain shrubland zones. The development of successful restoration techniques for these key shrub species is therefore important for the continued and sustainable utilization of natural resources in the Rocky Mountains. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a reference to land managers working on woody plant establishment on mining disturbances in mountain shrublands in the Rocky Mountains. This review covers the biology, ecology, and propagation of six shrub species that are of primary importance for meeting regulatory compliance in this region. Based upon this survey of the published literature, we conclude that successful establishment of these species has most often involved: (1) utilization of local shrub ecotypes, varieties or subspecies in reclamation efforts, (2) protection from browsing during the establishment phase, (3) strategies for avoiding herbaceous competition, and (4) providing a source of mutualistic soil organisms. Additional specific recommendations for each of these species are discussed.";"Paschke, M.W.

Yields of arable crops on agropastoralists' fields were generally low. Livestock productivity was similar on all parameters to levels in comparable contexts elsewhere across the West African subregion, but generally below possible potentials and on-farm research findings. Pastoral households' activities presently influence between 221 km2 and 523 km2 of land in Ogun State. Pastoral grazing orbits extended beyond administrative boundaries, causing potential conflicts between local crop farmers and agropatoralists. Much of the land-cover has been altered considerably around the areas of pastoral household settlements compared with the situation 20 years ago.

In particular we find that in areas that already at least partially cleared, improving the road network (i.e. decreasing transport costs) may actually decrease the rate of deforestation. We argue that our methodology of explicitly modeling the dynamics should be preferred to the more common static, contemporaneous analyses found in the literature. Furthermore, we endeavor to provide an encompassing explanation of our results. In other words, not only do we show that dynamic modeling yields different conclusions from the conventional wisdom, but using our dynamic approach we are able to explain why so many other studies came to (possibly erroneous) conclusions using more traditional methods.";"Reis, Eustaquio Jose

The changes of landscape structure were observed in 100 sample areas (squares) each of them having 2.5 km2 area and distributed in different landscape types. The changes in sample areas (squares) with determination of land cover structure transformations were observed using topographic photos and ortophoto images at a scale 1:10 000. More distinct manifestation of landscape re-naturalisation through land abandonment and conversion to forests, swamps and shrubs, also through transformation of arable land to meadows and pastures was the main direction of land cover changes. The opposite but lower scale conversion of forests, shrubs and other land use types to agrarian fields was also noticed. Acceleration of the conversion of landscape structure towards technogenisation through quick expansion of construction, recreational use and development of infrastructure was another important landscape structure conversion going on in the opposite direction of technogenisation. It manifested mainly as the change of agrarian fields, suburban gardens to built-up territories and as increase of percentage of other land use types related to them (ponds, streets and roads).";"Jankauskaite, M., Nature Research Centre, Vilnius (Lithuania).

Drawing lessons from the legal transfer experience of Latin America in the 1960s, the paper attempts to ascertain what relevance, if any, legal transfer has in the context of the emerging market economies and democratic societies of the former communist countries of East Europe and the Soviet Union. It is argued that attempts at exporting laws have failed when little or no attempt is made to understand the processes of how law is legitimized within a specific country. The cultural orientation of a particular country or section of society at a particular point in time will determine how legal culture is formed and sustained and will thus affect the degree to which law is legitimized.

"AGRIS:US2016202191";"Tax Rules, Land Development, and Open Space";"";"Concern about ""open space"" is growing. Conservation advocates worry that private land use decision-makers preserve too little open space. Yet private land developers are deciding on their own to preserve open space in new developments because it provides amenities to purchasers of lots. Moreover, tax provisions provide incentives for preserving more open space than would be privately optimal. Many jurisdictions have adopted ""use-value assessment"" standards granting favorable tax treatment to lands maintained in open space. Also, donations of open space can be deducted from income in computing tax liabilities. Both factors may be empirically important, although tax deductibility may have larger conservation effects than does use-value assessment. These conclusions raise several unanswered questions: How important are tax incentives in practice? Do they motivate enough conservation of open space? Do tax incentives target the right conservation priorities?";"Simpson, R.

Impacts of concentrated precipitation events include the damage caused by landslides. Many areas in Gangwondo (Korea) are located at high elevation and have large elevation differences; these areas are thus at high risk of landslides. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the landslide hazard of the province using representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 and to compare results. This study produced an optimal landslide model for the province through analysis of variables and points of landslide origin. Estimates indicate that the landslide hazard area will increase to 154 km². The RCP 8.5 scenario showed a larger (by about 59 km²) landslide hazard area than the RCP 4.5 scenario. The uncertainty of climate change scenarios was also explored using statistical values of each scenario period. An overlay analysis (overlay of landslide hazard areas and land cover map) showed that 40.6 % of farmlands would be susceptible to landslides in 2070–2099 (RCP 8.5). Additionally, damage to the alpine agriculture due to landslides was also identified as a critical area. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, the land-use types that occupy more than 20 % of the landslide hazard area are transportation, recreational facilities, and vinyl house for farming. This suggests that casualties from landslides will increase in future. It also highlights a lack of policies to manage development. Therefore, the local government of Gangwondo should consider landslide hazard areas when planning future land uses.";"Kim, Ho Gul

The instrument employs a continuous wave quantum cascade laser to scan over the absorption features of N₂O, CH₄ and water vapor at 7.8μm. The precision of the N₂O flux measurements was determined to be 0.2nmolm⁻² s⁻¹ but the accuracy can easily be affected by water vapor interferences twice as large. These water vapor interferences are not only due to the respective gas dilution effect but also due to an additional cross-sensitivity of the N₂O analyzer to water vapor (0.3ppb N₂O/% H₂O). Both effects cause a negative bias of similar magnitude (0.3nmolm⁻² s⁻¹ N₂O flux/mmolm⁻² s⁻¹ H₂O flux) in the flux measurements. While the dilution (or density) correction is a well known and routinely applied procedure, the magnitude of the analyzer cross-talk may depend on the specific instrumental setup and should be empirically determined. The comparison with static chamber measurements shows the necessity of the cross-talk correction; otherwise the QCL-AS based eddy covariance system would yield unrealistically large uptake of N₂O.";"Neftel, Albrecht

Besides clean development mechanisms, the reduction of emission through deforestation and degradation (REDD) initiative is viewed as one way to mitigate climate change. Important forest habitat protection activities have already been implemented with the aim of conserving the biodiversity of the region in a sustainable manner. The main causes of land use changes in the region are small holder subsistence practices and logging activities. Agricultural production has low productivity levels and therefore investments in improved agricultural techniques can both reduce pressure on existing forests and perhaps allow for the reforestation of existing degraded lands. The logging industry is dominated by large, industrial scale, logging operations performing selective logging of specific species and large trees. The adoption of improved forest management practices can reduce the impact of such logging on the ecological integrity and carbon stocks. Some efforts to engage in the carbon market have begun in the region. Further research is needed into the types of projects that will most likely become successful in the region and what locations will offer the greatest benefits.";"Sonwa, Denis J.

The eutrophication of streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and costal zones is one of the most important consequences of human activities. In this study we assessed the trophic status of 28 wadeable stream reaches of the Santa Lucía basin, an important economic region of Uruguay. We developed a Trophic State Index of Benthic Invertebrates (TSI-BI), the first of its kind for South American lotic systems. The methodological approach consisted of determining the ambient trophic gradient via canonical correspondence analysis based on the benthic invertebrate abundance matrix and an environmental variable matrix. The rescaled site scores served as environmental variables in the weighted averaging model (WA), to weight the benthic abundances and then find the optimum and tolerance of each of the sampled genus. These data were used to estimate the TSI-BI scores. These scores, in conjunction with the total phosphorus concentrations (TP), were used to group the study reaches when running a cluster analysis. The basic statistical parameters of the defined groups serve as an input to identify the threshold values of TP and TSI-BI corresponding with the different trophic states. The boundaries of TSI-BI and TP demarcating mesotrophic and eutrophic states were 8 and 71μg/l, respectively, and can be considered the limits between impaired and less altered reaches. The results also indicated that the trophic status of the reaches is related to land use intensity.

"AGRIS:US201301618999";"Perceptions of Texas Landowners Regarding Fire and Its Use";"";"Growing recognition that periodic fire is critical for maintaining the health of many rangeland ecosystems and concerns over more frequent catastrophic wildfires have focused attention on prescribed fire as an ecosystem restoration and fuel management tool. In states such as Texas, where most land is privately owned, the level of success of outreach activities aimed at expanding the adoption of specific management practices is influenced by the extent to which landowners' perceptions, interests, and concerns regarding such practices are addressed. This is particularly important for prescribed fire, which has been perceived by many landowners to be a dangerous or wasteful practice. Here we report the results of a mail survey of 185 members of the Edwards Plateau Prescribed Burn Association (EPPBA) and a random sample of 600 nonmember rural landowners in four counties in the Edwards Plateau and two counties in the Rolling Plains ecoregions of Texas. The overall response rate was 46.6%. Primary reasons respondents did not apply fire on their land were insufficient resources, legal concerns, and lack of assistance with burn plan development. EPPBA members had more positive attitudes than nonmembers about the ecological role of fire and the use of prescribed fire. Our study suggests that adoption of prescribed burning as an integral part of land management plans by private landowners could be expanded by forming new prescribed burning associations. The EPPBA model for such associations provides learning opportunities that are consistent with adult learning and innovation adoption principles. It facilitates fire safety training, reduces concerns over legal liability associated with fire ignition, and enhances access to shared fire management equipment and labor on burn days. The two-tiered structure of the EPPBA with some form of state-level representation appears to be an efficient organizational structure for these associations.";"Kreuter, Urs P.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District.

GIS-based spatial multi-criteria evaluation approach, in terms of the FLOWA module was used to assess the land suitability for large PV farms implementation in Oman. The tool used applies fuzzy quantifiers within ArcGIS environment allowing the integration of a multi-criteria decision analysis. Land suitability analysis for large PV farms implementation was carried out for the case study of Oman. The overlay results obtained from the analysis of the resultant maps showed that 0.5% of the total land area demonstrate a high suitability level. Different PV technologies were considered for implementation. It was found that the CPV technology provides very high technical potential for implementing large solar plants. In fact, if all highly suitable land is completely exploited for CPV implementation, it can produce almost 45.5 times the present total power demand in Oman.";"Charabi, Yassine

We created a detailed land cover map of dune sites. The spatial pattern of natural dune cover types was characterized by computing a set of patch-based metrics. To quantify patch plant richness, we used 16 m ² vegetation plots, randomly distributed on coastal dune cover types. For each patch, the richness of the entire pool of species and of three guilds (i.e., typical dune, ruderal, and alien species) was considered. We compared different levels of human pressure on coastal dunes focusing on pattern metrics and floristic information by using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. In sites with high human pressure, we have observed a general simplification in the natural dune spatial pattern and a decline of plant richness but with a specific response for each cover type. Alien and ruderal species presented low richness in all patches. In coastal dunes, the harsh ecological conditions and the strong sea–inland gradient shape the distribution of human activities and control the number of ruderal species. The approach effectively describes fragmentation and biodiversity in dune ecosystems.";"Malavasi, M.

During desertification, vegetation changes have been widely observed, and are likely controlled to some extent by soil water. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in soil physical properties, organic C, and vegetation induced by land-use changes, with special reference to the dynamics of available soil water. We selected four study sites in a typical Mongolian steppe grassland: grassland protected from grazing, grazed grassland, abandoned cropland, and cultivated cropland. Grazing exclusion increased the cover of perennial grass, with little increase in the root weight. Since there was no difference in available water between the grasslands with and without grazing, there appears to be no serious soil compaction due to overgrazing. On the other hand, vegetation cover and the number of species were poor in both abandoned cropland and cultivated cropland. However, the root weight was greater in abandoned cropland. Although the abandonment of cultivation appeared to increase organic C, available water did not differ significantly in comparison with cultivated cropland. The silt contents were significantly lower in abandoned and cultivated cropland than in both grasslands, suggesting the effects of wind erosion. In addition, the silt contents were positively correlated with the volume fraction of storage pores for available water. Therefore, the lower silt contents may constrain the volume of available water in abandoned cropland. Moreover, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity results indicated that the diameters of storage pores for available water at the present study sites were smaller than those suggested by previous studies. Although the differences in vegetation cover by different land-use types were observed at every site, differences in the volume of available water were observed at between abandoned cropland and cultivated cropland. The reason why the no differences in available water between grazed grassland and grasslands protected from grazing may be short time of grazing exclusion for 2 years for evaluating the effects of exclusion on soil properties.";"Hoshino, A.

It ishypothesized that poor economic condition of farmers impedes their ability to make large-scale investmentin conservation agriculture, in general and improvement of land, in particular. The study is based on twogroups of farms- with and without conservation history. The results have substantiated the argument thatunder the present price scenario, farm profitability makes the marginal farms susceptible to a viciouspoverty circle. The input and output prices prevailing in the region do not favour the farming enterprise.Thus, this policy variable would have little impact on farm profitability and the incentive to adopt conservationon farm. Hence, such farms need an initial dose of state help. This fact has been clearly brought out in thestudy area. The farms benefiting from past conservation programme of the state government have donebetter than those who were deprived of it. The former group of farms has been able to lease-in better pieceof land and take cash crop to raise their profit level. This has positively affected their investment decisions.While land tenure has shown weak relation with decision of farm investment, farmers’ credit worthinessmight play a greater role in helping adoption of conservation on farm. Thus, financial inclusion of thesemarginal farms could be an important incentive policy variable for adoption of conservation measures inthis region.";"Pande, V.C.

A combination of models would provide the necessary direction and approaches designed to control NPS pollution through land use planning. In this study, NPS pollution load was simulated in urban planning, historic trends and ecological protection land use scenarios based on the Conversion of Land Use and its Effect at Small regional extent (CLUE-S) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models applied to Hunhe-Taizi River Watershed, Liaoning Province, China. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were chosen as NPS pollution indices. The results of models validation showed that CLUE-S and SWAT models were suitable in the study area. NPS pollution mainly came from dry farmland, paddy, rural and urban areas. The spatial distribution of TN and TP exhibited the same trend in 57 sub-catchments. The TN and TP had the highest NPS pollution load in the western and central plains, which concentrated the urban area and farm land. The NPS pollution load would increase in the urban planning and historic trends scenarios, and would be even higher in the urban planning scenario. However, the NPS pollution load decreased in the ecological protection scenario. The differences observed in the three scenarios indicated that land use had a degree of impact on NPS pollution, which showed that scientific and ecologically sound construction could effectively reduce the NPS pollution load in a watershed. This study provides a scientific method for conducting NPS pollution research at the watershed scale, a scientific basis for non-point source pollution control, and a reference for related policy making.";"Liu, Miao

In contrast, model results are mixed with respect to the direction of the decoupling effect on oilseed and pasture as well as voluntary set aside area. The model type is not found to have a systematic effect on model results. It is rather the assumptions about the effects of direct payments on production which differ widely and drive model results to a large extent.

Two hundred and eighty-two topsoil (0–30 cm) samples were randomly collected and analyzed. pH and clay followed a normal distribution, whereas sand EC, CaCO ₃, OC and K were log-transformed. The highest variation was observed for soil EC, and the lowest for soil pH. In the variography analysis, spherical, exponential and gaussian models were best fit on experimental semivariograms. The minimum effective spatial autocorrelation was 1500 m for OC and the maximum effective spatial autocorrelation was 4000 m for sand and K. Strong spatial correlations were noted with sand and CaCO ₃ (<25%), whereas values were moderate for clay, EC, OC and K (25–75%). Ordinary kriging was utilized for the interpolation of estimated variable determinations in unsampled sites. It was found that soil properties in this study area were strongly influenced by both environmental and natural factors.

"AGRIS:US201301574888";"Land use and disturbance effects on the dynamics of natural ecosystems of the Monte Desert: Implications for their management";"";"The complex interactions between human activity and natural processes determine non-linear dynamics in ecosystems that can difficult their management. Human settlements in arid lands contribute to the modification of disturbance regimes, including the introduction of new disturbances and the elimination of others. In consequence, they can alter the functional mechanisms that allow systems to overcome limiting factors, leading to desertification. In this revision, we evaluated the effects of the changes on disturbance regimes produced by the different forms of land transformation on the structure and function of ecosystems of the Monte Biogeographical Province, in Argentinean arid west. Two approaches were used: the analysis of land use history and the analysis of the effects of the main disturbances on the dynamics of different communities. We concluded that throughout the history of the Monte Desert, the joint action of natural and anthropic agents has resulted in complex dynamics that lead most area of the Monte to a moderate to severe status of desertification. The modification of the disturbance regime had strong consequences for several aspects of the dynamics of communities, such as species composition and diversity, water dynamics, soil conditions, trophic structure and productivity of Monte Desert ecosystems. However, disturbance regimes could be managed to promote favorable transitions in ecosystems and, therefore, could be a tool for optimizing productivity of agro-ecosystems, and recovering and conserving natural ecosystems.";"Villagra, P.E.

The geomorphologic units of the study area were delineated through visual interpretation of IRS–ID LISS-III data based on the spatial variation of the image characteristics. Thirteen landform units have been identified in the tahsil. The slope varied from level to nearly level with an area of about 63.76% of the tahsil. Rest of the area ranged from very gentle to moderately steep slopes. During soil survey, soil profiles were studied for morphological features. Horizon-wise soil samples were collected from the representative soil profiles on each landform unit. The depth of soil varied from 25 to 160 cm and colour from dark brown to very dark grayish brown. The texture ranged from clay loam to clayey in accordance with higher and lower topographic positions respectively. Higher available water holding capacity (AWC 285 mm) is found in low-lying area and low to medium AWC (140 mm) is noticed in the soils developed at higher elevation. The soils reaction (pH) is strongly acidic in nature (pH 5.2) on dissected hills, linear ridge and moderately weathered pediments, whereas, the soils are moderately to slightly acidic in nature (pH 5.5 to 6.5) on hills, shallow weathered pediments, moderately weathered pediments, deeply weathered pediments, narrow valleys, and broad valley floors. Slightly alkaline condition (pH 7.6) was observed on foot slopes and aggraded valley fills. The electrical conductivity of the soils is found almost same in all landforms. The cation exchange capacity of the area varies from 10.5 to 51.5 cmol(p⁺)kg⁻¹. The base saturation increases with decreasing elevation and slope. The four major soil orders viz, Entisols, Alfisols, Inceptisols and Vertisols are found in the study areas which are further classified into suborder and great group levels. The landform and soil relationship was analyzed to appraise the land resources in the tahsil. The study shows that the application of remotely sensed data and GIS are immensely helpful in land resources appraisal for their management on sustainable basis.";"Dongare, Vishakha T.

"AGRIS:US201500162934";"Cattle-raising and public credit in rural settlements in Eastern Amazon";"";"The practice of raising cattle in the Amazon has been connected to deforestation, which has been especially intense in the Eastern Amazonian state of Pará that contained 23% of new rural settlements before 2008. The settlements were part of a program of land reform that allowed farmers to receive public credit. Public credit aims to increase production and incorporation of new technologies by settled farmers, which can lead to a decrease in pressure on forested areas. Public credit, however, may also result in an increase in deforestation if farmers use the loans for extending their pastureland. In small farms with different characteristics situated in southeastern Pará, credit is not an important driver for the expansion of pastureland. The expansion was instead associated with larger farms and longer periods of cattle-raising. On the other hand, small farms cannot properly develop cattle-raising without credit. At least six years of operation and 25ha are required for changes in the indicators of cattle-raising activities to be detected. Small farms that are relatively new to bovine production have more difficulties accessing public credit and face strong constraints to increasing the herds and the production of milk.";"da S.

We established 22–0.04 ha plots in six different land cover types—rural slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations (n = 3), rural natural pine forests (n = 3), rural natural oak forests (n = 4), urban pine forests (n = 3), urban oak forests (n = 4) and urban lawns (n = 5) to investigate how net soil nitrogen mineralization rates and soil microbial biomass differed between urban forests and rural forests and between urban forests and urban lawns in the Florida panhandle. Urban forest sites have 2.5 times as much net total nitrogen mineralized than rural forest sites based on the mean daily rates averaged over the 2 years study (2010–2012). Urbanization may increase soil microbial biomass and activity (potential carbon mineralization rates) and this may be influencing the soil nitrogen mineralization rates in the forest sites. To include an urban lawn (turfgrass) component in the study, one time measurements of soils from the aforementioned forest sites and from urban lawn sites (no fertilization, no irrigation) were collected in 2012. Urban forest sites and urban lawns sites do not differ in their potential carbon mineralization rates, potential net total nitrogen mineralization rates or microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen contents. However, lawns have a higher potential net nitrification rate compared to urban forests.";"Enloe, Heather A.

The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to define safeguard zones for the protection of carbonate groundwater bodies intended for human consumption. To do this, firstly the risk of groundwater contamination is evaluated through a combination of characterising pressures and the evaluation of the intrinsic vulnerability to contamination. Secondly, the existing water abstraction points are identified and their zones of contribution are delineated in order to establish priorities when defining protective measures in the region. Finally, the existing wellhead protection areas and those defined according to the proposed methodology must be integrated into the delineated safeguard zones. The results obtained in a carbonate groundwater body in southern Spain are consistent with the existing quality data and they show the percentage of land that must be protected to preserve the quality of water intended for human consumption, thus facilitating their future integration into adequate land use planning tools.";"Jiménez-Madrid, A.

Between 1855 and 1881, the majority of government 'wastelands' were given on lease to farmers who organized the land into grazing paddocks and fenced with hedges of Balasmodendron berryi. Numerous wells were dug in the grazing lands to provide water for drinking to animals and to some extent for irrigation. Between July and February, the animals are exclusively grazed by rotating between paddocks. The grazing lands are cultivated every 4 to 5 years and sorghum is sown and made into hay for animal feeding between March and June. In several places, the Cenchrus dominated grassland is also sown with legumes like Phaseolus trilobus to improve the quality of forage. Security of land tenure coupled with technological interventions has sustained the productive capacity of the grassland for over a century.

A field study was conducted from 2002 to 2006 to identify the impacts of deferred grazing (no defoliation of pastures for a period generally from spring to autumn) and fertilizer application on herbage accumulation, soil seed reserve and nutritive value in a hill pasture in western Victoria, Australia. Three deferred grazing strategies were used: short‐term deferred grazing (no defoliation between October and January), long‐term deferred grazing (no defoliation from October to the autumn break) and optimized deferred grazing (withholding time from grazing commenced between annual grass stem elongation and seed head emergence and concluded in February/March). These treatments were applied with two fertilizer levels (with or without fertilizer at 50 kg phosphorus ha⁻¹ and 2000 kg lime ha⁻¹ applied in year 1 only) in a factorial arrangement and two additional treatments: continuous grazing (CG) and no grazing (NG) in year 1. The deferred grazing treatments on average produced herbage dry matter of 4773 kg ha⁻¹, the NG produced 4583 kg ha⁻¹ and the CG produced 3183 kg ha⁻¹ in year 4 (2005–06) of the experiment. Deferred grazing treatments with and without fertilizer application produced an average of 5135 and 4411 kg DM ha⁻¹ respectively. Averaged over 4 years, deferred grazing increased the germinable seed pool of perennial grasses by 200% and annual grasses by 50% (except optimized deferred grazing that considerably decreased the annual grass seed pool) compared with the CG. The best of the deferred grazing strategies increased the digestibility of pastures by 7% compared with the CG. The results demonstrated that deferred grazing from spring to autumn followed by rotational grazing could be an effective tool to increase herbage production and soil seed pool and improve the digestibility of native pastures in the steep hill country of southern Australia.";"Nie, Z.

"AGRIS:US2016200673";"LAND AND POPULATION ON THE INDIAN RESERVATION OF WISCONSIN: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE";"";"The historical relationship between land use and population change among Wisconsin's Indian groups has been strikingly emblematic of the larger American Indian population. The ingredients of this rich relationship include the state's natural resource base, as well as the major engines of demographic change, namely fertility, mortality, and migration. In addition, federal policies have played a critical role in mediating this relationship. These policies have figured prominently since the earliest contact between Europeans and Wisconsin Indians and have continued to exert substantial influence. This paper discusses the past, present, and future relationship between the land and the state's Indian populations, paying particular attention to reservation populations. The reciprocal relationship between land and population among Wisconsin's Indians has evolved in an environment of changing social and political forces. Hence, the paper treats these issues in a chronological manner. It begins by reviewing the early period of contact between Europeans and Indians in the area known today as Wisconsin. Then, it discusses the creation of the state of Wisconsin and various Indian reservations, as well as their implications for Indian populations in the state. Next, it discusses federal land policies of the 19th and 20th centuries, and their effects on Wisconsin reservation populations.

We examined the habitat selection of red wolves (Canis rufus) in North Carolina, USA, where the population of red wolves resides in a mosaic of naturally occurring and human-associated land cover. We used locations from 20 GPS-collared red wolves, monitored over 3years, to develop resource selection functions at the landscape level. Red wolves selected for human-associated land-cover over other land-cover types. Red wolves also selected areas near secondary roads. However, red wolves avoided areas with high human density, and avoidance of natural land-cover types decreased as human density increased; this interaction was strong enough that red wolves selected for natural land-cover types over human-associated land-cover types at relatively high human density. Similarly, avoidance of natural land-cover types decreased when they were near secondary roads. These results suggest that red wolves will use human-associated landscapes, but modify their habitat selection patterns with increased human presence. Such findings suggest that large carnivores such as the red wolf may not strictly require habitats devoid of humans. In a world with rapid human-alteration of habitat, understanding how increasing human density and development impact habitat selection is vital to managing for population persistence of large carnivores and maintaining top-down ecological processes.";"Dellinger, Justin A.

"AGRIS:US201400159887";"simulation of water markets with transaction costs";"";"Most theorists regard transaction costs as one of the key lenses to understand the water rights market. This paper proposes a theoretical model of water rights trading with transaction costs according to the idea of costs minimization. Applying the model to the Yellow River Basin (YRB), we evaluate the potential of investment savings from introducing the trans-jurisdictional water market to achieve the water-saving targets of agricultural and industrial sectors. The simulation results confirm that the potential benefits from the trans-jurisdictional water markets are considerable in the condition of zero transaction costs, and the benefits are inclined to increase with the decrease of transaction costs. The potential of trading water between the agricultural sector and the industrial sector is much larger than within the agricultural sector. The simulation also implies that the agricultural sector is more sensitive to transaction costs than the industrial sector, and thus priority should be given to reduce the transaction costs paid by the agricultural sector in the institutional design of inter-sectoral water transfers.";"Wang, Yahua";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"water rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400159887";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2011.10.017";"";"";"";"54-61"
"AGRIS:US201600126112";"Assessment of land suitability for olive mill wastewater disposal site selection by integrating fuzzy logic, AHP, and WLC in a GIS";"";"This paper presents a geographic information system–based multi-criteria site selection tool of an olive mill wastewater (OMW) disposal site in Sidi Bouzid Region, Tunisia. The multi-criteria decision framework integrates ten constraints and six factors that relate to environmental and economic concerns, and builds a hierarchy model for OMW disposal site suitability. The methodology is used for preliminary assessment of the most suitable OMW disposal sites by combining fuzzy set theory and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The fuzzy set theory is used to standardize factors using different fuzzy membership functions while the AHP is used to establish the relative importance of the criteria. The AHP makes pairwise comparisons of relative importance between hierarchy elements grouped by both environmental and economic decision criteria. The OMW disposal site suitability is achieved by applying a weighted linear combination that uses a comparison matrix to aggregate different importance scenarios associated with environmental and economic objectives. Three different scenarios generated by different weights applied to the two objectives. The scenario (a) assigns a weight of 0.75 to the environmental and 0.25 to the economic objective, scenario (b) has equal weights, and scenario (c) features weights of 0.25 and 0.75 for environmental and economic objectives, respectively. The results from this study assign the least suitable OMW disposal site of 2.5 % when environmental and economic objectives are rated equally, while a more suitable OMW disposal site of 1.0 % is generated when the economic objective is rated higher.";"Aydi, Abdelwaheb

"AGRIS:US201400158769";"evaluation of the effectiveness of a direct payment for biodiversity conservation: The Bird Nest Protection Program in the Northern Plains of Cambodia";"";"Direct payments for the protection of biodiversity (a type of payment for environmental services) have been proposed as an effective tool for delivering conservation outcomes, in a way that also delivers development benefits to local people. Using an impact evaluation framework, this paper analyses the effectiveness of a direct payment program that was established for nine globally threatened bird species in the Northern Plains of Cambodia. The program provided conditional payments to local people to protect nests, since most of the species were highly threatened by the collection of eggs and chicks. Since the program’s inception in 2003 it has protected >2700 nests over >2000km² of habitat at a cost of $30,000 annually, with 71–78% of the costs paid directly to local people. Payments significantly improved the success rates of protected nests in comparison with control sites, leading to population increases for at least three species. However, payments did not influence other threats to species, such as land clearance, and have failed to arrest declines in at least one species’ population. The average payment per protector was a significant contribution to incomes in remote rural villages. However, the program only benefited a small proportion of people, causing some local jealousies and deliberate disturbance of nesting birds. The program demonstrates that direct payments can be a highly effective conservation tool in those cases where payments correctly target the cause of biodiversity loss. The results also suggest that it is important to consider how decisions over beneficiaries are made, especially in situations where property rights over biodiversity are unclear, if payments are to be socially acceptable. This has important implications for the design of payment schemes in conservation more generally.";"Clements, Tom

"AGRIS:US2016210532";"Theory and Identification of Marginal Land and Factors Determining Land Use Change";"";"Biomass is being researched as a possible alternative to fossil sources of energy, in order to avoid externalities from fossil fuel use that affect the environment and the economy.  Some biomass-based energy production systems may produce unwanted externalities in their own right, such as increasing the production pressure on the agricultural land base, resulting in a rise in prices of food commodities.  Using marginal land for biomass production has been suggested as a solution.  However, the definition of what constitutes marginal land is poorly understood.  This paper provides a theoretical foundation for identification of marginal lands, and analyzes recent literature to assess how current usage of the term marginal correspond to the theoretical framework.  Then, the paper devises empirical models  that test possible methods of identification of the extensive margin of agricultural land in 19 counties in the state of Michigan.  The models find that dynamic variables such as price changes have a statistically significant effect on land use change into and out of cropland.  Land quality and regional effects are also statistically significant.";"James, Laura";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"land use;land reform";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016210532";"http://purl.umn.edu/98203";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201300792727";"Homogenization of northern U.S. Great Lakes forests due to land use";"";"Human land use of forested regions has intensified worldwide in recent decades, threatening long-term sustainability. Primary effects include conversion of land cover or reversion to an earlier stage of successional development. Both types of change can have cascading effects through ecosystems; however, the long-term effects where forests are allowed to regrow are poorly understood. We quantify the regional-scale consequences of a century of Euro-American land use in the northern U.S. Great Lakes region using a combination of historical Public Land Survey records and current forest inventory and land cover data. Our analysis shows a distinct and rapid trajectory of vegetation change toward historically unprecedented and simplified conditions. In addition to overall loss of forestland, current forests are marked by lower species diversity, functional diversity, and structural complexity compared to pre-Euro-American forests. Today's forest is marked by dominance of broadleaf deciduous species--all 55 ecoregions that comprise the region exhibit a lower relative dominance of conifers in comparison to the pre-Euro-American period. Aspen (Populus grandidentata and P. tremuloides) and maple (Acer saccharum and A. rubrum) species comprise the primary deciduous species that have replaced conifers. These changes reflect the cumulative effects of local forest alterations over the region and they affect future ecosystem conditions as well as the ecosystem services they provide.";"Schulte, Lisa A.

"AGRIS:US201400101896";"Behavioural context of multi-scale species distribution models assessed by radio-tracking";"";"Incorporating ecological processes and animal behaviour into Species Distribution Models (SDMs) is difficult. In species with a central resting or breeding place, there can be conflict between the environmental requirements of the ‘central place’ and foraging habitat. We apply a multi-scale SDM to examine habitat trade-offs between the central place, roost sites, and foraging habitat in Myotis nattereri. We validate these derived associations using habitat selection from behavioural observations of radio-tracked bats. A Generalised Linear Model (GLM) of roost occurrence using land cover variables with mixed spatial scales indicated roost occurrence was positively associated with woodland on a fine scale and pasture on a broad scale. Habitat selection of radio-tracked bats mirrored the SDM with bats selecting for woodland in the immediate vicinity of individual roosts but avoiding this habitat in foraging areas, whilst pasture was significantly positively selected for in foraging areas. Using habitat selection derived from radio-tracking enables a multi-scale SDM to be interpreted in a behavioural context. We suggest that the multi-scale SDM of M. nattereri describes a trade-off between the central place and foraging habitat. Multi-scale methods provide a greater understanding of the ecological processes which determine where species occur and allow integration of behavioural processes into SDMs. The findings have implications when assessing the resource use of a species at a single point in time. Doing so could lead to misinterpretation of habitat requirements as these can change within a short time period depending on specific behaviour, particularly if detectability changes depending on behaviour.";"Lundy, Mathieu G.

"AGRIS:US201300792729";"Effects of stream map resolution on measures of riparian buffer distribution and nutrient retention potential";"";"Riparian ecosystems are interfaces between aquatic and terrestrial environments recognized for their nutrient interception potential in agricultural landscapes. Stream network maps from a broad range of map resolutions have been employed in watershed studies of riparian areas. However, map resolution may affect important attributes of riparian buffers, such as the connectivity between source lands and small stream channels missing in coarse resolution maps. We sought to understand the influence of changing stream map resolution on measures of the river network, near-stream land cover, and riparian metrics. Our objectives were: (1) to evaluate the influence of stream map resolution on measures of the stream network, the character and extent of near-stream zones, and riparian metrics; (2) to compare patterns of variation among different physiographic provinces; and (3) to explore how predictions of nutrient retention potential might be affected by the resolution of a stream map. We found that using fine resolution stream maps significantly increased our estimates of stream order, drainage density, and the proportion of watershed area occurring near a stream. Increasing stream map resolution reduced the mean distance to source areas as well as mean buffer width and increased the frequency of buffer gaps. Measures of percent land cover within 100 m of streams were less sensitive to stream map resolution. Overall, increasing stream map resolution led to reduced estimates of nutrient retention potential in riparian buffers. In some watersheds, switching from a coarse resolution to a fine resolution stream map completely changed our perception of a stream network from well buffered to largely unbuffered. Because previous, broad-scale analyses of riparian buffers used coarse-resolution stream maps, those studies may have overestimated landscape-level buffer prevalence and effectiveness. We present a case study of three watersheds to demonstrate that interactions among stream map resolution and land cover patterns make a dramatic difference in the perceived ability of riparian buffers to ameliorate effects of agricultural activities across whole watersheds. Moreover, stream map resolution affects inferences about whether retention occurs in streams or riparian zones.";"Baker, Matthew E.

"AGRIS:US201600198397";"Habitat connectivity shapes urban arthropod communities: the key role of green roofs";"";"The installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (Î² diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of highâmobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while lowâmobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping highâmobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, lowâmobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of lowâmobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for lowâmobility species.";"Braaker, S.

Using two different measurement methods, this study sought to identify and compare perceived and observed neighborhood indicators of obesity and a high-risk profile of being obese and inactive. Design: Cross-sectional telephone surveys (perceived) and street-scale environmental audits (observed) were conducted concurrently in two diverse US cities to assess recreational facility access, land use, transportation infrastructure and aesthetics. Subjects: A total of 1032 randomly selected urban residents (20% obese, 32% black, 65% female). Analysis: Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association (adjusted prevalence odds ratio (aOR)) between the primary outcome (obese vs normal weight) and perceived and observed environmental indicators, controlling for demographic variables. Results: Being obese was significantly associated with perceived indicators of no nearby nonresidential destinations (aOR=2.2), absence of sidewalks (aOR=2.2), unpleasant community (aOR=3.1) and lack of interesting sites (aOR=4.8) and observed indicators of poor sidewalk quality (aOR=2.1), physical disorder (aOR=4.0) and presence of garbage (aOR=3.7). Perceived and observed indicators of land use and aesthetics were the most robust neighborhood correlates of obesity in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: The findings contribute substantially to the growing evidence base of community-level correlates of obesity and suggest salient environmental and policy intervention strategies that may reduce population-level obesity prevalence. Continued use of both measurement methods is recommended to clarify inconsistent associations across perceived and observed indicators within the same domain.";"Boehmer, T.K.

A few studies and reports have offered valuable but general advice on what the funders of this science can do to better link science with decisions; there are fewer still published empirical case studies assessing the impacts of innovative funder methods for getting more science used by intended audiences. Here, we report on three case studies involving new tools and science to help land use planners better protect coastal resources. Our qualitative analysis indicates that funder efforts to bring scientists and users into greater alignment did improve the extent to which science linked to decisions. However, these cases show that funders can and should do more if the paramount motivation behind the science is to address societal problems rather than generate new knowledge. Based on these findings, we assert that funders need to focus significantly more attention and resources on the user engagement aspect of science projects, making strong user engagement methods as important as strong biophysical science or social science methods.";"Matso, Kalle E.

This work uses a mixed qualitative and quantitative method to understand farmer knowledge of ESS and willingness to manage lands from an ESS perspective. Fourteen interviews were conducted to analyze farmer understanding of ESS within the context of conservation management. Two hundred surveys of Indiana farmers and 33 surveys of Indiana US Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service conservationists (‘conservationists’) were analyzed in order to assess ESS knowledge derived from varied land types. Though most farmers and conservationists were unfamiliar with ESS, both groups consistently recognized environmental benefits from land types and conservation practices. They were also able to identify trade-offs in ESS when managing lands for maximum food production. Farmers and conservationists differed in their views of the beneficiaries and stewards of ESS, which also varied by land type. Overall, this study shows that while Indiana farmers and conservationists are aware of ESS concepts, some ESS are more easily recognized and understood than others. By understanding how farmers view and describe ESS, we can start applying the ESS concept to agricultural management in the United States.";"Logsdon, Rebecca A.

Soil Taxonomy was used to characterize the major soil types; however, to assist end users, a complementary special‐purpose soil classification system was developed in the form of a soil identification key using plain language terms in English that were also translated into Malay. Easily recognized soil features such as depth, colour and texture were used to categorize soils to match Soil Taxonomy classes. To complement the soil identification key, conceptual soil toposequence models presented the soil distribution patterns in a visual format that local land users understood. Legacy soil survey information along with a widespread distribution of 172 soil sites from 35 traverses in 16 study areas provided a dataset to develop and test soil toposequence models and the soil identification key which both proved reliable and robust.

The average rough rice yield in irrigated predominantly direct-seeded dry zone (DZ) is about 5.0tha⁻¹and in the wet zone (WZ) it is about 3.3tha⁻¹. However the average realizable yield in DZ and WZ are 8tha⁻¹ and 5tha⁻¹ respectively. A survey was conducted to understand the cultural practices, farmers' perceptions and the reasons for the yield gap in direct-seeded rice culture in Sri Lanka. Farmers' seed rate ranged from 87 to 220kgha⁻¹ for intermediate bold-type varieties and from 71 to 176kgha⁻¹ for varieties with short round grains. About 90% of the farmers in the DZ and the intermediate zone (IZ) consider both yield potential and duration as criteria in selecting a variety. Among the farmers surveyed, only 21% of the farmers in the DZ, 13% of the farmers in the IZ, and 29% of the farmers in the WZ adhered to the recommended method of basal fertilizer application. Farmers did not adhere to the correct timing of fertilizer application. More than 50% of the cost for rice farming goes to labor, followed by cost of inputs in all climatic zones. Farmers reported that the most important production constraint for direct-seeded rice in the DZ and IZ is the non availability of reliable labor followed by soil problems and weeds. While in the WZ, it is the soil problems specially iron toxicity followed by lower soil fertility. The survey revealed that smaller land holding size, non adherence to the optimum time of farm activity initiation, less efficient use of rain water, higher seed rate and higher cost of production are a few reasons for the existing yield gap. Location-specific technologies for different agro-ecological zones of Sri Lanka should be developed to reduce the cost of production and to increase resource-use efficiency and should be transferred to the farmers to achieve sustainable optimum direct-seeded rice yields.";"Weerakoon, W.M.W.

"AGRIS:US201301689409";"Planning and management modeling for treated wastewater usage";"";"Due to urban growth, some agricultural lands have been replaced by residential, municipal, and industrial areas. In some cases the remaining agricultural land will not have enough water because of transfers from agriculture to M''I (municipal and industrial) users. Therefore, in many places, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, the use of treated wastewater as a reliable source of irrigation water has already been, or will be, considered in the future. Due to its unique characteristics, this new resource has many challenges that cannot be ignored, such as health issues, water quality, and long- and short-term effects on soils and crops. The study described herein considered the development of a new GIS-based model for planning and managing the reuse of treated wastewater for the irrigation of agricultural and green lands, considering various factors such as population and urban growth. The model is composed of several different modules, including an urban growth model. These modules are designed to help in the decision-making process for allocations of water resources to agricultural areas, considering factors such as crop types, crop pattern, water salinity, soil characteristics, pumping and conveyance costs, and also by comparing different management scenarios. Appropriate crops that can be grown with a specific water salinity and soil characteristics, proper water resources for each farm (according to pumping and conveyance costs, and analysis of water demand, and water supply) can be determined through the application of this model. The model can also rank agricultural areas and open spaces in and near an urban area according to their suitability for irrigated agriculture.";"Ahmadi, Leila

"AGRIS:US201300759930";"Influence of a Large Herbivore Reintroduction on Plant Invasions and Community Composition in a California Grassland";"";"Despite many successful reintroductions of large mammalian herbivores throughout the world, remarkably little attention has focused on how these actions affect native and exotic vegetation at reintroduction sites. One such herbivore is tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes), which was on the brink of extinction in the mid 1800s, but now has numerous stable populations due to intensive reintroduction efforts. Here, we summarize results from a 5-year exclosure experiment that explored the effects of tule elk on a coastal grassland in northern California. Elk significantly altered the species composition of this community; the response of annual species (dominated heavily by exotic taxa) was dramatically different from perennial species. Elk herbivory increased the abundance and aboveground biomass of native and exotic annuals, whereas it either had no effect on or caused significant decreases in perennials. Elk also decreased the cover of native shrubs, suggesting that these herbivores play an important role in maintaining open grasslands. In addition, elk significantly reduced the abundance and biomass of a highly invasive exotic grass, Holcus lanatus, which is a major problem in mesic perennial grasslands. Our results demonstrate that the successful reintroduction of a charismatic and long-extirpated mammal had extremely complex effects on the plant community, giving rise to both desirable and undesirable outcomes from a management perspective. We suspect that these kinds of opposing effects are not unique to tule elk and that land managers will frequently encounter them when dealing with reintroduced mammals.";"JOHNSON, BRENT E.

Researching sites on privately owned lands creates unique challenges when compared to conducting research on government or publicly owned land. This study explores different methods for obtaining landowner information, permission to sample privately owned sites, and assesses the time it takes to obtain permission for randomly selected study sites. During the study, researchers contacted 390 landowners to obtain permission to sample wetlands on privately owned lands. A variety of methods were used to contact landowners and determine which methods were most effective for obtaining permission. Methods included face-to-face discussion, phone calls, and mailed response letters. It took approximately 9� months to obtain landowner information, contact landowners, and obtain permission to sample sites. The most effective method for obtaining permission to sample sites was through face-to-face discussions with landowners. Overall, it took a longer period of time to obtain permission for the survey than it did to sample sites. Information from this study can be used by anyone conducting research on private land to better estimate the time it will take to obtain permission to sample sites and to estimate the most effective way to obtain permission based on project finances and available personnel.";"Hargiss, Christina L.

The benefits of, and constraints to, Indigenous employment in the sector were examined using a case study approach focused on Indigenous participation in ‘Operation Farm Clear’, an emergency response following Cyclone Larry in northern Queensland in 2006. The findings suggested that, given a supportive environment, there are opportunities for Indigenous people to benefit from employment in the forestry sector. These benefits included skill development and increased confidence, the opportunity for employment and participation in land management. The findings also highlighted constraints that could limit the delivery of these benefits. Constraints included an insufficient level of relevant skill or experience, lack of a supportive environment, the difficulty of balancing Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures, and limitations related to the nature of the forestry sector. In the case study, the most important factors for the realisation of benefits were the provision of long-term support and opportunities for ongoing training and employment, and the peer support provided by other Indigenous employees.";"Loxton, E.

"AGRIS:US201301882739";"Evaluating the impacts of retention and disposal options for Minnesota's county-administered forest land";"";"We evaluated how the management and use of public forest land administered by Minnesota county land departments changed once these forests were transferred to private ownership. To characterize these changes, the individuals and organizations who purchased forest land from Minnesota's county land departments were surveyed using a mail questionnaire. The sale of county forest land did not appear to produce noticeable changes in timber harvesting or the level of investment in forest management. However, the level of professional forestry expertise overseeing the management of these lands declined considerably. Additionally, while nearly all forest land managed by county land departments is open to the public for recreation, more than half became posted to prohibit public trespass after it was sold. From 2002-2005, county land departments generated approximately US$12.3 million in real annual net income, or US$4.53 per acre. When comparing the capitalized value of annual net revenue generated from the land to its market value, retaining county forest land in public ownership cannot be rationalized solely on its ability to generate income. Yet public ownership of these lands can be justified when the full suite of benefits derived from the forest land's public recreational, environmental, and amenity values is considered.";"Brown, Ross N.

We tracked changes of perennial vegetation using remote sensing to address the question of how prolonged drought and landâuse intensification have affected perennial vegetation cover across a desert region in the early 21st century? LOCATION: Mojave Desert, southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, USA. METHODS: We coupled the ModerateâResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index (MODISâEVI) with groundâbased measurements of perennial vegetation cover taken in about 2000 and about 2010. Using the difference between these years, we determined perennial vegetation changes in the early 21st century and related these shifts to climate, soil and landscape properties, and patterns of land use. RESULTS: We found a good fit between MODISâEVI and perennial vegetation cover (2000: RÂ²Â =Â 0.83 and 2010: RÂ²Â =Â 0.74). The southwestern, far southeastern and central Mojave Desert had large declines in perennial vegetation cover in the early 21st century, while the northeastern and southeastern portions of the desert had increases. These changes were explained by 10âyr precipitation anomalies, particularly in the cool season and during extreme dry or wet years. Areas heavily impacted by visitor use or wildfire lost perennial vegetation cover, and vegetation in protected areas increased to a greater degree than in unprotected areas. CONCLUSIONS: We find that we can extrapolate previously documented declines of perennial plant cover to an entire desert, and demonstrate that prolonged water shortages coupled with landâuse intensification create identifiable patterns of vegetation change in dryland regions.";"Munson, Seth M.

"AGRIS:US201400091150";"tragedy of the commons: unsustainable population structure of Iberian red deer in hunting estates";"";"Hunting can influence population structure with consequences in ecological and evolutionary processes. Populations of Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) in Spain occur under two different management regimes: fenced and unfenced (open) estates. We compared census data, hunting bags and data from hunted individuals between both types of estates. Harvest on stags was moderate in fenced estates but strong in open ones, probably due to the competition between neighbouring landowners over the same deer populations. On the contrary, female culling was low in open estates compared to fenced ones. As a result, populations in open estates have mostly young males and strongly female-biased sex ratios. Female-biased population structure in open estates did not result in higher number of males being harvested per year compared with fenced estates, probably due to negative effects on development, survival and reproduction, and harvested males were younger, and hence, with smaller antlers. There is published evidence for undesirable effects of biased population sex ratio and age structure in these red deer populations. Our results indicate that this type of management may be unsustainable and recommend that harvest on males in open estates should be reduced and that on females increased, in order to maintain a more balanced population structure that may allow sustainable population dynamics and the operation of natural evolutionary processes.";"Torres-Porras, Jerónimo

"AGRIS:US201500199229";"Effects of land use, land cover and rainfall regimes on the surface runoff and soil loss on karst slopes in southwest China";"";"Surface runoff and soil loss from 2007 to 2010 related to land use and rainfall regimes in karst hill slopes in Guizhou Province, southwest China, were analyzed. Using the hierarchical clustering method, sixty-one rainfall events under the subtropical monsoon climate condition were classified into 5 types of rainfall regimes according to the depth, maximum 30-min intensity, and duration of rainfall. In our study, we first demonstrated that the amounts of surface runoff and soil loss on the karst hill slopes were very small compared to the non-karst areas, because the dual hydrological structure in the karst region, including ground and underground drainage systems, could influence the processes of rainfall recharge and runoff generation. Most rainfall water was transported underground through limestone fissures and fractures, while little was in the form of surface runoff. Second, the runoff and soil loss were affected by land use management and vegetation cover. Soil loss was intensified in a descending order to five types of land uses: pastureland>burned area>cropland>combination vegetation land>young forestland. Third, the runoff and soil loss exhibited remarkable variances among different rainfall regimes. Large runoff and soil loss were mainly created by heavy rainfall storms with a rainfall depth of more than 40mm and a maximum 30-min rainfall intensity of over 30mmh⁻¹. In addition, rainfall storms with large antecedent precipitations could also produce large runoff and soil loss. These observations indicated that limestone fissures and fractures play important roles in surface runoff generation on karst limestone slopes due to their large storage capacity and high infiltration rate. Lastly, the soil erosion risk in the karst pure limestone slope is quite high and should be paid particular attention, especially in regards to over-grazing because the soil loss created by a single heavy rainstorm in pastureland was 5 times the annual soil loss tolerance.";"Peng, Tao

Due to the complexity of factors contributing to the urban thermal environment, traditional statistical methods are insufficient for acquiring data and analyzing the impacts of human activities on the thermal environment, especially for identifying dominant factors. Based on thermal remote sensing imageries and Geographic Information System analysis, we assessed spatial pattern of urban thermal environment in Shanghai in 2008, and analyzed the factors contributing to the generation of urban heat island (UHI) using principal component analysis (PCA). We found that Shanghai had obvious UHI with uneven spatial pattern in 2008. Further, we identified three most important components leading to the variances of Shanghai’s UHI: the gradient from man-made to natural land cover, landscape configuration, and anthropogenic heat release. A linear model has thus been successfully constructed, implying that PCA is helpful in identifying major contributors to UHI. The findings are of significance for policy implication to urban thermal environment mitigation.";"Yue, Wenze

Aerial photographs taken in 1960 formed the benchmark for the analysis of respective land use changes between 1995 and 2006, using 30m Landsat TM and 20m SPOT MS images. Landslide sites were mapped using a MobileMapper, and terrain parameters were derived using a 15m Digital Elevation Model. A supervised classification approach was employed to generate land-cover maps, from which the areas of three land-cover classes (agricultural fields, woodlands and forests) were calculated. A post-classification comparison change-detection technique revealed different trends in land-cover change between the periods 1960–1995 and 1995–2006. Whereas there were minimal land use changes between 1960 and 1995, the period 1995–2006 marked a considerable loss of woodlands and forest cover, particularly on steep concave slopes (36°–58°) of the National Park. The encroachment onto the critical slopes was noted to have induced a series of shallow and deep landslides in the area. All the mapped landslides were noted to lie on steep concave slopes of a northerly orientation, which had been opened up for cultivation. Deforestation and cultivation alter the soil hydrological conditions on steep concave slopes, rendering them susceptible to saturation. This may trigger debris flows during rainfall events. There is a need to restore forest cover on the fragile steep slopes and restrain local communities from opening up new areas for cultivation on critical slopes, particularly within the protected area.";"Mugagga, F.

We used two techniques: discriminant analysis represented by Random Forests and ordination represented by principal components analysis to discriminate among habitat type classification units, and assessed their relationships with the physical environment. RESULTS: Neither habitat types nor series correspond well to environmental (climatic, physiographic, edaphic) differences. Plant indicator species (sensu Daubenmire) representing the habitat types generally failed in differentiating between important factors of the physical environment. CONCLUSIONS: The failure of the habitat type classifications in discriminating between key environmental factors calls into question the basic premise that habitat types, as used in much of the western United States, are representative of basic ecological units of land.

Such knowledge is important in light of current interest in reorienting agricultural policy toward environmental and resource conservation goals.  This paper uses farmer survey data combined with information on standard unit costs of installing seven soil-conserving, runoff-reducing practices obtained from a state cost sharing program to estimate latent demand models for each of these seven practices.  All seven exhibit downward sloping demand.  Topographical variations in adoption conform to expectations as well.

The hypothesis has been highly debated, in part, because nomenclature has been careless.  Also, the role of property rights in defining innovation offsets has been neglected.  If the Porter Hypothesis has validity in agriculture, its policy implications are important.

To determine the potential relevance of this conjecture for the crop traits market, we analyze the theoretical time path of trait prices under three systems of intellectual property rights (utility patents, plant breeders' rights, and none), alternative assumptions about sellers' ability to commit to future action, and alternative assumptions that buyers are either myopic or far-sighted with respect to expectations about the future price of the durable. Under only one of these stylized circumstances does the Coase conjecture have traction, but it is a plausible circumstance in much of the world--owners with plant breeders' rights, buyers with foresight, sellers unable to commit to future price paths. In this circumstance, this theory suggests that sellers holding only plant breeders rights would realize only 11% of potential social welfare benefits from the trait, while farmers and/or downstream consumers would realize about 85%. On the other hand, with myopic buyers under any system of intellectual property rights, temporal price discrimination is feasible, resulting in above-normal monopolist welfare (about 70% of maximum social welfare benefits) and little damage to consumers relative to normal monopoly pricing.";"Perrin, Richard K.

Another approach is to use foliar-water indices based on the absorption at shortwave-infrared wavelengths by liquid water in the leaves to determine canopy water content, which is then related to VWC. An example of these indices is the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), which was found to be linearly related to canopy water content using various datasets, including data from the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 and 2005 in central Iowa. Here we compared independent estimates of VWC from WindSat to Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDII over central Iowa from 2003 to 2005. Results showed that there was a linear relationship between theMODIS and WindSat estimates of VWC, although WindSat-retrieved VWC was greater than MODIS-retrieved VWC. WindSat and MODIS have different satellite overpass times and in most climates we expect VWC to vary over a day due to transpiration and plant water stress. However, a sensitivity analysis indicated that the diurnal variation of VWC should not have a significant effect on retrievals of VWC by either method. The results of this study indicated that soil moisture retrievals from microwave sensors may be improved using VWC from optical sensors determined by foliar-water indices and classifications of land cover type.";"Hunt, E.

Itfocuses on emerging endogenous mechanisms of cooperation as well as on the roleof external actors and instruments in forming or enhancing collective actioninstitutions, and enforcing use and ownership rights among the rural poor. Withinthis framework key contextual factor, such as asset endowments, legal structures,and power relations, have an impact on poverty and rural livelihoods, but are alsomediated and changed by property right regimes and local cooperation. Findingsindicate that access to and use of natural capital still contributes significantly torural incomes. Access to natural resources is, however, defined by multiple andoverlapping rights, both private and common ones, which are, in turn, governed byformal and informal patterns of cooperation. Collective action also contributes toimprove livelihoods. Nevertheless, depending on asset endowments, differencesexist in the degree of participation. Owing to Cambodia’s recent history of genocide,forced collectivization and resettlement, property rights regimes have been severelyaffected, remain contested, and are re–established only slowly. In this context, themutual trust necessary for successful cooperation in common property issues isseverely undermined.";"Weingart, Anne

The case of irrigated croplands in Uzbekistan";"";"This study analyzed the financial attractiveness of Clean Development Mechanism Afforestation and Reforestation (CDM A/R) in irrigated agricultural settings. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated by analyzing the case of Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the major crops in the region, i.e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize. The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation water availability, from 0 to 30,000m³/ha, to reflect the reality of a high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R ranged between 724 and 5794USD/ha over seven years, depending on the tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L. had the highest profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit production. Temporary Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) ranged within 399–702USD/ha after the assumed 7-year crediting period and would not suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree plantations. IRR peaked at 65% with E. angustifolia under the conventional afforestation and measured −10% and 61% when considering only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option but required water input of 26,500m³/ha/year, which is not consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current global average price of 4.76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation needs of trees, 3–30% of the crop water demand, a conversion of degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15,300m³/ha/year at the current tCER price. Combining the monetary value of water and carbon would enlarge the scope for CDM A/R in irrigated drylands, thus enhancing the investments in marginal land rehabilitation and strengthening the resilience of rural populations to the repercussions of climate change.";"Djanibekov, Utkur

Under the 1993 Land Law these rights can be transferred, exchanged,leased, inherited, and mortgaged. This Land Law provided the foundation for thedevelopment of a market for land use rights. During 2001, 400 farm households weresurveyed in four provinces in Vietnam. Along with production and consumption data,evidence was sought of land accumulation and consolidation, land use changes, andattitudes to land reform issues. Analysis of the data shows that there is an active marketfor land use rights, but the level of activity varies considerably between provinces. Someindividual households have acquired a large percentage of their land through buying orrenting activities, as distinct from land that has been allocated or inherited. A moreactive market appears to be associated with opportunities for land use changes which leadto more profitable production activities. Lack of available land and in some cases labour,inadequate credit access, and reluctance to sell land use rights are identified as constraintsto the land use right market, rather than transaction costs and the limit on land holdings.";"Marsh, Sally P.

In recent years, European Union policies gave impetus to a large area of new cork oak plantations, which have been established mainly for cork production purposes, and consequently with higher stand density than traditional agroforestry systems. These plantations are important not only for cork production but also for the carbon sequestered by these slow growing forests that won't be harvested for wood production. Thinning operations will be needed to avoid excessive inter-tree competition and wood extracted from these thinning may also provide income for the owners. In the present study, carbon sequestered and wood volumes resulting from thinning were estimated for the next 70years. Three scenarios of different annual afforestation rates and different site indexes were tested. The resulting values for the considered scenarios show that, if the plantation rates are maintained, new cork oak plantations will have an important contribution to the Portuguese commitments to providing CO₂ offsets under the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, due to the increasing values of initial density in new cork plantations, cork oak forests will produce a significant volume of wood that may become an important contribution to the landowners' income.";"Coelho, Marta Baptista

In this article, we study the implications of pursuing the goal of equity in the management of surface water resources for irrigation with a heuristic model incorporating a Leontief-type fixed production function. The analysis has been carried out in the backdrop of the Baliraja water distribution experiment in India. One suggestion is that the allocating tradable water rights over water, a common property natural resource, can be used as an instrument to improve equity. Unfortunately, advocating the use of water distribution as an instrument of poverty alleviation is fraught with implicit assumptions about the rural economy and uncertain outcomes. It is important for planners to understand that the concepts of equity and equality are applicable to inputs and outputs or outcomes. We attempt to understand the implications of equality in water distribution on social welfare with a simple heuristic analysis. Theoretical analysis shows the possible outcomes of such a policy and also intended to raise pertinent questions and hypotheses in studying the effectiveness of irrigation and watershed initiatives where rights over water have been redistributed equally.";"Sivramkrishna, Sashi

In 1980, the population was only 4.7 M and then it has been more than doubled in only two decades. The population has been increasing as a result of mass immigration. An urbanization process continues and it causes serious increases in urban areas while decreasing the amount of green areas. This rapid, uncontrolled, and illegal urbanization accompanied by insufficient infrastructure has caused degradation of forest and barren lands in the metropolitan area, especially through the last two decades. The watershed basins inside the metropolitan area and the transportation network have accelerated the land-cover changes, which have negative impacts on water quality of the basins. Monitoring urban growth and land cover change will enable better management of this complex urban area by the Greater Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (GIMM). A temporal assessment of land-cover changes of Istanbul has been documented in this study. The study mainly focuses on the acquisition and analysis of Landsat TM and Landsat GeoCover LC satellite images reflecting the significant land-cover changes between the years of 1990 and 2005. Raster data were converted to vector data and used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A database was created for Istanbul metropolitan area to plan, manage, and utilize statistical attribute data covering population, water, forest, industry, and topographic position. Consequently an overlay analysis was carried out and land use/cover changes through years have been detected for the case study area.

With the advent of the New Water Law, highly localized and centuries-old agricultural water management traditions are giving way to more modern centralized institutions. The newly-created river basin councils need management tools to support decision-making at the watershed level. This study develops the Afghan Canal Irrigation Management and Policy Tool (ACIMAP), a versatile linear programming-based model that can be used to optimize crop selection and water allocation within Afghan irrigation districts. The model can further be used in the assessment of the benefits from various irrigation infrastructure improvements. This study describes the development of ACIMAP and applies it to an illustrative case study on the Balkhab River in Balkh Province, Afghanistan. The benefits to the district’s farmers of constructing a reservoir of various capacities are analyzed and compared with the benefits derived from increasing conveyance efficiencies in the canal networks and the assignment of water rights. It is found that while the construction of a reservoir could increase agricultural net revenues by up to 30%, even greater benefits may result from increasing distribution efficiencies. Further, property rights schemes may be implemented to distribute wealth more evenly through various canal sub-regions at minimal cost to the agricultural community as a whole. These results demonstrate the usefulness of ACIMAP in assessing alternative irrigation policies.";"Reeling, Carson J.

This loss increased in areas with steeper slope, which confirms that the areas that would be first abandoned are those that are less productive and more difficult to manage. The reafforestation rate was particularly strong in the north of the province, where the livestock sector experienced a dramatic decline. In light of this situation and using multiple regression models with a large set of socioeconomic and agricultural indicators, we found that the loss of agricultural areas in 69 municipalities was primarily counterbalanced by the maintenance of livestock farming. The loss of steeper agricultural areas was counteracted by traditional extensive systems; however, it was not counteracted by modern intensive systems, which has important implications because steeper areas have higher landscape and biodiversity values. In addition, tourism development had a positive, although smaller, effect on the maintenance of agricultural areas, while industry development had a negative effect. The results of this study suggest that efforts are needed to maintain a territorial network of traditional extensive farms to avoid further landscape deterioration in Alpine areas. Likewise, certain choices toward the economic development of local communities might have an impact on land conservation.";"Cocca, Giampaolo

This paper examines the sustainability of a PES silvopastoral programme in Colombia from peasant farmersâ perspectives. Programme participants were asked questions regarding their perceived ability to continue with the silvopastoral practices, the influence of the economic benefits and contracts on behavioural change, and the programme's impacts on self-determination, innovation and social learning; factors considered critical for sustained resource management. While the participants expressed a need for the PES programme practices, less than half stated that they would continue with the silvopastoral measures and only 13% understood that part of their contractual commitment was to conserve forests. Ten per cent of the participants considered themselves the principal decision-maker in the farm-level changes and only one participant had altered the prescribed practices, despite a common perception that some techniques were not suitable for the region. The results suggest a need to re-examine the degree to which the PES model in fact encourages adaptive management practices and sustained land-use behaviours in peasant communities.";"HAYES, TANYA M.";"";"Cambridge University Press";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"forest conservation;land use;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"013;COL;005";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600185896";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892912000045";"";"";"";"144-153"

In recent years comprehensive legal reforms of communal rural resource management in Namibia have sought to create an institutional framework linking the sustainable use of natural resources (game, water, forest) and rural development. The state, however, ceded rights to rural communities in an ambiguous and fragmented manner, creating a number of instances of overlapping property rights and different legal conditions for different natural resources. Nowadays communities grapple with the challenge of developing institutions for these resource-centered “new commons”.

LOCATION: Chamonix Valley, French Alps. METHODS: We fit linear mixed effects (LME) models to historical changes in forest and glacier cover and projected these trends forward to align with 21st century IPCC climate scenarios. We used a logistic function to model the probability of plant establishment in glacial forelands zones expected to become ice free between 2008 and 2051–2080. Habitat filtering consisted of intersecting land cover maps with climate‐driven SDMs to refine habitat suitability predictions. SDM outputs for tree, heath and alpine species were compared based on whether habitat filtering during the prediction period was carried out using present‐day (static) land cover, future (dynamic) land cover filters or no land cover filter (unfiltered). Species range change (SRC) was used to measure differences in habitat suitability predictions across methods. RESULTS: LME predictions for 2021–2080 showed continued glacier retreat, tree line rise and primary succession in glacier forelands. SRC was highest in the unfiltered scenario (−10%), intermediate in the dynamic scenario (−15%) and lowest in the static scenario (−31%). Tree species were the only group predicted to gain overall range by 2051–2080. Although alpine plants lost range in all three land cover scenarios, new habitat made available by glacier retreat in the dynamic land cover scenario buffered alpine plant range loss due to climate change. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We provide a framework for combining trajectories of land cover change with SDM predictions. Our pilot study shows that incorporating shifts in land cover improves habitat suitability predictions and leads to contrasting outcomes of future mountain plant distribution. Alpine plants in particular may lose less suitable habitat than standard SDMs predict due to 21st century glacier retreat.";"Carlson, Bradley Z.

We hypothesised that crop yield following a modest application of 2 t haâ»Â¹ of crop residue in a reduced tillage system is similar to the yield obtained from a conventional tillage system, and that incorporation of legumes in a cropping system leads to greater economic benefits as opposed to a cropping system involving continuous maize. Three cropping systems (continuous maize monocropping, legume/maize intercropping and rotation) under different tillage and residue management systems were tested in sub-humid western Kenya over 10 seasons. While soybean performed equally well in both tillage systems throughout, maize yield was lower in reduced than conventional tillage during the first five seasons but no significant differences were observed after season 6. Likewise, with crop residue application, yields in conventional and reduced tillage systems are comparable after season 6. Nitrogen and phosphorus increased yield by up to 100% compared with control. Gross margins were not significantly different among the cropping systems being only 6 to 39% more in the legumeâcereal systems relative to similar treatments in continuous cereal monocropping system. After 10 seasons of reduced tillage production, the economic benefits for our cropping systems are still not attractive for a switch from the conventional to reduced tillage.";"KIHARA, J.

High-resolution soil-sedimentary data define an abruptly increased climatic aridity at 3100 a B.P. on the southern Loess Plateau. It was caused by a shift from the dominance of the maritime monsoon to the continental monsoon in the East Asia. The marked aridity induced a considerable deterioration of environment and degradation of land resources. Consequently, both the livestock failure of the nomadic tribes in the north and the crop failure of the Han Chinese in the south resulted in large-scale nomadic southward migration, and dislocations of the political capital and capital cities of the predynastic Zhou culture. Land use of arable farming was replaced largely by pastoral farming on the plateau. The combination of severe drought and resultant great famine was the fundamental cause of social instability and eventual collapse of the Shang Dynasty at 3000 a B.P.

This land cover change affects surface energy and water transfer processes. We employed the Bowen ratio energy balance technique to examine micrometeorological changes following the establishment of artificially established artemisia vegetation on the severely desertified sandy land in Naiman, a county located in the Horqin. Re-vegetation on the desertified sandy land decreased the surface albedo and increased the surface roughness length, thereby resulting in considerable changes in both surface water and heat budget, and wind regimes. As compared with that (34%) before re-vegetation, albedo decreased by 15% as the sandy land was semi-fixed and decreased by 47% as the sandy land is entirely fixed. With change in albedo, partitioning of the available energy exhibited distinct patterns depending on vegetation cover, especially large increase in evapotranspiration, which may result in soil desiccation and thus further affecting temperature regime. Establishment of artificially established vegetation also affected wind regimes by altering surface roughness; consequently, erosion was avoided in the vegetated surfaces. These changes, if occurring in large spatial scale, may affect the local and regional climate according to the Charney theory.";"Li, Sheng-Gong

A broad range of technologies combating degradation currently exist. This paper presents and discusses both traditional techniques as well as modern techniques which are derived from the traditional ones. Various methods of mulching and application of manure or mineral fertilizers are used to maintain or increase soil fertility. The use of mulch as well as various methods of integrating shrubs, trees and herbaceous vegetation into the cultivation systems are the technologies currently used to decrease the effects of wind erosion. Similarly, water erosion can be prevented with lines of stones, mulch and grasses. The most promising methods which impede decreasing natural vegetation are promotion of natural regeneration and to some extent the implementation of agricultural parks. In contrast, community-based management of grazing land or forested areas are difficult to establish. Most conservation strategies are limited by the availability of mulch, fertilizer or manure to fertilize fields or to protect sufficient land areas from wind and water erosion. Household constraints of individual farmers also play a crucial role in increasing such protection. Great efforts are needed to distribute the knowledge of the various conservation strategies throughout the different regions of semi-arid West Africa, and to develop new technologies, preferably with farmers' participation, to enable adoption. As degradation continues and populations increase, this must be accomplished in the near future in order to hinder devastation of land resources.";"Wezel, Alexander

"AGRIS:US201400155253";"Land management trumps the effects of climate change and elevated CO₂ on grassland functioning";"";"Grasslands cover ˜30% of the Earth's terrestrial surface and provide many ecosystem services. Many grasslands are heavily managed to maximize these services for human benefit, but the outcome of management is anticipated to be increasingly influenced by various aspects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO₂. The relative importance of global change vs. land management on grasslands is largely unknown. A meta‐analysis is used here to examine drivers at both scales primarily targeting services provided by grasslands relating to plant productivity (above‐ and below‐ground biomass) and soil processes (nutrients and soil respiration) in 38 manipulative experiments published in the last decade. We specifically target effects of (i) single and combined land management practices (LMs), (ii) single and combined factors relating to broad‐scale climate change and elevated CO₂, and (iii) combined management practices and changes to climate and CO₂. Collectively, this examines the general efficacy of global change models in predicting changes to grassland functioning. We found that combinations of management practices had approximately double the explanatory power for variation in grassland services compared with individual or interactive effects of factors associated with climate change and CO₂. These interacting management practices such as nutrient additions and defoliation predominantly influenced functions associated with productivity or biomass both below and above ground. The effects of interacting factors of climate and CO₂ influenced a wider range of ecosystem functions, but the magnitude of these effects was relatively smaller. Interactions between management practices or between climate change/CO₂ factors always had higher explanatory power than any factor in isolation indicating that multivariate synergistic models of environmental change can better describe impacts on ecosystem function in plant communities (e.g. relative to univariate climate‐based models). Given that the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the interactions varied widely, this also implies that the outcomes of these multivariate interactions can vary spatially, temporally or by immediate context (e.g. management prescriptions). Synthesis. Although our work confirms how climate change and CO₂ can affect many ecosystem‐based functional attributes, it suggests that combinations of LMs remain the dominant set of factors in determining the performance of grassland plant communities. Land management may thus be critical for influencing projected responses to future climate change and elevated CO₂ in models of grassland function at least for factors relating to primary production.";"Thébault, Aurélie

Indicators can be valuable that focus on the specific relevance of cities’ socioeconomic and spatial properties. While previous analyses have identified socioeconomic influences on urban greenhouse gas emissions, information about the role of spatial urban structures and land use and land cover patterns is sparse. OBJECTIVE: This study advances the use of spatial metrics for analyzing the linkages between the spatial properties of a city and its greenhouse gas emissions. METHODS: The relationship between nine types of spatial structure, four land use and land cover-based indicators, and the emissions of 52 European cities is investigated by spatially and statistically analyzing high resolution data from European Union’s “Urban Atlas”. RESULTS: Spatial determinants of urban greenhouse gas emissions are identified, indicating a strong connection between urban sprawl and increasing emissions. In particular, high amounts of sparsity in the urban fabric within large distances to the city center relate to increased per capita emissions. Thus, a 10 % reduction of very low density urban fabrics is correlated with 9 % fewer emissions per capita. In contrast, high amounts of fragmented, dense urban patches relate with lower emissions. CONCLUSIONS: This study links urban spatial properties and land use and land cover compositions to greenhouse gas emissions and advances the understanding of urban sprawl. Future research needs to combine knowledge about socioeconomic drivers with information about the identified spatial influences of urban greenhouse gas emissions to help cities realize their climate change mitigation potential.";"Baur, Albert H.

Thematic maps were made using the Bhattacharya (supervized) classification procedure, followed by visual interpretation. The area of each category was determined in each thematic map, using the 30 m spatial resolution as a reference. Mapping accuracy was evaluated using the Global accuracy, and the Kappa and Tau coefficients. It was found out that: a) the greatest area differences were observed in those maps derived from the 200 m spatial resolution images; b) those categories that dominated the scene spectrally and spatially, increased their influence as the spatial resolution decreased; c) the thematic maps from images with coarser spatial resolution than 200 m presented a slight confusion in map category identification, and d) the spectral confusion between the mapping categories did not present a linear tendency.

Imagens do sensor TM/Landsat-5 referentes às bandas de TM1 a TM5 e TM7 do município de Altamira-PA, Brasil, da passagem de 20/7/1991, modificadas para 60, 100, 120, 200 e 250 m, foram utilizadas para avaliar a influência da resolução espacial na identificação de floresta, capoeira nova, capoeira madura e não-floresta. Mapas temáticos (um para cada resolução espacial) foram elaborados, considerando a aplicação de um algoritmo de classificação digital Bhattacharya (supervisionado), seguido da interpretação visual. A área de cada uma dessas categorias foi determinada em cada um dos mapas temáticos, tomando as imagens com 30 m de resolução espacial como referência. A exatidão de mapeamento foi avaliada, utilizando a exatidão global, o índice kappa e o índice Tau. Verificou-se que: a) as maiores discrepâncias em termos quantitativos ocorreram nos mapas gerados a partir das imagens com 200 m de resolução espacial; b) as categorias que dominavam a cena em termos espectrais e espaciais aumentaram à medida que a resolução espacial foi degradada; c) os mapas elaborados a partir de imagens com resolução espacial de 200 m apresentaram ligeira confusão na identificação dos temas; e d) a confusão espectral entre os temas não apresentou tendência linear com a gradativa degradação da resolução espectral.";"Ponzoni, Flávio Jorge(Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais Divisão de Sensoriamento Remoto)

We analyze participating factors of small household workers in NFEs and their effects on household production (farming and non-farm activities) and consumption (both food and non-food). For estimatingconsumption effects (poverty), we focus on food adequacy, income poverty and educationpoverty (as a part of human poverty). At each level of estimation, we depend on appropriate econometric regressions. Results find the significant positive role of overall NFEs on household NFAs rather faming. Remittance incomes do not contribute in household production either farming or non-farm activities and food adequacy; and thus, these must be spent on non-food consumption. Education-poverty levels are worse than income poverty levels among small households. The increasing NFI is reducing some income poverty, but it is yet to realize in achieving household education; however, access to formal sectoremployments by the small household workers is significantly reducing education poverty.Therefore, qualitative diversification of the poor household workers and productive use of household remittance incomes deserve special attention.";"Malek, Mohammad Abdul

"AGRIS:US201400106519";"Evaluation of changes in ecological security in China’s Qinghai Lake Basin from 2000 to 2013 and the relationship to land use and climate change";"";"Ecological security evaluation is an important way to identify the need for improvement in a watershed and to assess the degree of regional sustainable development. Using a driver–pressure–state–exposure–response model, a comprehensive system of ecological security indicators was developed, and it was demonstrated in a case study of the main ecological problems facing the Qinghai Lake Basin. Indicators of the status of the natural ecological environment, socioeconomic pressure, and the degree of environmental damage were chosen to develop the model, and comprehensively evaluated the basin’s ecological security in 2000, 2004, 2009, and 2013 to reveal changes in the ecological security in response to changing climate and land use. The overall ecological security of the basin improved from 2000 to 2013, with considerable restoration and reconstruction of the ecosystem. From 2000 to 2004, environmental deterioration increased slightly as a result of pollution caused by human activities, excess land reclamation for agriculture, land desertification, and grassland degeneration. However, the obvious effect of ecological protection policies, such as conversion of farmland into grassland and stall feeding of livestock instead of grazing, led to improvement of the ecological environment from 2004 to 2013. Ecological security in the basin increased with increasing precipitation during the study period.";"Wang, Hong

"AGRIS:US2016215484";"An Iterative Auction for Spatially Contiguous Land Management: An Experimental Analysis";"";"Tackling the problem of ecosystem services degradation is an important policy challenge.  Different types of economic instruments have been employed by conservation agencies to meet this challenge. Notable among them are Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes that pay private landowners to change land uses to pro-environmental ones on their properties. This paper focuses on a PES scheme – an auction for the cost-efficient disbursal of government funds for selection of spatially contiguous land management projects. The auction is structured as an iterative descending price auction where every bid is evaluated on the basis of a scoring metric – a benefit cost ratio. The ecological effectiveness and economic efficiency of the auction is tested with data generated from lab experiments. These experiments use the information available to the subjects about the spatial goal as the treatment variable. Analysis indicates that the information reduces the cost-efficiency of the auction. Experience with bidding also has a negative impact on auction efficiency. The study also provides an analysis of the behavior of winners and losers at the final auction outcome. Winners and losers are found to have significantly different behavior with winners bidding much higher than their costs than losers.";"Banerjee, Simanti

Results suggest that income and the proximity to majorhighways are the principal determinants of rapid conversion events (and also responsible for prolonging these events). In particular, an increase in income of 1% is found to hasten the time to a rapid conversion event by 111% and to extend the time back to a slow state of conversion by 76%. On the other hand, valuable agricultural land and high property taxes extend the time to a rapid conversion event (and also hasten the time back to a slow state of conversion). An increase in the value of agricultural production per acre extends the time to a rapid conversion event by 14% and hastens the time to a slow state of conversion by 106%. Knowledge about the timing of rapid farmland conversion will help counties to better predict infrastructure needs and take steps to mitigate the traffic and environmental impacts.";"Kovacs, Kent F.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016215481";"http://purl.umn.edu/49252";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201500217267";"Application of spatial resource data to assist in farmland valuation";"";"A land transaction is generally not a recurring action for most buyers and sellers, their experience and knowledge are limited, for this reason the services of property agents and valuers are sometimes used, just to get more information available. The condition of insufficient information and the inability to observe differences in land productivity gives rise to the undervaluation of good land and overvaluation of poor land. The advent of the Internet made access to comprehensive information sources easier for property agents and valuers whose critical time and resources can now be effectively managed through Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated workflow processes. This study aims to develop the blueprint for a farm valuation support system (FVSS) that assists valuers in their application of the comparable sales method by enabling them to do the following: (1) Rapid identification of the location of the subject property and transaction properties on an electronic map. (2) Comparison of the subject property with the transaction properties in terms of value contributing attributes that can be expressed in a spatial format, mainly (a) location and (b) land resource quality factors not considered in existing valuation systems that primarily focus on residential property. An algorithm, that generates an index value, was developed to allow easy comparison of the land of a subject property and that of transaction properties. This index value distinguishes the proposed FVSS from other existing property valuation systems and can therefore be used by valuers as a first approximation of a property's soil suitability, before doing further field work. The FVSS was successfully developed and tested, primarily using data obtained in the Western Cape, South Africa.";"Naudé, S.D.

'Kafkasör Festival' is arranged in July every year. However, the area is intensively used during the festivals, and irregular usage and lack of equipment damage the area. Because of the intensity of festival activities, the area can not respond the needs and the determined visitor necessities don't be used in planning. Hence, redefining the visitor demand should be determined. The research area was investigated in terms of community demands to protect the area and prevent from some damages because of the wrong usage. Questionnaire results in Cengiz (1996) and 2006 was compared. It is aimed to define the usage demands researching the effect of time change on recreational tendencies during the last ten years. This study has pointed out that previous scientific results haven't applied by local administration. For the comparison of changing of recreational demands for years 1996 and 2006, 'z proportion test' on Minitab 13.0 statistics software has been used. Findings in the research show that there has been no change on visitor profile, needs and preferences of the recreational and tourism activities during the last ten years. Needs of the local community have not been implemented. Furthermore, it has been seen that local administrations have not utilized the scientific results and solved the problems.

"AGRIS:US201300927441";"Proxy global assessment of land degradation";"";"Land degradation is always with us but its causes, extent and severity are contested. We define land degradation as a long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, which may be assessed using long-term, remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Deviation from the norm may serve as a proxy assessment of land degradation and improvement - if other factors that may be responsible are taken into account. These other factors include rainfall effects which may be assessed by rain-use efficiency, calculated from NDVI and rainfall. Results from the analysis of the 23-year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI data indicate declining rain-use efficiency-adjusted NDVI on ca. 24% of the global land area with degrading areas mainly in Africa south of the equator, South-East Asia and south China, north-central Australia, the Pampas and swaths of the Siberian and north American taiga; 1.5 billion people live in these areas. The results are very different from previous assessments which compounded what is happening now with historical land degradation. Economic appraisal can be undertaken when land degradation is expressed in terms of net primary productivity and the resultant data allow statistical comparison with other variables to reveal possible drivers.";"Bai, Z.G.

"AGRIS:US201301825094";"Functional response traits in relation to land use change in the Montado";"";"The socio-economic changes of the last decades have resulted in changes in traditional land uses with consequent abandonment of large farmland areas in the Mediterranean region. We assessed the response of species richness and composition, and species functional traits to decreasing land use intensity in a Montado system, an agro-pastoral system characteristic of the Alentejo, Southern Portugal. Additionally, we investigated whether plant functional types can be established based on the response to decreasing land use intensity in these systems. Consistent with previous studies, species richness decreased sharply after land abandonment, and this was associated with a strong turnover in species composition from grazed to abandoned sites as the vegetation changed from herbaceous to shrub dominated communities. Pronounced differences in functional traits were found for different successional stages. Therophyte life form, short plant height, high specific leaf area (SLA), low leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and small seeds with dispersal structures were dominant in grazed plots. Within abandoned plots, chamaephytes dominated in plots abandoned for 10-15 years and decreased in favour of nanophanerophytes in plots abandoned for 20-30 years. Plant height, LDMC and seed mass increased with abandonment time while SLA decreased. Functional response groups sufficient to describe vegetation change were identified combining life form and SLA. Therophytes with medium SLA were the dominant functional group in grazed areas, while nanophanerophytes with medium or low SLA were associated with later phases of abandonment. At intermediate stages of succession the dominant group was chamaephytes with medium SLA but functional diversity was highest as all the groups, except hemicryptophytes with medium SLA, were represented. These changes in functional composition can be translated into effects on key ecosystem properties. The increase in LDMC indicates an increase in flammability while trends in both LDMC and SLA suggest decreased decomposition, and thereby carbon and nutrient cycling. These will need to be considered in combination with consequences for other ecosystem properties for future management.";"Castro, Helena

"AGRIS:US201500224259";"Long-term bio-cultural heritage: exploring the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in agro-ecological landscapes (Mallorca, c. 1850–2012)";"";"We applied an intermediate disturbance-complexity approach to the land-use change of cultural landscapes in the island of Mallorca from c. 1850 to the present, which accounts for the joint behaviour of human appropriation of photosynthetic capacity used as a measure of disturbance, and a selection of land metrics at different spatial scales that account for ecological functionality as a proxy of biodiversity. We also delved deeper into local land-use changes in order to identify the main socioeconomic drivers and ruling agencies at stake. A second degree polynomial regression was obtained linking socio-metabolic disturbance and landscape ecological functioning (jointly assessing landscape patterns and processes). The results confirm our intermediate disturbance-complexity hypothesis by showing a hump-shaped relationship where the highest level of landscape complexity (heterogeneity connectivity) is attained when disturbance peaks at 50–60 %. The study proves the usefulness of transferring the concept of intermediate disturbance to Mediterranean cultural landscapes, and suggests that the conservation of heterogeneous and well connected land-use mosaics with a positive interplay between intermediate level of farming disturbances and land-cover complexity endowed with a rich bio-cultural heritage will preserve a wildlife-friendly agro-ecological matrix that is likely to house high biodiversity.";"Marull, Joan
