"AGRIS:US201400154527";"Data-Based Conservation Planning Tool for Florida Panthers";"";"Habitat loss and fragmentation are the greatest threats to the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). We developed a data-based habitat model and user-friendly interface so that land managers can objectively evaluate Florida panther habitat. We used a geographic information system (GIS) and the Mahalanobis distance statistic (D ²) to develop a model based on broad-scale landscape characteristics associated with panther home ranges. Variables in our model were Euclidean distance to natural land cover, road density, distance to major roads, human density, amount of natural land cover, amount of semi-natural land cover, amount of permanent or semi-permanent flooded area–open water, and a cost–distance variable. We then developed a Florida Panther Habitat Estimator tool, which automates and replicates the GIS processes used to apply the statistical habitat model. The estimator can be used by persons with moderate GIS skills to quantify effects of land-use changes on panther habitat at local and landscape scales. Example applications of the tool are presented.";"Murrow, Jennifer L.

"AGRIS:US201400035512";"Forecasting the environmental and socio-economic consequences of changes in the Common Agricultural Policy";"";"A framework is described that has been used to assess the effect of the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposal on the Dumfries and Galloway region, Scotland. The model assesses the impact of agriculture on land-use patterns, the environment and socio-economics of the region. It incorporates a farm-type linear programming sub-model with environmental and socio-economic sub-models. In the environmental model, the environmental factors and management practices for each of the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (MLURI) Land Cover classifications that were relevant to farm activity were defined. The changes in management practices and the Land Cover type of the 10 nearest parcels of land were used to determine the likelihood of a parcel of land changing its associated vegetation type. Using the March 1998 Agenda 2000 proposals, the linear programming model predicted that net farm incomes would fall and the environmental sub-model estimated that approximately 2.6% of the land area would change its vegetation type. The model predicted that diversity in the landscape would be reduced by the proposals. The changes in farm output would also result in falling incomes and employment across the region.";"Topp, C.F.E.

"AGRIS:US201500198684";"Impacts of land use changes and synoptic forcing on the seasonal climate over the Pearl River Delta of China";"";"In this study, the impact of the rapid rate of urbanization over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China since the 1980s on its seasonal climate is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. Two land-cover data are employed to simulate the urbanization effects on the regional climate in both summer (June and August) and winter (December and February) for 26 years from 1984 to 2009. Spatial and temporal features of the urbanization effect on temperature and precipitation are found to be different between summer and winter. Urban warming and modifications of surface variables such as surface latent heat flux and 2-m relatively humidity are more pronounced in summer. Moreover, summer rainfall is enhanced but winter precipitation is reduced. The increase in summer rainfall is mainly contributed by the strong urban heat island effect, which enhances the convective circulation over the urban area. On the other hand, a reduction in winter precipitation is observed. The different behavior during winter time is due to drier northerly winds and increased atmospheric stability. Furthermore, the changes in winter precipitation are associated with the synoptic forcing such as El Niño – Southern Oscillation and monsoon, but no significant correlation can be found between changes in summer rainfall and the synoptic forcing. In other words, the local surface forcing (including radiative fluxes, heat, momentum and water transfer at the air–land interface) dominates over the synoptic forcing in summer but the reverse is true in winter. Under conditions of weak synoptic flow, local thermodynamic effects of urbanization dominates, setting up convergence zone over the urban area and leading to increased precipitation. However, during winter time, under the influence of strong northeasterly synoptic flow, dynamic effects of increased surface roughness urban areas dominate and lead to convergence upwind of the urban region.";"Cheng, Camilla K.M.

"AGRIS:US2012204564";"GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS: PROTECTING VALUE-ADDED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PARTICIPATION";"";"Since 1992, the European Union has protected high-quality agricultural products based on geographical origin using designations of geographical indications (GIs). U.S. producers and processors can obtain a type of trademark called a certification mark, which provides similar protections to that of GIs but protects products only within the United States. In the current round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, the European Union and other countries are seeking to expand protection through GIs. If they achieve the full range of protection they are seeking, many U.S. producers and processors could no longer use many product names currently treated as generic (e.g., feta cheese). This article describes and contrasts three systems of protecting property rights for agricultural products (certification mark, E.U.-wide GI, and WTO GI) and discusses some of the benefits and problems of each system and the effects of each system on helping to differentiate and protect high-value U.S. agricultural products.";"Babcock, Bruce A.

"AGRIS:US201500192652";"Carbon stocks and carbon fluxes from a 10‐year prescribed burning chronosequence on a UK blanket peat";"";"Prescribed burning is a common land management technique in many areas of the UK uplands. However, concern has been expressed at the impact of this management practice on carbon stocks and fluxes found in the carbon‐rich peat soils that underlie many of these areas. This study measured both carbon stocks and carbon fluxes from a chronosequence of prescribed burn sites in northern England. A range of carbon parameters were measured including above ground biomass and carbon stocks; net ecosystem exchange (NEE), net ecosystem respiration (Rₑcₒ) and photosynthesis (Pg) from closed chamber methods; and particulate organic carbon (POC). Analysis of the CO₂data showed that burning was a significant factor in measured CO₂readings but that other factors such as month of sampling explained a greater proportion of the variation in the data. Carbon budget results showed that whereas all the plots were net sources of carbon, the most recent burn scars were smaller sources of carbon compared with the older burn scars, suggesting that burning of Calluna‐dominated landscapes leads to an ‘avoided loss’ of carbon. However, this management intervention did not lead to a transition to a carbon sink and that for carbon purposes, active peat‐forming conditions are desirable.";"Clay, G. D.

"AGRIS:US201500198680";"Influence of development stage of spring oilseed rape and spring wheat on interception of wet-deposited radiocaesium and radiostrontium";"";"The dry and wet deposition of radionuclides released into the atmosphere can be intercepted by vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems. The aim of this study was to quantify the interception of wet deposited ¹³⁴Cs and ⁸⁵Sr by spring oilseed rape (Brassíca napus L.) and spring wheat (Tríticum aestívum L.). The dependency of the intercepted fraction (f) on total above ground plant biomass, growing stage and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) was quantified. A trial was established in Uppsala (east central Sweden), with land management in accordance to common agricultural practices. The field trial was a randomised block design of 1 × 1 m² parcels with three replicates. During the growing season of 2010, a rainfall simulator deposited ¹³⁴Cs and ⁸⁵Sr during six different growth stages. Two to 3 h after deposition, the biomass of the centre 25 × 25 cm² area of each parcel was sampled and above ground biomass and LAI were measured. The radioactivity concentration and radioactivity of samples were measured by High Purity Germanium (HPGe)-detectors. For ¹³⁴Cs, there was a correlation between f and LAI (r² = 0.55, p < 0.05) for spring wheat, but not for spring oilseed rape (r² = 0.28, p > 0.05). For ⁸⁵Sr, there was a correlation between f and LAI for both crops (r² = 0.41, p < 0.05 for spring oilseed rape and r² = 0.48 p, <0.05 for spring wheat). There was no correlation between f and above ground plant biomass in spring oilseed rape for either ¹³⁴Cs (r² = 0.01, p > 0.05) or for ⁸⁵Sr (r² = 0.11, p > 0.05). For spring wheat, there was a correlation for both ¹³⁴Cs (r² = 0.36, p < 0.05) and ⁸⁵Sr (r² = 0.32, p < 0.05). For spring oilseed rape, f was highest at growth stage ‘stem elongation’ for ¹³⁴Cs (0.32 ± 0.22) and ⁸⁵Sr (0.41 ± 0.29). For spring wheat, f was highest at growth stage ‘ripening’ for both radionuclides (¹³⁴Cs was 0.36 ± 0.14 and ⁸⁵Sr was 0.48 ± 0.18). Thus, LAI can be used to quantify interception of both radionuclides for both crops, whereas, above ground plant biomass is a weak measure of interception of wet deposited radiocaesium and radiostrontium.";"Bengtsson, S.B.

"AGRIS:US201600190522";"Functional connectivity as an indicator for patch occupancy in grassland specialists";"";"Habitat specialists living in metapopulations are sensitive to habitat fragmentation. In most studies, the effects of fragmentation on such species are analyzed based on Euclidean inter-patch distances. This approach, however, ignores the role of the landscape matrix. Recently, therefore, functional distances that account for the composition of the landscape surrounding the habitat patches have been used more frequently as indicators for patch occupancy. However, the performance of functional and non-functional connectivity measures in predicting patch occupancy of such species has never been compared in a multi-species approach.Here we evaluate the effect of habitat connectivity on the patch occupancy of 13 habitat specialists from three different insect orders (Auchenorrhyncha, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera) in fragmented calcareous grasslands. In order to calculate functional distances we used four different sets of resistance values and rankings. We then modelled speciesâ occurrence using both Euclidean and functional (based on least-cost modelling) inter-patch distances as predictors.We found that functional connectivity measures provided better results than the non-functional approach. However, a functional connectivity measure that was based on very coarse land-cover data performed even better than connectivity measures that were based on much more detailed land-use data.In order to take into account possible effects of the landscape matrix on patch occupancy by habitat specialists, future metapopulation studies should use functional rather than Euclidean distances whenever possible. For practical applications, we recommend a âsimple approachâ which requires only coarse land-cover data and in our study performed better than all other functional connectivity measures, even more complex ones.";"Poniatowski, Dominik

"AGRIS:US201301797035";"Plantation development: Economic analysis of forest management in Fujian Province, China";"";"Growing pressures on timber resources and increasing environmental awareness have generated the need to comprehensively analyze forest management in Fujian Province, China. Fujian is the most heavily forested province in China and experiences an unprecedented property rights reform and changes in investment in forestry by rights holders. This paper focuses on the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) for projected financial performance of plantation management for five species in Fujian. Based on our data, Chinese fir offers the lowest internal rate of return on capital, but still a respectable NPV. Despite the long rotation (31years) masson pine returns are very high according to the NPV, because there are returns from thinnings and rosin for more than half the rotation period. Eucalyptus and bamboo offer the lowest NPVs, with high IRRs and short rotations they are well suited to planting by smallholders, and this has occurred widely. Some ecological and environmental issues are discussed according to calculation results of NPV and IRR in Fujian. Further, this should popularize the loblolly pine planting, so that species could play an increasing role. Based on the above studies, projected economic benefit to rights holders have been a powerful driver for private investment in forestry development. Property rights reforms, private investment, and demand growth have successfully fostered considerable investment in forest management in Fujian. In 2007 foreign investors initiated planting operations there. We believe management should pay more attention to forest layout and ecological issues. This would enhance forest sustainable development as well as promote further economic development, social progress and environmental protection. Fujian is one of China's key forest regions. In recent years, forest resources have been developed rapidly, with significant local benefits to employment and economic activities. To suggest ways to better promote forest development and improve management, this paper studies the projected economic performance of five of the most prominent species being planted.";"Ying, Zhang

"AGRIS:US201400173132";"Evaluation of best management practices under intensive irrigation using SWAT model";"";"Land management practices such as conservation tillage and optimum irrigation are routinely used to reduce non-point source pollution and improve water quality. The calibrated and validated SWAT-IRRIG model is the first modified SWAT version that reproduces well the irrigation return flows (IRF) when the irrigation source is outside of the watershed. The application of this SWAT version in intensive irrigated systems permits to better evaluate the best management practices (BMPs) in such systems. This paper evaluates several BMPs on IRF, total suspended sediment (TSS), organic P (ORG_P), soluble P (SOL_P), and total P (TP) at the outlet Del Reguero stream watershed (Spain). Economic impacts of the BMPs on crop gross margin were also evaluated. In total, 20 BMPs scenarios were tested. The BMPs proposed considered tillage (conservation and no-tillage), fertilizer application (incorporated, recommended, and reduced), and irrigation (adjusted to crop needs). The measured data series corresponding to 2008 and 2009 years were considered to estimate IRF, TSS, ORG_P, SOL_P and TP losses as a reference to assess the effects of the considered BMPs. The results indicate that the best individual BMP (adjusted irrigation water use) reduced IRF by 31.4%, TSS loads by 33.5% and TP loads by 12.8%. When individual BMPs were combined, the load reductions were even increased. The BMP scenario combining optimum irrigation application, conservation tillage and reduced P fertilizer dose was the best, leading to a TP load reduction of about 22.6%. For corn and alfalfa, the best BMP scenario was the combination between conservation tillage and reduced P fertilizer dose, increasing the crop gross margin by 309€ha⁻¹ and 188€ha⁻¹, respectively. For sunflower and barley, the best scenario combined the adjusted irrigation water use, conservation tillage and reduced P fertilizer dose (gross margin increase of 171€ha⁻¹ and 307€ha⁻¹, respectively).";"Dechmi, F.

"AGRIS:US201301920944";"Effects of Long-Term Livestock Grazing on Fuel Characteristics in Rangelands: An Example From the Sagebrush Steppe";"";"Livestock grazing potentially has substantial influence on fuel characteristics in rangelands around the globe. However, information quantifying the impacts of grazing on rangeland fuel characteristics is limited, and the effects of grazing on fuels are important because fuel characteristics are one of the primary factors determining risk, severity, continuity, and size of wildfires. We investigated the effects of long-term (70+ yr) livestock grazing exclusion (nongrazed) and moderate levels of livestock grazing (grazed) on fuel accumulations, continuity, gaps, and heights in shrub-grassland rangelands. Livestock used the grazed treatment through 2008 and sampling occurred in mid- to late summer in 2009. Nongrazed rangelands had over twofold more herbaceous standing crop than grazed rangelands (P<0.01). Fuel accumulations on perennial bunchgrasses were approximately threefold greater in nongrazed than grazed treatments. Continuity of fuels in nongrazed compared to grazed treatments was also greater (P<0.05). The heights of perennial grass current year's and previous years' growth were 1.3-fold and 2.2-fold taller in nongrazed compared to grazed treatments (P<0.01). The results of this study suggest that moderate livestock grazing decreases the risk of wildfires in sagebrush steppe plant communities and potentially other semi-arid and arid rangelands. These results also suggest wildfires in moderately grazed sagebrush rangelands have decreased severity, continuity, and size of the burn compared to long-term nongrazed sagebrush rangelands. Because of the impacts fuels have on fire characteristics, moderate levels of grazing probably increase the efficiency of fire suppression activities. Because of the large difference between fuel characteristics in grazed and nongrazed sagebrush rangelands, we suggest that additional management impacts on fuels and subsequently fires need to be investigated in nonforested rangelands to protect native plant communities and prioritize management needs.";"Davies, Kirk W.

A geospatial modeling approach based on a global environmental stratification is used to explore potential impacts of projected climate change on the spatial distribution of bioclimatic strata and ecoregions within the transboundary Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL) of China, India and Nepal. Twenty-eight strata, comprising seven bioclimatic zones, were aggregated to develop an ecoregional classification of 12 ecoregions (generally defined by their potential dominant vegetation type), based upon vegetation and landcover characteristics. Projected climate change impacts were modeled by reconstructing the stratification based upon an ensemble of 19 Earth System Models (CIMP5) across four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios (i.e. 63 impact simulations), and identifying the change in spatial distribution of bioclimatic zones and ecoregions. Large and substantial shifts in bioclimatic conditions can be expected throughout the KSL area by the year 2050, within all bioclimatic zones and ecoregions. Over 76� % of the total area may shift to a different stratum, 55� % to a different bioclimatic zone, and 36.6� % to a different ecoregion. Potential impacts include upward shift in mean elevation of bioclimatic zones (357� m) and ecoregions (371� m), decreases in area of the highest elevation zones and ecoregions, large expansion of the lower tropical and sub-tropical zones and ecoregions, and the disappearance of several strata representing unique bioclimatic conditions within the KSL, with potentially high levels of biotic perturbance by 2050, and a high likelihood of major consequences for biodiversity, ecosystems, ecosystem services, conservation efforts and sustainable development policies in the region.";"Zomer, Robert J.

"AGRIS:US201400182375";"effect of soil moisture and wind speed on aerosol optical thickness retrieval in a desert environment using SEVIRI thermal channels";"";"Dust emission and deposition are associated with several factors such as surface roughness, land cover, soil properties, soil moisture (SM), and wind speed (WS). A combination of land surface and remote-sensing models has recently been investigated for dust detection and monitoring. The thermal bands of the Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG/SEVIRI) satellite are widely used for qualitative detection of dust over desert because of their high spectral and temporal resolutions. In this work, the contribution of ground-measured WS data and satellite-measured SM data on aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieval was investigated using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. ANNs have been applied in similar applications and have shown a higher performance than simple multiple-regression models. This performance is mainly due to the ANN's ability to capture complex and non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. A combination of MSG/SEVIRI brightness temperature (BT)/brightness temperature differences (BTDs), BTD₃.₉–₁₀.₈, BTD₈.₇–₁₀.₈, BTD₁₀.₈–₁₂, and BT₃.₉, was used as input to the base ANN model while Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOT (level 2) data at 0.5 μm were used as output. These input/output sets were obtained from two stations (Hamim and Mezaira) lying in the inland desert of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). About 3800 observations were collected, of which two-thirds were used to train the ANN model and the remaining third was kept as an independent set to assess the accuracy of the trained model. Later, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) SM data and ground-measured WS data were used as additional inputs to the base model to investigate their contribution to the AOT retrieval. SM data consist of daytime AMSR-E-derived daily and collected from a National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC)-archived database. Hourly average WS data were also collected at 10 m height in the same AERONET sites from two stations managed by the UAE National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology. All ground and satellite measurements were extracted for the closest time to AERONET measurements. The use of these additional inputs has been shown to have a positive impact on the accuracy of simulated AOT. The addition of these inputs to the base ANN increased R² from 0.68 to 0.76 and reduced root mean square error from 0.113 to 0.09.";"Parajuli, Sagar Prasad

In this paper, hotspots of agricultural change were mapped and put in the context of hydrology and water management. Time series of MODIS imagery taken every eight days before (2001-2002) and during (2002-2003) the supply shock were combined with agricultural census data to document changes in cropping patterns in four large irrigation projects in the downstream sections of the Krishna and Godavari River basins (total command area 18,287km²). The area cropped in rice in the four irrigated command areas decreased by 32% during the drought year, and rice production in the two districts that experienced the largest flow reductions fell below production levels of 1980. The irrigation project that showed the largest change in double cropped area (−90%) was upstream of the Krishna Delta. In the Krishna Delta, large areas changed from rice-rice to rice-gram double cropping. Historical water management contributed to the vulnerability of rice production to drought: the main reservoir in the system was drained to dead storage levels by the end of each growing season over 1968-2000, with little carryover storage. The land cover change maps suggested that the lower Krishna Basin has experienced a “hard landing” during basin closure, and revised management strategies that account for the new flow regime will be required to maintain agricultural production during droughts.";"Biggs, Trent W.

Since the late 1990s, a large area of the Loess Plateau has undergone intensive land use changes during several ecological restoration projects to control soil erosion and combat land degradation, especially in the Grain for Green project. By using remote sensing techniques and the Yasso07 model, we simulated the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the Yangjuangou catchment of the Loess Plateau. The performance of the model was evaluated by comparing the simulated results with the intensive field measurements in 2006 and 2011 throughout the catchment. SOC stocks and NPP values of all land use types had generally increased during our study period. The average SOC sequestration rate in the upper 30 cm soil from 2006 to 2011 in the Yangjuangou catchment was approximately 44 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹, which was comparable to other studies in the Loess Plateau. Forest and grassland showed a more effective accumulation of SOC than the other land use types in our study area. The Yasso07 model performed reasonably well in predicting the overall dynamics of SOC stock for different land use change types at both the site and catchment scales. The assessment of the model performance indicated that the combination of Yasso07 model and remote sensing data could be used for simulating the effect of land use changes on SOC stock at catchment scale in the Loess Plateau.";"Wu, Xing

We assessed paired sites of natural forest and major land uses (potato, tea and grazing lands) converted between 1973 and 2010. These pairings were replicated at three altitudinal zones. Plots (20m by 50m) were demarcated within each site. Five composite soil and core samples were obtained from 0 to 15cm (top-soil) and 15–30cm (sub-soil) at each plot. In total, 192 composite soil and core samples were collected. Within forest we found marked site to site variation in SOC from 54.6 to 82.6Mg/ha. There was a tendency for higher SOC in converted land, associated with higher bulk density suggesting quality based land use selection with forest left on inferior soils. Cultivation, landscape position, slope and sampling depth were all significantly (P<0.05) related to variation in SOC stocks following forest conversion but time since conversion had no detectable impact. Interestingly, there was no significant relationship between SOC in the top and sub-soils. Higher SOC is largely determined by higher bulk density. The large SOC stocks in these afro-montane soils are less predictable and more persistent than anticipated.";"Twongyirwe, R.

"AGRIS:US201500013790";"Increase in soil nutrients in intensively managed cash-crop agricultural ecosystems in the Guanting Reservoir catchment, Beijing, China";"";"Since the late 1970s, transitions in socioeconomic status and new governmental policies have led to drastic changes in agricultural land use types and farm management practices across rural China, such as an increase in the area of land cultivated for cash–crops (e.g. vegetables and orchards) and intensive fertilization and irrigation of this land. How this more intensive management and land use for the more profitable cash crops affects soil nutrients is of great concern for carbon, soil and water quality management. In this paper, we attempted to assess the influence of cash crop ecosystems on soil nutrients in the catchment upstream of the Guanting Reservoir, in the Beijing municipality, North China plain. Soil nutrients in cash crop (orchard and vegetable) ecosystems with between 8 and 20years of intensive management history were compared with traditional agro-ecosystem management patterns (corn and soybean). Results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) had improved, and total nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (P) concentrations had marginally increased under intensive management practices in the vegetable and orchard ecosystems in the last 25years. The increases in SOC and total P densities at the 100cm soil depth in orchard, vegetable and irrigated corn systems were greater than those in the rain fed corn and soybean systems. Soil available P and electrical conductivity (EC) were highest in the vegetable lands. However, no significant changes were found between the soil physical properties (i.e. bulk density, clay content and water stable aggregate content) of the traditional and cash-cropping systems. Multi regression analysis showed that manure and mineral fertilizer contributed significantly to the increase in soil nutrients. Intensively managed orchards are a better option for improving soil quality and SOC sequestration. However, the risks of nonpoint source pollution from, and soil salinization in, the land used for vegetable cultivation should be considered in the future.";"Zhang, Xinyu

"AGRIS:US201400173136";"Strategies to increase wheat production in the water scarce Karkheh River Basin, Iran";"";"Two strategies are assessed to increase wheat production in the water-scarce Karkheh River Basin (KRB) in Iran to meet targets by the year 2025. The strategies proposed are (a) to increase yields in the current irrigated and rainfed wheat areas and (b) to increase the area under rainfed wheat through land conversion. Crop water consumption, based on satellite remote sensing and crop yield data, was used to estimate crop water productivity (CWP) in irrigated and rainfed wheat areas in five sub-basins. CWP for wheat ranges from 0.5–1.63kgm⁻³ in irrigated areas to 0.37–0.62kgm⁻³ in rainfed areas. Conditions indicating water-stress in wheat areas were assessed by relative evapotranspiration (ETₐ/ETₚ) and showed that water-stress only had a minimal effect for about 154,000ha of irrigated wheat (57%). Land suitability analysis showed that about 71,000ha of rangelands can be converted into rainfed wheat areas without harming the current water balance in the basin. Statistical analyses showed that more than 70% of the variation in irrigated and rainfed wheat yield at plot level can be explained by water, fertilizer and seed rates. This suggests that wheat production can be increased by improving inputs other than water. Results from this study indicate that it is possible to meet approximately 85% of the wheat production targets in the year 2025 when strategies are combined.";"Muthuwatta, L.P.

An accurate evaluation of soil water conditions in such regions is essential in order to improve the understanding of the role of soils as a water pool and to design scientifically based water management strategies. However, the vertical distribution of soil water and its storage in deeper layers are unclear due to the shortage of field data. In this study, soil water content (SWC) and related soil (i.e., soil organic carbon, soil particle composition) and plant (i.e., root depth, root mass) properties were determined to a depth of 21m at 11 sites across the Loess Plateau of China. Soil water storage (SWS) and available soil water storage (AWS) were calculated for each 1-m thick soil layer in the profile as well as for the whole profile. Mean values for SWC, SWS, and AWS in the soil layers had a similar distribution pattern down the profile, which could be divided into three statistically significant different sub-layers where the parameter decreased (0–2.5m), then increased (2.5–5m), and increased with fluctuations (5–21m). The amount of SWS and AWS in the 21-m profiles varied from 1639mm to 5669mm and from 831mm to 2953mm, respectively. In the root zone, the vertical distribution and quantity of soil water were significantly influenced by land use and plant characteristics (i.e., root mass); while below the root zone, soil texture became a more important factor. Compared with the upper soil layers, the deeper soil layers provided a larger water pool and thus potentially had a stronger buffering capacity, which could mitigate the effects of seasonal or inter-annual drought on plants. Understanding this information is important to regional water budgets, sustainable land management and the restoration of the ecological environment on the Loess Plateau and possibly in other water-limited ecosystems around the world.";"Wang, Yunqiang

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been proposed as a potential system for improving soil quality and providing stable yields through minimum soil disturbance, surface crop residue retention (mulching) and crop rotations or associations. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of evidence of the benefits of CA for small-scale farmers in southern Africa. This research was carried out in two communities and one on-station site in Zambia to provide more scientific evidence about the effects of CA on soil quality, infiltration, soil moisture and crop performance. Results from Kayowozi showed that maize yields in a direct seeded CA treatment, using cowpea seeded with a dibble stick in full rotation, increased by up to 78% after four cropping seasons in comparison to a conventional control using a ridge and furrow system. At Malende, maize yields for animal traction rip-line seeded and direct seeded plots were, on average, 75% and 91% higher than a conventionally tilled control plot after six cropping seasons. Detailed studies undertaken at the Monze Farmer Training Centre revealed that CA treatments, especially that using cotton in rotation, increased water infiltration and soil moisture. In some years, infiltration was five times higher on CA fields than on those using conventional tillage. Carbon increases were only found at the on-station long-term trial, where, over time, CA plots outperformed conventional practice leading to an overall increase of 12% carbon in the first 30 cm, compared with decreases of 15% in the conventional control. Comparative analyses between the on-farm and on-station trials point to a lack of adequate mulching, which might be the reason for lower carbon at the on-farm sites. We conclude that the effects of CA can build up on different soil types in most systems, but that scaling up and out requires the whole community to be targeted, rather than relying on individual farmers to overcome constraints related to the set-up in rural communitieS.";"Thierfelder, C.

EVIDENCE FROM THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA";"";"This paper investigates the issue of child labor in the context of land reforms intransition economies, using farm household data from the Republic of Georgia. The results show that an increase in landholdings as an outcome of the land reform can, in the presence of market imperfections, lead to an increase in child labor. This is because the increased demand for labor on the family farm is stronger than the wealth effect generated by the land reform. However, thisresult is not uniform across farm families. First, it is only relevant for boys,because girls tend to assist in household activities rather than in farm work.Second, larger households are able to meet the increased demand for farm laborwithout the need for additional child labor. To the extent that smaller householdstend to be poorer, it is mostly the poor households that sacrifice the future wellbeing of their male children in order to satisfy current needs. In this sense, theland reform may lead to a higher rural inequality in the long run. The policyimplications are that land reforms in transition countries should include, as anintegral ingredient, the development of rural land, labor and credit markets, inorder to avoid the repercussions associated with increased child labor.";"Kimhi, Ayal";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"GEO";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212075";"http://purl.umn.edu/7147";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400175701";"structured multi-stakeholder learning process for Sustainable Land Management";"";"There are many, often competing, options for Sustainable Land Management (SLM). Each must be assessed – and sometimes negotiated – prior to implementation. Participatory, multi-stakeholder approaches to identification and selection of SLM options are increasingly popular, often motivated by social learning and empowerment goals. Yet there are few practical tools for facilitating processes in which land managers may share, select, and decide on the most appropriate SLM options. The research presented here aims to close the gap between the theory and the practice of stakeholder participation/learning in SLM decision-making processes. The paper describes a three-part participatory methodology for selecting SLM options that was tested in 14 desertification-prone study sites within the EU-DESIRE project. Cross-site analysis and in-depth evaluation of the Moroccan and Portuguese sites were used to evaluate how well the proposed process facilitated stakeholder learning and selection of appropriate SLM options for local implementation. The structured nature of the process – starting with SLM goal setting – was found to facilitate mutual understanding and collaboration between stakeholders. The deliberation process led to a high degree of consensus over the outcome and, though not an initial aim, it fostered social learning in many cases. This solution-oriented methodology is applicable in a wide range of contexts and may be implemented with limited time and resources.";"Schwilch, Gudrun

Hydraulic information derived from river network model applications was then used to determine where river water has sufficient residence time above the tidal limit to facilitate bloom development. A nitrate model (NALTRACES) was developed to estimate the impact of land management change on mean river nitrate concentrations. Applications of this model showed that although agricultural activity contributes substantially to nitrate loads in the Ouse it is likely to have little impact on phytoplankton growth, which could still occur extensively in its absence given favourable sunny and dry conditions. As an example of a means of controlling light availability, establishing full riparian tree cover would appear to be a considerably more effective management scenario than suppressing inputs to the river of nitrate or phosphorus. Any actions should be prioritised in headwater areas such as the upper reaches of the Swale and Ure tributaries. These conclusions are in broad agreement with those arising from more detailed simulations at daily resolution using the QUESTOR river quality model. The combination of simple modelling approaches applied here allows an initial identification of suitable spatially-targeted options for mitigating against phytoplankton blooms which can be applied more widely at a regional or national level.";"Hutchins, Michael G.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400175709";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.04.045";"";"";"";"19-26"

These catastrophic events leave behind a trail of mass destruction with property and human losses amounting to millions. Once a natural disaster hits a region, built-up information is required within a short span of time for disaster management. Nowadays, earth observation satellite imagery serves as a promising source to extract the land use / land cover classes. However, the automatic extraction of urban built-up from remote sensing data is a known challenge in the remote sensing community. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) algorithm has been recognized as an effective algorithm for automatic built-up identification from medium spatial and spectral resolution satellite images. Few researchers have modified this algorithm and proposed new quantitative expressions for the built-up index. In this paper, three built-up index based, unsupervised built-up extraction algorithms have been reviewed and compared. An automated kernel-based probabilistic thresholding algorithm is used to assort the built-up index values, obtained from modified built-up index algorithms, into built-up and non built-up regions for enhancing the efficiency of the built-up detection process. Qualitative assessment of these algorithms involves computation of several parameters including recently developed parameters like allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement, and classical parameters such as error of omission, error of commission and overall accuracy. This paper presents a case study where the algorithms have been implemented on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the city of Delhi and its surrounding areas for detection of built-up regions automatically.";"Varshney, Avnish

Under the current relative sea-level rise scenario, it might be expected that salt marsh ecosystems lose their ability to keep up with tidal flooding and drown following a transgressional pattern where marsh vegetation replaces woody plant species. With more frequent inundation from rising sea level, the change would progress from high marsh through a transition to the low marsh state. Ultimately this would lead to the development of a mud flat when sea level rises beyond low marsh accretion rates, with important coastal management implications. Geological observations from the southeastern Bay of Biscay, however, suggest that this model does not always apply. Evidence indicates that reclaimed areas rapidly gain elevation due to very high sedimentation rates and are colonized by salt marsh vegetation within a few decades, pristine salt marshes in this case have kept up with current sea-level rise, but more importantly, due to high sedimentation rates, even former intertidal mud flats have gained elevation over the last 50 years allowing salt marsh vegetation to colonize new areas. This recent evolution, however, has to be considered in a context of anthropogenic impacts in river catchments wherein sediment supply has been enhanced by human activity.";"Leorri, Eduardo

"AGRIS:US201600182167";"introduced Honeybee Apis mellifera and the Precautionary Principle: reducing the conflict";"";"For more than 20 years there has been conflict arising from different points of view concerning the role of the introduced honeybee. There is a strong prima facie argument, and some supporting evidence, that introduced honeybees are likely to adversely affect the environment. Some land management agencies have consequently adopted a policy of removal of hive honeybees from areas devoted primarily to conservation. On the other hand, some argue that the scientific evidence on the issue remains poor, point out the economic benefits that arise from the honeybee industry and suggest that removal of apiaries from such areas is unjustified. It is suggested in this paper that adoption of the Precautionary Principle could Significantly reduce this conflict. Instead of the focus being on obtaining definitive âproofâ concerning possible impacts of honeybees, it could shift to finding ways to reduce the density of feral honeybees, and hence their impacts on both the natural environment and honeybees in hives. The focus could also shift to finding sites where reduction in honeybee density is feasible and the likely conservation gains arising from such a reduction are relatively high. In this way both the honeybee industry and the natural environment could benefit.";"Pyke, Graham H.";"";"Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales";"AGRIS";"1999-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600182167";"http://dx.doi.org/10.7882%2FAZ.1999.018";"";"";"";"181-186"
"AGRIS:US201500129701";"Health and living conditions of Palestinian refugees residing in camps and gatherings in Lebanon: a cross-sectional survey";"";"BACKGROUND: Palestinian refugees have lived in camps and gatherings in Lebanon for more than 60 years. They are socially, politically, and economically disadvantaged as a result of discriminatory laws and decades of marginalisation, as shown by the absence of property rights and being banned from more than 30 occupations. In Palestinian refugee camps and gatherings, the provision of housing, water, electricity, refuse, and other services are inadequate and contribute to poor health. The association between physical and mental health and living conditions of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon was assessed. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of Palestinian refugees living in all the camps and gatherings in Lebanon was done with multistage cluster sampling during July and August, 2010. Within clusters, households were selected with a random-walk algorithm from a sampling frame provided by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Trained Palestinian social workers interviewed a proxy respondent (generally the female homemaker) from each household face to face using a structured questionnaire. Respondents answered questions about the health and sociodemographics of all household members, housing conditions, and household expenditures and assets (including the ownership of household appliances). The questionnaire included housing indicators for water leakage and type of construction materials. Health was assessed with household reports of chronic and acute illnesses, and mental health of the respondent was assessed with the five-item mental health inventory. Logistic regression models were used to analyse the association between chronic or mental health problems and housing conditions; other covariates were controlled for. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the American University of Beirut. Informed oral consent was obtained from proxy respondents. FINDINGS: A total of 2575 households were randomly selected from a sampling frame and 2501 (97%) responded to the survey. An estimated 31% of 11 092 individuals surveyed had had chronic illnesses and 24% had had acute illnesses in the 6 months before the survey. 82% of 2501 proxy respondents were women; 52% of respondents reported chronic illness, 28% reported acute illness, and 55% were psychologically distressed. 42% of dwellings had water leaking from the roof or walls and 8% were composed of building materials that are dangerous to health (eg, asbestos). Multivariate analysis of predictors of chronic illness showed that the prevalence of chronic illnesses was significantly positively correlated with water leakage (odds ratio 1·24; 95% CI 1·04–1·48) and negatively correlated with household assets (0·85; 0·79–0·91), supporting the link between poverty and health in these communities. Respondents with poor mental health were more likely than were those with good mental health to live in crowded households (1·46; 1·27–1·67), reside in homes with water leakage (1·36; 1·14–1·62), report having chronic (1·98; 1·55–2·48) and acute illnesses (1·31; 1·02–1·68), and have fewer household assets (0·88; 0·84–0·94). INTERPRETATION: Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon struggle with poor health, which is exacerbated by substandard housing and other forms of social and economic marginalisation. Initiatives to improve their housing and economic conditions are needed. Additionally, the increased efforts to assess the social roots of poor physical and mental health and develop appropriate interventions are timely. FUNDING: European Union.";"Habib, Rima R

"AGRIS:US201600124323";"Assessing species traits and landscape relationships of the mammalian carnivore community in a neotropical biological corridor";"";"Mammalian carnivores play an important role in regulating food webs and ecosystems. While many carnivore populations are facing various threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and illegal trade, others have adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Information about Neotropical carnivore communities in particular is limited, especially in disturbed landscapes. We conducted a camera trap survey at 38 sites across the San Juan–La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica to assess occupancy and detection probabilities of the carnivore community. We developed hypotheses within a likelihood-based framework in order to determine the landscape features and species traits (diet and size) that influenced their occupancy. We detected nine of the 13 native carnivores predicted to occur in the corridor. When modeled separately, each species responded to land cover changes differently, suggesting no strong community-wide predictors of occupancy. We then modeled three separate guilds within the carnivore community: omnivorous mesopredators, obligate carnivorous mesopredators, and apex predators. These community guild models revealed a negative relationship between omnivorous mesopredators and increasing forest and tree plantation cover, suggesting omnivores utilize forest fragments and edge habitats in agricultural landscapes. Obligate carnivorous mesopredator models did not reveal any strong habitat relationships, but landscape effects tended to contradict our a priori predictions. Apex predators were positively associated with increasing forest and tree plantation cover, protected areas, and increasing distances to villages. Alarmingly, apex predators and obligate carnivorous mesopredators were generally rare within the biological corridor. A lack of top-down control alone might result in heightened occupancy for all mesopredators, but because the community is dominated by omnivorous species, bottom-up release from human-induced land cover changes and resource provision may better explain their high occupancy.";"Pardo Vargas, Lain E.

"AGRIS:RU2016001573";"Complex land reclamation impact on physical and chemical properties of chernozem solonetz";"Влияние комплексной мелиорации на физико-химические свойства солонцов черноземных";"The aim of the research is to investigate the impact of complex land reclamation including chemical reclamation, manure applying, and ameliorative tillage on physical and chemical properties of chernozem solonetz. The study was carried out in the Rostov region at two backgrounds: 1 – ameliorative tillage by three-tier plow: 2 – ameliorative tillage by plow-milling tool. On the base of own investigations and analysis of science publications it is shown that chernozem solonetz consisting the complex with southern chernozem from 30 to 75% needs the special reclamation considering the environment of zonal soils. Soil samples for the research were collected before reclamation and 4 years later. Data analysis obtained during the study of different variants of complex land reclamation (chemical reclamation + applying of organic fertilizers + ameliorative tillage) has shown its impact on plow and subsurface soil layers, as well as on the fertility improvement of the whole reclaimed layer. The following combinations of phosphogypsum (PG) and manure (M) are the most effective by reclamation impact: 10 t/ha PG + 20 t/ha M and 10 t/ha PG + 40 t/ha M, followed by ameliorative tillage by plow-milling tool. In these variants to the 4th year of after-action sodicity in soil layer 0–40 cm decreased by 70 and 65% respectively, and exchangeable sodium percentage reached 8–9% from the sum of exchangeable cations that is almost fit to the values of zonal soil (6–7%). Simultaneously in solonetz the alkalinity vanished and sodium persistence increased to the medium level (35 meq/100 g of soil), which was less than 10 meq/100 g of soil before the land reclamation. The leaching of toxic salts at applying of 10 t/ha PG + 40 t/ha M reaches 53–62%. While at the background of plow-milling tillage the salt leaching was higher by 15–35% comparing to the three-tier plowing.

Цель исследования – изучить влияние комплексной мелиорации, включающей химическую мелиорацию, внесение навоза и мелиоративные вспашки, на физико-химические свойства солонцов черноземных. Исследования проводились в Ростовской области на двух фонах: фон 1 – мелиоративная вспашка трехъярусным плугом (ПТН-3-40)
фон 2 – мелиоративная вспашка плужно-фрезерным орудием (ПТН-2-40Ф). На основе собственных исследований и анализа научной литературы показано, что солонцы черноземные, составляющие комплекс с южными черноземами от 30 до 75%, нуждаются в особой мелиорации с учетом окружающих зональных почв. Образцы почв для исследования отбирали перед мелиорацией и через 4 года после. Анализ данных, полученных при изучении различных вариантов комплексной мелиорации (химическая мелиорация + внесение органических удобрений + мелиоративная вспашка), показал ее воздействие на пахотный и подпахотный слои и повышение плодородия всего мелиорируемого слоя. Самыми эффективными по мелиорирующему воздействию являются следующие сочетания фосфогипса (Ф) и навоза (Н): 10 т/га Ф + 20 т/га Н и 10 т/га Ф + 40 т/га Н, с последующим проведением мелиоративной вспашки плужно-фрезерным орудием (фон 2). Солонцеватость в слое почв 0–40 см в этих вариантах снизилась к 4-му году последействия соответственно на 70 и 65% и достигла 8–9% обменного натрия от суммы обменных катионов, то есть почти приблизилась к значениям, характерным для зональной почвы (6–7%). Одновременно в солонцах исчезла щелочность и до среднего уровня (35 мг-экв./100 г почвы) возросла содоустойчивость почвы, которая до мелиорации составляла менее 10 мг-экв./100 г. Вынос токсичных солей при внесении 10 т/га Ф + 40 т/га Н достиг 53–62%. При этом на фоне плужно-фрезерной вспашки соли вымывались лучше на 15–35% по сравнению с трехъярусной вспашкой.";"Balakay G.T.

"AGRIS:US201600028910";"Effects of Weather and Land Management on the Western Prairie Fringed-orchid (Platanthera praeclara) at the Northern Limit of its Range in Manitoba, Canada";"";"The western prairie fringed-orchid is a rare North American orchid restricted to a few remnants of wet to mesic tallgrass prairie. It is federally listed in both Canada and the United States and both countries have developed a recovery plan for the species. Two key management objectives are to monitor population trends and identify beneficial management practices. We used 21 y of data from the Manitoba metapopulation to assess effects of weather and land management on this species. Our results suggest the metapopulation in Manitoba is relatively stable. Western prairie fringed-orchids appear to benefit most from a combination of warm temperatures in the previous growing season followed by cool snowy but short winters and wet springs. Periodic burning (e.g., every 2–3 y) may benefit fringed-orchids, whereas grazing may be detrimental. This was not a controlled experiment, however, and gaps in the data may have influenced our results. Prescribed burning is a viable management tool for curtailing woody invasion and both burning and grazing reduce litter and grass cover, but careful consideration of timing, frequency, and intensity of application is required so management does not hinder fringed-orchid reproduction or reduce survival, while also recognizing management requirements may vary among years depending on weather. Long-term studies are particularly valuable for the western prairie fringed-orchid due to its erratic life cycle and fluctuating populations, which complicate studies of environmental and management effects on this species.";"Bleho, Barbara I.

"AGRIS:US201400150572";"Simulated watershed responses to land cover changes using the Regional Hydro‐Ecological Simulation System";"";"In this work, we used the Regional Hydro‐Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) model to examine runoff sensitivity to land cover changes in a mountain environment. Two independent experiments were evaluated where we conducted simulations with multiple vegetation cover changes that include conversion to grass, no vegetation cover and deciduous/coniferous cover scenarios. The model experiments were performed at two hillslopes within the Weber River near Oakley, Utah watershed (USGS gauge # 10128500). Daily precipitation, air temperature and wind speed data as well as spatial data that include a digital elevation model with 30 m grid resolution, soil texture map and vegetation and land use maps were processed to drive RHESSys simulations. Observed runoff data at the watershed outlet were used for calibration and verification. Our runoff sensitivity results suggest that during winter, reduced leaf area index (LAI) decreases canopy interception resulting in increased snow accumulations and hence snow available for runoff during the early spring melt season. Increased LAI during the spring melt season tends to delay the snow melting process. This delay in snow melting process is due to reduced radiation beneath high LAI surfaces relative to low LAI surfaces. The model results suggest that annual runoff yield after removing deciduous vegetation is on average about 7% higher than with deciduous vegetation cover, while annual runoff yield after removing coniferous vegetation is on average as about 2% higher than that produced with coniferous vegetation cover. These simulations thus help quantify the sensitivity of water yield to vegetation change. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Mohammed, Ibrahim Nourein

"AGRIS:US201500209184";"Anatomy of landslides along the Dead Sea Transform Fault System in NW Jordan";"";"In the mountainous region north of Amman, Jordan, Cenomanian calcareous rocks are being monitored constantly for their mass wasting processes which occasionally cause severe damage to the Amman–Irbid Highway. Satellite remote sensing data (Landsat TM, ASTER, and SRTM) and ground measurements are applied to investigate the anatomy of landslides along the Dead Sea Transform Fault System (DSTFS), a prominent strike-slip fault. The joints and faults pertinent to the DSTFS match the architectural elements identified in landslides of different size. This similarity attests to a close genetic relation between the tectonic setting of one of the most prominent fault zones on the earth and modern geomorphologic processes. Six indicators stand out in particular: 1) The fractures developing in N–S and splay faults represent the N–S lateral movement of the DSTFS. They governed the position of the landslides. 2) Cracks and faults aligned in NE–SW to NNW–SSW were caused by compressional strength. They were subsequently reactivated during extensional processes and used in some cases as slip planes during mass wasting. 3) Minor landslides with NE–SW straight scarps were derived from compressional features which were turned into slip planes during the incipient stages of mass wasting. They occur mainly along the slopes in small wadis or where a wide wadi narrows upstream. 4) Major landslides with curved instead of straight scarps and rotational slides are representative of a more advanced level of mass wasting. These areas have to be marked in the maps and during land management projects as high-risk area mainly and may be encountered in large wadis with steep slopes or longitudinal slopes undercut by road construction works. 5) The spatial relation between minor faults and slope angle is crucial as to the vulnerability of the areas in terms of mass wasting. 6) Springs lined up along faults cause serious problems to engineering geology in that they step up the behavior of marly interbeds to accelerate sliding during mass wasting. The most vulnerable areas prone to slope instabilities are those with compressional tectonics followed by extensional movements, with fault bound springs and smectite-bearing marly layers interbedded with pure massive limestones. The semi-arid to arid climate with periodic rainfalls combined with subsurface water circulation along the joints and faults can trigger mass wasting.";"Dill, H.G.

"AGRIS:US201500161792";"How to integrate remotely sensed data and biodiversity for ecosystem assessments at landscape scale";"";"CONTEXT: Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning underpins the delivery of all ecosystem services and should be accounted for in all decision-making related to the use of natural resources and areas. However, biodiversity and ecosystem services are often inadequately accounted for in land use management decisions. OBJECTIVE: We studied a boreal forest ecosystem by linking citizen-science bird data with detailed information on forest characteristics from airborne laser scanning (ALS). In this paper, we describe this method, and evaluate how similar kinds of biological data sets combined with remote sensing can be used for ecosystem assessments at landscape scale. METHODS: We analysed data for 41 boreal forest bird species and for 14 structural ALS-based forest parameters. RESULTS: The results support the use of the selected method as a basis for quantifying spatially-explicit biodiversity indicators for ecosystem assessments, while suggestions for improvements are also reported. Finally, we evaluate the capacity of those indicators to describe biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, for example with carbon trade-offs. The results showed clear distinctions between the different species as measured, for example, by above-ground forest biomass at the observation sites. We also assess how the available data sources can be developed to be compatible with the concept of essential biodiversity variables (EBV), which has been put forward as a solution to cover the most important aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that EBVs should be integrated into environmental monitoring programmes in the future, and citizen science and remote sensing methods need to be an important part of them.";"Vihervaara, Petteri

Quelques enseignements";"";"Permanently maintained pastures in France are often located in less desirable areas of the country and are extensively used for grass based farming, dairy farming an mountainous regions), and suckler farming (cattle and sheep, down into the valleys). These production systems are of interest because they employ practices respectful of the environment and local biodiversity. We conducted observations of 73 cattle suckler farms (12 of which use organic agriculture) located in the Massif Central. We saw that they managed to maintain vast fodder areas, ranging from 1.2 ha of main fodder area per LU for calf producers or sheep producers in semi-montainous areas to 0.6 ha of main fodder area per LU for finishers. For the farms included in our sample, we describe the grass harvesting techniques used, input consumption, and the earnings associated with different production systems. The survival of these farms is tied to Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funding; recent changes to this program are analysed.

The robust tools of seasonal Mann–Kendall trend test and LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing methods were employed to reveal trends of the monitored parameters with adjustment to hydrology. Using principal component analysis and multiple regressions, statistically significant factors with highest impacts on the assessed water quality parameters were identified. Besides indicators of LULC changes in the catchments and their various zones, information of built tile drainage systems were used along with factors reflecting point pollution sources such as the population number, sewerage type and proximity to a watercourse, effectiveness of wastewater treatment, and number of livestock units. The change in LULC was essential only for NO₃-N concentrations, when grassing of arable land, presence of water ponds, areas of permanent cultures and also areas of drained land explained up to 90.6� % NO₃-N variability and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations showed a significantly decreasing trend in all monitored catchments during the evaluated period. LULC changes within infiltration vulnerable zones were discovered as less important for the assessed water quality parameters compared to LULC changes in the whole catchment area. However, for NH₄-N, P and COD, the results did not enable a definite quantification of the effects of LULC changes. The influence of non-point pollution sources on these parameters was revealed as uncertain and was heavily overshadowed by point sources, in particular by wastewater management, and livestock numbers, although the proportion of arable land in tile drainage subcatchments was discovered fundamental in case of the COD. The increasing numbers of livestock, population, and changes in sewage treatment led in some catchments to significant worsening of water quality. Achieved findings may be critical for supporting water quality policy and management decisions.";"Fučík, Petr

This paper presents ALSE, an intelligent system for assessing land suitability for different types of crops in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. mango, banana, papaya, citrus, and guava) based on geo-environmental factors that automates the process of evaluation and illustrates the results on an attribute table. Its main features include support of GIS capabilities on the digital map of an area with the FAO-SYS framework model with some necessary modifications to suit the local environmental conditions for land evaluation, and the support of expert knowledge through on spatial tools to derive criteria weights with their relative importance. A dynamic program for calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a weighting matrix is provided. Expertise and knowledge help ensure that ALSE databases represent realistic, practicable and functional systems. It is useful for decision makers to determine the quality of land for agricultural uses and is intended as a decision and planning support. Responsibility for any decisions based partly or wholly on the output of ALSE rests with the decision maker. ALSE ensures that the results are interpreted correctly within the relevant context, and contributes by maximizing land-use planning and decision support.";"Elsheikh, Ranya

In this experiment the diet composition of four groups of animals grazing heathland swards with low (8%) and high (61%) percentages of cover of Calluna vulgaris was estimated from faeces profiles of n-alkanes and long-chain fatty alcohols. Two breeds of sheep (Welsh Mountain (WM) and Scottish Blackface (SBF)), and two breeds of cattle (Welsh Black (WB) and Continental cross (CX)) grazed the experimental sites during two separate 14-day sampling sessions, in July and September respectively. Both species were selective feeders, consuming grasses (selectivity indices 0.20-1.0) in preference to dwarf shrubs (selectivity indices 0.20-1.0), but there were significant differences in the proportions of various plant groups within the diets. Although the sheep diets contained significantly more C. vulgaris, the quantities consumed were small (<10% of the diet), even on the High site, reflecting the biomass of the graminoid species present, and hence availability of preferred items. The SBF sheep were the only animal type to increase consumption of C. vulgaris later in the season. There were a number of significant differences in the composition of the diets selected by the two hill breeds of sheep used in the study, with the SBF sheep recorded as consuming more C. vulgaris. These results imply that through choice of breed land managers may be able to meet environmental goals more effectively without compromising returns from conventional production systems. In contrast, the overall diet composition of the two breed types of cattle was similar. This indicates that commercial breeds have the potential to deliver the types of environmental benefits associated with grazing of traditional breeds.";"Fraser, M.D.

Currently, most public and private land holders and various other interested parties have different approaches to describing this soil disturbance. More uniformity is needed to describe, monitor, and report soil disturbance from forest practices. We describe required elements for attaining: (1) more uniform terms for describing soil disturbance; (2) cost-effective techniques for monitoring or assessing soil disturbance; and (3) reliable methods to rate inherent soil susceptibility to compaction, rutting, mechanical topsoil displacement, and erosion. Visual disturbance categories are practical for describing soil disturbance. Soil disturbance categories for the Pacific Northwest are described in detail to illustrate essential elements for attaining Element One. A number of potential products are listed to meet the other elements. Completion of these will facilitate collecting comparable data and sharing research and training information. Coordinated efforts will also ensure a more seamless process for assessing and reporting for sustainability protocols, and responding to third-party certification protocols. Additionally, these products will improve operational relevance of research results.";"Curran, M.

We do this by employing an economic land evaluation approach; first, we estimate the physical land suitability and the necessary inputs to reach certain amounts of yields. Subsequently, we estimate costs and benefits for different input-output levels. Finally, to incorporate the increased awareness of sustainability in the export sector, we introduce also certification criteria. Using data from an experimental farm in Kilosa, we find that high yields are crucial for the economic feasibility and that they can only be obtained on good soils at high input rates. Costs of compliance with certification criteria depend on site specific characteristics such as land suitability and precipitation. In general, both domestic production and (certified) exports are too expensive to be able to compete with conventional diesel/rapeseed oil from the EU. Even though the crop may have potential for large scale production as a niche product, there is still a lot of risk involved and more experimental research is needed.";"Segerstedt, Anna

The objective of this study was to determine how C. microphylla plantations affected the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of a sandy soil. Soil samples at the depths of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50cm were collected from the C. microphylla plantations with an age sequence of 0, 5, 10, and 23 years. The results showed that shrub growth altered microclimate, increased litter input, and hence, improved soil water holding capacity, contents of total carbon, total N and microbial biomass C and N, electrical conductivity, and activities of urease, phosphomonoesterase, protease, dehydrogenase and polyphenol oxidase, and decreased soil bulk density. These trends increased with increasing plantation age but decreased with increasing soil depth. C. microphylla establishment could be an effective and applicable measure to restore vegetation and control desertification in the Horqin sandy land, and recommended for adoption in semi-arid sandy areas on a large scale.";"Cao, Chengyou

"AGRIS:US201600191587";"Agricultural landscape simplification and insecticide use in the Midwestern United States";"";"Agronomic intensification has transformed many agricultural landscapes into expansive monocultures with little natural habitat. A pervasive concern is that such landscape simplification results in an increase in insect pest pressure, and thus an increased need for insecticides. We tested this hypothesis across a range of cropping systems in the Midwestern United States, using remotely sensed land cover data, data from a national census of farm management practices, and data from a regional crop pest monitoring network. We found that, independent of several other factors, the proportion of harvested cropland treated with insecticides increased with the proportion and patch size of cropland and decreased with the proportion of seminatural habitat in a county. We also found a positive relationship between the proportion of harvested cropland treated with insecticides and crop pest abundance, and a positive relationship between crop pest abundance and the proportion cropland in a county. These results provide broad correlative support for the hypothesized link between landscape simplification, pest pressure, and insecticide use. Using regression coefficients from our analysis, we estimate that, across the seven-state region in 2007, landscape simplification was associated with insecticide application to 1.4 million hectares and an increase in direct costs totaling between $34 and $103 million. Both the direct and indirect environmental costs of landscape simplification should be considered in design of land use policy that balances multiple ecosystem goods and services.";"Meehan, Timothy D.

However, co-managed PAs are often conflict ridden. The forceful closure of Silaka Nature Reserve in South Africa in 2013 by a local community epitomizes the conflicts that can emerge in co-management arrangements. Using Silaka Reserve as a case study, we ask questions related to the meaning of land to local people, with an interrogative focus beyond “material benefits” in co-management discourse. The results of this study show that apart from nonaccrual of material benefits, conflicts arise from nonrecognition of nonmaterial aspects such as cultural values of and historical attachment to land and limited involvement of land claimants in decision making.

Much concern has been raised about how cropland expansion and associated management practices (nitrogen fertilizer use, irrigation, etc.) have affected the terrestrial carbon cycle in this region. In this study, we used a process-based ecosystem model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), to assess the magnitude, spatial and temporal patterns of terrestrial carbon fluxes and pools in Tropical Asia as resulted from cropland expansion and land management practices during 1901–2005. The results indicated that cropland expansion had resulted in a release of 19.12±3.06PgC (0.18±0.029PgC/yr) into the atmosphere in Tropical Asia over the study period. Of this amount, approximately 22% (4.18±0.66PgC) was released from South Asia and 78% (14.94±2.40PgC) from Southeast Asia. Larger land area was converted to cropland while less carbon was emitted from South Asia than from Southeast Asia, where forest biomass and soil carbon were significantly higher. Changes in vegetation, soil organic matter, and litter pools caused emissions of 15.58, 2.25, and 1.71PgC, respectively, from the entire region. Significant decreases in vegetation carbon occurred across most regions of Southeast Asia due to continuous cropland expansion and shrink of natural forests. When considering land management practices, however, less carbon was released into the atmosphere, especially in South Asia where land management practices contributed to an approximately 10% reduction in carbon emission. This implies that optimizing land management practices could greatly reduce the carbon emissions caused by cropland expansion and might be one of important climate mitigation options in Tropical Asia.";"Tao, Bo

Thus, agricultural land resources are available to produce intensively RES for biogas production in the future and to achieve the target set for renewables by 2020, so that the total capacity of biogas facilities reaches 61 MW. In 2011, totally 24 new biogas facilities with a total capacity of 29.38 MW started operating.

Here, we used literature review and case study approaches to assess the evidence for similar transformations in cold-climate ecosystems of the boreal, subarctic and upper montane-temperate life zones. Our assessment focuses on the plant genera Lupinus and Alnus, which have become invasive largely as a consequence of deliberate introductions and/or reduced land management. These cold biomes are commonly located in remote areas with low anthropogenic N inputs, and the environmental impacts of N₂-fixer invasion appear to be as severe as those from anthropogenic N deposition in highly N polluted areas. Hence, inputs of N from N₂ fixation can affect ecosystems as dramatically or even more strongly than N inputs from atmospheric deposition, and biomes in cold climates represent no exception with regard to the risk of being invaded by N₂-fixing species. In particular, the cold biomes studied here show both a strong potential to be transformed by N₂-fixing plants and a rapid subsequent saturation in the ecosystem’s capacity to retain N. Therefore, analogous to increases in N deposition, N₂-fixing plant invasions must be deemed significant threats to biodiversity and to environmental quality.";"Hiltbrunner, Erika

"AGRIS:DJ2012091652";"'The Finn line' - a historical curiosity or a juridicial rality? The Sami reindeer herders' land rights in southern Sami areas evaluated from land consolidation practice (In Norwegian with Summary in English)";"";"Attitudes towards the land rights of Sami reindeer herders have changed considerably during the last 100 years. So, too, has consideration of how such rights should be treated by Land Consolidation Courts. This paper reviews changes in attitudes to the Sami land rights with respect to how these are considered in Land Consolidation Courts in southern Sami areas in Norway. The review also considers changing attitudes regarding the competence of Land Consolidation Courts to deal with such matters. There were several cases in the 20th Century in which Land Consolidation Courts treated Sami land rights in a restricted and unfortunate manner. Legal practice, however, was not always like that, evidenced by the so-called 'Finn line' (Norwegian: 'finnelinja' -'Finn' is an archaic name for Sami). This boundary was established during a land consolidation case in 1873 and was confirmed in 1883. At that time, Sami land rights were evidently accepted as appurtenant right in privately owned mountain pasture and the Sami were treated in the same way as others who enjoyed rights of usufruct on it. The regulation of 1883 included rules governing compensation for grazing damage on farming land. In particular, responsibility for grazing damage was divided between owners and the reindeer herders, providing these looked after their animals properly, 'The Finn line' subsequently achieved wider importance. The case of 18731883 has been referred to several times as a valuable and valid precedent for a way in which to organize grazing conflicts in other Sami areas. It was used in 1964 as evidence of the special rights of Sami reindeer people in the Brekken common land case. The Sami won this case in 1968 and, in its judgement, the Norwegian Supreme Court of Justice emphasised the importance of the line (Rt. 1968, p. 394). Although, owing to changes in land use practices, the 'Finn line' no longer has any practical significance, its juridical significance remains because it settles the principle that the rights of Sami reindeer herders' have to be considered in the same way as the rights of farming land owners. The ruling of 1873-1883 makes it clear that reindeer herders stand to gain important concessions, with respect to access to pasture, in land consolidation cases. The degradation of Sami land rights from the end of the 19th Century was a consequence of political manipulation and had no basis in law. Attitudes have now changed and, consequently, there is a need to revise recent legislation, such as the 1978 Reindeer Husbandry Act with regard to rules for compensation for grazing damage on farming land, and the 1979 Land Consolidation Act concerning rules of land use.";"Øyvind Ravna";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-04-19";"";"land consolidation";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"NOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012091652";"http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1736";"";"";"";""

An unsupervised classification methodology was used producing accuracies in the range of 59% to 66%. Existing field studies, with their associated limitations, were used for identifying class membership and accuracy assessment.

Although classical topics in human thinking throughout the ages, few environmental economic non-market valuation studies have attempted to link the two concepts. Economists have estimated non-market environmental values in monetary terms for over 30 years. This history of valuation provides an opportunity to compare value estimates and how valuation techniques have changed over time.This research aims to compare value estimates of benefits of a protected natural area. In 1978, Nadgee Nature Reserve on the far south coast of New South Wales was the focus of the first application of the contingent valuation method in Australia. This research aims to replicate that study using both the original 1978 contingent valuation method questionnaire and sampling technique, as well as state of the art non-market valuation tools. This replication will provide insights into the extent and direction of changes in environmental values over time. It will also highlight the impact on value estimates of methodological evolution.

"AGRIS:US2012201833";"The Role of Taxation in the Prevention and Treatment of Land Degradation";"";"Tax provisions for land care are often justified as corrections for externalities. It is argued in this paper that land care provisions can be justified independently of an externality correction objective, since land care provisions can be viewed as a partial correction of the failure of the depreciation provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to recognise that items other than plant and articles devalue through use. This argument only applies to depreciation over the effective life of the asset and not to the provision of accelerated depreciation. There may be a role for Pigouvian subsidies in the case of land degradation to address the externality problem, and some degree of accelerated depreciation may be viewed as an approximation of such. It is argued that direct subsidies may be preferred to either the current or redesigned income tax provisions.";"Peterson, Deborah";"";"";"AGRIS";"1995-04-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012201833";"http://purl.umn.edu/12534";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500014327";"Land management between crops affects soil inorganic nitrogen balance in a tropical rice system";"";"Sustainable production of lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) requires minimising undesirable soil nitrogen (N) losses via nitrate (NO₃⁻) leaching and denitrification. However, information is limited on the N transformations that occur between rice crops (fallow and land preparation), which control indigenous N availability for the subsequent crop. In order to redress this knowledge gap, changes in NO₃⁻isotopic composition (δ¹⁵N and δ¹⁸O) in soil and water were measured from harvest through fallow, land preparation, and crop establishment in a 7 year old field trial in the Philippines. During the period between rice crops, plots were maintained either, continuously flooded, dry, or alternately wet and dry from rainfall. Plots were split with addition or removal of residue from the previous rice crop. No N fertilizer was applied during the experimental period. Nitrogen accumulated during the fallow (20 kg NH₄⁺–N ha⁻¹in flooded treatments and 10 kg NO₃⁻–N ha⁻¹in treatments with drying), but did not influence N availability for the subsequent crop. Nitrate isotope fractionation patterns indicated that denitrification drove this homogenisation: during land preparation ~50 % of inorganic N in the soil (top 10 cm) was denitrified, and by 2 weeks after transplanting this increased to >80 % of inorganic N, regardless of fallow management. The 17 days between fallow and crop establishment controlled not only N attenuation (3–7 kg NO₃⁻–N ha⁻¹denitrified), but also N inputs (3–14 kg NO₃⁻–N ha⁻¹from nitrification), meaning denitrification was dependent on soil nitrification rates. While crop residue incorporation delayed the timing of N attenuation, it ultimately did not impact indigenous N supply. By measuring NO₃⁻isotopic composition over depth and time, this study provides unique in situ measurements of the pivotal role of land preparation in determining paddy soil indigenous N supply.";"Wells, Naomi S.

In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) annual gross primary productivity (GPP) (the product termed MOD-17) and its upstream products, especially the MODIS land cover product (the product termed MOD-12). We used high-resolution Google Earth images to classify the land cover classes and their percentage cover within each 1 km spatial resolution MODIS pixel. We used field-based annual GPP for 2006 to estimate GPP for each pixel based on percentage cover. Both land cover and GPP were then compared to MODIS land cover and GPP products. The results show that for pure pixels that are 100% covered by mature oil palm trees, the RMSE (root mean square error) between MODIS and field-based annual GPP is 18%, and that this is increased to 27% for pixels containing mostly oil palm. Overall, for an area of about 42 km² the RMSE is 26%. We conclude that land cover classification (at 1 km resolution) is one of the main factors for the discrepancy between MODIS and field-based GPP. We also conclude that the accuracy of the MODIS GPP product could be improved significantly by using higher-resolution land cover maps.";"Cracknell, Arthur Philip

Road networks with hierarchical structure are crucial for understanding landscape dynamics. In this study, we compared the distribution of national road, provincial road, county road and rural road in the Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) in Yunnan Province of China, and estimated the effect of roads (and other factors) on the spatial patterns of land use and land cover with logistic regression. In addition, we analyzed the land use and land cover change (LUCC) and landscape fragmentation in 1989–2005 along a buffer zone of the primary traffic corridor, national road G214. The results showed that, county and rural roads had much higher percentage of length extending into more natural habitats at higher elevation and steeper slope, compared with the higher level roads in this region. While the distributions of natural land cover types were dominated by environmental factors, human land use types i.e., building land and farmland types were significantly related with roads, linking more closely with lower level roads. The LUCC dynamics (1989–2005) of the G214 buffer zone showed a general trend of land transformation from conifer forests and valley arid shrubs to building land and farmland, and from ice and snow to alpine shrubs and forests. With the length of G214 unchanged during the time, the overall landscape pattern changed little in the buffer zone, but habitat fragmentation and area decrease had occurred for the natural vegetation types, in contrast to patch mergence and expansion of human land use types, and landscape fragmentation was intensified above 2500 m a.s.l. but declined below the elevation. The results indicated the dynamics of landscape composition and patch type level distribution in spite of the stability of the overall landscape pattern, and implied the potential role of roads, especially the low level roads on landscape changes.";"Liang, Jun

We examined the relationship between cover patterns of emergent aquatic plants derived from the CORINE land cover database, and environmental gradients (i.e. lake, climate and land cover and soil variables) at four different buffer scales (50m, 100m, 300m and 500m) in 408 boreal lakes in Finland. Our main statistical methods were hierarchical partitioning (HP), generalized linear models (GLM) and variation partitioning (VP).Based on correlations and HP, the importance of different buffer zones varied between environmental variables in explaining the vegetation cover. Our study also demonstrated that landscape productivity variables (i.e. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness) strongly structured the vegetation cover. These productivity variables proved to be proxies for agricultural land and nutrient leaching from terrestrial areas to water, but they were also associated with shading of riparian vegetation. In the VP, land cover and soil variable groups influenced emergent vegetation cover the most, followed by lake and, lastly, by climate variables.Our work emphasized the importance of spatial scale in structuring freshwater assemblages that should be taken into account in ecological research and bioassessment. The use of a single spatial scale may lead to flawed results on the relevance of various environmental gradients on freshwater assemblages. Moreover, our study showed that satellite-based productivity variables can be powerful proxies for the amount of nutrients eventually entering aquatic ecosystems from adjacent terrestrial areas. The GIS-based approach used here provided an ecologically sound and cost-efficient early-warning estimation of vegetation overgrowth in boreal lakes. This approach is applicable to other regions with similar land cover data sets.";"Alahuhta, Janne

Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen storage under different land uses in the Naiman Banner, a semiarid degraded region of northern China. Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 9â20. Accurate investigation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage at a regional level is important for detecting changes in the C and N sequestration and emission potentials induced by land-use and cover type changes. In a degraded semiarid region of northern China's Horqin Sandy Land, we selected 208 locations and calculated SOC and TN storage to a depth of 100 cm for the main land-use and cover types. The productive cropland on former grassland had the highest level of SOC and TN storage (6613 g C mâ»Â² and 709 g N mâ»Â²). The corresponding storage values were 3758 g C mâ»Â² and 402 g N mâ»Â² in degraded grassland, 3449 g C mâ»Â² and 373 g N mâ»Â² in afforested dunes, 2674 g C mâ»Â² and 320 g N mâ»Â² in unproductive cropland on former dunes, and 1109 g C mâ»Â² and 129 g N mâ»Â² in sand dunes (from mobile to fixed). The average soil bulk density was highest in sand dunes, with a value of 1.59 g cmâ»Â³, and lowest in productive cropland on former grassland, with a value of 1.39 g cmâ»Â³. The conversion of severely degraded sandy land into other land-use and cover types therefore has considerable potential to partially offset the SOC and TN loss during the past century that has resulted from desertification in the Horqin Sandy Land.";"Li, Yuqiang

The type, intensity and spatial distribution of land use forms result directly from the actual and former character of agriculture. In this study, an attempt was made to assess the impact of loess relief on the spatial diversity of land use patch features. The research was carried out within three test areas covering a total of about 100km². The test areas are located within the loess areas of SE Poland. Spatial analyses were carried out using GIS software. Eight landscape metrics were used; altogether 170 averaged parameters (based on almost 13,000 patches) were calculated. In general, the patterns were similar in all three test areas, bigger slopes favour occurrence of larger land use mosaic. Observed land use diversity is as a form of adaptation of agriculture to the existing geomorphological conditions (soil erosion threat). The implementation of land consolidation programmes is very low in loess areas, which results besides social and economic aspects from the occurrence of a diverse mosaic of fields and varied topography. That is why loess areas require special land consolidation programmes taking into account specific geomorphological conditions.";"Zgłobicki, Wojciech

First, a landslide inventory map showing the locations of 118 landslides that have occurred during the last ten years was constructed using data from various sources. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly partitioned into training and validation datasets (70% of the known landslide locations were used for training and building the landslide models and the remaining 30% for the model validation). Secondly, nine landslide conditioning factors were selected (i.e., slope, aspect, relief amplitude, lithology, landuse, soil type, distance to roads, distance to rivers and distance to faults). Using these factors, landslide susceptibility index values were calculated using evidential belief functions and fuzzy logic models. Finally, landslide susceptibility maps were validated and compared using the validation dataset that was not used in the model building. The prediction-rate curves and area under the curves were calculated to assess prediction capability. The results show that all the models have good prediction capabilities. The model derived using evidential belief functions has the highest prediction capability. The model derived using fuzzy SUM has the lowest prediction capability. The fuzzy PRODUCT and fuzzy GAMMA models have almost the same prediction capabilities.

"AGRIS:US201600124331";"Can reforested and plantation habitats effectively conserve SW China’s ant biodiversity?";"";"China has a long history of deforestation and environmental degradation. Because China is also lacking biological reserves, off-reserve conservation is a major contributor to its conservation efforts. Off-reserve conservation in China is primarily being achieved within afforestation and low-intensity agriculture. We compare ant diversity of three habitats: Natural Forest, Disturbed Forest and Plantation, to assess the conservation potential of these multiple land uses. Natural Forest consistently had the greatest plot-level species richness of the three habitats, but this pattern was only statistically significant for arboreal ants. Functional group profiles showed that Specialist Predators were significantly more represented in Disturbed Forest, Opportunists were significantly more represented in one Plantation site, coupled with a lack of Subordinate Camponotini, and Generalised Myrmicinae were more represented in a second Plantation site coupled with a complete lack of Cryptic Species. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences of ant species composition between habitats. Within IndVal analyses, 17 species were associated with Natural Forest and nine with Plantation. No species were associated with Disturbed Forest. Reforestation and low-intensity agriculture clearly provide habitat for many species, but will not necessarily substitute for undisturbed habitat for many other species, especially specialised species. China’s off-reserve conservation could be enhanced by developing a greater understanding of agricultural practices and reforestation techniques that promote species diversity, especially for uncommon, threatened and specialised species.";"Lu, Zhixing

Maps at 1973, 1993, and 2005 indicate that land-cover change is accelerating, while carbon loss is decelerating in Jambi Province, Sumatra. Land dynamics have shifted from Forest loss during 1973–1993 to Agroforest loss during 1993–2005. Forest losses account for most reductions in aboveground carbon during the both time intervals, but Agroforest plays an increasingly important role in carbon reductions during the more recent interval. These results provide motivation for future REDD policies to count carbon changes associated with all influential land categories, such as Agroforests.";"Villamor, Grace B.

"AGRIS:US201400103410";"Fractal characterization of soil particle-size distribution under different land-use patterns in the Yellow River Delta Wetland in China";"";"PURPOSE: Soil particle-size distribution (PSD) is an important soil physical property. Single- and multi-fractal models are increasingly used to characterize soil properties and may provide additional information. The Yellow River Delta is one of the best representative examples of river ecosystem wetlands in the world. In this area, different land resource development patterns strongly influence soil structure and fertility. Here, the single- and multi-fractal characterizations of soil PSD were determined based on fractal theory, and the correlations between PSD and soil organic matter (SOM) across different land-use patterns were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study site was located in a typical area of the Yellow River Delta Wetland in Shandong Province in China. The tested soil samples were obtained from areas with four different land-use patterns, including integrated Robinia pseudoacacia and grass cover land (RPG), well-covered European and American poplar forestland (EAP), cropland used for growing cotton (COT), and waste grassland (WAG). Soil samples were air-dried and passed through a 2-mm screen. Based on the international system of soil size fraction, the soil PSD was described according to the percentages of clay, silt, and sand. The clay, silt, and sand fractions were determined using a laser particle size analyzer. The fractal characterizations of soil PSD were determined using the single- and multi-fractal methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The single-fractal dimension (D) of the different land-use patterns varied greatly (between 2.4657 and 2.6789). The D values of the RPG and EAP were the greatest, which corresponded to the soils with the greatest silt content and the lowest sand content. In contrast, the D value of the WAG was the smallest, which corresponded with the lowest clay content and the greatest sand content. These results indicated that D was directly proportional to clay content and inversely proportional to sand content. The multi-fractal parameters of the soil PSD, capacity dimension (D ₀), information dimension (D ₁), and information dimension / capacity dimension (D ₁ / D ₀), followed a regular trend due to different land-use patterns. These parameters decreased in the following order: RPG > EAP > COT > WAG. In addition, the PSD of the RPG and EAP varied widely and was more heterogeneous than the PSD of the COT and WAG. Furthermore, the single- and multi-fractal parameters were significantly correlated with SOM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that the single- and multi-fractal parameters adequately described the scaling properties of the soil PSD and the influences of soil structure and soil nutrients for the different land-use patterns in the Yellow River Delta Wetland of China.";"Peng, Gao

Influence of this actions on physical, chemical, agrochemical properties of soils upon rice growing, as well as on the yield of rice and winter wheat have been estimated during three following years. The variant ""green manure +10 t/ha (double dose) of phosphogipsum + deep subsoiling + MF"" had the best impact on soil processes. The application of the full dose of phosphogipsum (5 t/ha), calculated for complete displacement of exchangeable sodium in cation exchange complex (CEC), was insufficient due to the presence of magnesium (over 20% of CEC) which increased soil alkalinization in studied soils. Double dose of phosphogipsum supplied the increasing of calcium up to 79% of CEC and decreasing of sodium and magnesium up to 3 and 18% respectively. Thereby the soil structure and water resistance of soil aggregates have improved. Green manure and application of MF created the positive humus balance and increased the content of nutrition elements in soil in comparison with initial data (before soil reclamation). The yield gain of crops grown at the variants with full and double doses of phosphogipsum were 1.17-1.60 and 1.51-2.10 t/ha for rice and 0.79 and 1.13 t/ha respectively. Annual economic effect amounted to 10.1 and 13.8 thousand rubles per hectare.

Комплексную мелиорацию темно-каштановых почв, включающую сидерацию, внесение различных доз фосфогипса, минеральных удобрений (МУ) в количестве, рассчитанном на планируемую урожайность, проводили в 2009 г. Оценку влияния этих мероприятий на физические, физико-химические, агрохимические свойства почвпри рисосеянии, а также на урожайность риса и озимой пшеницы проводили в течение 3 последующих лет. Лучшим вариантом по положительному воздействию на почвенные процессы являлся вариант сидерация + 10 т/га (двойная) доза фосфогипса + глубокое рыхление + МУ. Внесение полной дозы фосфогипса (5 т/га), рассчитанной на полное вытеснение обменного натрия из почвенного поглощающего комплекса (ППК), оказалось недостаточным из-за присутствия в изучаемых почвах не только натрия (7-8%), но и обменного магния (более 20% от ППК), усиливающего процессы осолонцевания. Двойная доза фосфогипса обеспечила увеличение в ППК кальция до 79% и уменьшение натрия и магния соответственно до 3 и 18%. В связи с этим улучшилось структурное состояние почв и водопрочность агрегатов. Сидерация и внесение МУ создали положительный баланс гумуса и увеличили содержание питательных элементов в почве в сравнении с исходными данными (до мелиорации). Прибавки урожайности с.-х. культур на вариантах с полной и двойной дозой фосфогипса составили соответственно 1,17-1,60 и  1,51-2,10 т/га риса, 0,79 и 1,13 т/га пшеницы.

"AGRIS:US201400103949";"Driving forces responsible for aeolian desertification in the source region of the Yangtze River from 1975 to 2005";"";"The Yangtze River is the China’s longest river and the third-longest river in the world. The river’s source region in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is especially sensitive to global environmental change because of its high elevation and cold environment. Under the influence of global warming, aeolian desertified land has expanded rapidly in this area. To assess the trends in aeolian desertification from 1975 to 2005, remote-sensing and GIS technology were used to monitor the extent of aeolian desertification in 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2005. The data sources included Landsat multi-spectral scanner images acquired in 1975, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images acquired in 2000, and Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in 1990 and 2005. Images recorded between June and October were selected, when vegetation grew well, because aeolian desertified land was more easily recognized during this period. Thematic maps, including land use and geomorphologic maps, were used as supplementary data. Aeolian desertification maps (1:100000) were produced for each year from the Landsat images through visual interpretation. The area of aeolian desertified land increased by 2,678.43� km² from 1975 to 2005, accounting for 8.8% of the total area of aeolian desertified land in 1975, an increase of 89.28� km² a⁻¹. Increasing mean annual temperature and the combination of a dry, cold, and windy climate in winter and spring were mainly responsible for the expansion of desertified land.";"Hu, Guangyin

This study examined hydrology and estimated the seasonal net groundwater recharge of an irrigated semi‐arid region located in the Haryana State of India where about 500 000 ha area are waterlogged and unproductive, and the size of the waterlogged area is increasing, causing a threat to agricultural sustainability. Groundwater recharge analysis during the study period (1989–2010) revealed that percolation from irrigated fields was the main recharge component, with 48% contributing to total recharge. An annual groundwater table rise of 0.198 m was estimated for the study area. Since the groundwater table had been rising continuously, suitable water management strategies such as as conjunctive use of groundwater and canal water and changes in crop patterns by reducing rice crop areas against of other low‐water crops such as sorghum are suggested to bring the groundwater table down to a safe limit and prevent further rise of the groundwater table.";"Singh, Ajay

"AGRIS:US2016200976";"Using multi-agent modeling technique to regionalize key processes and patterns of sustainable agricultural cropping systems in the North China Plain";"";"The North China Plain (NCP) covers an area of around 328,000 km2 and is one of the most important regions of cereal crop production in China. Wheat and maize rotations and one season cotton are the most common cropping systems. The region contributes at an amount of about 50% to the countries wheat production and about one third of maize yields. Crop production in the NCP was focused in the last decades on increasing yields to meet the growing food demand accompanied by the limitation of arable land as a result of urbanization rate i.e. of the Beijing District. Food production needs can nowadays only be achieved by the optimization of agricultural management, i.e. fertilizer input, irrigation, improved crop rotations. The focus on increasing yields raised serious environmental problems, like water shortage and pollution, air pollution and soil contamination. Hence the development of future land use system approaches improving these conditions is essentially. This may provide both a high production level as well as a protection of resources. The multidisciplinary collaborative International Research Training Group project (IRTG) “Modelling Material Flows and Production Systems for Sustainable Resource Use in Intensified Crop Production in the North China Plain”, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the Chinese Ministry of Education, was launched to detect the potential of adjustments in cropping systems and to further develop management practices for sustainable resource use and protection of environmental conditions while assuring a high yield level. The here presented research concentrates on the construction of a modelling framework of different spatial-temporal scales in order to regionalize the detected key features and the effects of changing land use patterns.In order to investigate our research objective, the regionalisation of key features towards sustainable agricultural and to improve productivity in the NCP (North China Plain) we primarily have to identify these core features. On the economic site we determine “farmer income” to be an appropriate factor. The ecological site is served by the determination of “water use efficiency” (WUE) and yield. Both factors have to be further verified on their plausibility for our research aim by project member discussion. Next an evaluation of multiple computational approaches towards their practicability was investigated. Relay on both existing GIS data in the projects AIES data base and additional data provided by our Chinese Agricultural University (CAU) colleagues. Primarily the Cellular Automata (CA) concept based on previous work as well as statistical analyses, Data mining and cell neighbourhood relations was investigated. This approach has to be denied due to insignificant neighbourhood relations and the fact that no appropriate computing environment was found. Secondly a model combination of Markov Chain and Cellular Automata as it is proposed by remote sensing software techniques (IDRISI 15.0) has been evaluated. This approach combines stochastic probabilities for cell transitions with classical GIS facilities. Again no statistic significance of spatial transitions due to farmer decisions is found. The 3rd actual approach Multi Agent System (MAS) is believed to be the most promising for several reasons. We chose NetLogo 4.0.3 as appropriate computing environment. First it includes GIS data extensions, above this it is a powerful free designable and Java programmable cross-platform user interface. The hypothesis is the following, Multi-Agents (farmers) acting in space, interfere and interact in spatial scales corrupting their entities (arable land) and thus their income. We have parameterised soil and defined agricultural activity zones. Agents now are aware of their own productivity value and compete with direct neighbours.For future purposes the ecological key features WUE and yield will be investigate by the use of the DSSAT crop model. As a group of scientist actually use the DSSAT crop model in varying plant sciences, certain expertises are generated in our project. This and the author personal expertise will help for a sudden parameterisation and integration of AEIS GIS dataset parameters.";"Roth, Andreas

"AGRIS:US201400056943";"Forest cover changes in North Korea since the 1980s";"";"North Korea used to have abundant forest stocks but underwent substantial deforestation and degradation of forest in recent decades. This study examined morphological changes of forest cover in North Korea between the 1980s and 2000s. Land cover data based on Landsat TM imagery were obtained as images from the Republic of Korea’s Ministry of Environment. The images were processed and used for the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and network analysis. MSPA classified the forest cover into morphological classes such as core, islet, bridge, perforation, edge, loop, and branch. The network analysis identified individual networks of forest, each of which represents a patch of connected forest. The results are summarized as follows: (1) forest cover sharply decreased between the 1990s and 2000s, particularly in western provinces; (2) morphological classes indicating forest fragmentation such as islet, branch, and edge consistently increased in their fraction to the total area between the 1980s and 2000s; (3) islet, branch, and edge also increased in number during the same period; (4) forest networks shrank in size and increased in number. Overall, the results demonstrate that deforestation and fragmentation of forest occurred simultaneously in North Korea during the time.";"Kang, Sangjun

The present study analyses the relationship between urban expansion and soil degradation in an arid Mediterranean region (Attica, Greece) where the compact settlement pattern has been replaced by low‐density urban development. The study area is one of the most densely populated areas in the Mediterranean basin that has experienced an impressive growth in population during the last 60� yr. Low‐density, dispersed urban settlements developed during the last decade (2000–2010) occupy primarily land at medium‐low soil quality. However, the overall quality conditions of vegetation, climate and soil assessed by our study shows that urban expansion consumed high‐quality land previously classified as non‐vulnerable to desertification. By contrast, compact urban settlements have consumed land of intermediate or even high soil quality, but experience poor climatic and vegetation conditions that are classified as highly vulnerable to desertification. Regional planning should incorporate multi‐dimensional indicators of soil, climate and vegetation quality to evaluate the environmental impact of urban expansion.";"Salvati, L.

To test this hypothesis, a participatory assessment approach was combined with the spatially explicit, soil fertility driven FALLOW (Forest, Agroforest, Low-value Landscape Or Wasteland?) model. For a case study village in Northwest Vietnam, participatory evaluations with two age groups of farmers were employed in an iterative way to derive qualitative and quantitative model input data to test scenarios of current and improved management on upland soil fertility evolution with FALLOW. The indigenous colour-based soil quality classification was successfully integrated into the Trenbath FALLOW soil module. The model baseline scenario was validated by calculating the goodness-of-fit of model outputs with land cover maps (Fₜ 0.78) from remote sensing. Model scenario analysis suggested a masking effect of ongoing soil fertility decline by use of fertilizers and hybrid crop varieties, indicating a resource overuse that becomes increasingly irreversible without external interventions. Simulations further suggest that success of introduction of improved cropping management methods becomes less effective with increasing soil degradation and cannot fully restore initial soil fertility. We conclude that the coupled semi-quantitative approach is useful at the village level as it generated meaningful insights into local land use change dynamics without the need for long-term and data-intensive studies.";"Lippe, M.

A new methodology is proposed based exclusively on SPOT VGT data, illustrated for the African Continent using GLC2000 as reference to select 26 distinct land cover types (classes). For each class, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series are extracted from SPOT VGT images and a hierarchical aggregation is done using two different methods: one that preserves the initial signatures throughout the hierarchical process, and another that recalculates the signatures for each aggregation level. The average classification agreement was above 89% using 26 classes. Reducing the number of classes improves classification agreement. In order to study the influence of temporal variability in the classification results, the methodology was applied on data from 1999, 2001, 2008, and 2010.

Nutrient deficiencies reduce crop productivity in salt‐affected regions. Soil fertility has not been sustainably managed in salt‐affected arid regions. Few researchers investigated the crop responses to phosphorus and potassium interactions especially in saline–sodic soils. A research study was carried out to explore the effect of diammonium phosphorus (DAP) and potassium sulphate (K₂SO₄) on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) grown in a saline–sodic field located in Kohat district of Pakistan. The crop was irrigated with ground water with ECᵢw value of 2.17–3.0� dS/m. Three levels each of K₂O (0, 75 and 150� kg/ha) as K₂SO₄ and P₂O₅ (0, 60 and 120� kg/ha) as DAP were applied. The application of P significantly affected fresh beet and shoot yield while K fertilizers had significant effect on fresh beet yield and ratio of beet:shoot, while non‐significant effects on the fresh shoot were observed. The application of K₁ and K₂ promoted sugar beet shoot yield by 49.2 and 49.2% at P₁ and 64.4 and 59.7% at P₂, respectively over controls. In comparison with controls, fresh beet yield was increased (%) by 15 and 51, 45 and 84, and 50 and 58 for corresponding K₁ and K₂ at P₀, P₁ and P₂, respectively. Addition of P₁ and P₂ increased beet yield by 37 and 47% over control. The shoot [P] (mmol/kg) were achieved as 55.2, 73.6 and 84.3 at P₀, P₁ and P₂, respectively. The shoot [Mg] and [SO₄] tended to decrease with increasing P levels, while [SO₄] was markedly reduced at P₂. The effect of P on leaf [Na] was non‐significant, but increasing levels of K decreased [Na] substantially at P₀ and P₁, but there was no difference in the effect of K level on [Na] at P₂. Consequently, K application reduced leaf Na:K ratios. Fresh shoot yield was weakly associated with leaf [P] (R²� =� 0.53). The leaf Na:K ratio showed a negative relationship (R²� =� 0.90) with leaf [K]. A strongly positive relationship (R²� =� 0.75) was observed between leaf [K] and fresh beet yield. The addition of K₂SO₄ also enhanced [SO₄] and SO₄:P ratios in leaf tissues. The ratio of Na:K in the shoot decreased with increasing K application. These results demonstrated that interactions of K and P could mitigate the adverse effects of salinity and sodicity in soils. This would contribute to the efficient management of soil fertility system in arid‐climate agriculture.";"Hussain, Z.

"AGRIS:US201600190061";"Evidence for deviations from uniform changes in a Portuguese watershed illustrated by CORINE maps: An Intensity Analysis approach";"";"We apply a method to evaluate the strength of the evidence for deviations from uniform land change in a coastal area, in the context of Intensity Analysis. The errors in the CORINE maps at 1990 and 2006 can influence the apparent change, but the errors are unknown because error assessment of the 1990 map has never been released, while the error of the 2006 map has been checked for only some countries. The 1990 and the 2006 maps of a coastal watershed in Portugal served as the data to compute the intensities of changes among eight categories. We evaluate the sizes and types of errors that could explain deviations from uniform intensities. Errors in 2.0% of the 2006 map can explain all apparent deviations from uniform gains. Errors in 1.5% of the 1990 map can explain all apparent deviations from uniform losses. Errors in less than 0.7% of the 1990 map can explain all apparent deviations from uniform transitions to each gaining category. We analyse the strength of the evidence for deviations from uniform intensities in light of historical processes of change. Historical processes can explain some transitions that the data show, while the hypothesised errors in the data are the explanation for other transitions that are not consistent with known processes. Inconsistent transitions are an indication of the misclassification errors that could propagate to other land cover change applications, as in the assessment of hydrological processes.";"Teixeira, Zara

"AGRIS:US201301830591";"Changes in Butterfly Abundance in Response to Global Warming and Reforestation";"";"In the Republic of Korea, most denuded forest lands have been restored since the 1960s. In addition, the annual mean temperature in the Republic of Korea has increased approximately equal to 1.0°C during the last century, which is higher than the global mean increase of 0.74°C. Such rapid environmental changes may have resulted in changes in the local butterfly fauna. For example, the number of butterflies inhabiting forests may have increased because of reforestation, whereas the number of butterflies inhabiting grasslands may have declined. Furthermore, the number of northern butterflies may have declined, whereas the number of southern butterflies may have increased in response to global warming. Therefore, we compared current data (2002 approximately equal to 2007) regarding the abundance of butterfly species at two sites in the central portion of the Korean Peninsula to data from the late 1950s and early 1970s for the same sites. Changes in the abundance rank of each species between the two periods were evaluated to determine whether any patterns corresponded to the predicted temporal changes. The predicted changes in butterfly abundance were confirmed in this study. In addition, the results showed a different response to habitat change between northern and southern species. In northern butterfly species, butterflies inhabiting forests increased, whereas those inhabiting grasslands declined. However, the opposite was true when southern butterfly species were evaluated. Changes in the abundance indicate that habitat change may be one of the key factors related to the survival of populations that remain around the southern boundary of butterfly species.";"Kwon, Tae-Sung

"AGRIS:US201400168683";"Vegetation traits and soil properties in response to utilization patterns of grassland in Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia, China";"";"Numerous studies have focused on vegetation traits and soil properties in grassland, few of which concerned about effects of human utilization patterns on grassland yet. Thus, this study hypothesized that human disturbance (e.g., grazing, mowing and fencing) triggered significant variation of biomass partitioning and carbon reallocation. Besides, there existed some differences of species diversity and soil fertility. To address these hypotheses of grassland with diverse utilization patterns in Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia, China, we sampled in situ about aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) to evaluate their biomass allocation. Species diversity and soil properties were also investigated. Subsequently, we discussed the relationship of species diversity with environmental conditions, using data collected from 23 sites during the ecological project period of Returning Grazing Lands to Grasslands (RGLG) program. The results were as follows: 1) both AGB and BGB were lower on grazing regime than those on fencing and mowing, but the ratio of root-to-shoot (R/S) was higher on grazing regime than the other two utilization patterns; 2) neither of evenness and Simpson Index was different significantly among all grassland utilization patterns in desert, typical, and meadow grassland at 0.05. In meadow grassland, species richness of fencing pattern was significantly higher than that of grazing pattern (p < 0.05); 3) both of soil organic carbon content and soil available phosphorous content were increased significantly on fencing pattern than grazing pattern (p < 0.05) in desert grassland, and mowing patterns increased the soil nutrients (soil organic carbon, soil total phosphorous, soil available phosphorous, and soil total nitrogen) significantly compared with grazing patterns (p < 0.05) in typical grassland. However, there were no significant differences among utilization patterns in meadow grassland. In conclusion, both of AGB and BGB were increased significantly by fencing. Moreover, species diversity and soil nutrients can be promoted via mowing and fencing. This study suggested that implementation of Ecological Project played a positive role in sustainable grassland utilization of Hulun Buir City and a strong positive influence on the entire temperate grassland.";"Liu, Miao

"AGRIS:US201600060028";"Change detection from remotely sensed images: From pixel-based to object-based approaches";"";"The appetite for up-to-date information about earth’s surface is ever increasing, as such information provides a base for a large number of applications, including local, regional and global resources monitoring, land-cover and land-use change monitoring, and environmental studies. The data from remote sensing satellites provide opportunities to acquire information about land at varying resolutions and has been widely used for change detection studies. A large number of change detection methodologies and techniques, utilizing remotely sensed data, have been developed, and newer techniques are still emerging. This paper begins with a discussion of the traditionally pixel-based and (mostly) statistics-oriented change detection techniques which focus mainly on the spectral values and mostly ignore the spatial context. This is succeeded by a review of object-based change detection techniques. Finally there is a brief discussion of spatial data mining techniques in image processing and change detection from remote sensing data. The merits and issues of different techniques are compared. The importance of the exponential increase in the image data volume and multiple sensors and associated challenges on the development of change detection techniques are highlighted. With the wide use of very-high-resolution (VHR) remotely sensed images, object-based methods and data mining techniques may have more potential in change detection.";"Hussain, Masroor

We investigated a continuous rubber plantation (forested), land fallowed for 10 y (fallow), 10‐y continuous arable cropping land and cropped land with top soil removed (TSR) for concentrations of C, N, and P in bulk soil and dry aggregates. Results showed that a high level of soil disturbance decreased the proportion of surface (0–15 cm) soil aggregate stability (low mean weight diameter) in TSR by 149% and arable cropping by 125% compared with the forested. Aggregate associated SOC was higher in aggregate‐size fractions of forested land‐use when compared with that in 10‐y fallow, continuous arable cropping, and TSR. For aggregate associated N, fallow and forested land‐use types concentrated higher proportion across aggregate sizes than the arable cropping and TSR. Macro aggregate fractions generally contained higher concentrations of C, N, and P compared with the micro‐aggregates. Water transmission indicators like total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity recorded higher values with forested and fallow land‐use than the others. We can thus conclude that long‐term soil disturbance due to cultivation and removal of top soil reduces the accumulation of soil C, N, and P in bulk soil and decreases water transmission properties. On the other hand, aggregate‐associated C, N and P accumulations are dependent on the level of soil surface disturbance and aggregate sizes.";"Udom, Bassey E.

"AGRIS:US201600060025";"Estimating crop net primary production using national inventory data and MODIS-derived parameters";"";"National estimates of spatially-resolved cropland net primary production (NPP) are needed for diagnostic and prognostic modeling of carbon sources, sinks, and net carbon flux between land and atmosphere. Cropland NPP estimates that correspond with existing cropland cover maps are needed to drive biogeochemical models at the local scale as well as national and continental scales. Existing satellite-based NPP products tend to underestimate NPP on croplands. An Agricultural Inventory-based Light Use Efficiency (AgI-LUE) framework was developed to estimate individual crop biophysical parameters for use in estimating crop-specific NPP over large multi-state regions. The method is documented here and evaluated for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Iowa and Illinois in 2006 and 2007. The method includes a crop-specific Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), shortwave radiation data estimated using the Mountain Climate Simulator (MTCLIM) algorithm, and crop-specific LUE per county. The combined aforementioned variables were used to generate spatially-resolved, crop-specific NPP that corresponds to the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) land cover product. Results from the modeling framework captured the spatial NPP gradient across croplands of Iowa and Illinois, and also represented the difference in NPP between years 2006 and 2007. Average corn and soybean NPP from AgI-LUE was 917gCm⁻²yr⁻¹ and 409gCm⁻²yr⁻¹, respectively. This was 2.4 and 1.1 times higher, respectively, for corn and soybean compared to the MOD17A3 NPP product. Site comparisons with flux tower data show AgI-LUE NPP in close agreement with tower-derived NPP, lower than inventory-based NPP, and higher than MOD17A3 NPP. The combination of new inputs and improved datasets enabled the development of spatially explicit and reliable NPP estimates for individual crops over large regional extents.";"Bandaru, Varaprasad

"AGRIS:US201500219855";"Impact of land‐use changes on soil hydraulic properties of Calcaric Regosols on the Loess Plateau, NW China";"";"Vegetation restoration efforts (planting trees and grass) have been effective in controlling soil erosion on the Loess Plateau (NW China). Shifts in land cover result in modifications of soil properties. Yet, whether the hydraulic properties have also been improved by vegetation restoration is still not clear. The objective of this paper was to understand how vegetation restoration alters soil structure and related soil hydraulic properties such as permeability and soil water storage capacity. Three adjacent sites with similar soil texture, soil type, and topography, but different land cover (black locust forest, grassland, and cropland) were selected in a typical small catchment in the middle reaches of the Yellow River (Loess Plateau). Seasonal variation of soil hydraulic properties in topsoil and subsoil were examined. Our study revealed that land‐use type had a significant impact on field‐saturated, near‐saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil water characteristics. Specifically, conversion from cropland to grass or forests promotes infiltration capacity as a result of increased saturated hydraulic conductivity, air capacity, and macroporosity. Moreover, conversion from cropland to forest tends to promote the creation of mesopores, which increase soil water‐storage capacity. Tillage of cropland created temporarily well‐structured topsoil but compacted subsoil as indicated by low subsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity, air capacity, and plant‐available water capacity. No impact of land cover conversion on unsaturated hydraulic conductivities at suction > 300 cm was found indicating that changes in land cover do not affect functional meso‐ and microporosity. Our work demonstrates that changes in soil hydraulic properties resulting from soil conservation efforts need to be considered when soil conservation measures shall be implemented in water‐limited regions. For ensuring the sustainability of such measures, the impact of soil conversion on water resources and hydrological processes needs to be further investigated.";"Yu, Miaozi

In this study, an oasis in Minfeng County, which is located in the southern edges of the Taklimakan Desert, was chosen as our case study area. Supervised classification for land types was conducted, and then the change detection and the trend of changes in sandy land areas were analyzed and compared. The results show that the area of sandy land has decreased in the region in the period of 1992-2001. The main change was between sandy land and sparse vegetation in the Desert-oasis ecotone. In addition, the change from woodland to grassland and/or arable land was quite obvious from 1992 to 2001. These changes would probably result in more fragile environment and higher potentiality in land desertification in the area.";"Nasierding, Nasiman

"AGRIS:US201400042350";"Social vulnerability to climate change in primary producers: a typology approach";"";"Adaptation in agro-ecological systems will be important for moderating the impacts of climate change. Vulnerability assessments provide the basis for developing strategies to reduce social vulnerability and plan for climate adaptation. Primary industries have been identified as the most vulnerable industry sector globally. We review how primary producers might be socially vulnerable to climate change and develop a ‘vulnerability typology’ of cattle producers based on survey responses from 240 producers across northern Australia. We measured social vulnerability according to ten indicators of climate sensitivity (resource dependency) and four indicators of adaptive capacity. Using a K-means clustering analysis we identified four main ‘types’ of cattle producers. Type 1 producers (43%) were vulnerable because they had low strategic skills and low interest in changing behaviour. Mean age was 59 years old, they were weakly networked within the industry and businesses were small. Type II producers (41%) had low strategic skills, poorly managed risk and uncertainty, had medium sized businesses and were 51 years old on average. Only 16% of producers (Type III and IV) appeared to have resilience to change. Type III producers (13.4%) had a stronger psychological and financial buffer, were 52 years old on average, were well-networked and managed or owned larger businesses. Type IV producers (2.6%) managed risk well, liked to experiment with options and were interested in change. They were 41 years old on average, managed large properties, were well-networked, perceived themselves as responsible for the future productivity of their land and were early adopters of new technology. By providing knowledge of the different ways in which people can be vulnerable to climate change, vulnerability assessments can enable decision-makers to prioritise their efforts, provide a basis for early engagement, and tailor a range of adaptation approaches to most effectively accommodate and support the divergent requirements of different ""types"" of resource users.";"Marshall, N.

A base case simulation was conducted using built-in distributed i-Tree Eco tools, and simulations using different inputs were compared against this base case. Differences in land cover classification and tree cover between the distributed i-Tree Eco and WRF resulted in changes in estimated LAI, which in turn resulted in variations in simulated NO₂ dry deposition.

Estimating transition probabilities between habitat states and modeling the factors that influence such transitions have many applications for investigating and managing disturbanceâprone ecosystems. We identify the correspondence between multistate captureârecapture models and Markov models of habitat dynamics. We exploit this correspondence by fitting and comparing competing models of different ecological covariates affecting habitat transition probabilities in Florida scrub and flatwoods, a habitat important to many unique plants and animals. We subdivided a large scrub and flatwoods ecosystem along central Florida's Atlantic coast into 10âha grid cells, which approximated average territory size of the threatened Florida ScrubâJay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a management indicator species. We used 1.0âm resolution aerial imagery for 1994, 1999, and 2004 to classify grid cells into four habitat quality states that were directly related to Florida ScrubâJay sourceâsink dynamics and management decision making. Results showed that static site features related to fire propagation (vegetation type, edges) and temporally varying disturbances (fires, mechanical cutting) best explained transition probabilities. Results indicated that much of the scrub and flatwoods ecosystem was resistant to moving from a degraded state to a desired state without mechanical cutting, an expensive restoration tool. We used habitat models parameterized with the estimated transition probabilities to investigate the consequences of alternative management scenarios on future habitat dynamics. We recommend this multistate modeling approach as being broadly applicable for studying ecosystem, land cover, or habitat dynamics. The approach provides maximumâlikelihood estimates of transition parameters, including precision measures, and can be used to assess evidence among competing ecological models that describe system dynamics.";"Breininger, David R.

"AGRIS:US2016206564";"Regional dairy production: short-term projections and expected demand for inputs";"";"Over the period 1991-2003, New Zealand’s milk production more than doubled. At the same time, dairy farming expanded its boundaries into non-traditional dairy production regions. The distribution of regional production is of particular interest because of effects on supply and demand balances for key inputs and outputs. Changes in the geographical distribution of dairy production alter local economic output and, consequently, income distribution and community viability. The aim of this paper is to present regional short-term estimates of demand for selected key production inputs and milk output. Short-term estimates for milk production and land use were derived based on past growth rates in stocking rate, cow numbers and productivity per cow for each region. Input demand forecasts were, in turn, derived using regional milk production and land use forecasts and baseline estimates of input and energy use reported in Wells (2001). Results indicate that by season 2006/07, the effective area devoted to dairy production will be at 1.56 million hectares, a 7% increase with respect to the 2003 baseline. However, contrary to what happened prior to 2003, almost all the gain in dairy area is explained by increases in the South Island. Over the same period, national milk production is expected to increase by 20% to 1,431 million kgs. MS. Similarly, the South Island accounted for much of the gain, increasing its share in total milk production to 34% up from 28% in 2003. It is expected that the use of inputs such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and sulphur per unit of area will intensify for all dairy regions. However, the increase in the use of inputs per unit of area relative to the baseline is lower in long-established dairy regions, Northland, South Auckland and Taranaki, than in non-traditional dairy regions like, North and South Canterbury, Otago and Southland.";"Laca-Vina, Hector R.

"AGRIS:US201400066807";"Perspectives on studies on soil carbon stocks and the carbon sequestration potential of China";"";"Soil carbon stocks and sequestration have been given a lot of attention recently in the study of terrestrial ecosystems and global climate change. This review focuses on the progress made on the estimation of the soil carbon stocks of China, and the characterization of carbon dynamics of croplands with regard to climate change, and addresses issues on the mineralization of soil organic carbon in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. By integrating existing research data, China’s total soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is estimated to be 90 Pg and its inorganic carbon (SIC) stock as 60 Pg, with SOC sequestration rates in the range of 20–25 Tg/a for the last two decades. An estimation of the biophysical potential of SOC sequestration has been generally agreed as being 2 Pg over the long term, of which only 1/3 could be attainable using contemporary agricultural technologies in all of China’s croplands. Thus, it is critical to enhance SOC sequestration and mitigate climate change to improve agricultural and land use management in China. There have been many instances where SOC accumulation may not induce an increased amount of decomposition under a warming scenario but instead favor improved cropland productivity and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, unchanged or even decreased net global warming potential (GWP) from croplands with enhanced SOC has been reported by a number of case studies using life cycle analysis. Future studies on soil carbon stocks and the sequestration potential of China are expected to focus on: (1) Carbon stocks and the sequestration capacity of the earths’ surface systems at scales ranging from the plot to the watershed and (2) multiple interface processes and the synergies between carbon sequestration and ecosystem productivity and ecosystem functioning at scales from the molecular level to agro-ecosystems. Soil carbon science in China faces new challenges and opportunities to undertake integrated research applicable to many areas.";"Zheng, JuFeng

Woody vegetation establishment patterns represented  objective indicators of ecological responses to flow alteration. We found different  responses between life-forms. Both trees and shrubs migrated downwards to the channel  after dam closure, but shrubs were most impacted under higher degrees of flow alteration  in terms of lateral movement. In addition, our results show clear longitudinal recovery  trends of natural patterns of tree and shrub distribution corresponding to a decrease in  intensity of hydrologic alteration in the Boreal river. However, vegetation encroachment  persisted along the entire Mediterranean study reach. This may result from a relatively  low gradient of decrease of hydrologic alteration with distance from the dam, coupled with  other overlapping pressures and the mediating effect of physico-climatic characteristics  on vegetation responses.  <br>  La gestion de l’eau par l’homme menace les écosystèmes fluviaux. Une gestion durable de  l’eau implique de connaître les réponses des écosystèmes aux différents modes  d’aménagement des rivières. Assez peu d’études proposent des évaluations quantitatives  écologiques en réponse à des degrés variables de perturbation des débits en rivière. Ce  travail présente les modifications naturelles de la distribution de ligneux, strates  arborée et arbustive, au sein de corridors ripariens (indicateurs de l’état écologique de  l’écosystème fluvial); ces changements sont quantifiés sur différents sites le long de  gradients de perturbation des débits (indicateurs de l’impact), ce pour deux rivières  régulées, l’une Boréale, l’autre Méditerranéenne, à l’aval de barrages. Nous avons évalué  les types de réponses à partir de relations observées au sein des deux biomes (Boréal and  Méditerranéen) par rapport aux facteurs locaux physiques et climatiques en s’intéressant  aux différents traits de vie des ligneux (arbres et arbustes). Les strates arborées et  arbustives réagissent de manière équivalente le long d’un gradient longitudinal (effet  distance au barrage); les arbustes sont plus sensibles, lors des niveaux les plus forts de  débits, aux perturbations latérales sur les berges. De plus, nos résultats montrent  clairement une restauration, selon un gradient longitudinal, des dynamiques naturelles  pour le cours d’eau Boréal. Toutefois l’enracinement des ligneux existe tout au long du  secteur d’étude en rivière Méditerranéenne. Ceci correspond sans doute au gradient  relativement faible de diminution des perturbations hydrauliques à distance du barrage.  Cet effet s’additionne à l’effet des pressions physico-climatiques qui caractérisent les  réponses de la végétation Méditerranéenne.";"Dolores Bejarano M.

"AGRIS:US201301810242";"Local Media and Experts: Sources of Environmental Policy Initiation";"";"Research on the process of policy change often involves a direct or indirect analysis of the roles of policy entrepreneurs and the mass media. In Colorado, beginning in 1998, twelve communities decided to obtain water rights for recreational in-channel purposes such as kayaking and whitewater rafting. These water rights stirred political controversy within some communities in Colorado related to spending public money, appropriate uses of water, and the role of recreation in local economies. Using a comparative case study research method, this research analyzes the role that policy entrepreneurs and local media coverage of recreational water rights played in initiating policy change in local communities. The most critical finding from this study is that in communities where citizens acted as policy entrepreneurs there was more controversy, less positive media coverage, and more media coverage early in the process. This case contradicts the assumption that local media coverage helps to highlight policy problems within communities. It supports the idea that experts wield higher levels of influence than citizens in promoting policy agendas.";"Crow, Deserai Anderson";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301810242";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2009.00348.x";"";"";"";"143-164"

In particular we examine attempts by foreign investors to forge voluntary carbon agreements with customary landowners after the Bali climate change conference of 2007, and the mobilization of state institutions to counter these ‘private dealings’. We highlight the connection between the ways that these processes played out at both national and local scales, with a focus on the highly contentious Kamula Doso forest area in Western Province. We conclude with some observations on the way that the constitutional protection of customary land rights inhibits the formalization of marketable rights in forest resources, including forest carbon, and creates an inconclusive circularity in the operation of forest policy and property processes at different levels of social and political organization.";"Filer, Colin

"AGRIS:US201301110743";"Co-management Policy Can Reduce Resilience in Traditionally Managed Marine Ecosystems";"";"Best-practice environmental policy often suggests co-management of marine resources as a means of achieving sustainable development. Here we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of arrangements between governments and user groups described by different levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin the traditional management system for the bull-kelp “cochayuyo” (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second, the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby jeopardizing the ecosystem's resilience. Our results suggest that the devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future implementation.";"Gelcich, Stefan

Intensity of agricultural production has risen sharply in the last decades and the negative environmental effects like water scarcity, salinization and nitrate contamination have been widely acknowledged. In the wake of the country's rapid economic development it becomes at the same time more and more urgent to narrow the gap between the well-being of the urban and rural population. 
In order to better understand the paths that lead to this present dilemma, this paper provides a historical overview of the development of the land and water markets and the rural financial system. It highlights the linkages and reciprocal restraints between these three sectors and gives some conclusions and policy recommendations on how to proceed in order to further a more sustainable development in the North China Plain.

It is an important ethnomedicinal plant of the Thar Desert; local inhabitants use every part of the plant as medicine. Kernels are prescribed in pregnancy as soporific, antiemetic and for relieving abdominal pain. The insect gall is powered and given orally with water to cure bone fracture. Crushed root is applied on the paining shoulder of the bullock. The decoction of leaves is used for the treatment of cough and cold; leaves are also regarded as diaphoretic and prescribed in typhoid. Paste of leaves is used for healing of cuts, boils and cutaneous disease. It is widely used in pain and inflammatory conditions. Z. nummularia contains a unique group of alkaloids known as cyclopeptide alkaloids, in continuation of our work carried out on the leaves of Z. nummularia, present study was initiated to explore antiinflammatory and analgesic potential of cyclopeptide alkaloids isolated from the leaves of Z. nummularia (IFZN). Anti-inflammatory activity was tested against rat paw oedema, mouse peritonitis and cotton pellet granuloma. For screening of analgesic activity, acetic acid induced writhing, tail flick and hot plate test were performed. IFZN 30mg/kg shows the anti-oedematogenic effect against paw oedema induced by carrageenan, dextran, serotonin and histamine; IFZN 20 and 30mg/kg were found to have highly significant anti-nociceptive effects. Result of pharmacological studies indicated that IFZN is a potent and efficacious analgesic agent. The analgesic activity of IFZN is mediated by the peripheral as well as central pathways.";"Goyal, Manoj

In this article, we summarize experimental evidence showing that local adaptation is widespread in all kingdoms of life, and how this “home-field advantage” has been exploited in forest restoration activities to develop and promote regionally adapted, genetically diverse restoration materials. The importance of such materials is highlighted in the context of changing environmental conditions, such as those predicted in future climate change scenarios. Although the adaptive properties of most restoration species remains unexamined, numerous tools exist for identifying similar environments and ecosystems, and these can be used to develop first-generation seed zones. Finally, general recommendations for establishing foundation populations are outlined so that pre-adapted populations retain sufficient genetic diversity to acclimate to new evolutionary challenges, while minimizing the likelihood of deleterious genetic outcomes (for example, inadvertent selection of undesirable traits; inbreeding depression).";"Johnson, Randy

"AGRIS:US201500078317";"influence of basic beliefs and object-specific attitudes on behavioural intentions towards a rare and little-known amphibian";"";"Context Given the decline in amphibian populations worldwide, it is essential to build a better understanding of human behaviours that jeopardise their survival. Much of the literature regarding the social–psychological determinants of behaviours related to wildlife has focussed solely on general wildlife beliefs rather than specific attitudes towards a particular species. Aims The goal of this study was to assess how individuals’ behavioural intentions towards a rare and little-known species, the hellbender salamander (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), are influenced by their attitudes towards the animal and their more general beliefs about wildlife. Methods Questionnaires were distributed to landowners in Missouri (n=1 065) and Indiana (n=1 378) in counties where the hellbender is known to exist. A multinomial logit regression model was used to assess the relationship between basic wildlife beliefs, species-specific attitudes and behavioural intentions towards the hellbender. Key results The response rate was 36.6% in Missouri and 41.0% in Indiana. The more value individuals placed on non-hunting wildlife experiences, the less likely they were to say they would engage in a behaviour harmful to the animal (β=–0.47, P=0.030). The more negative the attitudes towards the hellbender held by individuals, the less likely they were to say they would remove the hook (β=–0.55, P<0.001), put the animal back (β=–0.77, P<0.001), or call a resource professional (β=–0.33, P=0.023). A comparison of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) scores and model log-likelihood values without (AIC=2 858.36; LLV=–1 395.18) and with (AIC=2 232.60; LLV=–1 077.30) the species-specific attitude measure showed that its inclusion improved the model. Conclusions Positive attitudes towards the hellbender and mutualistic wildlife beliefs were related to non-detrimental behavioural intentions. However, attitudes towards the animal were found to be a stronger and more consistent predictor of behavioural intentions than basic wildlife beliefs. Implications Efforts to conserve rare or little-known species should focus outreach strategies on developing positive attitudes towards these species, so as to achieve desired changes in behaviour.";"Perry-Hill, Rebecca

"AGRIS:DJ2012083106";"Cambodian peasant's contribution to rural development: a perspective from Kampong Thom Province";"";"The paper aims to identify the rationality of peasant communities and their contribution to rural development in Kampong Thom province. To do so, an interdisciplinary analytical framework addresses the dynamics of land use and land tenure, the strategies of labor force allocation as well as the determinants of land and labor agricultural productivities amongst peasant communities. It rests on details field surveys in two communes located in very distinct agro-ecological settings of Kampong Thom province. A land use change analysis based on time-series aerial photos is conducted with participatory inventories of natural resources. It shows that endogenous management of forest and fisheries resources generate significant incomes and, at the same time, contribute to maintaining biodiversity. The paper analyses how this contribution is challenged by the non-peasant actors involved in massive State land privatization. Aiming to full employment, peasant households enjoy a great flexibility in the way they allocate labor force, especially in line with the age of active labor and the fluctuation of labor opportunity costs. Principally due to an unequal land holding distribution, agricultural income is unfairly distributed but this inequality is actually balanced by the access to common-pool resources of crucial importance for the poorest and by the recourse to non farming activities, which is an important factor of socio-economic differentiation amongst households. The main economic indicators of rice production confirm that peasant households always try to maximize their income in step with the production factor they have in relatively less amount. A land market simulation stresses that, contrarily to theoretical assumptions, land access through sale (and purchase) does not result in a fairer land distribution. Nevertheless, land leases amongst peasant households seem more promising to ensure equitable access to land as they are embedded in collective security mechanisms activated by peasantry. The paper argues that peasant communities in the studied area constitute a solid basis for rural development as they offer a very good articulation between economic efficiency, social justice and environmental sustainability. Finally, recommendations are formulated to properly address peasant contribution to rural development in the new national agrarian policies.";"Diepart, JC.";"";"Les Presses agronomiques de Gembloux";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"";"rural development;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KHM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012083106";"http://www.pressesagro.be/base/text/v14n2/321.pdf";"";"";"";"321-340"

This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides.

A former drug candidate obtained from Sanofi Pharmaceutical Company (Hungary) was investigated to explore its polymorphism, to distinguish the morphologies generated by analytical examinations and to investigate their relative stabilities. An Avantium Crystal 16 automatic laboratory reactor system was used for the polymorph studies and the studies of their dissolution. Eight polymorphs were obtained by crystallization and transformation methods then characterized by XRPD, DSC, and Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and light microscopy. All the morphologies could be stored in solid without any form transformation for a long time (2 years investigated).

The results showed that a total of 24 plant species seeds were present in the soil seed bank, of which 20 were annuals or biennials. The seed densities in the soil seed bank were in the range of 830 – 13882·5 seeds m⁻² at 10 cm depth. Species richness in the soil seed bank did not increase as the shrubs aged, whereas the seed densities increased significantly. Five annual species: Setaria viridis, Eragrostis pilosa, Chenopodium acuminatum, Chenopodium glaucum and Corispermum acuminatum, contributed above 90 per cent of the seeds to the soil seed bank. On the basis of seed characteristics and seed reduction amount during the growing season, we concluded that it represents a mixture of persistent and transient seeds in different proportions. More seeds accumulated under the canopies than outside the mature shrub cover, but no significant difference was found the younger cover. These results suggest that shrub size and age had an important role in augmenting seed abundance of the soil seed bank but not the species richness. We confirmed the important effects of shrub cover on seed accumulation and vegetation recovery, especially the value of more mature age vegetation for countering land degradation.

"AGRIS:US201500216508";"Feasibility of Inter-Comparing Airborne and Spaceborne Observations of Radar Backscattering Coefficients";"";"This paper investigates the feasibility of using an airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to validate spaceborne SAR data. This is directed at soil moisture sensing and the recently launched soil moisture active passive (SMAP) satellite. The value of this approach is related to the fact that vicarious targets such as rain forests and oceans calibrate only the extrema of backscattering coefficients (σ0) and that the relationship between soil moisture and σ0 is nonlinear. Furthermore, corner reflectors are difficult to deploy to calibrate medium resolution (1–3 km) space- borne sensors such as the one onboard SMAP. A challenge with the approach is the varying incidence angle (θ(inc)) of the airborne sensor versus the constant value used by SMAP. The impact of this on the inter-comparison of airborne and SMAP data is analyzed through simulation and aircraft data analysis. In the absence of the SMAP SAR data, the airborne SAR and scatterometer σ0 from the recent field campaign provided the imaging geometry similar to the spaceborne case. The effect of θinc on the intercomparison using these two airborne data sets was found to be small if the landcover within the footprint is homogeneous and if σ0 (natural unit) changes very little or approximately linearly with θinc . Over heterogeneous pixels consisting of pasture, grass, forest, and growing corn, the simulation shows that the mean and standard deviation of the difference in σ0 between the SAR and scatterometer data are smaller than 0.4 and 0.3 dB, respectively. The test results with the airborne data are generally consistent with the simulation results: the mean and standard deviation of the difference are smaller than 0.9 dB for HH, VV, and HV. These magnitudes are comparable with those of the major sources of the difference: the relative calibration errors of the airborne instruments (<0.3 dB), speckle noise (∼ 0.35 dB), effect of θinc variation within the footprint (<0.4 dB), and geolocation uncertainty in the airborne scatterometer data (<0.5 dB). The findings from this study are expected to apply to the inter-comparison of the SMAP and airborne data after considering the details affecting the comparison: imaging geometry, temporal synchronization, spatial collocation, antenna gain, speckle noise, and spatial resolution. When applied, the inter-comparison will provide more confidence in the calibration of SMAP.";"Kim, Seung-bum

In the issue of researches the exponential relationship between the mol ratio   and the quantity of applied phosphogypsum was obtained with R2=0.8288. The maximum dose of phosphogypsum should consider 20 t per ha. For implement of the proposed concept the device for applying into soil liquid materials during rotary tillage and mixing and decreasing of organic matter losses from soil is designed.

Цель исследований – апробация концепции рекреационной биогеосистемотехники на примере рециклинга фосфогипса в почве с внесением его одновременно с ротационной агромелиоративной обработкой почвы в слое 30-60 см. Методы исследований: стационарный поле-вой, лабораторный, расчетный, а также термодинамический, позволяющий оценить степень устойчивости новой биогеосистемы рециклинга фосфогипса в черноземе. В результате применения предложенной концепции установлено улучшение морфологической структура почвы; более глубокое и равномерное проникновение в почву корневой системы подсолнечника, так, при дозе фосфогипса 20 т/га к уборке культуры в плоскости почвенного разреза площадку 25 см2 пересекали в слое 0-5 см 27 шт., в слое 25-30 см 12 шт., в слое 35-40 см – 15 шт., а также повышение биологической урожайности кукурузы на зерно до 12,44 т/га при НСР05 0,98 т/га, подсолнечника до 5,73 т/га при НСР05 0,47 т/га, озимой пшеницы до 5,44 т/га при НСР05 0,35 т/га. Для замены массового выражения соотношения Ca/Sr предложен переводной коэффициент к молярному отношению. При внесении фосфогипса в почвы Краснодарского края установлено снижение молярного отношения   в почвенном растворе с 382 до 125 (при дозе фосфогипса 40 т/га). В результате исследований получена экспоненциальная зависимость отношения   и количества внесенного фосфогипса при R2 = 0,8288. Предельной дозой мелиоранта следует считать 20 т/га фосфогипса. Для осуществления предложенной концепции разработано устройство, позволяющее вносить жидкие вещества в почву в процессе ротационного рыхления и перемешивания и снизить потери органического вещества.";"Gromyko, E.V., Administration of Krasnodar Territory

"AGRIS:US201500204933";"Spatial controls on dissolved organic carbon in upland waters inferred from a simple statistical model";"";"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in upland surface waters in many northern hemisphere industrialised regions are at their highest in living memory, provoking debate over their “naturalness”. Because of the implications for drinking water treatment and supply there is increasing interest in the potential for mitigation through local land management, and for forecasting the likely impact of environmental change. However, the dominant controls on DOC production remain unresolved, hindering the establishment of appropriate reference levels for specific locations. Here we demonstrate that spatial variation in long-term average DOC levels draining upland UK catchments is highly predictable using a simple multiple logistic regression model comprising variables representing wetland soil cover, rainfall, altitude, catchment sensitivity to acidification and current acid deposition. A negative relationship was observed between DOC concentration and altitude that, for catchments dominated by organo-mineral soils, is plausibly explained by the combined effects of changing net primary production and temperature-dependent decomposition. However, the magnitude of the altitude effect was considerably greater for catchments with a high proportion of wetland cover, suggesting that additional controls influence these sites such as impeded respiratory loss of carbon in wet soils and/or an increased susceptibility to water level drawdown at lower altitudes. The model suggests (1) that continuing reductions in sulphur deposition on acid sensitive organo-mineral soils, will drive further significant increases in DOC and, (2) given the differences in the magnitude of the observed altitude-DOC relationships, that DOC production from catchments with peat-dominated soils may be more sensitive to climate change than those dominated by mineral soils. However, given that mechanisms remain unclear, the latter warrants further investigation.";"Monteith, Donald T.

After single soil-meliorative rotor-milling plowing the processed soil layer consists of small units homogeneous for the size. There are no morphological signs of a solonetz pedogenesis restoration. The moisture of an atmospheric precipitation freely penetrates into the soil and easily distributes in artificial dispersed system. Readily soluble salts leach off to depth, sufficient for reducing of their influence on soil genesis. In 30 years after soil-meliorative rotor-milling tillage by ploughs PMS-70, FS-1.3 the quantity of a humus in a soil layer of 20-40 sm reaches 3.3%, in a layer of 20-40 sm – 2.4%, the quantity of absorbed Na+ in a layer of 20-30 sm decreases for 1.5-2.0 times in comparison with initial and makes 10.6% from soil cation exchange capacity. The increase of agricultural crops productivity makes up more than 25-60% from the level of standard agricultural technology during the whole observation period. The new biogeosystem functions so that the period of its return to the regionally caused condition is extended; stability of the new biogeosystem is high. On the basis of soil science, sedimentology, lithology, by methods of recrea-tional biogeosystem techniques, the prospect of innovative technical decisions of rotor-milling soil-meliorative tools for correct transformation of a soil continuum from positions of the theory of dis-persed systems, obtaining of stable economic indicators and social effect are shown.

Изучено изменение почвы при управлении ее дисперсной системой посредством трехъярусной и роторно-фрезерной обработки. После однократной почвенно-мелиоративной ротационно-фрезерной обработки почва в обработанном слое состоит из мелких однородных по размеру агрегатов. Отсутствуют морфологические признаки восстановления солонцового педогенеза. Влага атмосферных осадков свободно поступает в почву и беспрепятственно рассредоточивается в искусственной дисперсной системе. Легкорастворимые соли опускаются на глубину, достаточную для ослабления их влияния на генезис почвы. Через 30 лет после почвенно-мелиоративной ротационно-фрезерной обработки плугами ПМС-70, ФС-1,3 количество гумуса в слое 20-40 см достигает 3,3%, в слое 20-40 см – 2,4%, количество поглощенного Na+ в слое 20-30 см снижается в 1,5-2 раза по сравнению с исходным и составляет 10,6% от емкости катионного обмена почвы. Прибавка урожайности сельскохозяйственных культур составляет 25-60% и более от уровня стандартной технологии земледелия в течение всего периода наблюдений. Функционирование новой биогеосистемы протекает так, что период ее возврата в регионально обусловленное состояние удлиняется. Устойчивость биогеосистемы высокая. На основе фундаментальных представлений почвоведения, седиментологии, литологии методами рекреационной биогеосистемотехники показана перспектива инновационных технических решений роторно-фрезерных почвенно-мелиоративных орудий для корректного преобразования почвенного континуума с позиций теории дисперсных систем, получения стабильных экономических показателей и социального эффекта.";"Sharshak, V.K.

However, our understanding of such dynamics today is often limited by the availability of reliable and detailed land-cover information in the past, before the onset of remote sensing technologies. In this study, we carefully extracted information from historical maps of the Caldenal savannas of central Argentina in the 1880s to generate a woody cover map that we compared to a 2000s dataset. Over about the last 120 years, woody cover increased across approximately 12,200 km²(14.2% of the area). During the same period, about 5,000 km²of the original woody area was converted to croplands and around 7,000 km²to pastures, about the same total land area as was affected by encroachment. A smaller area, fine-scale analysis between the 1960s and the 2000s revealed that tree cover increased overall by 27%, shifting from open savannas to a mosaic of dense woodlands along with additional agricultural clearings. Statistical models indicate that woody cover dynamics in this region were affected by a combination of environmental and human factors. Over about the last 120 years, increases in woody plant cover have stored significant amounts of C (95.9 TgC), but not enough to compensate for losses from conversions to croplands and pastures (166.7 TgC), generating a regional net loss of 70.9 TgC. C losses could be even larger in the future if, as predicted, energy crops such as switchgrass, would trigger a new land-cover change phase in this region.";"González-Roglich, Mariano

Landscape-scale variability in soil organic carbon storage in the central Canadian Arctic. Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 477â488. Arctic soils constitute a vast, but poorly quantified, pool of soil organic carbon (SOC). The uncertainty associated with pan-Arctic SOC storage estimates â a result of limited SOC and land cover data â needs to be reduced if we are to better predict the impact of future changes to Arctic carbon stocks resulting from climate warming. In this study landscape-scale variability in SOC at a Southern Arctic Ecozone site in the central Canadian Arctic was investigated with the ultimate goal of up-scaling SOC estimates with a land cover classification system. Total SOC was estimated to depths of 30 cm and 50 cm for 76 soil pits, together representing eight different vegetation communities in seven different broad landscape units. Soil organic carbon to 50 cm was lowest for the xerophytic herb community in the esker complex landscape unit (7.2Â±2.2 SD kg mâ»Â²) and highest in the birch hummock terrain in the lowland tundra landscape unit (36.4Â±2.8 kg mâ»Â²), followed by wet sedge and dry sedge communities in the wetland complex (29.8Â±9.9 and 22.0Â±2.0 kg mâ»Â², respectively). The up-scaled estimates of mean SOC for the study area (excluding water) were 15.8 kg mâ»Â² (to 50 cm) and 11.6 kg mâ»Â² (to 30 cm). On a landscape scale, soil moisture content was found to have an important influence on SOC variability. Overall, this study highlights the importance of SOC variability at fine scales and its impact on up-scaling SOC in Arctic landscapes.";"Campeau, A. Brett

"AGRIS:US201600180852";"Private reserves in Brazil: Distribution patterns, logistical challenges, and conservation contributions";"";"Traditional strategies to stem declines in biodiversity include the establishment of public protected area networks. However, private lands are an increasingly important component of contemporary reserve networks. Despite the increasing recognition of the value of private lands for conservation little is known about these areas. Consequently, this study aimed to re-evaluate the changes in private reserves in Brazil since 2005. Brazilâs private reserve system is represented by 1182 reserves, recognized under federal law and created to protect nature in perpetuity. These reserves protect 7502km2 of land and are distributed across seven terrestrial biomes. This is an overall increase of 35% in the number of reserves (n=753) and 3265km2 of protected land (<0.05% of Brazilian terrestrial extent) since 2005. Forty-eight percent of the reserves (n=572) are each smaller than 0.5km2. While 749 (67%) of all private reserves (n=1,182) are located in the Atlantic Forest biome, 38% of the overall area protected under the private reserve system is in the Pantanal biome, which has only 10 reserves. For landowners, the establishment of these reserves is a costly and bureaucratic process. Few economic incentives to establish reserves are available and comprise mostly tax breaks and funding from NGOs to assist with the establishment and management activities. The private reserve network provides valuable contributions to watershed and species conservation in Brazil, despite their limited size and challenges to create and manage these areas. Greater funding opportunities to landowners can be a catalyst for the establishment of reserves beyond the Atlantic Forest biome.";"Pegas, Fernanda de Vasconcellos

B.P.) to Middle Holocene (6900–4800� cal. B.P.) periods. The Early Holocene environment, regulated by a stronger Southwest Asian monsoon, was moister than the present, providing a marshy winter grazing area for cattle herders, whose construction of hearths and food preparation strategies changed over time. This study provides an insight into long term stability of land cover and use as well as the dynamics of human contributions to landscape change. We suggest that complex environmental and cultural processes affect species availability, fuel choice and land use management. Despite environmental and economic changes in Wadi Sana, our dataset does not show changes in fuel choice from the Early to Middle Holocene.";"Kimiaie, Masoumeh

"AGRIS:US201500092525";"Mapping hotspots of malaria transmission from pre-existing hydrology, geology and geomorphology data in the pre-elimination context of Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania";"";"BACKGROUND: Larval source management strategies can play an important role in malaria elimination programmes, especially for tackling outdoor biting species and for eliminating parasite and vector populations when they are most vulnerable during the dry season. Effective larval source management requires tools for identifying geographic foci of vector proliferation and malaria transmission where these efforts may be concentrated. Previous studies have relied on surface topographic wetness to indicate hydrological potential for vector breeding sites, but this is unsuitable for karst (limestone) landscapes such as Zanzibar where water flow, especially in the dry season, is subterranean and not controlled by surface topography. METHODS: We examine the relationship between dry and wet season spatial patterns of diagnostic positivity rates of malaria infection amongst patients reporting to health facilities on Unguja, Zanzibar, with the physical geography of the island, including land cover, elevation, slope angle, hydrology, geology and geomorphology in order to identify transmission hot spots using Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) analysis. RESULTS: The distribution of both wet and dry season malaria infection rates can be predicted using freely available static data, such as elevation and geology. Specifically, high infection rates in the central and southeast regions of the island coincide with outcrops of hard dense limestone which cause locally elevated water tables and the location of dolines (shallow depressions plugged with fine-grained material promoting the persistence of shallow water bodies). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides a tractable tool for the identification of malaria hotspots which incorporates subterranean hydrology, which can be used to target larval source management strategies.";"Hardy, Andrew

This paper argues that the effectiveness of MBIs (and the likelihood therefore of sustained environmental and social outcomes) depends on a number of often unacknowledged assumptions about the distribution of benefits arising from ecosystem service provision, the rights and duties associated with resource access, and the fitness for purpose of various policy instruments. These assumptions are illustrated and discussed using The Benefit Flows and Property Rights Matrix. It is argued that the legitimacy of MBIs depends both on the demonstrability of distinct public benefit and of acceptance among the wider community that private resource users ought to be compensated in some way for the provision of that benefit. Effective provision of ecosystem services through a market-mechanism thereafter depends on a range of additional conditions including inter-changeability of supply, scalability, lack of corroboration, adequate information, financial capacity, clarity of property rights, clarity of resource access-related duties and institutional capacity. Meeting these conditions is not simply a matter of appropriate incentive design but of political decision-making, moral judgement and social learning. Failure to recognise these conditions potentially undermines the effectiveness not only of MBIs but of alternative policy measures taken contemporaneously with MBIs such as community-based natural resource management.";"Lockie, Stewart";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217457";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2011.08.010";"";"";"";"90-98"

Satellite image analysis, supported by semi-structured interviews with farmers and representatives of key institutions, shows that deforestation for commercial agriculture in Santa Cruz continues and has increased in certain “hotspots”. Previous research has shown that the environmental effects of neoliberalism on forest cover are varied, but more broadly, reduced state intervention has meant less environmental regulation and greater deforestation, while strong government is better able to curtail deforestation. Although neoliberal policies triggered an unprecedented level of forest clearing in Bolivia, rates have generally continued to increase and can be indirectly linked to the administration's new agrarian reform and pro-environmental regulations. This trend is counterintuitive and stems from unanticipated responses such as deforestation through fire to prove productive use under the reform's socio-economic function requirements. Given increased regulation and enforcement of forest clearing and burning under Morales, in contrast to the neoliberal era, our analyses suggest that rates will continue to increase under the current political climate, which has further polarized the opposition in Santa Cruz.";"Redo, Daniel

Impact on irrigated agricultural production and profitability are estimatedwith a mathematical programming model using a two-stage approach that simultaneouslyestimates short and long-run adjustments. The model accounts for a range of adaptiveresponses including: deficit irrigation, temporarily fallowing some areas, and permanentlyreducing irrigated area and changing the mix of crops.The results suggest that relatively low cost adaptation strategies are available for moderatereduction in water availability and thus costs of such reduction are likely to be relativelysmall.

"AGRIS:US2016202601";"CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON US AGRICULTURE";"";"There is general consensus in the scientific literature that human-induced climate change has taken place and will continue to do so over the next century. The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes with “very high confidence” that anthropogenic activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation have affected the global climate. The AR4 also indicates that global average temperatures are expected to increase by another 1.1°C to 5.4°C by 2100, depending on the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases that takes place during this time. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, temperature increases, altered precipitation patterns and other factors influenced by climate have already begun to impact U.S. agriculture. Climate change will continue to have significant effects on U.S. agriculture, water resources, land resources, and biodiversity in the future as temperature extremes begin exceeding thresholds that harm crop growth more frequently and precipitation and runoff patterns continue to change. In this study, we provide an assessment of the potential long-term implications of climate change on landowner decisions regarding land use, crop mix, and production practices in the U.S., combining a crop process model (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model) and an economic model of the U.S. forestry and agricultural sector (Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model). Agricultural producers have always faced numerous production and price risks, but forecasts of more rapid changes in climatic conditions in the future have raised concerns that these risks will increase in the future relative to historical conditions.";"Beach, Robert H.

Our objectives were to gain understanding of this protected germplasm by utilizing pedigree information available in the U.S. Patent and PVPA records to enhance the use of this germplasm in new line development as the lines become publicly available. Ownership, derivation, and lineage of corn inbred lines protected by U.S. Patent or PVPA from 1980 to 2004 were surveyed. Thirty-three companies have protected 908 corn inbred lines and four of these companies: Dekalb Genetics (DK), Holden's Foundation Seeds (LH), Pioneer Hi-Bred (PH), and Syngenta (SG) originated 685 of them. We identified the most significant lines by their cumulative use as parents in the development of new lines. Much of today's germplasm originates from seven progenitor lines: B73, LH82, LH123, PH207, PH595, PHG39, and Mo17. The germplasm surveyed is grouped by pedigree lineage into Oh43, Lancaster, Oh07-Midland, Iodent, Stiff Stalk, Commercial hybrid derived, and Argentine Maiz Amargo backgrounds, with new diversity emerging from the two latter groups. Recycling elite inbred lines using two-parent crosses followed by pedigree breeding was the most prevalent method of new line development.";"Mikel, M.A.

Biological methods of control have been instituted, but many information gaps remain. An investment model approach is used to demonstrate some of the potentially key pieces of biological data that are required for an analysis. This model is applied to the control of leafy spurge on rangeland. The results of control are very dependent on the rate of spread and control by the biological control agent, the initial density of the weed, and the recovery of the forage (grass) after the weed has been controlled. Benefits of control are relatively low, as is the cost of the biological control practice. It takes several years before net benefits of the control practice are positive.";"Smith, Elwin G.

"AGRIS:US2012209746";"Land Inequality and Economic Growth: A Dynamic Panel Data Approach";"";"The growing body of literature devoted to study the impact of inequality on economic growth have centred its attention in the income distribution effect, even though the theoretical relationships are more related to assets distributions than to income distribution. While some recent studies have tried to overcome this limitation by introducing indicators of this type, they found a new constraint when dealing only with time-invariant measurements for this explanatory variable. This article provides a theoretical discussion and some novel empirical tests to better understand the relationships between assets distribution and economic growth. We assembled a new panel database that includes observations for more than 30 countries over the last three decades. The data include a time-varying variable for changes in the Land Gini index over this period that enables to overcome the limitations of previous studies that only included time-invariant measurement. A system GMM estimator is used to generate truly unbiased and consistent regression estimates. We explore some of the likely channels through which asset distribution and economic growth may be linked, paying particular attention to the role of secure property rights and the relations between land ownership and education. We find robust and significant negative signs for land inequality in the growth regressions, indicating that changes in asset distribution are an important factor for economic development.";"Fort, Ricardo

"AGRIS:US2012209740";"Bargaining on Ecological Main Structures for Natural Pest Control: Modelling Land Use Regulations as Common Property Management";"";"In this paper we argue that the loss of bio-diversity hould be of concern for farmers, though it seems to be of little or no concern to them at the moment. As diversity is a component of nature that controls the growth of pests, a loss of bio-diversity means increased exposure to pests, danger of crop failures and, in the long run, lower average yields and profits. So far farmers buy costly pesticides for compensating the reduction of bio-diversity. We argue that institutional problems are the reason why farmers are not concerned with bio-diversity, and show that under pure private property rights farmers have interest in pesticides and not in bio-diversity as a measure of crop protect because they have perhaps to devote land to the natural eco-system. In contrast, public policy which is assumed to make bio-diversity improvements, and this policy may pay off. Note, the prerequisite for improved in biodiversity through the establishment of an ecological main structure (EMS), may reveres this trend. We show that joint efforts in a community of farmers can result in building up an adequate size of nature elements in landscapes (an EMS) for maintaining the bio-diversity. These nature elements shall allow, in parts, a more sustainable performance of pest control than chemical control. The public control instrument is the EMS size. For this, in the paper, we extend the institution economics model of Rausser and Zusman (1992) on productive governments to bio-diversity.";"Nuppenau, Ernst-August";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012209740";"http://purl.umn.edu/25600";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400105812";"Gravel, Soil Organic Matter, and Texture in Fallowed Alfisols, Entisols and Ultisols: Implications for Root and Tuber Crops";"";"Southwestern Nigeria is replete with soils that have high gravel contents within the subsoils. Most of these soils are being opened up for cultivation as other land uses (roads and housing) are competing for agricultural lands. It is imperative that these soils be properly studied and managed to prevent serious land degradation, which may over the long term militate against food production in most rural communities. Thus, the objectives of these investigations were to assess the soil profile gravel contents, texture, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), and SOM/silt + clay (or SSC ratio) of these soils; assess which of these pedons will be susceptible to degradation using the SSC ratio; and evaluate the relationship that exists, if any, among the aforementioned variables. A semidetailed survey was conducted on 810 ha of land (7° 40′ N and 7° 45′N; 4° 25′ E and 4° 30′ E) located in the rain forest (RF) agroecological zone (AEZ) of southwestern Nigeria. Eighteen soil types/pedons were identified. Subsequently, profile pits (1.50 m) were dug, and soil samples were collected, bagged, labeled, and air dried. These samples were used to determine the proportion of gravel (>2 mm) in the soil, and the <2-mm fraction was used for the determination of particle-size distribution, organic carbon contents (SOC), and CEC. The SOM was determined by multiplying the SOC by a factor of 1.729. The ratio (or SSC) was calculated as total SOM (g kg⁻¹) divided by clay + silt (g kg⁻¹) and multiplied by 100. Results showed that the soil separates (sand, silt, and clay), gravel contents, SOM, and the SSC ratio have high coefficient of variations (CV), which suggests that these soils are highly variable. The gravel contents in the subsoils increased with depth and were generally ≥126 g kg⁻¹, except in pedons AP (Typic UstiPsamments/Ferric Arenosols), PEA (Typic Kanhaplustalf/Ferric Lixisol), BA (Gleyic Lixisol/Udic Kanhaplustalf), GEA (Typic Kanhaplustalf/Ferric Lixisol), and JGB (Tropaquent/Dystric Fluvisol), which had gravel contents of ≤54g kg⁻¹. The SSC ratio ranged between 1.33 (IB,Typic Kanhapludalf) and 14.4 (PEA, Typic Kanhaplustalf) and of all these 18 pedons, only 3 out of 18 (or 16.67%) had an SSC ratio of ≤5 and such may be at the risk of being degraded when opened for cultivation. The correlation coefficients among texture, CEC, SSC ratio, SOM/clay, and gravel contents revealed significantly negative relationships.";"Olaleye, A. O.

This relationship is reflected mainly in two aspects. Firstly, land circulation is a necessary requirement for the development of modern agriculture, which can speed up the adjustment of agricultural structure and realize the scale management, accelerate the transfer of the rural population and improve the agricultural income, enhance the risk resisting ability of agriculture and the response of agriculture to market challenges. Secondly, development of modern agriculture must be based on land circulation. Land circulation can not only provide resource allocation basis for modern agriculture, but also offer economic benefit basis for modern agriculture. 2007 China Statistical Yearbook, agricultural product output (Y), agricultural employees (L) and other relevant data in 19 provinces are obtained. CES production function is used to reflect the agricultural employees (L), agricultural capital investment (K) and agricultural product output (Y), in order to calculate the agricultural production function. Result shows that contribution of labor force to output is negative, while the contribution of capita to output is positive. Meanwhile, the substitution elasticity of capital for labor is 1.11, indicating that every 1% increase of labor force will lead to the 1.11% enhancement of farmers’ capital.";"Wu, Zhe

Land cover of individual catchments was principally sand dunes and scrub, plantation forest, pasture, or a mixture of plantation forest and pasture. Sampling was concentrated in the sedge beds, submerged macrophytes and surface sediment layers of the littoral zone. Sixty-eight invertebrate taxa were recorded, 11–30 per lake. Relative abundance of major faunal groups differed considerably among lakes but a core group of common species was found in three quarters of them. Neither community composition, nor various measures of species richness were related significantly to catchment land cover classes. A feature of the lake fauna was the occurrence of three introduced species of Gastropoda and eight self-introduced insect species, including five dragonflies.

We measured five ecological heterogeneity indices (EHI) and we used a database of six biological groups (woody plants, orchids, orthopterans, aquatic and terrestrial herpetofauna and passerine birds) across 30 sites in a Mediterranean reserve (Greece). We found that all the five EHI were significantly related to the overall species richness and to the species richness of woody plants and birds. Two indices, measuring vertical vegetation complexity (1/D) and horizontal heterogeneity of landcover types (SIDI) in terms of Simpson's index, predicted well overall species richness and had significantly higher values inside the complementary reserve networks designed after five of the six biological groups. We compared five methods of forming reserve networks. The method of ecological heterogeneity (selecting those sites with the greatest 1/D and then SIDI) was less efficient (non-significantly) than the species-based methods (scoring and complementary networks) but significantly more efficient than the random method (randomly selected network). We also found that the method of complementary ecological heterogeneity (selecting those sites where each EHI had its maximum value) was not that efficient, as it did not differ significantly from the random method. These results underline the potential of the ecological heterogeneity method as an alternative tool in reserve design.";"Kati, Vassiliki

A seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) approach was used to assess the supply of sawtimber, pulpwood, woody bioenergy and demand for labor. Data was gathered from official statistical reports of the forestry sector in Florida spanning 1970 to 2006. The econometric analysis suggested that consistent own price elasticities could be obtained from the SUR approach. The results indicated that an increased price of woody bioenergy implied an increase in the production of pulpwood and demand for labor. Results also suggested that forest landowners might financially benefit from emerging bioenergy markets.";"Susaeta, Andres

The NRCS and conservation partners provided financial and technical assistance to landowners and managers of sites enrolled in various conservation easement programs, and incorporated approximately 190,000 ha of wetlands and agricultural lands in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) and Gulf Coast regions in the MBHI. In fall 2010, the NRCS worked with scientists and graduate students from three universities and various conservation agencies to design and implement landscape-scale evaluations of (1) the use of MBHI-managed wetlands and comparable non-MBHI wetlands by Charadriiformes (shorebirds), Anseriformes (waterfowl), and other waterbirds; and (2) the relative effectiveness of different MBHI practices for providing habitat and food resources for migrating, resident, and wintering waterbirds. In this paper, we describe the scientific framework designed to evaluate the MBHI in improving waterbird habitats on private lands in the MAV, the Gulf Coast Prairies in Louisiana and Texas, and Gulf coastal wetlands of Mississippi and Alabama. The results of our evaluation will enhance our understanding of the influence of MBHI, other Farm Bill Conservation Initiative managed lands (e.g., Wetland Reserve Program), and selected agricultural working lands (e.g., Oryza sativa L. [Rice] fields in southern Louisiana and Texas) on wintering and migrating waterbirds. A proactive approach that uses science to evaluate governmental conservation programs is relevant and can inform development of meaningful public policy that likely will be needed for effective delivery of future conservation programs and to justify financial incentives paid to landowners to apply best management practices.";"Davis, J.

Shut down temporarily during World War II, the Fernow was reopened in 1948 as an outdoor laboratory and classroom with the purpose of conducting research that would be useful to the forest landowners and managers throughout the Central Appalachians. Early research focused on the silvicultural management of high-value hardwoods and the effects of various forest management schemes on water quantity and quality. Over time, additional research projects in wildlife, soil science, ecology, air quality, and other environmental topics were included. Today, the Fernow is involved in long-term silvicultural and hydrological research, as well as shorter-term, more topical research projects on the effects of air pollution on wilderness areas, developing management guidelines for threatened and endangered wildlife species, the uses of prescribed fire for managing hardwood stands, and the restoration of the Red Spruceânorthern hardwood ecosystem.

"AGRIS:LV2016000476";"Making the most of our land: meeting supply and demand of soil functions across spatial scales";"";"The challenges of achieving both food security and sustainability have resulted in a confluence of demands on land within the European Union: we expect our land to provide food, purify water, sequester carbon, and provide a home to biodiversity and to external nutrients. All soils perform all these five functions, but some soils ‘are better at’ supplying selective functions. Functional Land Management is a framework for policy making aimed at meeting these demands by incentivising soil management and land use practices that selectively augment specific soil functions, where required. In this paper, we explore how the demands for contrasting soil functions, as framed by EU policies, may apply to very different spatial scales, from farm scale to national scale. At the same time, we show that the supply of each soil function is largely defined by local soil and land use conditions, with large variations at both local and regional level. We demonstrate that this has implications for soil management. While some soil functions must be managed at local (i.e. farm) level, others may be offset between regions with a view to solely meeting national targets. We review the policy instruments available to address the challenge of maximising the delivery of soil functions across these spatial scales, and bring these instruments together in a coherent policy framework.";"Schulte, R., Teagasc, Johnstown Castle, Wexford (Ireland).

This study focused on understanding how land management and climate change have together influenced terrestrial N storage and watershed inorganic N export across boreal and subâarctic landscapes in northern Sweden. Using longâterm discharge and nutrient concentration data that have been collected continuously for over three decades, we calculated the hydrologic inorganic N export from nine watersheds in this region. We found a consistent decline in inorganic N export from 1985 to 2011 over the entire region from both small and large watersheds, despite the absence of any longâterm trend in river discharge during this period. The steepest declines in inorganic N export were observed during the growing season, consistent with the hypothesis that observed changes are biologically mediated and are not the result of changes in longâterm hydrology. Concurrent with the decrease in inorganic N export, we report sustained increases in terrestrial N accumulation in forest biomass and soils across northern Sweden. Given the close communication of nutrient and energy stores between plants, soils, and waters, our results indicate a regional tightening of the N cycle in an already Nâlimited environment as a result of changes in forest management and climateâmediated growth increases. Our results are consistent with declining inorganic N efflux previously reported from small headwater streams in other ecosystems and shed new light on the mechanisms controlling these patterns by identifying corresponding shifts in the terrestrial N balance, which have been altered by a combination of management activities and climate change.";"Lucas, Richard W.

As a result, largescaleabandonment of agriculture is likely in lowyieldgrassland areas and consequences forlandscape appearance might be dramatic. In highyieldgrassland areas, agriculture is much morestable. However, under very disadvantageousconditions the extent of farms giving-up productionis as high as in marginal grassland regions.Nevertheless one cannot expect large-scale set aside,because remaining farmers use the possibility ofgrowth and lease a considerable quantity of land Incontrast to this, farm structure in the arable regionsis stable due to a high potential of productionalternatives.

While 50.3% of all Latvian forests are state-owned and the remaining 49.7% are under different ownership, historically this structure has changed with the political situation and the authorities. The changes in forest property rights were examined from the beginning of the 20th century up to modern times, identifying three distinct periods The main conclusions were that, looking from the standpoint of economic performance, the period between the beginning of the 20th century and 1940 was characterized by an ill-conceived transformation of forests into farmland. In 1989, the notion that rural households are an economically independent form of farming became established. The year 2000 marked the final large transformation, as the state functions in forestry were delegated to the Joint Stock Company ''Latvijas valsts mezi'', which now contributes significantly to the state and local budgets.";"Zalite, Z., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia).

"AGRIS:US201500014309";"Soil quality evaluation under different land management practices";"";"Sustainable agricultural production requires prudent management backed by reliable information that accurately elucidates the complex relationships between land management practices and soil quality trends. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of management on soil properties acquired at different depths, and yields, at five different field sites within Ohio, USA. The principal management systems considered were no till with or without manure and cover crops, natural vegetation (NV) or forest, and conventional tillage (CT) defined as farms with surface residue cover (<30 %). Analyses of variance (ANOVA), correlation analyses, stepwise regression, and the principal component analyses (PCA) were used to elucidate and model the link between four different management practices and the soil physical and chemical properties. The ANOVA results indicate that the available water capacity and electrical conductivity (EC) were the major variables affected by management. In contrast, soil pH, bulk density (ρ b), porosity, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN), were invariable with management, yet only pH and EC did not significantly vary with the interaction of soil type and management effects. In comparison, the PCA results suggest that SOC, TN, porosity, ρ b, and EC were the major determining factors controlling yield variability. Interestingly, the derived models revealed that the highest yields, notably 10 and 2.7 Mg ha⁻¹ for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) occurred in soils under CT management. Quantifying the nexus between soil properties and management choices as demonstrated in this study, can provide critical insight for sustainable agricultural production.";"de Paul Obade, Vincent

Australia had only about 130,000 commercial farms in 2005, so average farm size is high.Australia's agriculture is market driven and export-oriented. For some products, aggregations for values of production and for export values are not directly comparable because export values reflect the value of more highly processed products such as sugar and wine. Overall, about 65% of agricultural production is exported, representing about 25% of total merchandise exports. The processed agrifood products share of total merchandise exports has doubled since 1986-88.Between 1986-88 and 2002-04, the support to producers in Australia decreased from 8% to 4% of the total value of agricultural production.

"AGRIS:US2012203263";"A Modelling Framework for Addressing the Synergies between Global Conventions through Land Use Changes: Carbon Sequestration, Biodiversity Conservation, Prevention of Land Degradation and Food Security in Agricultural and Forested Lands in Developing Countries";"";"This paper proposed a methodological framework for the assessment of carbon stocks and the development and identification of land use, land use change and land management scenarios, whereby enhancing carbon sequestration synergistically increases biodiversity, the prevention of land degradation and food security through the increases in crop yields. The framework integrates satellite image interpretation, computer modelling tools (i.e. software customization of off-the-shelf soil organic matter turnover simulation models) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The framework addresses directly and indirectly the cross-cutting ecological concerns foci of major global conventions: climate change, biodiversity, the combat of desertification and food security. Their synergies are targeted by providing procedures for assessing and identifying simultaneously carbon sinks, potential increases in plant diversity, measures to prevent land degradation and enhancements in food security through crop yields, implicit in each land use change and land management scenario. The scenarios aim at providing win-win options to decision makers through the frameworks decision support tools. Issues concerning complex model parameterization and spatial representation were tackled through tight coupling soil carbon models to GIS via software customization. Results of applying the framework in the field in two developing countries indicate that reasonably accurate estimates of carbon sequestration can be obtained through modeling; and that alternative best soil organic matter management practices that arrest shifting slash-and-burn cultivation and prevent burning and emissions, can be identified. Such options also result in increased crop yields and food security for an average family size in the area, while enhancing biodiversity and preventing land degradation. These options demonstrate that the judicious management of organic matter is central to greenhouse gas mitigation and the attainment of synergistic ecological benefits, which is the concern of global conventions. The framework is to be further developed through successive approximations and refinement in future, extending its applicability to other landscapes.";"Ponce-Hernandez, Raul";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012203263";"http://purl.umn.edu/9318";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500202186";"use of diffuse reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy for the prediction of the concentration of chemical elements estimated by X-ray fluorescence in agricultural and grazing European soils";"";"The aim of this study was to develop partial least-squares (PLS) regression models using diffuse reflectance Fourier transform mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for the prediction of the concentration of elements in soil determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). A total of 4130 soils from the GEMAS European soil sampling program (geochemical mapping of agricultural soils and grazing land of Europe) were used for the development of models to predict concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Hf, K, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sc, Si, Sr, Th, Ti, V, Y, Zn and Zr in soil using MIR spectroscopy. The results were compared with those obtained where MIR models were developed with the same soils but using the concentration of elements extracted with aqua regia (AR). The PLS models were cross-validated against the experimental log-transformed XRF values of all the elements. The calibration models were derived from a set of 1000 randomly selected calibration samples. The rest of the samples (3130) were used as an independent validation set. According to the residual predictive deviation (RPD), predictions were classified as follows: “Good quality”, Ca (2.9), Mg (2.5), Al (2.3), Fe (2.2), Ga (2.2), Si (2.1), Na (2.0); “Indicator quality”, V (1.9), Ni (1.9), Sc (1.9), K (1.8), Ti (1.8), Rb (1.8), Zn (1.7), Co (1.7), Zr (1.6), Cr (1.6), Sr (1.6), Y (1.6), Nb (1.6), Ba (1.5), Mn (1.5), As (1.5), Ce (1.5); “Poor quality”, Cs (1.4), Th (1.4), P (1.4), Cu (1.4), Pb (1.3), La (1.2), Hf (1.1). Good agreement was observed between the RPD values obtained for the elements analysed in this study and those from the AR study. Despite the different elemental concentrations determined by the XRF method compared to the AR method, MIR spectroscopy was still capable of predicting elemental concentrations.";"Soriano-Disla, J.M.

We classified watershed conditions at 3 hierarchical spatial scales, following a house–neighborhood–community approach, where houses (stream segments) are embedded within neighborhoods (Hydrologic Unit Code [HUC]-12 watersheds) embedded within communities (HUC-10 watersheds). We used this information to develop a framework to prioritize restoration and protection in two HUC-8 watersheds in an intensively mined region of the central Appalachians. We used landscape data to predict current conditions (water chemistry and macroinvertebrate biotic integrity) for all stream segments with boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis. Mining intensity, distance to mining, and coal type were the dominant predictors of water quality and biological integrity. A hardness–salinity dimension of the water-chemistry data was explained by land-cover features and stream elevation. We compiled segment-level conditions to the HUC-12 and HUC-10 watershed scales to represent aquatic resource conditions hierarchically across 3 watershed-management scales. This process enabled us to relate stream-segment watershed conditions to watershed conditions in the broader context, and ultimately to identify key protection and restoration priorities in a metacommunity context. Our hierarchical classification system explicitly identifies stream restoration and protection priorities within a HUC-12 watershed context, which ensures that the benefits of restoration will extend beyond the stream reach. Highest protection priorities are high-quality HUC-12 watersheds adjacent to low-quality HUC-12 watersheds. Highest restoration priorities are HUC-12 watersheds in poor–fair condition within HUC-10 watersheds of good–excellent condition, whereas lowest restoration priorities are isolated HUC-12 watersheds. In high-priority HUC-12 watersheds, stream segments with the highest restoration priority are those that maximize watershed-scale restorability. A similar process for classifying conditions and restoration priorities may be valuable in other heavily impacted regions where strategic approaches are needed to maximize watershed-scale recovery.";"Merovich, George T.

We raised the hypothesis that livestock pressure is a key-factor in the mortality of tree seedlings and that facilitation processes among plants may enhance tree regeneration. We tested whether the tussock grass Panicum turgidum could facilitate the regeneration of a keystone tree species, Acacia tortilis var. raddiana, under a grazing regime. We transplanted 3-month-old seedlings of Acacia to plots representing different neighbourhood conditions (in areas without vegetation, amongst intact tussocks, among cropped tussocks, and under branches), which were either fenced or exposed to grazing by large herbivores. Survival and height of 160 transplants were recorded during one year. Acacia performance was much lower in the grazed plots, indicating that large herbivores had a strong negative impact on tree regeneration. Presence of Panicum tussocks had a positive effect on the height of seedlings, likely because they improved soil properties and water availability. No aboveground positive effect on Acacia was detected though the grass did reduce atmospheric aridity. We detected an indirect positive effect of Panicum on Acacia survival in the presence of herbivores when aridity and grazing pressure reached their maximum levels. We obtained evidence that indirect facilitation may occur in arid grazed areas, although it has been predicted to mainly exist in mesic competitive environments. Additionally, our results support the stress-gradient hypothesis against assumptions that competitive effects may dominate in extremely arid environments. Since most of the positive effect on Acacia survival is indirect (biotic grazing refuge) due to the presence of herbivores, transplantation of tree seedlings amongst Panicum may be a simple and low-cost technique for the restoration of Saharan ecosystems degraded by herbivore grazing.";"Anthelme, Fabien

"AGRIS:US201301858483";"Does the strength of facilitation by nurse shrubs depend on grazing resistance of tree saplings";"";"Facilitation of tree regeneration by nurse shrubs that offer protection against large herbivores is an important driver of wood-pasture dynamics. Here we asked whether the response to facilitation by nurse shrubs depends on the grazing resistance of the protégé saplings. We experimentally tested the protective effects of the thorny Rosa rubiginosa on browsing frequency, survival, and biomass change of saplings of two species-groups, presumably differing in grazing resistance: the coniferous Abies alba and Picea abies and the deciduous Acer pseudoplatanus and Fagus sylvatica saplings. The saplings were planted under and outside (1.5 m) planted nurse shrubs, under zero, low and high grazing intensity. In total, 1920 young saplings were transplanted to 60 blocks and followed for 1 year. Although the number of saplings browsed did not differ between species-groups, the coniferous saplings showed lower resistance to cattle browsing (i.e. lower survival and growth rates) than the deciduous saplings. The less resistant coniferous saplings benefited significantly more from nurse shrubs than the more resistant deciduous species in terms of growth of the surviving saplings, but not in terms of overall survival. This was likely due to herbivory on the nurse shrubs causing incidental browsing on protégé saplings and differences in biomass off-take. At high grazing intensity facilitative effects of the nurse shrubs decreased, especially for the coniferous species. These results have important management implications for the endangered wood-pastures in Western Europe. For a sustainable management and conservation that allows tree recruitment, grazing intensity should remain low to best promote facilitation processes for all tree species, but in particular for the less resistant conifer saplings.";"Vandenberghe, Charlotte

A long-term exclusion experiment was established in 2000 in the subalpine, the lower, and the upper alpine zone. With exception of the subalpine zone, domestic herbivores have been grazing during the whole growing season. In grazed and exclosure plots species frequencies were recorded for 7 years. We analysed exclosure effects on species number, community composition, life forms, and functional groups. Species richness did not decrease significantly within the exclosures, but changes in species composition occurred in each zone, although some were transitory in nature. The dynamic trends of the plots were significantly explained by the ‘treatment×year’ effect along the whole altitudinal gradient, but the effects decreased considerably with altitude. In the subalpine and upper alpine exclosures, stress-tolerators, species of low or no nutritive value, and mosses showed a decreasing trend, whereas tall grasses (subalpine exclosures), competitors, and species with high or medium nutritive values (lower alpine exclosures) tended to increase. Overall, our 7-year study revealed that several functional groups reacted to grazing, according to our main expectations. We suggest that these effects will intensify in the long term.";"Mayer, R.

This paper provides a systematic assessment of transfer error, contrasting methods for the transfer of farmland preservation values across states and jurisdictional scales.

We looked at the ability of economic landâuse diversification â with reforestation of tropical âwastelandsâ as a key activity â to halt deforestation at the farm level. Our ecologicalâeconomic concept, based on landâuse data from the buffer area of the Podocarpus National Park in southern Ecuador, shows that stopping deforestation after 10 years is possible without violating subsistence demands. Tropical, farmâlevel diversification may not only reduce total deforestation by 45%, but also increase farmers' profits by 65%, because the formerly unproductive wastelands have been returned to productive land use. We therefore conclude that a âwinâwinâ scenario is possible: the subsistence needs of people can be reconciled with conservation objectives.

It is a very useful environmental indicator that can be used to measure the impacts of urbanization on surface runoif, water quality, air quality, biodiversity and microclimate. Therefore, accurate estimation of impervious surfaces is critical for urban environmental monitoring, land management, decision-making and urban planning. Many approaches have been developed to estimate surface imperviousness, using remotely sensed data with various spatial resolutions. However, few studies, have investigated the effects of spatial resolution on estimating surface imperviousness. We compare medium-resolution Landsat data with high-resolution SPOT images to quantify the imperviousness in Beijing, China. The results indicated that the overall 91% accuracy of estimates of imperviousness based on TM data was considerably higher than the 81% accuracy of the SPOT data. The higher resolution SPOT data did not always predict the imperviousness of the land better than the TM data. At the whole city level, the TM data better predicts the percentage cover of impervious surfaces. At the sub-city level, however, the ring belts from the central core to the urban-rural peripheral, the SPOT data may better predict the imperviousness. These results highlighted the need to combine multiple resolution data to quantify the percentage of imperviousness, as higher resolution data do not necessarily lead to more accurate estimates. The methodology and results in this study can be utilized to identify the most suitable remote sensing data to quickly and efficiently extract the pattern of the impervious land, which could provide the base for further study on many related urban environmental problems.";"Li, Weifeng

"AGRIS:US201301960624";"Modelling and analysis of the impact of irrigation on local arid climate over northwest China";"";"This study focuses on how irrigation processes affect local climate over arid areas. The chosen study area is northwest China, a typical arid region where three dominant land‐use types are irrigated cropland, grassland, and desert. Observational analysis indicates that the highest precipitation, the coolest surface temperatures, and the slowest warming trend are seen over irrigated cropland from 1979 to 2005. The single column atmospheric model (SCAM), developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), was used to investigate and better understand the differences in long‐term climate conditions and change over the above three land‐use types. The results indicate that local climate conditions are predominantly controlled by large‐scale forcing in this arid region and that local land surface forcing related to vegetation cover change and irrigation processes also has a significant impact. This study strongly suggests that a realistic climate forecast for this region can be achieved only with both accurate large‐scale and local climate forcing. The irrigated cropland of the region generates stronger evaporation that cools the surface and slows the warming trend more than does the evaporation from the natural grassland and desert. Stronger evaporation also significantly increases precipitation, potentially alleviating the stress of irrigation demands in arid regions. A series of sensitivity SCAM simulations indicate that a drier and warmer climate occurs with decreasing vegetation cover in the irrigated cropland region.";"Wen, Lijuan

"AGRIS:US201600190846";"thermodynamic approach for assessing agroecosystem sustainability";"";"By revisiting theoretical concepts in biogeography and the importance of thermodynamic laws in biosphere-atmosphere interactions, ecological sustainability in agricultural systems may be better defined. In this case study, we employed a multidisciplinary methodology for exploring agroecosystem sustainability by using eddy covariance (EC) data to compute thermodynamic entropy production (Ï) and relate it to water, energy and carbon cycling in croplands and grasslands of the Central US. From 2002 to 2012, the biophysical metric of Ï was compared across AmeriFlux sites, each with site-specific land management practices of irrigation, crop rotation, and tillage. Results show that Ï is most correlated with net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon, and when cropland and grassland sites are close to being carbon neutral, Ï values range from 0.51â1.0WKâ1mâ2 for grasslands, 0.81â1.0WKâ1mâ2 for rainfed croplands, and 0.81â1.1WKâ1mâ2 for irrigated croplands. Irrigated maize stressed by hydrologic and high temperature anomalies associated with the 2012 drought exhibit the greatest increase in Ï, indicating the possibility of decreased sustainability compared to rainfed croplands and grasslands. These results suggest that maximizing carbon uptake with irrigation and fertilizer use tends to move agroecosystems further away from thermodynamic equilibrium, which has implications for ecological sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in climate-smart agriculture. The underlying theoretical concepts, multidisciplinary methodology, and use of eddy covariance data for biophysical indicators in this study contribute to a unique understanding of ecological sustainability in agricultural systems.";"Cochran, Ferdouz V.

"AGRIS:DJ2012054759";"Tree encroachment dynamics in heathlands of north-west Italy: the fire regime hypothesis";"";"Tree encroachment is one of the primary conservation issues in Calluna-heathlands, a priority habitat in Europe. Improving understanding of the ecological factors that trigger transitions to woodlands is key to developing strategies for heathlands management. The irrational use of fire has been recognized as one of the key factors that drives the loss of heathlands of north-west Italy. The effect of high frequency pastoral burning on the replacement of heathlands by grasslands has been documented by several studies. The relationship between fire and tree encroachment is less clear. The paper examines the effect of the fire regime on the encroachment of Populus tremula L. and Betula pendula Roth. in the heathland. The study was carried out at the Managed Nature Reserve of Vauda (7 41 E, 45 13 N), which includes one of the most valuable heathlands of north-western Italy. The experimental design consisted of analysing the age structure, dendrometric variables and the species composition of three aspen and birch stands, circular-shaped and isolated within the heathland matrix. From 1986 to 2009 all stands experienced the same fire regime due to pastoral burning. Wildfires of similar behaviour occurred in 1998, 2003 and 2008 and determined the stand structure observed in 2009. The results evidenced that fire acts as a catalyst not only for seedlings establishment, as previously documented, but also for woodland expansion in the heathland. After initial establishment, stands showed a concentric encroachment dynamic, mainly due to aspen root suckering after post-fire stem mortality, whose steps of expansion coincided with the return interval of wildfires. Moreover, aspen determined the loss of heathland characteristic species, whose relative abundances were inversely correlated to aspen density along a gradient from the stands centre to the surrounding heathland. The regulation of current burning practices by prescribed burning, integrated with rational grazing, presents the next research questions to be addressed.";"Ascoli D

"AGRIS:US201500015280";"Collaboration in natural resource governance: Reconciling stakeholder expectations in deer management in Scotland";"";"The challenges of integrated, adaptive and ecosystem management are leading government agencies to adopt participatory modes of engagement. Collaborative governance is a form of participation in which stakeholders co-produce goals and strategies and share responsibilities and resources. We assess the potential and challenges of collaborative governance as a mechanism to provide an integrated, ecosystem approach to natural resource management, using red deer in Scotland as a case study. Collaborative Deer Management Groups offer a well-established example of a ‘bridging organisation’, intended to reduce costs and facilitate decision making and learning across institutions and scales. We examine who initiates collaborative processes and why, what roles different actors adopt and how these factors influence the outcomes, particularly at a time of changing values, management and legislative priorities. Our findings demonstrate the need for careful consideration of where and how shared responsibility might be best implemented and sustained as state agencies often remain key to the process, despite the partnership intention. Differing interpretations between agencies and landowners of the degree of autonomy and division of responsibilities involved in ‘collaboration’ can create tension, while the diversity of landowner priorities brings additional challenges for defining shared goals in red deer management and in other cases. Effective maintenance depends on appropriate role allocation and adoption of responsibilities, definition of convergent values and goals, and establishing communication and trust in institutional networks. Options that may help private stakeholders offset the costs of accepting responsibility for delivering public benefits need to be explicitly addressed to build capacity and support adaptation. This study indicates that collaborative governance has the potential to help reconcile statutory obligations with stakeholder empowerment. The potential of collaboration to reduce the costs of sustainable management remains contentious and, in times of increasing resource constraints, the potential mismatch between resource investment and anticipated goals is likely to become a critical issue, which may challenge the goals and capacity of the state and existing managers.";"Davies, Althea L.

What effects have intellectual property rights concerns of individual and institutional data holders on data contribution and how can incentives to contribute data be generated? Location: West Africa, with discussion of a possible approach to dealing with property rights concerns being of wider interest. Methods: The management of data property rights in the West African Vegetation Database was developed based on consultations with institutions and scientists in five West African countries over 2 years. It was agreed in two successive Memoranda of Understanding. Results: The West African Vegetation Database addresses property rights concerns by leaving the control over data access with the data owners, and provides incentives to build a distributed research community by fostering data sharing. Conclusion: We present a potential solution to the problem of intellectual property rights issues being an impediment to data sharing and the compilation of large regional vegetation databases. The data property rights management approach implemented in the West African Vegetation Database provided incentives for the contribution of recently acquired and unpublished data. Numerous phytosociological and dendrometric vegetation surveys have been made available by institutions and individual researchers for regional-scale analyses. The structures developed may serve as a model for regional-scale vegetation databases in collaborative settings involving multiple data owners.";"Janssen, Thomas

"AGRIS:US201600187851";"On the distance travelled for woodland leisure via different transport modes in Wallonia, south Belgium";"";"Based on an extensive survey of woodland visitors in Wallonia, south Belgium, we examined a wide range of individual-, residential- and destination-level variables for their associations with the distance travelled for woodland leisure on foot, by bicycle and by car. For each transport mode, explanatory bivariate analyses were conducted firstly to identify potential correlates of the distances travelled. Then, cross-classified multilevel analysis was performed to build estimation models for the trip distance. The results showed that, amongst the multilevel variables selected, walking trip distance was only associated with individual trip behaviour, while cycling and car-borne trip distance could also be associated with individual socio-economic profile as well as a large range of residential and destination attributes on land use, land cover and visitor support services. The final estimation model for (i) walking trip distance included trip duration as the only explanatory variable, for (ii) cycling trip distance included variables on trip duration, proportion of woodland area at residence and presence of service facilities at destination, and for (iii) car-borne trip distance included variables on trip duration, visitor's employment status, whether the trip is on weekend or in summer, proportion of woodland area at residence and remoteness of destination from urban area. Despite being simple in form, all multilevel estimation models show a satisfactory explanatory power and a better performance than the ordinary single-level models. Our results add new empirical evidences on the key factors associated with the transport mode-specific travel distance, in particular, for woodland leisure. The cross-classified multilevel analysis used in our study provides new methodological insights for the estimation of individual trip distance, which could benefit future modelling of woodland recreation demand.";"Li, Sen

Raptors, in particular, are hazardous to aircraft safety due to their size, hunting behavior, and hovering and soaring habits. Reduction of rodent populations at an airport may decrease raptor populations in the area and, therefore, reduce risk that raptors pose to aircraft. Rodent populations can be reduced by population management (i.e., use of rodenticides) or by habitat management (i.e., vegetation and land-use management) that reduces the area’s carrying capacity for rodents. I found that zinc phosphide-treated oats reduced rodent populations by >94% at the Kansas City International Airport in summer 1999. Raptor strikes at the airport declined after rodenticide use.

That prompted this benchmarking analysis of 17 small and 3 large irrigation schemes located along the River Senegal. The objectives were to establish benchmarks for both productivity and performance of irrigation schemes along the valley, and to inquire whether small schemes function better than large schemes. Cluster and data envelopment analyses enabled, respectively, grouping and ranking of irrigation schemes according to a set of pre-determined performance indicators: viz. energy costs, relative irrigation supply, irrigation intensity related to irrigable and equipped area, adequacy, and land productivity. Land productivity, which was highly variable, was compared to simulated land productivity for non-limiting conditions in order to determine yield gap variations. Few early sown crops were close to the simulated yield frontier of 10.6tha⁻¹ and the mean yield was similar for large and small schemes (3.50tha⁻¹ and 3.77tha⁻¹, respectively). The analysis of the indicators revealed that, on average, large schemes performed similarly to small-scale schemes, but small schemes were more variable, particularly in input-use efficiency. Analysis of clusters identified three groups of irrigation schemes: viz. consuming and productive, precarious, and productive and economic. According to data envelopment analysis, four irrigation schemes were identified as technically efficient. Their average land productivity was relatively high (4.75tha⁻¹) and energy costs were contained (59€ha⁻¹). Data envelopment analysis also identified the particular efficient schemes that should be taken as reference for improvement of each inefficient scheme.";"Borgia, Cecilia

"AGRIS:US201500187386";"Functional diversity enhances the resistance of ecosystem multifunctionality to aridity in Mediterranean drylands";"";"We used a functional trait‐based approach to assess the impacts of aridity and shrub encroachment on the functional structure of Mediterranean dryland communities (functional diversity (FD) and community‐weighted mean trait values (CWM)), and to evaluate how these functional attributes ultimately affect multifunctionality (i.e. the provision of several ecosystem functions simultaneously). Shrub encroachment (the increase in the abundance/cover of shrubs) is a major land cover change that is taking place in grasslands worldwide. Studies conducted on drylands have reported positive or negative impacts of shrub encroachment depending on the functions and the traits of the sprouting or nonsprouting shrub species considered. FD and CWM were equally important as drivers of multifunctionality responses to both aridity and shrub encroachment. Size traits (e.g. vegetative height or lateral spread) and leaf traits (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) captured the effect of shrub encroachment on multifunctionality with a relative high accuracy (r² = 0.63). FD also improved the resistance of multifunctionality along the aridity gradient studied. Maintaining and enhancing FD in plant communities may help to buffer negative effects of ongoing global environmental change on dryland multifunctionality.";"Valencia, Enrique

Az olajkészletek korlátozottságamellett a bizonytalan kitermelés és a folyamatosan növekvő árak a bioüzemanyagokfelé irányítják a politikai döntéshozók és a befektetők figyelmét. Az olajimportőrországoknak a bioüzemanyag-gyártás nyersanyagainak hazai termelése lehetővéteszi importköltségeik visszafogását, az üvegházhatást okozó gázok kibocsátásánakcsökkentését, valamint a mezőgazdasági termelők jövedelem-színvonalának javítását.A bioüzemanyagok elterjedése ugyanakkor enyhíti a kapacitása határán dolgozóolajfinomító ipar üzemanyag-ellátási terheit is, ami jelentős mértékben hozzájárul(t)az üzemanyagárak emelkedéséhez.Ma támogatás nélkül a bioüzemanyag-gyártás azonban csak technológiai innovációhatására válhat gazdaságilag versenyképessé a fosszilis tüzelőanyagok mellett.Így az olajfüggőség helyett, illetve mellett bioüzemanyag- vagy élelmiszerfüggőségetidézhet elő a bioüzemanyag-előállítás ésszerűtlen növelése. Annak ellenére,hogy számos érv hangzik el a környezetvédelemben és a biztonságosabb energiaellátásban betöltött szerepéről, egyre világosabban látható az agrárpolitika szerepe. Ugyanis a takarmánytermelés már az utóbbi évtizedben sem tartott lépést a népesség növekedésével, ezért már középtávon is alternatív fehérjetakarmány és/vagy aDDGS, napraforgó és repcedara felhasználásának maximalizálása szükséges. A második generációs, cellulózalapú technológia elterjedésével a bioüzemanyag-gyártás földrajzi kiterjesztése és a mezőgazdaság jövedelmezőségének javulása várható az érintett régiókban.A bioüzemanyagok felhasználásával megtakarított üvegházhatású gázok mennyiségéről szóló tanulmányok pozitív hatásról számolnak be. Ugyanez vonatkozikaz energiamérlegre is. A termelési költségek kalkulációja azt mutatja, hogy a bioüzemanyaghasználata egyelőre nem tudja megfékezni a nyersolajárak növekedését,ugyanis sokkal inkább a nyersolaj kiegészítéséről, mintsem kiváltásáról van szó. A két legnagyobb globális bioüzemanyag-piac ma az USA és Brazília, a nemzetközi beruházások célpontja pedig Brazília és Európa. Az EU olajimport-függősége aggodalomra ad okot, ráadásul a közlekedési ágazatra jut az olajfelhasználás 70%-a. Ugyanakkor az EU agrárpolitikája nem tartalmaz világos stratégiát az éghajlatváltozáshoz való alkalmazkodásra. 2020-ra tagállami szinten legalább 10%-ra kell növelni a fosszilis üzemanyagok biokomponens-tartalmát. A 10%-os részarány teljesítéséhez az évi belső gabona-felhasználás 19%-a és a repcetermelés teljes mennyisége szükséges. A fosszilis üzemanyagok kiváltása a mai gabonatermelés legalább kétszeresét és a jelenlegirepce- és napraforgó-termelés 25-szörösét igényelné.    -   Increasing oil prices have made the replacement of fossil fuel with environmental-friendly biofuel a hot topic. The limit of available oil resources and rising oil prices has drawn more and more attention to policy makers and investors. The production of feedstock for biofuel production in oil importing countries may reduce the cost of oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions and increase the income level of agricultural producers. At the same time, biofuel production may reduce the burden on fossil fuel production with overused capacities, which has led to increasing oil prices. Without government support, technological innovation is the only way biofuels can be made economically competitive with fossil fuels. By increasing biofuel production without careful consideration we run the risk of generating a dependence on biofuels or food in the place of the current dependence on oil. During the many discussions that have been held about the protection of the environment and the security of energy supply in terms of biofuels, the growing role of agricultural policy has become clear. Since animal compound feed production has been unable to keep pace with population growth during the last decade, reliance on alternative protein resources and/or maximising the use of DDGS, rape-meal and sunflower-meal in the production of animal feed will become a key issue in the medium-term. The motivation for cellulosic ethanol production is the geographical expansion of ethanol production, since ethanol will become cheaper if the distance between production and consumption is reduced, which will also improve the profitability of agriculture in the rural areas concerned. While there are significant differences in studies on the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions saved by the use of biofuels, on the whole biofuels are considered to have a positive impact on the environment. The same is true in terms of the net energy balance of biofuel production. Calculations of the production cost of biofuel indicate that the use of biofuel cannot control the price evolution of oil, because biofuels will remain supplemental rather than competitive products, to be blended into traditional fuels. The world’s two largest biofuel markets are the US and Brazil, while Brazil and Europe are the main beneficiaries of international investments. While the dependency of the EU on imported oil gives rise to serious concerns, transportation accounts for 70 per cent of oil consumptionin the EU. The agricultural policy of the EU does not have a clear-cut strategy for adaptationto climate change. Member states are required to increase the biofuel share in fossil fuels toat least 10 per cent by 2020. This 10 per cent share will require 19 per cent of the annual cereal consumption and the full rapeseed production. In order to fully substitute fossil fuels, the EU would require at least twice the current output of cereals and 25 times the current rapeseed and sunflower- seed production. Similarly to some other EU member states, Hungary has required a certain percentage of the fuels marketed on the national market to be biofuels in order to qualify for a preferential excise duty (differentiation in excise duty). The mandatory 10 per cent target for 2020 requires a maize area of 110-120 thousand hectares and approximately 300-350 thousand hectares of rapeseed and sunflowerseed. Once bioethanol and biodiesel are produced in high quantities, the supply of feedstock will become a top priority. The future of the Hungarian bioethanol industry raises questions concerning the potential sources and prices of feedstock.";"Popp, Jozsef";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"hu";"environment";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"";"150;HUN;BRA;USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016218402";"http://purl.umn.edu/57723";"";"";"";""

Through an empirical investigation of farmers from Koussin-Lélé, a semi-collective irrigated rice scheme in central Benin, we find that female rice farmers are particularly discriminated against with regard to scheme membership and access to land and equipment, resulting in significant negative impacts on their productivity and income. Although women have lower productivity, they are as technically efficient as men.

Abstract:
In this paper, we estimate the value of irrigated land in the province of Leon (Spain) using land prices (irrigated and non irrigated) for two different uses (crop production and pasture) in ten different districts. The value of benefits associated with irrigation can be estimated by comparing the price of an irrigated plot of land with a similar plot of non irrigated land. The logical difficulty of finding these two similar (except for water) plots of land can be overcome using regression analysis where the effect of irrigation on land prices can be estimated after controlling for other differences in the plots of land analyzed. In the present paper, using an econometric model, we estimate the average prices associated with irrigated and non irrigated land. The difference among these average prices is an estimate of the value of irrigation. The results of this paper can be used in the analysis of new irrigation projects.";"Sampedro, Carlos Arias";"";"";"AGRIS";"2001-12-31";"es";"land economics";"";"";"ESP";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012200351";"http://purl.umn.edu/28780";"";"";"";""

While predominantly discussed as an environmental problem, degraded lands have recently been reconsidered as an untapped resource for production industries like agriculture and forestry. Here, we investigate the biodiversity potential of degraded land compared to both used and undisturbed land. First, we find that “degraded lands” and related terms cover a wide variety of socio-ecological settings and that a standardized terminology is clearly needed. Second, degraded lands may support biodiversity levels similar to or even above those of surrounding managed landscapes. However, degraded lands generally support less biodiversity than natural areas. Third, some principles to harness degraded lands for biodiversity conservation have been developed. If applied, degraded areas may provide opportunities to extend nature conservation strategies on a broader spatial scale, and they may serve as a buffer between protected areas and intensively used land. We conclude that efforts to capitalize on degraded lands for commodity crop production generate conflicts with biodiversity conservation that have been disregarded so far.";"Plieninger, Tobias

"AGRIS:US201400152659";"equilibrium analysis of the land use structure in the Yunnan Province, China";"";"Global land use structure is changing rapidly due to unceasing population growth and accelerated urbanization, which leads to fierce competition between the rigid demand for built-up area and the protection of cultivated land, forest, and grassland. It has been a great challenge to realize the sustainable development of land resources. Based on a computable general equilibrium model of land use change with a social accounting matrix dataset, this study implemented an equilibrium analysis of the land use structure in the Yunnan Province during the period of 2008–2020 under three scenarios, the baseline scenario, low TFP (total factor productivity) scenario, and high TFP scenario. The results indicated that under all three scenarios, area of cultivated land declined significantly along with a remarkable expansion of built-up area, while areas of forest, grassland, and unused land increased slightly. The growth rate of TFP had first negative and then positive effects on the expansion of built-up area and decline of cultivated land as it increased. Moreover, the simulated changes of both cultivated land and built-up area were the biggest under the low TFP scenario, and far exceeded the limit in the Overall Plan for Land Utilization in the Yunnan Province in 2020. The scenario-based simulation results are of important reference value for policy-makers in making land use decisions, balancing the fierce competition between the protection of cultivated land and the increasing demand for built-up area, and guaranteeing food security, ecological security, and the sustainable development of land resources.";"Luo, Jiao

"AGRIS:US201400003436";"Objective sampling design in a highly heterogeneous landscape - characterizing environmental determinants of malaria vector distribution in French Guiana, in the Amazonian region";"";"BACKGROUND: Sampling design is a key issue when establishing species inventories and characterizing habitats within highly heterogeneous landscapes. Sampling efforts in such environments may be constrained and many field studies only rely on subjective and/or qualitative approaches to design collection strategy. The region of Cacao, in French Guiana, provides an excellent study site to understand the presence and abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes, their species dynamics and the transmission risk of malaria across various environments. We propose an objective methodology to define a stratified sampling design. Following thorough environmental characterization, a factorial analysis of mixed groups allows the data to be reduced and non-collinear principal components to be identified while balancing the influences of the different environmental factors. Such components defined new variables which could then be used in a robust k-means clustering procedure. Then, we identified five clusters that corresponded to our sampling strata and selected sampling sites in each stratum. RESULTS: We validated our method by comparing the species overlap of entomological collections from selected sites and the environmental similarities of the same sites. The Morisita index was significantly correlated (Pearson linear correlation) with environmental similarity based on i) the balanced environmental variable groups considered jointly (p = 0.001) and ii) land cover/use (p-value << 0.001). The Jaccard index was significantly correlated with land cover/use-based environmental similarity (p-value = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results validate our sampling approach. Land cover/use maps (based on high spatial resolution satellite images) were shown to be particularly useful when studying the presence, density and diversity of Anopheles mosquitoes at local scales and in very heterogeneous landscapes.";"Roux, Emmanuel

The overall development goal of sustainable human well-being should be to obtain social, ecologic, and economic viability, not merely growth of the market economy. Therefore new and more integrated methods to value sustainable development are needed. There is a huge amount of data and methods currently available to model and analyze land management practices. However, it is scattered and requires consolidation and reformatting to be useful. In this review we collected and evaluated databases and computer models that could be useful for analyzing and valuing land management options for sustaining natural capital and maximizing ecosystem services. The current methods and models are not well equipped to handle large scale transdisciplinary analyses and a major conclusion of this synthesis paper is that there is a need for further development of the integrated approaches, which considers all four types of capital (human, built, natural, and social), and their interaction at spatially explicit, multiple scales. This should be facilitated by adapting existing models and make them and their outcomes more accessible to stakeholders. Other shortcomings and caveats of models should be addressed by adding the âhuman factorâ, for instance, in participatory decision-making and scenario testing. For integration of the models themselves, a more participatory approach to model development is also recommended, along with the possibility of adding advanced gaming interfaces to the models to allow them to be âplayedâ by a large number of interested parties and their trade-off decisions to be accumulated and compared.";"Turner, Katrine Grace

Location We modelled habitat and climatic associations of P. nathusii in the UK and applied this model to the species' historical range in continental Europe. Methods A binomial logistic regression model was constructed relating the occurrence of P. nathusii to climate and habitat characteristics using historical species occurrence records (1940-2006) and CORINE land cover data. This model was applied to historical and projected climate data to examine changes in suitable range (1940-2080) of this species. We tested the predictive ability of the model with known records in the UK after 2006 and applied the model to the species' known range in Europe. Results The distribution of P. nathusii was related positively to the area of water bodies, woodland and small areas of urbanization, and negatively related to the area of peat/heathland. Species records were associated with higher minimum temperatures, low seasonal variation in temperature and intermediate rainfall. We found that suitable areas have existed in the UK since the 1940s and that these have expanded. The model had high predictive power when applied to new records after 2006, with a correct classification rate of 70%, estimated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Based on climate projections, our model suggests a potential twofold increase in the area suitable for P. nathusii in the UK by 2050. The single most influential climate variable contributing to range increase was the projected increase in minimum temperature. When applied to Europe, the model predictions had best predictive capability of known records in western areas of the species' range, where P. nathusii is present during the winter. Main conclusions We show that a mobile, migratory species has adapted its range in response to recent climate change on a continental scale. We believe this may be the first study to demonstrate a case of range change linked to contemporary climate change in a mammal species in Europe.";"Lundy, Mathieu

In this study, our aim was to use historical records over two periods within the last 50� years to analyze trends in the number of requests made for rabbit control in Central Spain. We gathered data on rabbit control applications made in 1967 from Rabbit and Hare Control Authorization Records (CARs) and corresponding information for 2005 from Technical Hunting Plans (THPs). THPs are currently the official mechanism to apply for rabbit control licenses in the country. We show that although only 4.2� % of municipalities requested to control rabbits in 1967, this proportion was 71� % in 2005. Given that there is no evidence of rabbit population increases in the study region, we suggest that other factors may explain the observed rise in control requests. We contend that sport hunting is the main reason for the higher numbers of control requests in 2005. Evidence for this is the fact that hunting has increased since the 1960s as a means of augmenting income for landowners, and that the most requested method for control was the shotgun. Based on these results, we recommend that in order to adequately assess the real negative impacts of rabbits on human interests in Spain there is a need to implement a more robust data-gathering mechanism when control requests are made. We suggest the development of a more detailed control application form, similar to that used in Spain in the 1960s, in which the reason(s) for a rabbit control request can be clearly described.";"Ríos-Saldaña, Carlos Antonio

To understand and predict resulting changes in community structures, individual-based and spatially explicit population models are a useful tool but require detailed data sets for each species. More generic approaches are thus needed. Here we present a trait-based functional type approach to model savanna birds. The aim of our model is to explore the response of different bird functional types to modifications in habitat structure. The functional types are characterized by different traits, in particular body mass, which is related to life-history traits (reproduction and mortality) and spatial scales (home range area and dispersal ability), as well as the use of vegetation structures for foraging and nesting, which is related to habitat quality and suitability. We tested the performance of the functional types in artificial landscapes varying in shrub:grass ratio and clumping intensity of shrub patches. We found that an increase in shrub encroachment and a decrease in habitat quality caused by land use mismanagement and climate change endangered all simulated bird functional types. The strength of this effect was related to the preferred habitat. Furthermore, larger-bodied insectivores and omnivores were more prone to extinction due to shrub encroachment compared to small-bodied species. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more sensitive to clumping intensity of shrubs whereas herbivorous and carnivorous birds were most affected by a decreasing amount of grass cover. From an applied point of view, our findings emphasize that policies such as woody plant removal and a reduction in livestock stocking rates to prevent shrub encroachment should prioritize the enlargement of existing grassland patches. Overall, our results show that the combination of an individual-based modelling approach with carefully defined functional types can provide a powerful tool for exploring biodiversity responses to environmental changes. Furthermore, the increasing accumulation of worldwide data sets on speciesâ core and soft traits (surrogates to determine core traits indirectly) on one side and the refinement of conceptual frameworks for animal functional types on the other side will further improve functional type approaches which consider the sensitivities of multiple species to climate change, habitat loss, and fragmentation.";"Scherer, CÃ©dric

We first identified major land functions linking production, environment, ecosystem services and economics, and then classified land resources into four categories of marginal land using suitability and limitations associated with major management goals, including physically marginal land, biologically marginal land, environmentally ecologically marginal land, and economically marginal land. We tested this assessment framework in southwestern Michigan, USA. Our results indicated that this marginal land assessment framework can be potentially feasible on land use planning for food and bioenergy production, and balancing multiple goals of land use management. We also compared our results with marginal land assessment from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and land capability classes (LCC) that are used in the US. The hierarchical assessment framework has advantages of quantitatively reflecting land functions and multiple concerns. This provides a foundation upon which focused studies can be identified in order to improve the assessment framework by quantifying high-resolution land functions associated with environment and ecosystem services as well as their criteria needed to improve the assessment framework.";"Kang, S.

Between 24 and 30 CDC CO2-baited light traps were set annually in Sioux Falls from May to September 2005–2008. Land cover data were acquired from the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset and the percentages of selected land cover types were calculated within a 600-m buffer zone around each trap. Meteorological information was summarized from local weather stations. Cx. tarsalis exhibited stronger spatial autocorrelation than Ae. vexans. Land cover analysis indicated that Cx. tarsalis was positively correlated with grass/hay, and Ae. vexans was positively correlated with wetlands. No associations were identified between irrigation and the host-seeking population of each species. Higher temperature in the current week and 2 wk prior and higher precipitation 3–4 wk before collection of host-seeking adult mosquitoes had positive influences on Cx. tarsalis abundance. Temperature in the current week and rainfall 2–3 wk before sampling had positive influences on Ae. vexans abundance. This study revealed the different influences of weather and land cover on important mosquito species in the Northern Great Plains region, which can be used to improve local vector control strategies and West Nile virus prevention efforts.";"Chuang, Ting-Wu

Economic and environmental model simulations were performed over a 30-year time horizon for each of these practices using extensive data collected from the study area. Results from model simulations indicate that while most of the practices (including terraces, no till farming, contouring, and in-field contour buffers) would reduce sediment and sediment-bound nutrient losses significantly, they have very little benefit on soluble nitrogen and phosphorus losses. This is primarily because the increased infiltration rates resulting from those practices leads to greater losses of subsurface and return flow in the heavily tile-drained watershed. Nonetheless, when these practices are combined with judicious commercial fertilizer use, appreciable reductions in soluble nutrient losses are also indicated, and improvements in sediment loss are maintained. Terraces are indicated to provide the greatest sediment loss reduction (over 60% reduction) at the watershed level, relative to the status quo. Accordingly, installed terraces also lead to the highest simulated reductions in organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus (over 70%). Predicted reductions in sediment for most of the other practices ranged from almost 30% to about 45%. Corresponding reductions in simulated organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus losses range from about 35% to almost 50%. Economic model simulations also show varied impacts. In general, costs of sediment reducing practices range from about $6 per hectare of implemented area with contouring to almost $65 per hectare when terraces are installed on high-slope cropland. Terraces also indicated the greatest sediment loss reduction. On the other hand, judicious commercial fertilizer use is indicated to offset these costs by as much as roughly $50 per hectare. The study indicates that programs that offer producers some flexibility in choosing practice combinations may lead to the best outcomes.";"Gassman, P.W.

"AGRIS:US2016214172";"Gender, Marital Status, Farm Size and other Factors Influencing the Extent of Cash Cropping in Kenya: A Case Study";"";"This article examines the effects of commercialisation of agriculture on land use and work patterns by means of a case study in the Nyeri district in Kenya. The study uses cross sectional data collected from small-scale farmers in this district. We find that good quality land is allocated to non-food cash crops, which may lead to a reduction in non-cash food crops and expose some households to greater risks of possible famine. Also the proportion of land allocated to food crops declines as the farm size increases while the proportion of land allocated to non-food cash crops rises as the size of farm increases. Cash crops are also not bringing in as much revenue commensurate with the amount of land allocated to them. With growing commercialisation, women still work more hours than men. They not only work on non-cash food crops but also on cash crops including non-food cash crops. Evidence indicates that women living with husbands work longer hours than those married but living alone, and also longer than the unmarried women.Married women seem to lose their decision-making ability with growth of commercialisation, as husbands make most decisions to do with cash crops. Furthermore husbands appropriate family cash income. Husbands are less likely to use such income for the welfare of the family compared to wives due to different expenditure patterns. Married women in Kenya also have little or no power to change the way land is allocated between food and non-food cash crops. Due to deteriorating terms of trade for non-food cash crops, men have started cultivation of food cash crops with the potential of crowding out women. It is found that both the area of non-cash crops tends to rise with farm size but also the proportion of the farm area cash cropped rises in Central Kenya.";"Kiriti, Tabitha

"AGRIS:US201400125120";"Conserving Forests in Privatized Commons: Trends and Management Options in an Ifugao Village, Philippines";"";"This study addresses the question, ‘How can remaining forests be conserved when these are already individually privatized, and when the people prefer landuses other than forestry?’ These changes in landuse and forest ownership are demonstrated through a case study of a village in Ifugao, Philippines. A rapid and continued conversion of forest into agricultural land is observed, particularly for vegetable farming. Traditionally, most of the village total land area was under communal land ownership, but now almost half is under de facto private ownership. This transition in land (including forest) ownership is generally attributed to increased demand for land which is further attributed to changes in peoples’ values towards wealth accumulation rather than redistribution, greater integration to the market economy and a shift towards commercial agriculture. Past forest policies have been ineffective in regulating the landuse largely because they have not reflected local reality, and this appears to be true with the present national forest management strategy of community-based forest management. It is argued that the granting of land titles will improve forest conservation because it will improve the enforcement of forest laws and related contractual agreements. Based on the reality of private land ownership, it is further argued that forest policy in IP land should include private (individual, family or household) forest management. Given the possibility that indigenous people may prefer landuses other than forestry or may sell their property for various reasons, policies should regulate landuse as well as make it legal for IPs to transfer rights of ownership to ‘outsiders’. There is scope to improve the implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act in the Philippines.";"Albano, Adrian

"AGRIS:US201400132761";"Modelling emergent patterns of dynamic desert ecosystems";"";"In many desert ecosystems vegetation is both patchy and dynamic: vegetated areas are interspersed with patches of bare ground, and both the positioning and the species composition of the vegetated areas exhibit change through time. These characteristics lead to the emergence of multi-scale patterns in vegetation that arise from complex relationships between plants, soils and transport processes. Previous attempts to probe the causes of spatial complexity and predict responses of desert ecosystems tend to be limited in their focus: models of dynamics have been developed with no consideration of the inherent patchiness in the vegetation, or else models have been developed to generate patterns with no consideration of the dynamics. Here we develop a general modelling framework for the analysis of ecosystem change in deserts that is rooted in the concept of connectivity and is derived from a detailed process-based understanding. We explicitly consider spatial interactions among multiple vegetation types and multiple resources, and our model is formulated to predict responses to a variety of endogenous and exogenous disturbances. The model is implemented in the deserts of the American Southwest both to test hypotheses of the causes of the invasion of woody shrubs, and to test its ability to reproduce observed spatial differences in response to drought in the twentieth century. The model's performance leads us to argue that vertical and lateral connectivity are key emergent properties of the ecosystem, which both control its behaviour and provide indicators of its state. If this argument is shown to be compatible with field observations, the model presented here will provide a more certain approach towards preventing further degradation of semi-arid grasslands.";"Stewart, J

"AGRIS:US2012205649";"FACTORS INFLUENCING OPTIMAL STOCKING RATES FROM A TENANT PERSPECTIVE";"";"The terms of grazing lease contracts potentially influence the tenants incentive to preserve the vegetation resource. Annual stocking rate decisions dictate the degree of overgrazing, which can be cumulative over long periods of time. The objective of this study is to identify the impact the tenants planning horizon and cost structure specified in the lease contract has on his/her profit-maximizing stocking rate. A multi-period nonlinear programming model was developed to identify economically optimal stocking rates each year over a 24-year period. The model was solved under 1-, 4-, 8-, and 12-year leases on a per acre and per head basis.  The relative importance of each lease alternative and input variable on the tenants optimal stocking rate was ranked based on standardized ordinary least squares coefficient estimates between input values and optimal stocking rates.  Planning horizon and cost structure had a minor impact on optimal stocking rates relative to non-lease factors such as livestock prices and production costs. Holding other factors constant, per acre leases generated a 2% higher average stocking rate than per head leases. Optimal stocking rates were inversely related to the length of the lease. Twelve-year lease agreements generated 18 and 13% lower optimal stocking rater than the 1-year per acre and per head lease agreements, respectively. The optimal stocking rate difference between an 8-year and a 12-year lease was negligible, suggesting the 8-year lease would provide a similar incentive to protect vegetation as a lease with a longer planning horizon.";"May, Gary J.

In the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, a small area of hedgerow landscape persists as a remnant of what was once an important centre for livestock production. This paper presents the results of a study carried out in this area with the aim of clarifying the relationship between the structural change of this hedgerow landscape and the evolution of farming practices developed by its owners and workers. It also considers these farmers' perceptions of their pastures, of their farms and of the region. Up to 61 statistically significant relationships were found between the physical landscape characteristic variables and the socio-economical variables. Results depict a hedgerow landscape determined by the combination of two management models. Here, and contrary to conclusions reported in similar literature, traditional pasture activity leads to a weaker hedgerow network than a farming model based on crop cultivation. Management guidance required to move from the current situation towards a hedgerow landscape supporting both biodiversity and agrarian activity is discussed.";"Llausàs, Albert

The grassland cover in the 1980s, 2000 and 2005 was compared before and after the restoration programs. The variability of net primary production (NPP) and rain use efficiency (RUE) were analyzed as indicators of vegetation productivity. Our study showed that changes in grassland cover were closely related to the relative area of farmland, with increases in grassland being caused by returning farmland to grassland and decreases being caused by reclamation for agriculture. The results of NPP and RUE measurements over the past 30 years showed systematic increases in the area of grassland in most regions, especially from 2000 to 2008. This fact was reflected by intensified vegetation activity and cannot be completely explained by the warmer and wetter climate, which suggested a contribution from restored, ungrazed grasslands. Our analysis indicates that both vegetation activity and grassland cover increased in regions in which grassland and rangeland restoration programs were implemented.";"Huang, Lin

However, it is unclear whether urban, backyard gardens with native plants will support more bees than gardens without native plants. We examined backyard gardens in northwestern Ohio to ask: 1) Does bee diversity, abundance, and community composition differ in backyard gardens with and without native plants? 2) What characteristics of backyard gardens and land cover in the surrounding landscape correlate with changes in the bee community? 3) Do bees in backyard gardens respond more strongly to local or landscape factors? We sampled bees with pan trapping, netting, and direct observation. We examined vegetation characteristics and land cover in 500� m, 1� km, and 2� km buffers surrounding each garden. Abundance of all bees, native bees, and cavity-nesting bees (but not ground-nesting bees) was greater in native plant gardens but only richness of cavity-nesting bees differed in gardens with and without native plants. Bee community composition differed in gardens with and without native plants. Overall, bee richness and abundance were positively correlated with local characteristics of backyard gardens, such as increased floral abundance, taller vegetation, more cover by woody plants, less cover by grass, and larger vegetable gardens. Differences in the amount of forest, open space, and wetlands surrounding gardens influenced abundance of cavity- and ground-nesting bees, but at different spatial scales. Thus, presence of native plants, and local and landscape characteristics might play important roles in maintaining bee diversity within urban areas.";"Pardee, Gabriella L.

The results show that the local response to deforestation is similar with fixed and simulated SSTs. Over Amazonia, all experiments simulate a comparable decrease in precipitation and no change in moisture convergence, implying that there is only a change in local water recycling. Over Africa, the impact on precipitation is not identical for all experiments; however, the signal is smaller than over Amazonia and simulations of more than 50 years would be necessary to statistically discriminate the precipitation change. We observe small but significant changes in SSTs in the coupled simulation in the tropical oceans surrounding the deforested regions. Impacts on mid and high latitudes SSTs are also possible. As remote impacts to deforestation are weak, it has not been possible to establish possible oceanic feedbacks to the atmosphere. Overall, this study indicates that the oceanic feedback to land surface sensitivity studies is of second importance, and that the inclusion of the oceanic system will require ensembles of long climate simulations to properly take into account the low frequency variability of the ocean.";"Voldoire, Aurore

A comparison of independent datasets in Massachusetts, USA";"";"The spatial distribution of non-native, invasive plants on the landscape is strongly influenced by human action. People introduce non-native species to new landscapes and regions (propagule pressure) as well as increase ecosystem invasibility through disturbance of native ecosystems. However, the relative importance of different landscape drivers of invasion may vary with landscape context (i.e., the types and amounts of surrounding land cover and land use). If so, data collected in one context may not be appropriate for predicting invasion risk across a broader landscape. To test whether independent occurrence datasets suggest similar landscape drivers of invasion, we compared landscape models based on data compiled by the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England (IPANE), which are contributed opportunistically by trained citizen scientists, to models based on Forest Stewardship plans (FSPs), which are located in privately owned and relatively undisturbed forests. We evaluated 16 landscape variables related to propagule pressure and/or disturbance for significant predictors of invasive plant presence based on presence/absence and count regression models. Presence and richness of invasive plants within FSPs was most influenced by proportion of open land and proximity to residential areas, which are both sources of propagules in forest interiors. In contrast, IPANE invasive plant presence and richness for the same area was influenced by distance to roads and streams. These results suggest that landscape drivers of invasion vary considerably depending on landscape context, and the choice of occurrence dataset will strongly influence model results.";"Vieira, Renee

Numerous trials have been done on plant species compositions and biomass, but little testing has been done on the TEK of plant productivity and nutrient values, which are important for proper rangeland management. In this study, we tested the TEK of pastoralists living in Bulgan, northern Mongolia, regarding plant productivity and nutrient values. We examined biomass, growth form, plant productivity, and crude protein amounts along grazing gradients. The results showed that biomass declined and the number of erect-form plants decreased as grazing intensity increased, although plant productivity and crude protein amounts did not differ along the grazing gradient. This indicates that the pastoralists' evaluation of pastures dominated by narrow plants (Mongolian: nariin ovs) accurately reflects the productivity of the land, suggesting that their evaluation is reasonable in terms of the carrying capacity. This assessment of the ecological status of Mongolian rangelands provides a foundation for ecologically sound and culturally appropriate rangeland management.";"Kakinuma, Kaoru

In response to community requests to clarify resource rights to Brazil nut trees, CIFOR offered to train community members to map trees, trails and other key features themselves. This experience indicates that local residents can map their resources in an effective and efficient way and in the process gather necessary information to mediate competing claims, demonstrate their legitimate resource claims to external stakeholders and make management decisions. We argue that maps and properties are more likely to be seen as legitimate reflections of de facto rights if local stakeholders are involved as a group from the outset.";"Cronkleton, Peter

"AGRIS:US201500219288";"Ecological restoration planning based on connectivity in an urban area";"";"In urban areas, the competition between land development and ecological conservation is intense. To mitigate the negative effects of urbanization, we developed a methodology to plan a spatially explicit conservation network based on widely available remotely sensed data and other auxiliary data. First, as an area of strategic significance for the conservation of regional flora and fauna and for maintaining high environmental quality to promote human well-being, the remaining natural and semi-natural areas were identified as ecologically primary areas. Second, integrating the graph-theoretic model, we evaluated the overall connectivity of core habitats and identified which core habitats were and what landscape-pattern-context was most important to the conservation network. Third, focusing on maximizing the ability to utilize the existing conditions to reduce construction costs while meeting the ecological aims, an ecological corridor system was suggested to improve both the ecological connectivity and the livable environment. Finally, a comprehensive optimization scheme was suggested for the overall conservation planning. We concluded that successful and pragmatic ecological restoration planning in an urban area should consider the requirements of socially, economically and ecologically sustainable development and optimize the structure and function of the urban ecosystem, rather than maximize certain ecological aims. Our planning has been adopted by the local government, and a legally binding system of regulations has been established to guarantee the plan's enforcement. Our findings may provide an actual reference for the world, especially to manage the intertwined issues of economic development and ecological sustainability in rapidly urbanizing areas.";"Yu, Deyong

"AGRIS:US201600126084";"Impact of pigeon pea biochar on cadmium mobility in soil and transfer rate to leafy vegetable spinach";"";"Introduction of heavy metals in the environment by various anthropogenic activities has become a potential treat to life. Among the heavy metals, cadmium (Cd) shows relatively high soil mobility and has high phyto-mammalian toxicity. Integration of soil remediation and ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration in soils through organic amendments, may provide an attractive land management option for contaminated sites. The application of biochar in agriculture has recently received much attention globally due to its associated multiple benefits, particularly, long-term carbon storage in soil. However, the application of biochar from softwood crop residue for heavy metal immobilization, as an alternative to direct field application, has not received much attention. Hence, a pot experiment was conducted to study the effect of pigeon pea biochar on cadmium mobility in a soil-plant system in cadmium-spiked sandy loam soil. The biochar was prepared from pigeon pea stalk through a slow pyrolysis method at 300 °C. The experiment was designed with three levels of Cd (0, 5, and 10 mg Cd kg⁻¹ soil) and three levels of biochar (0, 2.5, and 5 g kg⁻¹ soil) using spinach as a test crop. The results indicate that with increasing levels of applied cadmium at 5 and 10 mg kg⁻¹ soil, the dry matter yield (DMY) of spinach leaf decreased by 9.84 and 18.29 %, respectively. However, application of biochar (at 2.5 and 5 g kg⁻¹ soil) significantly increased the dry matter yield of spinach leaf by 5.07 and 15.02 %, respectively, and root by 14.0 and 24.0 %, respectively, over the control. Organic carbon content in the post-harvest soil increased to 34.9 and 60.5 % due to the application of biochar 2.5 and 5 g kg⁻¹ soil, respectively. Further, there was a reduction in the diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable cadmium in the soil and in transfer coefficient values (soil to plant), as well as its concentrations in spinach leaf and root, indicating that cadmium mobility was decreased due to biochar application. This study shows that pigeon pea biochar has the potential to increase spinach yield and reduce cadmium mobility in contaminated sandy soil.";"Coumar, M. Vassanda

"AGRIS:US201600126088";"Criterion definition for the identification of physical-geographical boundaries of Khorezm oasis through remotely sensed data";"";"The Khorezm oasis is one of the main ancient agricultural and cultural centers of Asia. Different studies have used administrative boundaries, without regard to the ecosystem complexity. Remote sensing is a technique that provides many advantages in relation to traditional land cover monitoring approaches. The main objective of this study was to identify the physical-geographical boundaries of Khorezm oasis and analyzed area change dynamics of the oasis using remote sensing data. Landsat 4–5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from 1998, 2010, and 2014 were used in order to identify the oasis boundaries by analyzing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The Landsat data were radiometric normalized before the NDVI estimation. Several NDVI cutoff values were tested in order to define the more adequate value to identify the oasis boundaries (NDVI ≥ 0.1 for 1998 and 2010 images and NDVI ≥ 0.2 for 2014 images). Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques were then used to calculate the oasis area (31,885.49, 30,005.58, and 28,966.08 km², for 1998, 2010, and 2014, respectively) and analyze the land cover changes. The oasis presents a total area loss of 2919.41 km² between 1998 and 2014. The mean percentage variations between 2010 and 1998 and from 2014 to 1998 were −5.9 and −9.2 %, respectively. Therefore, the Khorezm oasis lost more than 9 % of this area between 1998 and 2014. The main areas of decrease appeared in the southern parts of the Aral Sea where the last tributaries of the Amudarya River were located. This work allowed mapping the physical-geographical boundaries of Khorezm oasis and identifying its dynamics for the analyzed period. The methodology presented in this work can be applied to other oasis regions, located in different parts of the world.";"Matchanov, Muzaffar

Many planners and conservation scientists have called for broader use of planning and regulatory tools to support the conservation of biodiversity at local scales. Yet little is known about the pervasiveness of these practices. We conducted an on-line survey of county, municipal, and tribal planning directors (n =116) in 3 geographic regions of the United States: metropolitan Seattle, Washington; metropolitan Des Moines, Iowa; and the Research Triangle, North Carolina. Our objectives were to gauge the extent to which local planning departments address biodiversity conservation and to identify factors that facilitate or hinder conservation actions in local planning. We found that biodiversity conservation was seldom a major consideration in these departments. Staff time was mainly devoted to development mandates and little time was spent on biodiversity conservation. Regulations requiring conservation actions that might benefit biodiversity were uncommon, with the exception of rules governing water quality in all 3 regions and the protection of threatened and endangered species in the Seattle region. Planning tools that could enhance habitat conservation were used infrequently. Collaboration across jurisdictions was widespread, but rarely focused on conservation. Departments with a conservation specialist on staff tended to be associated with higher levels of conservation actions. Jurisdictions in the Seattle region also reported higher levels of conservation action, largely driven by state and federal mandates. Increased funding was most frequently cited as a factor that would facilitate greater consideration of biodiversity in local planning. There are numerous opportunities for conservation biologists to play a role in improving conservation planning at local scales.";"MILLER, JAMES R.

"AGRIS:US201400185024";"Multiple environmental services as an opportunity for watershed restoration";"";"The impact of reforestation on water supplies is often considered in terms of impacts on water yields. In specific circumstances, reforestation will improve water quality, to the extent that previously unusable water can be utilised. Such is the case with salinisation, a process that threatens up to 17million hectares of Australian farmland, major fresh water resources, biodiversity and built infrastructure. This paper highlights the value of bundling payments for environmental services (PES) from watershed restoration, including water quality improvement and carbon sequestration coupled with wood production, and compares the net returns with the existing agricultural land-use, using as an example the 408000ha Warren–Tone watershed (WT) in south-western Australia. The externalities of different land use systems are also taken into account. In this watershed 105000ha of the land was cleared for agriculture, with 25000ha subsequently reforested. A hydrological model (LUCICAT) was used to define the relationships between reforestation/deforestation and water yield and quality, thus providing a basis for valuing the hydrological benefits of reforestation. Various land-use change scenarios were examined, with modelling indicating more than 70% reforestation is required to restore stream salinity to a potable threshold of 500mg/L total dissolved salts (TDS). Options that involve traditional agricultural land-uses or perennial pastures will not deliver potable water. A hydrological–land-use–economic (HLE) model was constructed, allowing the costs and benefits of different land-uses to be examined at watershed and sub-watershed scales. Reforestation was unprofitable when only wood revenues were considered with a discount rate of 9.5%, but was profitable at lower discount rates or with a discount rate of 9.5% and carbon prices of at least $22tCO₂-e. For the latter, reforestation activities driven by the economic benefits from selling wood and carbon, generate an externality benefit in the form of improved water quality without the need for any additional payment to landholders. Payments for activities that lead to improvements in water quality could represent a new, additional source of income for landholders on the proviso that there is sufficient reforestation to reach the potable threshold. Alternatively, costs could be imposed on those whose land-use practices cause the release of salt into waterways.";"Townsend, P.V.

To identify the characteristics of streamflow change in the Yellow River, approximately 50 years of natural and observed streamflow data from 23 hydrological stations were examined. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to detect trends and abrupt change points. The results show that both the natural and the observed streamflow in the Yellow River basin present downward trends from 1956 to 2008, and the decreasing rate of observed streamflow is generally faster than that of the natural streamflow. Larger drainage areas have higher declining rates, and the declining trends are intensified downstream within the mainstream. The possibility of abrupt changes in observed streamflow is higher than in natural streamflow, and streamflow series in the mainstream are more likely to change abruptly than those in the tributaries. In the mainstream, all the significant abrupt changes appear in the middle and latter half of the 1980s, but the abrupt changes occur somewhat earlier for observed streamflow than for natural streamflow. The significant abrupt change for the observed streamflow in the tributaries is almost isochronous with the natural streamflow and occurs from the 1970s to 1990s. It is implied that the slight reduction in precipitation is not the only direct reason for the streamflow variation. Other than the effects of climate change, land-use and land-cover changes are the main reasons for the natural streamflow change. Therefore, the increasing net water diversion by humans is responsible for the observed streamflow change. It is estimated that the influence of human activity on the declining streamflow is enhanced over time.Editor Z.W. KundzewiczCitation Miao, C.Y., Shi, W., Chen, X.H., and Yang, L., 2012.

The objective of this paper is thus to developproduction models that predict how farmers will respond to changing policy framework conditions.For this purpose socio-economic surveys were carried out on 44 sample farms, in order to investigatehow the land is managed on hill farms including ongoing policies and future farm managementplanning. Based on these surveys a series of representative farm linear programming models wasdeveloped, which represent typical farm types in the uplands in the Peak District. In this study thefocus is on typical sheep and beef farm type, the most common in this region. This model is used tocalculate the effect of different policies, carried out under CAP reform, on incomes, land use and theintensity of production.

We simulate potential environmental gains as well as adjustments in agricultural production, price, and income associated with various WLPP features to illustrate tradeoffs arising from WLPP design and implementation. Competitive bidding with the use of environmental indices to rank producers for enrollment is most cost effective.

"AGRIS:US201400185028";"When peer-reviewed publications are not enough! Delivering science for natural resource management";"";"Over the last century, natural resource management on forest lands has shifted from a singular focus on resource extraction to many foci, such as recreation, tourism, conservation, view-scapes, cultural and spiritual values, sustainability, and other values. As a result, the information needs of land managers must now include social and cultural values. In addition, the public's interest in having greater participation in land management decisions and in generating scientific knowledge has never been greater. The generation of scientific knowledge which is expressed primarily through conventional means – such as peer-reviewed publications targeting academics and technology transfer (e.g., patents, licenses, agreements) primarily for government and industry – does not always satisfy the needs of resource managers and public. In recent decades, there has been rapid growth of methods to help bridge this gap by better connecting new knowledge and knowledge generation with public needs. The U.S. Forest Service is making science delivery as important goal as science creation, including structural institutional changes at the interface among researchers, resource managers, and the public, allocating an appropriate portion of project funding specifically for delivery. The Forest Service is considering increasing its use of citizen science and participatory research – which brings resource managers, decision makers, and the public into the research process to varying extents – as part of the agency's science delivery efforts. Here we explore citizen science and participatory research as possible vehicles to augment existing science delivery efforts from the perspective of a federal land management agency. We found that these mechanisms facilitate public involvement in fundamentally different ways. Depending on the type of research and desired use of research outcomes, either citizen science or participatory research could enhance the use of science in some natural resource management discussions, possibly leading to supportable solutions.";"McKinley, Duncan C.

"AGRIS:US2012204305";"Allocation of Land at the Rural-Urban Fringe Using a Spatially-Realistic Ecosystem Constraint";"";"Development in rural-urban fringe communities is increasing with the potential to damage healthy ecosystems and endanger the long-term persistence of resident flora and fauna.  The environmental impacts of development include loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat, increased air and water pollution, increased soil erosion, and decreased aesthetic appeal of the landscape.  Current land use policies rarely incorporate features of landscape-scale ecosystem health.  This paper develops a model that combines ecological and economic constructs to determine the optimal allocation of development across a spatially-realistic landscape.  The land allocation model establishes links between long-term metapopulation persistence and development through an ecosystem constraint.  A social planner seeks to maximize the benefits of development while guaranteeing a certain likelihood of long-term metapopulation persistence across the landscape that accounts for the changes to habitat patches and species dispersal success brought about by development.  

It is shown that in an economically homogeneous environment, the allocation of land to developed uses is determined solely by ecological elements (landscape structure and species parameters).  The amount of land remaining in each habitat patch is the same regardless of their initial sizes or initial levels of development.  The cost to society of meeting the ecological objective for metapopulation persistence depends on the land rent, the level of the safe-minimum-standard, the area of the landscape management unit, the distance between habitat patches, the dispersal ability of the focal species, and the species-specific area scaling parameter.  Cost is not affected by the initial conditions of the habitat patches or the amount of development that has already taken place in the landscape management unit.  

When heterogeneity is introduced, the allocation of land is also determined by the differential land rents.  More development occurs in habitat patches and landscape management units with higher land rents compared with the homogeneous case.  In the heterogeneous land use case, where different land uses have different intensities of damages, the development intensity parameters are factors in the solution with more development occurring in areas zoned for less intensive land uses and the cost to society of achieving the ecological objective is a function of initial habitat patch sizes.";"Bauer, Dana Marie

We studied tree cover patterns in relationship to urban morphology (for example, housing density, parcel size), socioeconomic factors (for example, education, income, lifestyle characteristics), and historical legacies in Baltimore, Maryland, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Utilizing a multimodel inference approach and bivariate analyses, we analyzed two primary datasets employed in previous research predicting urban tree cover—one comprising continuous data (US Census), and the other consisting of categorical variables (Claritas PRIZM) that incorporate consumer purchasing data. Continuous data revealed that urban morphological characteristics were better predictors of tree cover patterns than socioeconomic factors in Raleigh and Baltimore at the parcel and neighborhood scales. Although the categorical dataset provided some evidence for the importance of socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics in predicting tree cover patterns, the hierarchical nature of these data preclude separating the impacts of these factors from levels of urbanization. Bivariate analyses of continuous and categorical variables revealed that the highest correlation coefficients were associated with variables describing urban morphology—parcel size, percent pervious area, and house age. In Baltimore, historical census data were better predictors of present-day tree cover than census data from recent years. Most notably, parcel size, a key predictor of tree cover, has decreased with time in Raleigh to sizes consistently seen in Baltimore. Our findings demonstrate that urban morphology, the main driver of tree cover patterns in these cities, may lead to the homogenization of tree canopy in Raleigh and Baltimore in the future.";"Bigsby, Kevin M.

The 1,770 km 2 watershed is located in Alabama and Mississippi. Simulation of the watershed processes were tested at the hillslope and at the watershed outlet for the period between 1985 and 2003. Three LU/LC databases were used: the Geographic Information Retrieval and Analysis System (GIRAS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover product (MODIS MOD12Q1), and the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). The two main land use categories revealed by the three LU/LC databases were forest and agricultural lands. Whereas forest cover mechanisms were the main source of water loss in hydrology simulation, agricultural land was the main source of sediment export in sediment modeling. Land use datasets of coarser spatial resolution (MODIS and GIRAS) produced larger HSPF estimations for sediment fraction values than land use datasets identifying smaller percentages of those agricultural land cover classes (NLCD). Differences in agricultural land characterization among the land use datasets showed that sediment predictions were more sensitive than streamflow predictions to the scale and resolution of land use datasets. Choosing the right land use dataset will impact the modeling of sediments and, potentially, other water quality constituents that are related with agricultural activities.";"Diaz-Ramirez, Jairo N.

"AGRIS:US2012204309";"Impact of Farmland Preservation Programs on the Rate of Urban Development";"";"Due to high losses of agricultural land in urbanizing areas over the past several years, state and local governments have adopted zoning regulations, right-to-farm ordinances, preferential property tax programs, and other means to protect agricultural land resources. Critics of the farmland preservation efforts note that these programs may only delay the ultimate conversion of farmland to urban uses and may simply shift urban development to neighboring areas (positive spillover effects). An alternative means of permanently protecting farmland is provided by purchase of development rights (PDR) programs, which enroll acreage from landowners who voluntarily sell the development rights to their farmland. Although ownership and all other property rights are retained by the owner, the option to develop the land for urban uses is removed from the current and all subsequent landowners. The purpose of this paper is to develop an empirical model of the impact of PDR programs on urban land development rates. 
To estimate the empirical model, we form a dependent variable based on county level rates of urban development from the USDA National Resources Inventory (NRI) data base for nine states in the Northeast US that have adopted farmland protection measures during the sample period (1982-1997). The set of explanatory variables include dummy variables for the existence of an active PDR program in the county and active PDR programs in adjacent counties plus measures of demographics, farm returns, population growth, income, and site-specific factors gathered from several sources (e.g., Census of Agriculture, Census of Population, and USDA). The model is estimated using the ordinary least squares technique. Two key policy-relevant hypotheses: (1) PDR programs did not reduce the rate of urban development and (2) PDR programs did not induce positive spillover effects on neighboring counties. The test results suggest that PDRs may have had important more significant impact in the earlier years and did not cause positive spillover effects.";"Brinkman, Blondel A.

"AGRIS:US201500162889";"Integration of multi-sensor data to assess grassland dynamics in a Yellow River sub-watershed";"";"Grasslands form the dominant land cover in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and provide a reliable indicator by being strongly correlated with regional terrestrial ecological status. Remote sensing can provide information useful for vegetation quality assessments, but no single sensor can meet the needs for the high temporal–spatial resolution required for such assessments on a watershed scale. To observe long-term grassland dynamics in the Longliu Watershed located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images were integrated to obtain Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. The MODIS images were used to identify patterns of monthly variation. With the temporal dynamics of NDVI provided by the MODIS images, an exponential regression model was obtained that described the relationship between Julian day and NDVI. Four time-series data sets from multi-spectral sensors were constructed to obtain regional grassland NDVI information from 1977 to 2006 in the Longliu Watershed. Using the daily NDVI correlation coefficient, NDVI values for different days were obtained from Landsat series images, standardised to the same day and integrated into TM format by using NDVI coefficients between the four different sensors. Thus, the NDVI data obtained from multi-sensors on different days were integrated into a comparable format. A regression analysis correlating the NDVI data from two sensors with fresh grass biomass showed that the integration procedure was reliable.";"Ouyang, Wei

"AGRIS:US2016217758";"INCOME EFFICIENCY OF SOIL CONSERVATION TECHNIQUES IN HAITI";"";"Soil erosion and environmental degradation are serious problems facing food security in Haiti. In 1999, the annual soil loss due to erosion was estimated at 36 million m3 tons. The government of Haiti has been aware of these deteriorating conditions and has sought international assistance to reduce these problems. In 1993, the United States Agency for International Development implemented a soil conservation project and millions of dollars were spent on the encouragement of adoption of soil conservation measures; yet the problems of soil degradation is still menacing food security in Haiti. Hence the need to evaluate the impact of soil conservation in Haiti is important. A survey of 951 farmers, who adopted soil conservation techniques in Haiti, was conducted. The survey participants were composed of 83.6% males and 16.2% females. About 53.3% were illiterate and 42.9 and 4.0% received up to eight years schooling and primary education, respectively. The age group range included 8.5% who were less than 30, 30.8% who were between 30 and 45 years old and 32.6% who were between 45 and 60, and 28.1% who were above 60 years old. The results showed that the soil conservation techniques most commonly adopted by farmers were crop bands, alley cropping, rock walls, and gully plugs. Most farmers were satisfied with the soil conservation techniques adopted and they were aware of the benefits of these techniques. There was no significant difference in income per ha for the soil conservation techniques: alley cropping, rock walls and gully plugs. The net income per ha for crop bands was superior to that of alley cropping, rock walls and gully plugs. All models had a good fit as shown by a relatively high adjusted R2 and a low mean square error. The model results showed in general the number of plots, the elevation, the number of trees greater than 10 centimeters in circumference, the evaluation of the soil by farmers as fertile and the number of crops unique to the soil conservation technique positively influence the net revenue per ha.  The average age of head of household negatively influenced the net income per hectare.";"Jolly, Curtis M.

"AGRIS:US201301807927";"Soil quality in a Mediterranean area of Southern Italy as related to different land use types";"";"The impact of different land use types on soil quality was evaluated by measuring several soil properties that are sensitive to stress or disturbance and by using two synthetic approaches, i.e. a numerical quality index and multivariate analysis. A Minimum Data Set of soil indicators was selected including physical (texture, bulk density and water holding capacity), chemical (pH, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total and mineral nitrogen, available K, Ca, Mg, P contents and total Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn contents) and biological (microbial biomass, fungal mycelium, soil potential respiration and potentially mineralizable nitrogen) parameters. These parameters were assayed on soil samples collected with seasonal frequency (except for physical parameters, determined only in autumn) in an area of Southern Italy under different land use types (i.e. permanent crops, grazing lands, shrublands, coniferous and mixed forests). Moreover, for most of the land use types, a further distinction on the basis of topographic position (hill, middle-hill and plain) was carried out. Annual means of the data (except for texture) were used to calculate a soil quality index (SQI) and elaborated by multivariate analyses (Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis, PCA) in order to distinguish among different soil quality classes. Data indicated a clear difference in soil quality among the studied areas: low soil quality (SQI<0.55) in almost all permanent crops; intermediate soil quality (0.55<SQI<0.70) in shrublands, grazing lands, coniferous forest and middle-hill olive grove (the only crop with an herb layer on the soil surface); high soil quality (SQI>0.70) in mixed forests. Results suggested that the permanent crop management had generally a strong negative impact on soil quality, while the moderate grazing activity and the crop management that leaves an herb cover on the soil had a lower negative impact. Nevertheless, the abandonment of cultivated lands, with consequent development of shrublands, produced an improvement of soil quality suggesting a good recovery capacity in the studied soil.";"Marzaioli, R.

"AGRIS:US201500054983";"Comparative Breakeven Analysis of Annual Grain and Perennial Switchgrass Cropping Systems on Claypan Soil Landscapes";"";"The Central Claypan region is an important agricultural production contributor in the U.S. Midwest. Because of the tendency for grain yield fluctuations caused by water stress, however, claypan soils may have potential for conversion from grain to grass production in support of biomass energy markets and conservation programs. This study examined the economic potential of transitioning from grain to perennial switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) production on claypan soils using comparative breakeven analysis. Partial budgets for a corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation and a perennial switchgrass cropping system were developed. Yield data from research plots with varying topsoil depths defined by the underlying claypan layer were used to establish yield expectations as affected by topsoil depth. Switchgrass yield projections for the claypan region were simulated with the Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model. Comparative breakeven prices for two switchgrass cultivars ranged from US$65 on marginal, eroded soils to US$124 Mg−1 on soils with >27 cm of topsoil. Breakeven yields with a biomass price of US$40 Mg−1 would require yield increases of up to 450% for lower yielding cultivars. The switchgrass cultivar Kanlow holds the most promise for biomass production on claypan soils; with an average projected yield of 12.56 Mg ha−1, breakeven prices fall to around US$60–80 Mg−1 for marginal soils with <15 cm of topsoil. Based on these projections, perennial switchgrass shows potential to compete with conventional grain crops at reasonable yield levels on eroded soils in the Central Claypan region.";"Landers, Greg W.

"AGRIS:US201400133140";"Pastoralism, sustainability, and marketing. A review";"";"Pastoralism is a highly traditional production system for livestock and livestock products. Under the surface of a seeming stability a variety of pressures of the modern time all seem to accumulate to put the sustainability of the pastoralist production system to the test. Population growth and growing demand for meat, put pressure on the natural resources used by pastoralists because the grazing lands that are saved from encroachment or conversion into arable lands, may be overexploited. Changing climatic conditions, such as frequent droughts, put even more pressure on the system. With so many challenges coming together, it is important to analyze whether pastoralism in itself can be considered a sustainable production system that in principle can cope with these challenges and thus deserves support from policy, or whether the pastoralist production system has fundamental misfit with today’s challenges, in the sense that it is detrimental to the world’s scarce resources. The scientific literature on pastoralism provides an important entry point to such fact finding. This article therefore analyzes 125 recent research contributions to the literature on pastoralism on their inferences as to whether pastoralism is a sustainable production system for livestock-based products. The results show substantial consensus that pastoralism is seen as a sustainable production system for livestock and livestock products (78 of the 125 studies contain sustainability inferences, of which 58 infer that the pastoral system is sustainable, while only 2 come to a negative conclusion). A total of 18 studies point however at conditional factors. The main factors that can potentially explain differences in the conclusions on whether pastoralism is sustainable pertain among others to the domain of sustainability, including abiotic and biotic factors representing the planet dimension, mobility, adaptation, indigenous knowledge, institutions and population growth as people-related factors, and economic contribution as a profit-related factor. Other factors include the ecosystem and land use types, policy instruments, constant/flexible stocking, controlled/mobile grazing, and diversification policies, as well as academic discipline, research methods and geographic focus. A quantitative test shows that consideration of adaptation, institutions and mobility are most strongly related to the sustainability inference. Such studies suggest that pastoralists that can adapt to external conditions, that are supported by effective institutions and that can exercise mobility, are more likely to behave sustainably. We argue that marketing can help to meet these conditions. Because the role of marketing has received scant attention in the context of pastoralists and because it has often been narrowly interpreted as market integration, we further explain the potential role of marketing in sustainable pastoralism. The role of marketing comes down to a strategic competence that enables pastoralists to create value for target buyers with whom they may develop economic and social relationships that can be favorable for both parties. Because it is likely to stabilize prices and generate a long-term perspective on value creation, and therefore on resource use, marketing can contribute to a pastoral system that supports people, planet, and profit.";"Tessema, Workneh Kassa

Subfossil beetle remains from archaeological sites have proven invaluable for examining past living conditions, human activities, and their impacts on landscapes and ecosystems. 2. In Iceland, specific economic practices (e.g. land management and natural resource exploitation) and major historical events (i.e. colonisation, economic intensification and commercialisation, and urbanisation) have affected local environments and left recognisable traces in the beetle subfossil record. 3. Understanding the ecology of synanthropic beetles is crucial if they are to be employed in highâresolution reconstructions of past lifeways and their ecological impacts, yet, because buildings' interiors are rarely the object of systematic entomological research, the ecological requirements of many such species are poorly understood. 4. A survey was conducted of live and dead beetle faunas from habitats that have so far been largely neglected by entomological research: stable manure and stored hay inside farm buildings, two key facets of a northern European pastoral economy. 5. The present results clarify the ecological requirements of some underâstudied synanthropic beetles and the processes by which their exoskeletons may become incorporated into the archaeological record while also producing new records of exotic species recently introduced to Iceland. 6. This paper provides crucial guidance for the interpretation of archaeological beetle assemblages and highlights the potential of further investigations of indoor insect faunas for clarifying the causes, processes, and ecological impacts of recent bioâinvasions.";"FORBES, VÃRONIQUE

These changes subsequently prompted research to investigate the extent to which bark beetle-altered fuel complexes affect fire behavior. Although not yet rigorously quantified, the results of the investigations, in addition to a growing body of operational experience, indicate that predictable changes in surface, ladder and canopy fuel characteristics do occur over the course of a bark beetle rotation. Input of these changes in fuel characteristics into conventional fire behavior modeling systems can readily provide predictions of potential fire behavior, including the likelihood of crowning. However, several factors limit the direct application of these modeling systems in their current form and consequently, they may largely under predict fire potential in such stands. This presents a concern where extreme fire behavior involving both crowning and spotting coupled with flammable fuel conditions can pose serious challenges to incident management and threaten the safety of firefighters and the general public alike. In this paper, we review the nature and characteristics of bark beetle-altered fuel complexes in the conifer forests of the Interior West and the challenges of understanding the effects on extreme fire behavior, including the initiation and spread of crown fires. We also discuss how emerging fire management plans in the U.S. have begun to integrate wildfire management and other forest health objectives with the specific goal of achieving biodiversity and ecosystem resiliency while simultaneously reducing the existence of hazardous fuel complexes.";"Jenkins, Michael J.

The reform had a positive effect on the wood supply and demand balance. By 2020 the reform led to a 14 to 36 percent decrease of China's imports of industrial roundwood. Concurrently, the rest of the world produced less, but several other countries especially in Europe, imported more. Despite the positive short-term effect of the reform on supply, China's industrial roundwood deficit was still increasing, but at a slower rate, after the reform was complete, due to the high demand induced by China's fast growing economy. Furthermore, while the tenure reform on collective forests mitigated China's timber shortage, it also decreased China's forest stock, with adverse effects for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, globally, this negative effect was compensated by a more than equal increase of forest stock in the rest of the world.";"Zhang, H.

Economic analysis of turbine decommissioning is complicated by a lack of operational experience, as few U.S. projects have been decommissioned. This leads to a lack of data regarding decommissioning costs.

Stable isotope analysis was used to calculate the relative contributions of the tributaries to water yield in the main stem of the Heishui River, while relative coverages of the different vegetation types were calculated from classified Landsat 7 TM satellite images of the study area. We found that all the sub-watersheds were dominated by two vegetation types (subalpine forest and alpine shrub-meadow) which influenced water yields in opposite ways. Lower subalpine forest coverage was significantly associated with higher tributary water yield, whereas lower alpine shrub-meadow coverage was associated with lower tributary water yield. Comparing our results to similar studies at different spatial scales, we found increasing uncertainty in the relationship between vegetation coverage (total and individual community types) and water yields as scale increased. Nevertheless, the quantitative relationships found in our study may prove useful at the appropriate scales by allowing policy makers and managers to use vegetation coverage as an indicator or index of water yield when attempting to manipulate the vegetation of watersheds to reduce the risk of flooding in this region.";"Liu, Yuhong

"AGRIS:US201300950907";"Vegetation response of a mesquite-mixed brush community to aeration";"";"Responses of plant communities to mechanical treatments such as aeration on semiarid rangelands are not clearly understood. Our objective was to compare woody and herbaceous plant cover, density, and diversity on aerated and nontreated rangelands. Five rangeland sites that were aerated with a double/tandem drum aerator during summer 1998 and 5 sites of nontreated rangeland were selected for study on the Chaparral Wildlife Management Area, La Salle County, Tex. Woody plant cover was estimated using the line-intercept method, and stem density was estimated in 30 x 1.5 m plots in 1999 and 2000. Forb and grass cover and density were estimated in 20 x 50 cm quadrats during spring and fall 1999. Woody and herbaceous plant diversity did not differ between treatments. On aerated sites percent woody plant cover was 4-fold less 1-year after aeration and increased 89% from the first to the second growing-season post treatment. Canopy cover of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), twisted acacia (Acacia schaffneri S. Wats.), and Texas pricklypear (Opuntia lindheimeri Engelm.) was greater on nontreated sites. By the second growing season after aeration, density of honey mesquite was greater on aerated sites, whereas Texas pricklypear had declined on aerated sites. Density of spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida Torr.) and Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana Scheele) was greater on aerated sites during the first growing-season post treatment. Cover and stem density of hog-plum (Colubrina texana T. & G.), coma (Bumelia celastrina Kunth), and whitebrush [Aloysia gratissima (Gill. & Hook.) Tron.] did not differ among aerated and nontreated sites by the first growing season after aeration. Forb cover was greater on aerated sites in spring 1999. Fringed signalgrass [Brachiaria ciliatissima (Buckl.) Chase], fall witchgrass [Digitaria cognata (Schult.) Pilger], and bristlegrass (Setaria spp. Beauv.) cover was greater on aerated sites in spring and fall 1999, whereas purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea Nutt.) was greater on nontreated sites. It is unclear to what degree environmental factors such as pre- and post-treatment climatic conditions and herbivory may have influenced vegetation response to aeration. The rapid regrowth of many woody plants following aeration may require the application of maintenance treatments within a relatively short time period to maintain treatment benefits. Aeration reduced total woody plant cover, increased the density of desirable woody plants, maintained woody plant diversity, increased grass cover, and may be a useful tool in managing South Texas rangelands for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Boddaert) and cattle.";"Ruthven, D.C.

"AGRIS:RU2016000303";"Experience and results of agrarian reforms in China and Russia";"Опыт и результаты аграрных  реформ в Китае и России";"Detailed comparative analysis of basic lines of agrarian transformations in China and Russia has been done, its results have been analysed. Not only conceptual differences of the agrarian policy in those countries are demonstrated, but also consequences of concrete political decisions for the development of the branch. The differences are stipulated mainly by two groups of factors. The first of them is the opposite approaches to transforming land relations and the entire system of agrarian relations. After the abolition of people's communes and getting the land plot into long-term rent, the Chinese peasant became the real owner of land, while the overwhelming part of Russian agricultural lands as conditional shares became practically ownerless, which follows directly from existing legislation. In China since 2006 all commissions and levies on agreements of land using, as well as the land tax were abolished. Unprecedented results of rural development in China are stipulated by the combination of market relations with purposeful state regulation and by scaled budgetary support. During the years of reforms the volume of state means, contributed to rural development, increased by 30 times. The second group of factors is connected with perception of agriculture role for the economy of the country on the side of power structures, significance of protectionist component of the agrarian policy, concrete measures and mechanisms of budgetary support. In the economic policy, Chinese leadership outcomes from the fact that the base of economy is composed by the agriculture. In Russia there is no such concept: the absolute dimensions of state support for the agriculture there are significantly less, and at the same time crediting debts of Russian commodity producers dynamically grow. In such situation, it is necessary not improving conducted agrarian policy, but its radical renewal.

Проведен развернутый сравнительный анализ основных направлений аграрных преобразований в Китае и России, проанализированы их результаты. Показаны не только концептуальные различия аграрной политики в этих странах, но и последствия конкретных политических решений для развития отрасли. Различия обусловлены в основном 2-мя группами факторов. Первая из них - противоположные подходы к преобразованию земельных отношений и всей системы аграрных отношений. Китайский крестьянин после отмены народных коммун и получения в долгосрочную аренду земельного участка стал подлинным хозяином земли, тогда как подавляющая часть российских сельхозугодий в виде условных долей стала практически бесхозной, что непосредственно вытекает из действующего законодательства. В Китае с 2006 г. отменены все комиссии и сборы по договорам землепользования, а также земельный налог. Беспрецедентные результаты сельского развития Китая обусловлены сочетанием рыночных отношений с целенаправленным государственным регулированием и с масштабной бюджетной поддержкой. За годы реформ объем государственных средств, вкладываемых в сельское развитие, возрос в 30 раз. Вторая группа факторов связана с осознанием роли сельского хозяйства для экономики страны со стороны властных структур, значимости протекционистской составляющей аграрной политики, конкретных мер и механизмов бюджетной поддержки. В экономической политике китайское руководство исходит из того, что основу экономики составляет сельское хозяйство. В России это понимание отсутствует: абсолютные размеры господдержки сельского хозяйства в ней значительно меньше, в то же время кредиторская задолженность российских товаропроизводителей динамично растет. В этой ситуации необходимо не совершенствование проводимой аграрной политики, а ее радикальное обновление.";"Buzdalov, I.N., The A.A.

"AGRIS:US201301610584";"Using habitat models to determine conservation priorities for pond-breeding amphibians in a privately-owned landscape of northern Idaho, USA";"";"As rural landscapes experience increasing levels of residential development, the persistence of species that rely on them will depend on informed planning and management decisions. An understanding of habitat requirements is essential for setting priorities and developing landscape-level plans for the survival of these species. In many temperate rural landscapes, artificially created ponds may be the only wetlands available for aquatic reproduction by amphibians. The introduction of non-native fish into these ponds reduces survival and prohibits successful reproduction of many native pond-breeding amphibians. We surveyed 105 randomly selected wetlands in a primarily privately-owned, rural landscape in north Idaho, USA, for pond-breeding amphibian larvae in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic multimodel inference and an algorithmic (random forests) approach to model habitat for each species based on local and landscape characteristics. We also used a mail survey to quantify how landowners value fish in their wetlands and their plans for future wetland development and fish stocking. Sixty-seven percent of pond owners reported that fishing in their pond was at least slightly important to them and 36% of owners indicated that they were at least 50% likely to add fish to their ponds in the next 5-10years. Landscape change predictions for this area indicate that forests will become more open due to thinning; habitat models indicated that this is likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs. Habitat models also indicate that Columbia spotted frog breeding sites consist of wetlands on flat ground with high solar insolation and that this species is sensitive to nearby development, indicating that as this landscape becomes further developed, this species may require habitat protection for persistence.";"Goldberg, Caren S.

This discussion has engaged the Superfund community for several years.

The study on the relationship between urban expansion and driving factors in this area is representative. This paper examined urban expansion from the perspective of non-urban to urban conversion, detailing an empirical investigation into the spatiotemporal variations and impact factors of urban expansion in Qingdao. By using the Urban Expansion Intensity Index (UEII) and Urban Expansion Differentiation Index (UEDI), the spatial and temporal difference of urban expansion in the Municipal District, Jiaozhou County, Jimo County, Pingdu County, Jiaonan County and Laixi County were calculated on a county unit data set for the period 1990 to 2008. A GIS and logistical regression models were applied for discussing the results of various factors in land use change. Results indicated that the elevation and slope factors showed negative effects to urban expansion. Distance to the city center and to road both also conferred negative effects. The population density and GDP were vital and positive factors of urban conversion. Neighborhood factors showed consistently positive effects. The magnitude of factors was various in different counties. A better understanding of the factors influencing land use change could support land use management and planning decisions.";"Qiuying, Li

To quantify the extent of the cropland degradation, this paper combines object-based change detection and spectral mixture analysis for vegetation cover decline mapping in irrigated agro-ecosystems in Uzbekistan based on multitemporal Landsat TM images from 1998 to 2009. The results of the change detection reveal that the cadastral field parcels, characterized by vegetation cover decrease, occupied 18% (52,938 ha) of the cropland area. Spatial distribution of fields with decreased vegetation cover was mainly associated with abandoned cropland and land with inherently low-fertility soils located on the outreaches of the irrigation system and bordering natural sandy deserts. The comparison with the land degradation map based on trend analyses of 250 m MODIS NDVI time series 2000–2010 yielded an overall agreement of 93%. The proposed approach is a useful supplement to the commonly applied trend analysis for detecting land degradation in cases when plot-specific data are needed but satellite time series of high spatial resolution are not available. The derived parcel-specific, spatial information supports better informed decisions on cropland rehabilitation measures.";"Dubovyk, Olena

Focus groups first identified drivers of intensification in their sector, then identified the strategies they perceived as available, and evaluated the identified strategies in terms of favourability. For a researcher selected intensification strategy in each pastoral sector, benefits, barriers and solutions, and the relationship between farmer goals and the selected strategy was examined.The three main drivers of intensification in the sheep industry were profit, higher land values and return on capital. The researcher chosen strategy, high fecundity sheep, was viewed by the focus group as having benefits of increased financial security, increased profit, better return on capital and better land utilisation. However the strategy was seen as conflicting with other desirable goals such as lifestyle, social life, work variety, self reliance, environmental concerns and animal welfare.The three main drivers of intensification in the dairy sector were declining market prices, need for increased profit and need for increased productivity. The researcher chosen strategy, robotic milking, was viewed as having benefits of: reduced labour requirements, enhanced lifestyle, greater job satisfaction, reduce operational costs and increased profit. Implementation cost was viewed as a barrier as was the need for new specialised technical skills.The three main drivers of intensification in the deer industry were return on investment, competition from other land uses and returns per hectare compared with other pastoral sectors. The researcher chosen strategy, 100kg weaner by 1st June, had benefits of increased management options, increased profit, achievement of animals’ genetic potential, better predictability and a higher kill-out yield. The strategy presents challenges to animal welfare – an important consideration for the group.Three industry enterprises (dairy, calf rearers, and beef finishers) are involved in beef production. All three agreed that profit was the main driver for intensification. Theresearcher chosen strategy was dairy/beef progeny. Benefits of this strategy for the industry were: increased profit, access to prime markets, higher yielding quicker growing animals, and better behaved animals. The primary barrier to the success of this strategy was the need for co-operation across the three industry enterprises and the processors, and the need to ensure increased profits are distributed to all parts of the chain. Dairy farmers (the source of 65% of animals farmed for beef) were particular concerned about animal welfare issues and the consequent financial risks presented to their operations by this strategy.";"Small, Bruce

Our results suggest that remittances improve migrant families' access to agricultural land which – depending on the context – fosters more equitable local land distribution patterns or land concentration by migrant families. Changes in the political economy of the country also combine to stimulate these patterns, while remittances contribute to secure land rights held by migrant households. But even though migrant households are acquiring more land, the trend does not change the traditional pattern of land distribution in the country. Regarding forests, significant changes were not observed in two of the communities, while in one we observed forest decline and in the last, forest recovery. A trend away from reliance on the land for survival results in forest recovery.";"Aguilar‐Støen, Mariel

It uses title deed information to determine year of sale via a number of sources. The main finding of this research is that a great deal of land changed ownership during this period, which, if the government had been committed to land reform, it could have acted upon. Evidence suggests as much as 67 per cent of white‐owned land changed ownership after 1980. The second is that, while a large amount of land did change hands, it was not the 80 per cent that many white farmers and their supporters have claimed. The figure of 69 per cent is still very high, but it is apparent that much of this did not represent ‘true’ transfer of land. By further investigating the land that did change hands, this paper also raises questions about (a) the possibilities of market‐led land reform in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa, and (b) the relationship between white capital and the new political elite in the postcolonial state.";"Pilossof, Rory";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land reform;farmers";"";"";"ZWE";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600079195";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.12090";"";"";"";"32-49"

Institutional capacity to re-allocate water between users and uses under stress from multiple sources is a key concern. Climate change threatens to add to those stresses in snowmelt systems by changing the timing of runoff and possibly increasing the severity and duration of drought. This article examines Snake and Klamath River institutions for their ability to resolve conflict induced by demand growth, drought, and environmental constraints on water use.

We investigated the historical distribution patterns of three declining woodland birds, the Marsh Tit (Poecile palustris), Willow Tit (Poecile montana) and Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor), in relation to a parsimonious landscape metric for describing habitat availability in Britain. Bird distributions were derived from two field-based atlas surveys, conducted in 1968–1972 and 1988–1991, and used to classify areas of the landscape for each species as retained, lost or gained between atlas periods, or unoccupied in both. We used remotely-sensed land cover data from 1990 to compare percentage habitat cover between landscape areas classified by bird occupation, and regional summary data from national woodland inventories to investigate changes in habitat cover and bird distributions. Percentage habitat cover was a sufficient landscape metric to explain the distribution pattern of all three bird species; habitat cover was greatest in areas where each species was retained between atlas surveys, significantly less in areas from which species were lost, and least in areas that remained unoccupied. Reductions in Marsh Tit distribution were less in regions that showed greater increases in habitat cover, but there was no such relationship for other species. Results indicated that spatial studies could be used to infer aspects of the spatial ecology of species where field data is lacking: by comparing distribution patterns with the relatively well-studied Marsh Tit, we found support for the assumption that the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker occupies very large territories in Britain, and provided evidence that the spatial habitat requirements of the Marsh Tit could be used as a proxy for the data-poor Willow Tit. The results showed that the habitat cover required to retain each species in the landscape had increased over time, illustrating how spatial studies can be used to identify priorities for further research and suggest conservation measures for declining species, and these are discussed.";"Broughton, Richard K.

The valley occupies a distinctive geographical setting on the edge of the Western Himalaya near the Hindukush range and supports a high biodiversity; pastoralism is the main land use. There have been no previous quantitative ecological studies in this region. This study was undertaken to (i) analyze and describe vegetation using classification and ordination techniques, (ii) identify environmental gradients responsible for plant community distributions and (iii) assess the anthropogenic pressures on the vegetation and identify priorities for conservation. Phytosociological characteristics of species were measured alongside environmental variables. A total of 198 species from 68 families were quantified at 144 stations along 24 transects across an elevation range of 2450–4100m. Correspondence Analysis techniques i.e., Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were used to determine vegetation–environment relationships. Results show vegetation changes with altitude from moist-cool temperate communities characterized by woody species, to more dry-cold subalpine and alpine herbaceous communities. Plant species diversity is optimal at middle altitudes (2800–3400m); at lower altitudes (2400–2800m) it is reduced by anthropogenic impacts and at higher altitudes (3400–4100m) by shallow soils and high summer grazing pressure. A large number of plant species of conservation concern were identified in the study and an assessment made of the main threats to their survival.";"Khan, Shujaul Mulk

The Act has limited clearing of native vegetation and development to crops and pasture, has protected biodiversity, and may have enhanced soil and water conservation. But an analysis of variations in the prices paid for farm land in Moree Plains Shire, with the complementary hedonic and bargaining methods, shows how buyers, sellers, and the market as a whole, value the characteristics of the land. It shows that the Act has led to substantial losses in land values for the farmers. The Act has imposed higher costs on those who had kept most vegetation, and on those who most need to retain their options to clear and develop. Stewardship payments will alleviate the financial situation for some and property plans will provide long-term security for both farmer and vegetation. But the magnitudes of the losses suggest that introduction of individual policies like these must be preceded by a review of the whole strategy of vegetation protection in New South Wales. We must first decide how much to protect and how to allocate the losses in an equitable manner.";"Sinden, Jack A.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016219090";"http://purl.umn.edu/12903";"";"";"";""

However, the remoteness of many sites or a lack of resources means these data are frequently not available. Remote sensing may provide a solution, but large-scale mapping and change detection may not be appropriate, necessitating site-level assessments. These need to be easy to undertake, rapid and cheap. We present an example of a Web-based solution based on free and open-source software and standards (including PostGIS, OpenLayers, Web Map Services, Web Feature Services and GeoServer) to support assessments of land-cover change (and validation of global land-cover maps). Authorised users are provided with means to assess land-cover visually and may optionally provide uncertainty information at various levels: from a general rating of their confidence in an assessment to a quantification of the proportions of land-cover types within a reference area. Versions of this tool have been developed for the TREES-3 initiative (Simonetti et al., 2011). This monitors tropical land-cover change through ground-truthing at latitude/longitude degree confluence points, and for monitoring of change within and around Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by Birdlife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In this paper we present results from the second of these applications. We also present further details on the potential use of the land-cover change assessment tool on sites of recognised conservation importance, in combination with NDVI and other time series data from the eStation (a system for receiving, processing and disseminating environmental data). We show how the tool can be used to increase the usability of Earth observation data by local stakeholders and experts, and assist in evaluating the impact of protection regimes on land-cover change.";"Bastin, L.

Carnivore research and management have been limited by the predominantly cryptic nature of carnivores, sometimes also by their large-scale habitat requirements and their remote distributions. As a consequence, many carnivore species currently remain under-studied. The increased availability and facilitated interpretation of remote-sensing imagery, combined with recent developments in landscape ecology and geographic information systems, have provided a wealth of analytical tools to overcome many of these traditional setbacks. These can be coupled with advances in multivariate statistics and species distribution models to formalise the link between spatial patterns in environmental variables and species occurrence. Such methods allow a greater understanding of the processes shaping habitat use, the effects of poaching and land-cover change, and assist in the design and monitoring of more targeted actions towards carnivores' long-term conservation.";"García-Rangel, S.

Around 7000 protected areas seek to safeguard the continent's rich biodiversity, but many of them face increasing management challenges. Human disturbances permeating into the parks directly and indirectly affect the ecological functioning and integrity of protected areas. With the envisaged expansion of the protected area network and further expected population and economic growth in the region, the competition between nature conservation and resources demands is likely to increase. The regular monitoring of land cover in and around protected areas can support the early detection of conservation conflicts. In this paper, we evaluate the use of the annual time series of MODIS Land Cover (LC) type product between 2003 and 2009 to monitor land cover changes at continental scale. We use the mean classification confidence and change frequency as indicators to assess the temporal consistency of the MODIS LC classifier for accurately monitoring land cover changes.

Since many shrubs native to the understory of the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem have market potential, one possibility is the intercropping of select species in the between-row spacing of young longleaf pine plantations. The objective of this study was to evaluate how interspecific competition affects the fate of ¹⁵N fertilizer when American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana L.), wax myrtle (Morella cerifera (L.) Small) and inkberry (Ilex glabra (L.) A.Gray) are intercropped with longleaf pine. Nitrogen derived from fertilizer (NDF), utilization of fertilizer N (UFN) and recovery of fertilizer N (RFNsoil) were compared between agroforestry and monoculture (treeless) treatments to assess the effects of competition. Results varied by species, with NDF being higher for C. americana foliage and lower for all M. cerifera tissues in the agroforestry treatment. No effect was observed for I. glabra. UFN was lower for all species in the agroforestry treatment. RFNsoil was higher in the agroforestry treatment for I. glabra, but no treatment effects were observed for C. americana or M. cerifera. Overall, while it is clear that interspecific competition was present in the agroforestry treatment, the inefficiency of fertilizer use suggests that nitrogen was not the most limiting resource. Management interventions, particularly those that address competition for water, will likely be critical to the success of this system.";"Hagan, Donald L.

The farmers' perceptions were identified using rapid and participatory rural appraisal (RRA/PRA) tools. The study catchment, having a semiarid continental climate and located on the Loess Plateau in northern China, covered an area of 3.5 km2. Most of the land users were dependent on subsistence agriculture. There were important topographic variations in the catchment and arable cropping on steep slopes brought about degradation of land due to water erosion. The biophysical monitoring, soil survey and RRA/PRA survey, carried out one year prior to the present investigation, supplied the data needed for identification of preliminary limiting land properties and land evaluation units. The land properties that needed further investigation in the present study were slope aspect, soil workability, flooding hazard and farmers' criteria on choice of land-use type. The farmers were able to give a comprehensive picture of the spatial and temporal variation and the importance for land-use options of the land properties concerned, and thereby complement the information gained from empirical results (measurements). In order to guarantee good production for dry as well as wet years, both south- and north-facing sites were chosen for most crops, and the slope aspect did not need to be differentiated in the final land suitability evaluation for arable crops. Grassland, however, was considered to be more suitable than woodland on south-facing sites. Hard soil layers were found to be important, since they affected soil workability and erosion negatively, giving slightly reduced suitability for the land units in which they occurred. Flooding events affecting crops on alluvial soils negatively were considered to occur once every 5 to 10 years, which is considered to be a low rate, so this property was therefore not included in the final suitability evaluation.";"Messing, I.

In 1997 and 1998, a major land redistribution was undertaken in the Amhara Region, reducing landlessness where implemented. While the impacts of such redistributions have been hotly debated, little empirical evidence exists concerning the actual impacts of redistribution. We find that land redistribution in the Amhara Region has had a positive impact on land productivity, by increasing access to land for farmers who are more interested or able to use purchased inputs such as fertilizer and herbicides. Our results, however, do not show much effect of the recent land redistribution or expectations of future redistribution on land improvement and management. Thus, to the extent that investments in land improvement are necessary for conservation purposes, it appears that policy change to stop land redistributions is unlikely to have a substantial impact on reducing land degradation. Credit and extension programmes and improving land rental markets, however, present better strategies for improving land management in this region of Ethiopia.";"Benin, S.

Based on the types of recreational services offered, two types of landowners have been identified: Productivists and Ruralists. They differ on their extent of Recreational Multifunctionality, farm household attributes and farm representation. Both types of landowners also have different behavior and understanding of agroforestry. This study builds on the Recreational Multifunctionality construct to identify message content, channels and agencies that can better facilitate the diffusion of agroforestry. In 2006, 353 randomly selected landowners from Missouri were interviewed and clustered in two groups: Productivists (38.0%) and Ruralists (62.0%). These groups were examined to identify differences regarding their perceptions of being a good farmer (i.e., message content); their preferred source of information (i.e., communication channel); and their preferred agencies for learning purposes (i.e., communication agencies). Study results show differences between Productivists and Ruralists in all three aspects of diffusion examined (i.e., message content, channels and agencies), suggesting that all landowners should not be approached in the same way when promoting agroforestry. Messages conveyed to Productivists should emphasize the economic benefits of agroforestry, while messages to Ruralists should emphasize the conservation benefits of agroforestry. Touring farms with active tree management is a good way to disseminate agroforestry practices among Productivists while state and federal extension agents appear to be more suitable to approach Ruralists. Both groups can effectively be reached using printed materials, especially through official conservation magazines.";"Barbieri, Carla

"AGRIS:US2016212056";"On Self Selection in PES Schemes";"";"This paper investigates participation by farmers in the UK Environmental Stewardship Schemes and how decisions to join the scheme are related to land productivity levels on the one hand and ecological conservation on the other. In particular the paper will explore the extent to which the self selection of farmers onto the scheme influences likely scheme performance.  The first part of the paper analyses a theoretical model for the provision of ecological services where an uninformed government agency offers to contracts to well-informed farmers.  The results of this analysis indicate the extent to which self selection by farmers can impair the efficiency of PES schemes and point to specific strategies that might be used by a government agency to mitigate these effects.  These results are used to motivate the empirical analysis of a sample of participants in the UK’s Environmental Stewardship Schemes (ESS). We use a comprehensive dataset for more than 10,000 ESS agreements over different years to estimate different regression models. The results of this preliminary analysis can inform policy makers on a more adequate design of conservation schemes with respect to positive and/or negative effects of self-selection.";"Russell, Noel P.

The different extent of the reform and its different timing across regions provide a natural experiment to test how time and risk preferences affect a households’ forest investment response to the reform. Empirically, we combine original field experiment data on time and risk preferences collected among 103 households with an original panel survey data set collected among the same 103 households, which contains data for three years: 2000 (before the reform), 2005 and 2008 (after the reform) in a difference-in-differences framework. We examine three measures of forest management activity, including: the value of labor allocated to applying forest inputs, the expenditure on forest inputs, and the value of labor allocated to harvesting. The status of the forest tenure reform on each forest plot is captured by an indicator variable of whether or not the household has a forest certificate for the plot. Results indicate that forest plot certification has not had the expected impact of increasing investment in forest resources, in terms of labor to apply and expenditure on forest inputs (chemical fertilizer, pesticide and seed). However, forest plot certification has had the expected impact on harvesting behavior, as less harvesting labor was allocated to plots with forest certificates. Furthermore, results indicate that risk aversion, as well as a household’s liquidity constraint, have an impact on forest management responses to forest certification. The results of this paper have wide implications to policymakers in China and elsewhere by informing when property right reforms may not work as intended. The results indicate that instruments to deal with risks and poverty need to be coupled with such reforms in order to increase investment in long-term, productivity enhancing forest activities.";"Sullivan, Karen A.

Relevant thematic layers pertaining to the causative factors for landslide occurrences, such as slope, aspect, relative relief, lithology, tectonic structures, lineaments, land use and land cover, distance to drainage, drainage density and anthropogenic factors like distance to road, have been generated using remote sensing images, field survey, ancillary data and GIS techniques. The coefficients of the causative factors retained by the BLR model along with the constant have been used to construct the landslide susceptibility map of the study area, which has further been categorized into four landslide susceptibility zones from high to very low. The resultant landslide susceptibility map was validated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showing an accuracy of 95.2 % for an independent set of test samples. The result also showed a strong agreement between distribution of existing landslides and predicted landslide susceptibility zones.";"Kundu, S.

"AGRIS:US201600069120";"Vegetation Dynamics from Denoised NDVI Using Empirical Mode Decomposition";"";"A novel approach to study vegetation dynamics is introduced, using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to analyze NDVI time series. The NDVI time series which is nonlinear and nonstationary can be decomposed by EMD into components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), based on inherent temporal scales. The highest frequency component which has been found to represent noise is subtracted from the original NDVI series; thus smoothing the noisy signal. The different key features describing vegetation phenology have been extracted by analyzing the noise free signal. The lowest frequency component (last IMF) is the trend in the NDVI series. The trend in the series has been identified finding the Sen’s slope of last IMF, and the non-parametric seasonal Mann–Kendall test has been used to confirm the significance of the observed trend. The method has been applied on per–pixel basis to the SPOT Vegetation NDVI product covering Northeast India and surrounding regions for the time span of 1998–2009. Results show that the method has performed well in identifying the pixel clusters with significant trends. Hotspot regions with severe vegetation degeneration have been identified, and the relationship of the observed trends with the expected causative variables such as land use and land cover, topographic relief, and anthropogenic causes has been explored. The spatial locations of these critical regions closely matches with the findings of the previous studies carried out locally in the region, mainly indicating the shifting cultivation practice to be the main cause for land cover change.";"Verma, Rahul

A long term climatic database (1980–2003) was prepared to compute decadal rainfall and temperature variations of 13 IMD stations in part of Madhya Pradesh state. The climatic database was used in soil water balance software–BUDGET to compute crop specific length of growing period (LGP) and biophysical production potential such as water limited crop yield potential of each soil types for soybean crop. Water limited crop yield potential of soils were found to be varied from 33 to 100 and LGP ranged from 65 to 180 days in the area. FAO based land suitability was analyzed in association with the water limited yield potential for better appraisal of land potential and assess their suitability in rainfed area. FAO based land suitability indicated 2.45 % area as highly suitable and 57.49 % area as moderately suitable. However, integration of water limited crop yield potential with FAO based land suitability lead to agro-climatic suitability analysis indicated 17.60 % and 40.03 % area, respectively as highly suitable and moderately suitable. FAO based land evaluation showed 88.13 % of plains as moderately suitable whereas agro-climatic suitability indicated only 47.79 %.

"AGRIS:US201600069122";"Monitoring Urban Landscape Dynamics Over Delhi (India) Using Remote Sensing (1998–2011) Inputs";"";"Urbanization is increasingly becoming a widespread phenomenon at all scales of development around the globe. Be it developing or developed nations, all are witnessing urbanization at very high pace. In order to study its impacts, various methodologies and techniques are being implemented to measure growth of urban extents over spatial and temporal domains. But urbanization being a very dynamic phenomenon has been facing ambiguities regarding methods to study its dynamism. This paper aims at quantifying urban expansion in Delhi, the capital city of India. The process has been studied using urban land cover pattern derived from Landsat TM/ETM satellite data for two decades (1998–2011). These maps show that built-up increased by 417 ha in first time period (1998–2003) and 6,633 ha during next period (2003–2011) of study. For quantification of metrics for urban expansion, the Urban Landscape Analysis Tool (ULAT) was employed. Land cover mapping was done with accuracy of 92.67 %, 93.3 % and 96 % respectively for years 1998, 2003 and 2011. Three major land covers classes mapped are; (i) built-up, (ii) water and (iii) other or non-built-up. The maps were then utilized to extract degree of urbanization based on spatial density of built-up area consisting of seven classes, (i) Urban built-up, (ii) Suburban built-up,(iii) Rural built-up, (iv) Urbanized open land, (v) Captured open land, (vi) Rural open land and (vii) Water. These classes were demarcated based on the urbanness of cells. Similarly urban footprint maps were generated. The two time maps were compared to qualitatively and quantitatively capture the dynamics of urban expansion in the city. Along with urbanized area and urban footprint maps, the new development areas during the study time periods were also identified. The new development areas consisted of three major categories of developments, (i) infill, (ii) extension and (iii) leapfrog.";"Sharma, Richa

The entire basin was divided into ten sub basins comprising 107 hydrological response units on the basis of unique slope, soil and land cover classes using SWAT model. Sensitivity analysis of SWAT model was performed to examine the critical input variables of the study area. For Ken basin, curve number, available water capacity, soil depth, soil evaporation compensation factor and threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer (GWQ_MN) were found to be the most sensitive parameters. Yearly and monthly calibration (1985–1996) and validation (1997–2009) were performed using the observed discharge data of the Banda site in the Ken basin. Performance evaluation of the model was carried out using coefficient of determination, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error‐observations standard deviation ratio, percent bias and index of agreement criterion. It was found that SWAT model can be successfully applied for hydrological evaluation of the Ken basin, India. The water balance analysis was carried out to evaluate water balance of the Ken basin for 25 years (1985–2009). The water balance exhibited that the average annual rainfall in the Ken basin is about 1132 mm. In this, about 23% flows out as surface run‐off, 4% as groundwater flow and about 73% as evapotranspiration. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Murty, P. S.

Different scenarios based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral data and derived vegetation indices and textural images and different classification algorithms, maximum likelihood classification (MLC), artificial neural network (ANN), classification tree analysis (CTA) and object-based classification (OBC), were explored. The results indicate that a combination of vegetation indices as extra bands into Landsat TM multi-spectral bands did not improve the overall classification performance, but the combination of textural images was valuable for improving vegetation classification accuracy. In particular, the combination of both vegetation indices and textural images into TM multi-spectral bands improved the overall classification accuracy (OCA) by 5.6% and the overall kappa coefficient (OKC) by 6.25%. Comparison of the different classification algorithms indicated that CTA and ANN have poor classification performance in this research, but OBC improved primary forest and pasture classification accuracies. This research indicates that use of textural images or use of OBC are especially valuable for improving the vegetation classes such as upland and liana forest classes that have complex stand structures and large patch sizes.";"Li, Guiying

Nonetheless, one of the most critical life-history stages in birds falls between egg-laying and fledging, and identifying the factors causing offspring mortality during this period provides valuable knowledge. We quantified the number of laid White Stork eggs and the proportion of eggs that turned into fledglings in an agriculture-dominated region in Eastern Germany. Moreover, we identified the factors among land cover, weather and arrival dates, which influenced these two reproductive measures the most, and analysed the monitored mortality causes. On average, four eggs were laid per nest, and 57.8 % of the eggs turned into fledglings. The number of eggs laid was best explained by the negative effect of the arrival date of the second stork, while the percentage of eggs that turned into fledglings was more dependent on weather: most important parameters were mean temperature in the fifth and seventh weeks after the assumed breeding start (i.e. around the assumed hatching date), and the number of consecutive days with precipitation when nestlings are assumed to be approximately 3 weeks old. In an agricultural environment, weather effects that potentially disturb food availability might be more important than effects directly affecting the survival of White Stork offspring. The most frequent observed mortality cause, nest fights, furthermore revealed the relevance of intraspecific competition in the study population.";"Eggers, Ute

The purpose of this study was to identify landscape variables correlated with natural pest suppression carried out by arthropod natural enemies, predators and parasitoids. We conducted two field experiments, one observational and one experimental, where landscape variables at broad and local scales were measured and related to natural pest suppression. The first experiment measured natural pest suppression at 16 sites across an urban to rural landscape gradient in south central Wisconsin. We found natural enemy diversity positively affected natural pest suppression, whereas flower diversity negatively affected pest suppression. No relationship was found between natural pest suppression and broad scale variables, which measured the percentage of different land cover classes in the surrounding landscape. In the second experiment, we established small (2- by 3-m) replicated plots that experimentally varied flower diversity (0, 1, or 7 species) within a plot. We found no significant relationship between natural pest suppression and the different levels of flower diversity. The fact that we only found differences in natural pest suppression in our first experiment, which measured natural pest suppression at sites separated by larger distances than our second experiment, suggests the more appropriate scale for measuring ecosystem services performed by mobile organisms like insects, is across broad spatial scales where variation in natural enemies communities and the factors that affect them become more apparent.";"Bennett, A.

"AGRIS:US2016203495";"Biomass Supply from Alternative Cellulosic Crops and Crop Residues: A Preliminary Spatial Bioeconomic Modeling Approach";"";"This paper introduces a spatial bioeconomic model for study of potential cellulosic biomass supply at regional scale. By modeling the profitability of alternative crop production practices, it captures the opportunity cost of replacing current crops by cellulosic biomass crops. The model draws upon biophysical crop input-output coefficients, price and cost data, and spatial transportation costs in the context of profit maximization theory. Yields are simulated using temperature, precipitation and soil quality data with various commercial crops and potential new cellulosic biomass crops. Three types of alternative crop management scenarios are simulated by varying crop rotation, fertilization and tillage. The cost of transporting biomass to a specific demand location is obtained using road distances and bulk shipping costs from geographic information systems. The spatial mathematical programming model predicts the supply of biomass and implied environmental consequences for a landscape managed by representative, profit maximizing farmers. The model was applied and validated for simulation of cellulosic biomass supply in a 9-county region of southern Michigan. Results for 74 cropping systems simulated across 39 sub-watersheds show that crop residues are the first types of biomass to be supplied. Corn stover and wheat straw supply start at $21/Mg and $27/Mg delivered prices. Perennial bioenergy crops become profitable to produce when the delivered biomass price reaches $46/Mg for switchgrass, $118/Mg for grass mixes and $154/Mg for Miscanthus giganteus. The predicted effect of the USDA Biomass Conversion Assistance Program is to sharply reduce the minimum biomass price at which miscanthus would become profitable to supply. Compared to conventional crop production practices in the area, the EPIC-simulated environmental outcomes with crop residue removal include increased greenhouse gas emissions and reduced water quality through increased nutrient loss. By contrast, perennial cellulosic biomass crops reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved water quality compared to current commercial cropping systems.";"Egbendewe-Mondzozo, Aklesso

In northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) has engaged stakeholders and the DRC Government to lead a participatory zoning process in the Maringa–Lopori–Wamba (MLW) Landscape. To assist landscape scale macro-zoning efforts, we employed a spatial allocation decision support tool called Marxan to develop a set of three scenarios of potential human and agricultural expansion for 2050. The results offer guidance to stakeholders and assist decision-makers in determining the most suitable land for inclusion in a proposed Rural Development Zone (RDZ), designed to accommodate the expansion of agricultural activities and subsequent deforestation while considering conservation priority areas. We used data describing current patterns of human activity, including historical primary forest loss, land cover suitability for agricultural activity, and presence of important wildlife connectivity zones and protected areas to identify locations where future agricultural expansion might be encouraged. We found that future agricultural demands can be met by expansion around historically intensive agricultural areas in the eastern portion of MLW without significantly compromising conservation priority areas. Wildlife connectivity zones are most vulnerable to future agricultural expansion because of their proximity to current agricultural activity. Our results demonstrate the need to prioritize conservation action in these areas and illustrate how competing needs might be balanced in planning for both agricultural expansion and terrestrial biological conservation in this landscape.";"Nackoney, Janet

Water quality samples were collected through the years 1992-2006 at monthly and bi-monthly intervals. For the catchment land use analysis, the satellite images LANDSAT 7 (CORINE Land Cover) and digitised cadastre maps of the land register were processed using ESRI ArcMap GIS; both sources were corrected by field survey. We demonstrate on three different basin - scale studies a strong relation between the arable land ratio within a catchment and the coherent stream water nitrate concentration. The results acquired from all the evaluated catchments showed that every 10% decrease of ploughed land proportion in a catchment lowers the nitrate concentration C90 value (90% probability of non-exceedance) in average by 6.38 mg/L.";"Fucik, P.,Vyzkumny Ustav Melioraci a Ochrany Pudy, Prague (Czech Republic)

This research asks: (1) What are the possibilities and limitations of the conservation easement approach to wildlife conservation in contrasting rural and periurban regions? and (2) How does analysis of conservation easements differ when examining property as a bundle of rights or alternative metaphors? These questions were addressed through document analysis, interviews and GIS mapping in two regions where The Nature Conservancy deployed conservation easements for wildlife habitat: rural Lassen Foothills and periurban Tenaja Corridor, USA. Splitting the bundle allowed for site and region-specific easements with differences in permitted housing densities, land management and hunting. Easements focused on restricted rights rather than affirmative duties. The challenges of habitat connectivity in the fragmented Tenaja Corridor revealed the limits of parcel-based acquisition. Analysts and conservation practitioners should rethink the bundle of rights concept of property, considering a bundle of duties, powers and owners within a broader web of social and ecological interests, to understand the role of conservation acquisitions in contrasting landscape contexts.";"RISSMAN, ADENA R.";"";"Cambridge University Press";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"development;urbanization;land management;property rights";"Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"USA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600185434";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892913000015";"";"";"";"222-230"
"AGRIS:US201400150555";"comparison of nutrient export at two agricultural catchments: insight into the effect of increasing urban land cover in southern Ontario";"";"This study compared concentrations and export of total phosphorus (TP; including dissolved and particulate forms) and nitrogen (N) between quickflow and delayed flow at two adjacent agricultural catchments (Jennings and McLarens Creeks), one of which is undergoing increased urbanization. Annual runoff, frequency of quickflow events in the growing season (GS), and chloride (Cl⁻) concentrations and export were greater at the more urbanized Jennings Creek. There were only modest differences in TP and total dissolved P between the two catchments, with the largest difference occurring in the GS, when the urbanized Jennings Creek had higher TP concentrations and export. In contrast, the majority of N export was as dissolved inorganic nitrate‐N (NO₃ ⁻–N), and NO₃ ⁻–N concentrations and export were consistently greater at the more agricultural McLarens Creek. Particulate P was sensitive to increases in quickflow, with particulate P accounting for approximately 75% of TP export during GS events. In contrast, NO₃ ⁻–N export was less influenced by hydrologic conditions than P and appears to be delivered to these streams primarily by subsurface flow, which resulted in greater NO₃ ⁻–N export during delayed flow compared with events at both catchments. Overall, these results suggest that urban cover at Jennings Creek has impacted streamflow with more frequent quickflow events during the GS and substantially higher stream Cl⁻, although the influence of urban increases at the expense of agricultural land on P and N export was less clear.

Most critically, the biodiversity of wetlands is intimately linked to its hydrologic dynamics, which in turn are being drastically altered by ongoing climate changes. Hydroperiod regimes, e.g., percentage of time a site is inundated, exert critical control in the creation of niches for different plant species in wetlands. However, the spatial signatures of the organization of plant species in wetlands and how the different drivers interact to yield such signatures are unknown. Focusing on Everglades National Park (ENP) in Florida, we show here that cluster sizes of each species follow a power law probability distribution and that such clusters have well-defined fractal characteristics. Moreover, we individuate and model those signatures via the interplay between global forcings arising from the hydroperiod regime and local controls exerted by neighboring vegetation. With power law clustering often associated with systems near critical transitions, our findings are highly relevant for the management of wetland ecosystems. In addition, our results show that changes in climate and land management have a quantifiable predictable impact on the type of vegetation and its spatial organization in wetlands.";"Foti, Romano

Here, we (1) determine the predictability of estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) using different satellite data, classifications, and methods; (2) estimate the quantity and distribution of SOC for the top 10 cm for the Ambolikha River watershed (~121 km ²) in northeast Siberia, a sub-watershed of the Kolyma River; and (3) produce a hybrid SOC map through data fusion, combining the strengths of each data type. Land cover maps were produced using a pixel-based classification with Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data and an object-based classification using WorldView-2 data. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was performed on both data types to calculate the fraction of four vegetation types in each pixel, and land cover maps were combined with field measurements of SOC in the top 10 cm. The overall classification accuracy was 69% for Landsat, 81% for WorldView-2, and 82% for the hybrid map. The hybrid map estimated 490.5 Gg of SOC for the top 10 cm within the Ambolikha River watershed, with less severe over- or under-estimated than the Landsat or WorldView-2 maps alone. The results suggest that (a) higher spatial resolution satellite data and object-based classification should be used for land cover classification in the Arctic; (b) integrating multiple sensors maximizes the strengths of different sensors for estimating SOC; and (c) previous studies performed at the regional or pan-Arctic scale using lower spatial resolution data likely underestimate total SOC.";"Broderick, Dylan E.

Twelve land cover maps were generated for Turkey using boosted decision trees (BDTs) based on the stepwise addition of 14 explanatory variables derived from a time series of 16-day MODIS composites between 2000 and 2006 (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and four spectral bands) and ancillary climate and topographic data (minimum and maximum air temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, aspect, elevation, distance to sea and slope) at 500-m resolution. Evaluation of the 12 BDTs indicated that the BDT built as a function of all the MODIS and climate variables, aspect and elevation produced the highest degree of overall classification accuracy (79.8%) and kappa statistic (0.76) followed by the BDTs that additionally included distance to sea (DtS), and both DtS and slope. Based on an independent validation dataset derived from a pre-existing national forest map and Landsat images of Turkey, the highest overall accuracy (64.7%) and kappa coefficient (0.58) among the 12 land cover maps was achieved by using MODIS-derived NDVI time series only, followed by NDVI and EVI time series combined; NDVI, EVI and four MODIS spectral bands; and the combination of all MODIS and climate data, aspect, elevation and distance to sea, respectively. The largest improvements in producer's accuracies were observed for grasslands (+50%), barrenlands (+46%) and mixed forests (+39%) and in user's accuracies for grasslands (+53%), shrublands (+30%) and mixed forests (+28%), in relation to the lowest producer's accuracy.

Areal interpolation methods are commonly used to solve such zoning incompatibilities, but are frequently based on the questionable assumption of homogeneous population density within the different zones. To achieve more accurate estimates, land cover or other ancillary data may be used to better characterize the underlying source zone population density surface prior to areal interpolation. Although dasymetric techniques such as these are well documented, their effectiveness across different areal interpolation methods are not well established. This research compares the accuracy of a number of areal interpolation methods used to support temporal analysis of population data, and evaluates the effect of dasymetric mapping on interpolation accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that dasymetric refinement noticeably improves interpolation accuracy for the areal weighting, pycnophylactic, and target density weighting (TDW) methods of areal interpolation. A fourth method in which land cover densities are inherently incorporated, the expectation–maximization algorithm (EM), performs equally well. Our results show that the dasymetrically refined TDW method outperforms other areal interpolation methods in most instances, but suggest that the EM algorithm may be preferred as the interval between enumeration periods grows large.";"Ruther, Matt

Unfortunately, high spatial resolution imagery also increases internal variability in land cover units and can cause a ‘salt-and-pepper’ effect, resulting in decreased accuracy using pixel-based classification results. Region-based classification techniques, using an image object (IO) rather than a pixel as a classification unit, appear to hold promise as a method for overcoming this problem. Using IKONOS high spatial resolution imagery, we examined whether the IO technique could significantly improve classification accuracy compared to the pixel-based method when applied to urban land cover mapping in Tampa Bay, FL, USA. We further compared the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a minimum distance classifier (MDC) in urban detailed land cover classification and evaluated whether the classification accuracy was affected by the number of extracted IO features. Our analysis methods included IKONOS image data calibration, data fusion with the pansharpening (PS) process, Hue–Intensity–Saturation (HIS) transferred indices and textural feature extraction, and feature selection using a stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA). The classification results were evaluated with visually interpreted data from high-resolution (0.3 m) digital aerial photographs. Our results indicate a statistically significant difference in classification accuracy between pixel- and object-based techniques; ANN outperforms MDC as an object-based classifier; and the use of more features (27 vs. 9 features) increases the IO classification accuracy, although the increase is statistically significant for the MDC but not for the ANN.";"Pu, Ruiliang

Four market characteristics were identified as goals: (1) the land market should be dynamic, that is, there should be numerous transactions; (2) acquisition of land through these transactions should be by people who make productive investments; (3) all sectors of the population should participate in the market as buyers and sellers of land rights; and (4) people's investments in land through these market transactions should result in sustainable uses of land so as to assure the environmental rights of future generations.

The impacts of cash crop production vary by agro-ecological zones and cropping system.  In coffee producing zones, use of organic inputs is most common on plots growing coffee with other crops (mainly bananas), and least common on mono-cropped coffee.  Both mono-cropped coffee and mixed coffee plots have lower soil erosion than other plots in coffee producing zones because of greater soil cover.  Potassium depletion is much greater on mixed banana-coffee plots.  In the cotton production zone, few land management practices or investments are used, especially on cotton plots.  Soil erosion and soil nutrient depletion are lower in the cotton zone than in coffee producing zones because of flatter terrain and lower crop yields.  Soil erosion is much higher on cotton than non-cotton plots in this zone.  These results imply that promotion of cash crop production will not halt land degradation, and in some cases will worsen it, unless substantial efforts are made to promote adoption of sustainable land management practices.";"Pender, John L.

Underlying some of the most productive agricultural land in Canada, this highly vulnerable trans‐boundary aquifer provides a unique case study on the opportunities and challenges of addressing water quality issues. A groundwater monitoring program initiated in the early 1990s has been important in tracking spatial and temporal variation in groundwater nitrate concentration. However, small land parcels with spatially and temporally variable land use and management practices and sub‐horizontal flow in this highly permeable sand and gravel aquifer make it difficult to relate groundwater monitoring results to specific agricultural practices. Other approaches pointed to the historical over‐application of N relative to crop requirement (primarily as manure used to increase soil organic matter during replanting but also as a nutrient source during production). Despite changes in agricultural practices, and programs aimed at raising grower awareness, no appreciable change in average groundwater nitrate concentration has occurred over the monitoring period. On individual land parcels, nitrate contamination may be reduced through development and adoption of an integrated suite of beneficial management practices (BMPs) to improve N fertilization, irrigation and alley vegetation management, and in particular to eliminate application of any organic soil amendment such as untreated manure in which the N has not been stabilized (e.g., by composting). However, the substantial N imbalance on a regional scale, and the lack of an effective on‐going consultative process among stakeholders, remain major barriers to the development, demonstration and adoption of BMPs.";"Zebarth, Bernie J.

Therefore, the need to maintain connectivity for these species in human-dominated Atlantic landscapes is critical. In this study, we evaluated the landscape connectivity for large carnivores (cougar and jaguar) among the Strictly Protected Areas in the Atlantic Forest, evaluated the efficiency of the Mosaics of Protected Areas linked to land uses in promoting landscape connectivity, identified the critical habitat connections, and predicted the landscape connectivity status under the implementation of legislation for protecting riparian forests. The method was based on expert opinion translated into land use and land cover maps. The results show that the Protected Areas are still connected by a narrow band of landscape that is permeable to both species and that the Mosaics of Protected Areas increase the amount of protected area but fail to increase the connectivity between the forested mountain ranges (Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira). Riparian forests greatly increase connectivity, more than tripling the cougars’ priority areas. We note that the selection of Brazilian protected areas still fails to create connectivity among the legally protected forest remnants. We recommend the immediate protection of the priority areas identified that would increase the structural landscape connectivity for these large carnivores, especially paths in the SE/NW direction between the two mountain ranges.";"Castilho, Camila S.

It involves selecting and protecting the most vigorous stems regrowing from live stumps of felled trees, pruning off all other stems, and pollarding the chosen stems to grow into straight trunks. Despite widespread enthusiasm and application of FMNR by environmental management and development projects, to date, no research has provided a measure of the aggregate livelihood impact of community adoption of FMNR. This paper places FMNR in the context of other agroforestry initiatives, then seeks to quantify the value of livelihood outcomes of FMNR. We review published and unpublished evidence about the impacts of FMNR, and present a new case study that addresses gaps in the evidence-base. The case study focuses on a FMNR project in the district of Talensi in the semi-arid Upper East Region in Ghana. The case study employs a social return on investment analysis, which identifies proxy financial values for non-economic as well as economic benefits. The results demonstrate income and agricultural benefits, but also show that asset creation, increased consumption of wild resources, health improvements, and psycho-social benefits created more value in FMNR-adopting households during the period of the study than increases in income and agricultural yields.";"Weston, Peter

"AGRIS:US201400156487";"Effects of Plant Secondary Compounds on Nutritional Carrying Capacity Estimates of a Browsing Ungulate";"";"Carrying capacity estimates based on digestible protein (DP) and energy (DE) are useful in comparing effects of land management practices or the ability of different vegetation communities to support herbivores. Plant secondary compounds that negatively affect forage quality would be expected to change nutritionally based estimates of carrying capacity. We evaluated the effect of plant secondary compounds on nutritionally based carrying capacity estimates of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) in Tamaulipan thorn scrub of northern Mexico. Forage biomass, nutrient concentration, and tannin concentration (protein-precipitating capacity) were measured for 23 forage items during spring and summer in three replicate pastures. Nitrogen in phenolic amines was estimated for the two principal woody browse species in deer diets and was assumed to be unavailable for amino acid synthesis. Carrying capacity estimates were calculated based on three dietary concentrations of DP and DE. Nutritional carrying capacity estimates that accounted for antinutritional compounds were reduced 50 ± 6%, 28 ± 8%, and 0 ± 0% (mean ± SE) for diets of high, medium, and low DE concentration, respectively, compared to estimates from models that ignored the effects of these compounds. Accounting for effects of plant secondary compounds reduced DP-derived carrying capacity estimates 4 ± 3%, 47 ± 9%, and 9 ± 8% for diets with high, medium, and low concentrations of DP, respectively. High variation in percent reduction in carrying capacity estimates occurred because of site and seasonal variation in plant species composition and biomass, making application of a single correction factor to account for plant secondary compound effects on carrying capacity infeasible. Protein-precipitating capacity of tannins accounted for > 98% of the reductions in carrying capacity estimates based on DP. Our results clearly demonstrate the need to consider effects of tannins on ungulate carrying capacity estimates based on DP and DE. Estimates can be further refined by accounting for nonprotein nitrogen and other antinutritional compounds in all forage items.";"Windels, Steve K.

Ardestan Region is prone to land degradation and masked by sand sheets, sand dunes, clay flats, desert pavement and different kinds of salt crust due to dry climate. To study the trends of land degradation in last three decades, four satellite data sets of Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ and IRS acquired in 1976, 1990, 2001 and 2008, respectively were analyzed. The time series analysis revealed that the bare clayflats have decreased and clayflats with vegetation cover have expanded over 32 years. During this period, the areas which are covered by gravel have decreased 13 percent and both the area covered by salt crusts and aeolians have extended 2 percent. Puffy grounds have developed by 2001 but their magnitudes have decreased between 2001 and 2008 as they have been masked by the moving sand ripples. Reduction of 13 percent of sand sheets between 1990 and 2008 indicates that soil conservation practices have efficiently controlled land degradation and desertification in the area.";"N.

Land management practices or systems that reduce GHG emission would aid in slowing climate change. We measured the emission of CO2, CH4, and N2O from three management scenarios: business as usual (BAU), maximum C sequestration (MAXC), and optimum greenhouse gas benefits (OGGB). The BAU scenario was chisel or moldboard plowed, fertilized, in a 2-yr rotation (corn [Zea mays L.]–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]). The MAXC and OGGB scenarios were strip tilled in a 4-yr rotation (corn–soybean–wheat [Triticum aestivum L.]/alfalfa [Medicago sativa L.]–alfalfa). The MAXC received fertilizer inputs but the OGGB scenario was not fertilized. Nitrous oxide, CO2, and CH4 emissions were collected using vented static chambers. Carbon dioxide flux increased briefly following tillage, but the impact of tillage was negligible when CO2 flux was integrated across an entire year. The soil tended to be neutral to a slight CH4 sink under these managements scenarios. The N2O flux during spring thaw accounted for up to 65% of its annual emission, compared with 6% or less due to application of N fertilizer. Annual cumulative emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O did not vary significantly among these three management scenarios. Reducing tillage and increasing the length of the crop rotation did not appreciably change GHG emissions. Strategies that reduce N2O flux during spring thaw could reduce annual N2O emission.";"Johnson, Jane M.F.

Special attention is paid to the proper calculation of marginal effects in the bivariate probit model, which are often useful for policy purposes. Estimation results confirm that the choices of irrigation technology and land allocation are simultaneous. With regard to the influence of price incentives on agricultural water use, estimation results from the bivariate probit model indicate that the influence of water price on the adoption of precision irrigation technology is much larger than previously realized.

"AGRIS:US201600132138";"Effects of land use patterns on stream water quality: a case study of a small-scale watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China";"";"In this study, we have considered the relationship between the spatial configuration of land use and water quality in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. Using land use types, landscape metrics, and long-term water quality data, as well as statistical and spatial analysis, we determined that most water quality parameters were negatively correlated with non-wood forest and urban areas but were strongly positively correlated with the proportion of forest area. Landscape indices such as patch density, contagion, and the Shannon diversity index were able to predict some water quality indicators, but the mean shape index was not significantly related to the proportions of farmland and water in the study area. Regression relationships were stronger in spring and fall than in summer, and relationships with nitrogen were stronger than those of the other water quality parameters (R ² > 0.80) in all three seasons. Redundancy analysis showed that declining stream water quality was closely associated with configurations of urban, agricultural, and forest areas and with landscape fragmentation (PD) caused by urbanization and agricultural activities. Thus, a rational land use plan of adjusting the land use type, controlling landscape fragmentation, and increasing the proportion of forest area would help to achieve a healthier river ecosystem in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA).";"Huang, Zhilin

"AGRIS:US201400041645";"Agricultural land use suitability analysis using GIS and AHP technique";"";"The aim of this study was to determine suitable lands for agricultural use in the Yusufeli district of Artvin city (Turkey), where the current agricultural land in the district center and 3 villages will be completely inundated while the land in 22 villages will be partially inundated due to three large dams currently being constructed. The “Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)” method, commonly used in land use suitability analysis, was utilized in this study. In application, the parameters of great soil group, land use capability class, land use capability sub-class, soil depth, slope, aspect, elevation, erosion degree and other soil properties were used. In determining the weights of the parameters, experts’ opinions were consulted, and the agricultural land suitability map generated was divided into 5 categories according to the land suitability classification of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). After deducting the forests, pastures and reservoir areas from the reclassified suitability map, it was estimated that 0.08% of the study area (177.87ha) is highly suitable for agricultural production, while 1.55% (3578.33ha) is moderately suitable and 6.3% (14575.91ha) is marginally suitable for agricultural production. In addition, it was found that the proportion of land that is currently unsuitable for agricultural production is 2.24% (5183.63ha), while the amount of land that is permanently unsuitable is 3.42% (7923.39ha). It was also determined that the following facts were all effective factors in reaching these results: a substantial portion (approximately 85%) of the study area is covered with forests and pastures, the soil depth is inadequate for agricultural production, the slope in the study area is quite high and, accordingly, the erosion degree is high.";"Akıncı, Halil

"AGRIS:US201400158865";"Assessing potential desertification environmental impact in life cycle assessment. Part 2: agricultural case study in Spain and Argentina";"";"PURPOSE: Land use in dry lands can result in a final stage where land is completely depleted or entirely degraded causing the desertification phenomenon. The first part (part 1) of this series of two articles proposed a methodology to include desertification in life cycle assessment (LCA). A set of variables to be measured in the life cycle inventory, characterization factors, and an impact assessment method for the life cycle impact assessment phase were proposed. This second part (part 2) aims at showing the application of the model proposed in part 1 on two case studies of agricultural activities. METHODS: The impact model proposed is applied to plots of land devoted to agricultural activities in two countries: Argentina and Spain. In the agricultural plots of Spain (1SP to 9SP), two crops were analyzed: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rapeseed (RS, Brassica napus). Two crops were considered in the Argentinean case study: rapeseed (RS, B. napus) and digit grass (Digitaria eriantha) (10AR to 17AR). A bare soil state is considered in both countries as a reference state. Both case studies consider only the agricultural stage in the inventory of a complete life cycle assessment study. Both also consider only one impact category in life cycle environmental assessment: desertification impact due to land occupation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On the basis of the obtained results, it can be inferred that cultivating 1� ha of rapeseed and 1� ha of wheat has the same impact on the analyzed plots in Spain and improves the reference state conditions in 50� % of the cases. Moreover, rapeseed grown in Mendoza produces almost the same impact as in some of the Spanish plots. Normalized areas of plots could be useful to compare results in different regions of the world to avoid the influence of the area of occupation in results. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model implies a contribution of significant importance because so far there has not been an impact assessment tool for land use in dry lands within the LCA framework. The main strength of the proposed model is that it allows a simple way to quantify the desertification impact. Also, it is emphasized that the model can be adapted virtually without difficulty to the evaluation of all types of crops with different management practices in different regions in the life cycle impact assessment stage.";"Civit, Bárbara María

In 2002, China's Ministry of Water Resources initiated a pilot project in Zhangye City in Northwest China. The project was designed to establish a new water use rights system with tradable water quotas with the hope of reallocating water resources more efficiently through market-based instruments. However, the tradable water right system is not well enforced. Based on both primary and secondary data, we find that mutual monitoring can improve the effectiveness of a water allocation and trading program. For both surface water and groundwater irrigation systems, the conditions needed to stimulate mutual monitoring include: (1) a hierarchical management system; (2) well defined water rights or quotas; (3) control of total water quotas and water sources by the upper hierarchy; and (4) an approximate balance between the water supply or pumping capacity and the water quota. We describe also the institutional requirements for stimulating mutual monitoring.";"Zhang, Jun-Lian

"AGRIS:US201500161949";"Stacking the odds: light pollution may shift the balance in an ancient predator–prey arms race";"";"Artificial night lighting threatens to disrupt strongly conserved light‐dependent processes in animals and may have cascading effects on ecosystems as species interactions become altered. Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co‐evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti‐bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free‐living bat–insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey‐selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume ± SD: 5·91 ± 6·25%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume ± SD: 35·42 ± 17·90%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey‐selection models that included high‐efficacy estimates for eared‐moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared‐moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light‐induced, decreased eared‐moth defensive behaviour. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth‐eating bats and eared moths will face ever‐increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad‐spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth‐friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth‐eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.";"Minnaar, Corneile

As an important part of the evaluation the farm economic and macro economic consequences of a reduced use of pesticides in Danish agriculture was calculated. This article describes the farm economic consequences, as well as the agronomic background and the farm economic model developed to calculate these consequences. The analysis was built uparound a set of farm types representative for Danish crop rotation regimes and a set of scenarios intended to show the consequences of different degrees of reduction of pesticide consumption in agriculture. For each scenario the crop yield losses, alternative cultivation techniques, and a number of overall restrictions on the crop rotation were estimated and incorporated in the farm economic model. By using the model the new optimal allocation of crops and pesticides was decided for the different farm types and scenarios. It was found that a total ban on the use of pesticides would have considerably economic effects on crop production and require severe adjustment of the crop rotation and cultivation systems. However, the present use of pesticides can be significantly reduced without any drastic economic losses.";"Orum, Jens Erik

"AGRIS:US201500016737";"Useful insights from evolutionary biology for developing perennial grain crops1";"";"Annual grain crops dominate agricultural landscapes and provide the majority of calories consumed by humanity. Perennial grain crops could potentially ameliorate the land degradation and off-site impacts associated with annual grain cropping. However, herbaceous perennial plants with constitutively high allocation to harvestable seeds are rare to absent in nature. Recent trade-off theory models suggest that rugged fitness landscapes may explain the absence of this form better than sink competition models. Artificial selection for both grain production and multiyear lifespan can lead to more rapid progress in the face of fitness and genetic trade-offs than natural selection but is likely to result in plant types that differ substantially from all current domestic crops. Perennial grain domestication is also likely to require the development of selection strategies that differ from published crop breeding methods, despite their success in improving long-domesticated crops; for this purpose, we have reviewed literature in the areas of population and evolutionary genetics, domestication, and molecular biology. Rapid domestication will likely require genes with large effect that are expected to exhibit strong pleiotropy and epistasis. Cryptic genetic variation will need to be deliberately exposed both to purge mildly deleterious alleles and to generate novel agronomic phenotypes. We predict that perennial grain domestication programs will benefit from population subdivision followed by selection for simple traits in each subpopulation, the evaluation of very large populations, high selection intensity, rapid cycling through generations, and heterosis. The latter may be particularly beneficial in the development of varieties with stable yield and tolerance to crowding.";"DeHaan, Lee R.

This study analyzed the possible range of the boundary shift of the potential suitable agriculture area in the farming-grazing transitional zone in the northeastern China during the 20th century. Based on modern weather data, 1 km-resolution land cover data, historical climatic time series, and estimation by using similar historical climatic scenes, the following was concluded: 1) The climate conditions of suitable agriculture areas in the farming-grazing transitional zone in the northeastern China between 1971 and 2000 required an average annual temperature above 1°C or ≥ 0°C accumulated temperature above 2500°C–2700°C, and annual precipitation above 350 mm. 2) The northern boundary of the potential suitable agriculture area during the relatively warmer period of 1890–1910 was approximately located at the position of the 1961–2000 area. The northern boundary shifted back to the south by 75 km on average during the colder period of the earlier 20th century, whereas during the modern warm period of the 1990s, the area shifted north by 100 km on average. 3) The western and eastern boundaries of the suitable agriculture area during the heaviest drought periods between 1920s and 1930s had shifted northeast by 250 km and 125 km, respectively, contrasting to the boundaries of 1951–2008. For the wettest period, that is, the 1890s to the 1910s, the shift of western and eastern boundaries was to the southwest by 125 km and 200 km, respectively, compared with that in the 1951–2008 period.

Such is the case with the Natura 2000 protected areas in Europe. Focusing on the cork oak (Quercus suber) forests of one such area, the Serra de Monchique in southern Portugal, we test the complementarity and joint effectiveness of airborne multispectral and laser scanning (lidar) in providing robust indicators of conservation status. Principal forest types and other land covers are mapped to an accuracy of up to 70% (11 land cover classes) and 81% (5 classes) by fusing the two remote sensing datasets, results that are superior to using either one alone. Using previously tested relationships between lidar height metrics, forest vegetation structure and species diversity, we develop a map predicting areas of high (22% of area), medium (25%) and low (53%) condition.

"AGRIS:DJ2012067640";"Dynamics of Shifting Agricultural-Systems and Organic Carbon Sequestration in Southern Cameroon";"";"A conceptual model of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Shifting Agricultural Systems (SAS) in the rainforest region of Southern Cameroon made it possible to identify five different cultivation cycles, which enabled the quantification of soil dynamics and carbon stocks. Carbon stocks in each pool were evaluated using all chronosequences for land use types, including Virgin forest (PF), Secondary forest (SF), Forest fallow (FF), Chromolaena fallow (CF), Mixed crop field (MC) and Old cocoa plantations (OCP). Under each treatment, biomass measures were conducted on trees, undergrowth, litter and plant roots. Soil samples were analysed for physicochemical determinations. The total carbon (in TC/ha-1) varies in the following decreasing order: VF (305), SF (251), OCP (184), FF (180), CF (101), and MC (67). Although the average soil carbon stock represents 93% and 78% under the MC and CF systems, respectively, it represents only 26% of total carbon for the VF system. When a PF system is converted into MC, there is a total carbon loss of 97% from aerial biomass and 17% from soil. Fallowing and reconversion to SF lead to a carbon re-accumulation of 3.9 TC/ha-1.year-1 (r2= 0.83, p= 0.001). Several soil parameters have shown major variability within the system. This study has produced quantified data, which can be used to evaluate soil quality according to land use and the cost of the carbon sequestered by these agricultural systems.";"Njomgang, R.

Growing perennial grasses such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for biomass (e.g., cellulosic biofuel feedstocks) instead of annual row crops in these high relief waterway buffers can improve local environmental conditions (e.g., reduce soil erosion and improve water quality through lower use of fertilizers and pesticides) and ecosystem services (e.g., minimize drought and flood impacts on production; improve wildlife habitat, plant vigor, and nitrogen retention due to post-senescence harvest for cellulosic biofuels; and serve as carbon sinks). The main objectives of this study are to: (1) identify cropland areas with high topographic relief (high runoff potentials) and high switchgrass productivity potential in eastern Nebraska that may be suitable for growing switchgrass, and (2) estimate the total switchgrass production gain from the potential biofuel areas. Results indicate that about 140,000 hectares of waterway buffers in eastern Nebraska are suitable for switchgrass development and the total annual estimated switchgrass biomass production for these suitable areas is approximately 1.2 million metric tons. The resulting map delineates high topographic relief croplands and provides useful information to land managers and biofuel plant investors to make optimal land use decisions regarding biofuel crop development and ecosystem service optimization in eastern Nebraska.";"Gu, Yingxin

Efforts to safeguard widows’ rights to land through land tenure innovations involving community authorities may be an important component of social protection, poverty alleviation, and HIV/AIDS mitigation strategies. Several of the findings reported show the influence of local traditional authorities in affecting the extent to which widows are able to retain land. Increased government commitment to ensure security of widows’ access to land is another approach, but initial evaluations of government efforts provide mixed evidence (see Izumi, 2006). Government decrees appear to have little impact if local community authorities are not part of the agreement. But certainly, national governments, donors, and NGOS have an important role to play in developing programs to work with local authorities to protect widows and children against property grabbing by relatives of the deceased as well as to institute property rights that are more compatible with social protection and anti-poverty objectives in the era of AIDS.";"Chapoto, Antony

In organic agriculture, land management practices that promote biodiversity and soil quality are emphasized and the goal is to maintain a sustainable agricultural system. Soil quality or soil health is the foundation for all agriculture and natural plant communities and a primary indicator of sustainable land management. Soil quality is affected by farm management and land use decisions. This article presents a review of the literature on the question: How do organic agriculture and conventional agriculture differ in regard to their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services? All of the 22 articles identified in this review reported a significant increase in at least one variable that indicated enhanced biodiversity and/or ecosystem services on sites farmed using an organic farming system compared to sites farmed using a conventional farming system. This review underlines the importance of biodiversity, particularly soil biodiversity, to sustainable food production and underscores the need for further ecological studies on the links between farm management systems and soil quality.";"Underwood, Teri

Six main groups of halophytes have been described within the desert flora of Central Asia. Significant changes on chemical contents of ions: Cl⁻, SO₄ ²⁻, HCO₃ ⁻, Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺among 23 studied halophytic forage species were revealed. Alhagi pseudoalhagi, Poaceae spp., Artemisia diffusa containing minimum concentration of mineral ions were categorised as relatively more palatable and valuable feed for livestock on open grazing and as hay. Fresh biomass of forage species growing under highly saline soils sharply decreased with increasing of salinity gradient. Potassium concentration was found highest in Kochia scoparia, Agropyron desertorum, closely followed by Atriplex nitens, Suaeda salsa, while annuals Salsola spp., Bromus tectorum, Aeluropus littoralis, Tamarix hispida, Eremopyrum orientale, Agropyron desertorum contain low amount of mineral ions because excess of salts are exuded through salt glands present abundantly on the surface of the epidermis. Native and exotic, both C₃ and C₄, halophytes are suitable for reclamation of degraded lands have been proven very useful in demonstration trials. The fresh biomass of investigated C₃ plants sharply decreased with the increasing of soil salinity gradient. An integrated Biosaline Agriculture model for sustainable and integrated use of marginal mineralised water resources and salt-affected soils through involvement of food-feed salt/drought tolerant crops and forage legumes to improve food security, alleviate poverty and enhance ecosystem health in smallholder crop-livestock systems has been demonstrated.

"AGRIS:US201301662186";"Community participation in the rehabilitation of a sand dune environment in Kenya";"";"This study aims to document various community efforts in land rehabilitation and assess their potential. Data were captured using interviews and focus group with 150 community members. A public participation index was used to establish the extent of community efforts in land rehabilitation. The study revealed that in the absence of proper management and dune stabilisation, large areas covered with mobile sand dunes continue to be a threat to grazing lands in northern Kenya. In recognition of this threat, the people of North Horr have launched several initiatives to contain the problem. Environmental and non-environmental group members scored participation rates (PP) of 87·5 and 50%, respectively. These include tree planting on both communal and individual plots and the management of Suaeda monoica through natural regeneration. Although the survival rates of most planted trees on group plots were low, Azadirachta indica that were planted on individual homesteads appeared to be performing comparatively well. Natural regeneration of indigenous plant species such as Suaeda monoica has the potential to perform important economic and ecological functions. The study concludes that in order to effectively arrest the process of desertification on the pastoral drylands of northern Kenya and to restore productivity and biodiversity, it is important to take actions that incorporate both biophysical and human considerations. Linking sociology to ecology is thus paramount in any sustainable dune stabilisation (SDS) programme. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Olukoye, G.A.

"AGRIS:US201500175705";"Synergism: A Rotation Effect of Improved Growth Efficiency";"";"Cropping systems in the Great Plains are changing because of no-till. Rotations now include a diversity of crops in contrast with rotations in tilled systems that grow only one or two crops. This diversity of crops often leads to yield increases because of the rotation effect. We have observed that crop response to the rotation effect can be categorized as either improving resource-use efficiency or increasing plant size and yield capacity. An example of the efficiency response, which we term synergism, is that some crops improve water-use efficiency (WUE) of following crops. Crops produce more grain with the same water use in synergistic sequences; in contrast, crops that increase yield capacity consume more water to produce more grain. Further, synergism among crops increases tolerance of weed interference because of improved resource-use efficiency. Synergism is more prominent in low-yielding environments due to stresses such as drought, and appears to be rare among crop sequences. The cause of synergism among crops is likely related to a multitude of interacting factors such as microbial changes, growth-promoting substances, and altered nutrient cycling. Quantifying WUE as affected by preceding crop may provide a method to identify synergism among crops. No-till rotations that include synergistic crop sequences are improving land productivity, farm economics, soil health, and resource-use efficiency in the semiarid Great Plains.";"Anderson, Randy L.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500175705";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-385538-1.00005-6";"";"";"";"205-226"

"AGRIS:US201600190049";"Indicators of Cultural Ecosystem Services for urban planning: A review";"";"The concept of Ecosystem Services has gained traction on the scientific agenda and has found its way into research on urban environments. Cities and towns, like any other ecosystem, provide specific services to their inhabitants and communities and they are benefited by surrounding ecosystems as well. Among the different categories, typical Ecosystem Services categories such as food production and erosion control usually have a lesser importance within urban contexts. However, the very diverse range of land uses and ecosystems in urban contexts provide specific Cultural Ecosystem Services including recreational, cultural and educational values.However, to date only limited attention has been given to the provision of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES), especially considering the relevant benefits that communities and urban planning processes can derive from them. In this document we review existing approaches for the assessment of CES in urban contexts and provide a critical overview of how indicators are used to assess and measure CES. We first conduct a literature review on the indicators used for CES in urban contexts then the paper addresses some specific issues with reference to both operability and benefits of the use of CES indicators for urban planning and management.Our results show that existing CES indicators have limited usability for urban planning and management. Moreover a lack of appropriate data use is a significant obstacle for proper CES assessment. This impacts the potential for sustainable decision-making concerning CES in urban contexts. These issues, together with fact that most identified indicators are proxy ones, identify an urgent need to develop proper assessment indicators for CES.";"La Rosa, Daniele

"AGRIS:US201301662189";"Sequestering carbon in soils of arid ecosystems";"";"Recent increase in atmospheric concentration of CO₂ and decrease in land-based sink capacity are attributed to numerous anthropogenic activities including increase in severity and extent of soil degradation and desertification. There is a strong link between desertification and global warming with positive feedback of mutual reinforcement. The biophysical process is also driven by social, economic, political, and cultural factors such as overgrazing by local Bedouin population. Soil carbon (C) sequestration, through conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices, is more in cooler than warmer and higher in wetter than drier climates, and larger in clayey than sandy soils. It ranges from 0 to 200 kg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in soils of semi-arid climate to 200-500 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in those of sub-humid climates. The rates may range from negative to a high of 1500 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. In contrast, the rate of SIC sequestration as secondary carbonates are low and range from 1·5 to 15 kg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. In addition to proven technologies (e.g., low stocking rate, afforestaion, soil, and water conservation), there are numerous opportunities for using the modern innovations involving nanotechnology, biotechnology, and information technology. Trading of C credits, through Kyoto's CDM or World Bank's BioCarbon Fund and other mechanisms, opens new opportunities for promoting the use of terrestrial sinks. In this regards, desertified ecosystems in Africa/Asia and elsewhere may benefit through C-sequestration programs because rehabilitation of degraded lands is an urgent matter of global importance.

"AGRIS:US201500175702";"Review of Quantitative Tools for Assessing the Diffuse Pollution Response to Farmer Adaptations and Mitigation Methods Under Climate Change";"";"In an era of global climate change, the agricultural sector faces the challenge of increasing the production of safe and nutritious food supplies to meet a growing world population while safeguarding the environment. Farmers will adapt their agricultural practices to a changing climate to safeguard against loss of production and to take advantage of any positive climatic conditions. Certain management practices have been found to reduce the effects of agricultural practices on the environment and a key question is how efficient these are under the current climate, and will these management practices still be relevant under a changing climate? Mathematical modeling is the only tool available to assess the potential efficacy of proposed agricultural management practices to help evaluate their impacts on the environment in a future climate. This chapter attempts to evaluate a range of published models for their capability to simulate agricultural production systems and associated environmental system losses under a changing climate, and their ability to introduce farmer adaptation and mitigation methods. The chapter focuses on the applicability of the models given a set of essential criteria related to scale, biophysical processes, and land management. Thirty models are initially examined, based on details found in published papers, against specific criteria, viz: (1) spatial scale and temporal scale, ease of use, and ability to consider a change in climate; (2) ability to simulate nutrient cycling processes, specifically carbon and nitrogen dynamics with microbial turnover, mineralization–immobilization, nitrification and denitrification, plant nutrient uptake, and phosphorus cycling; (3) ability to consider a water balance and water movement through soil; and (4) ability to introduce and modify agricultural practices relating to crop and livestock management. The chapter does not compare any actual model simulations. It was concluded that albeit no single model incorporates all above stated requirements, there were three models, DAYCENT, PASIM, and SPACSYS which will accommodate most features. These models may therefore be considered in the context of this chapter to be the most suitable for a general assessment of the effects of farm mitigation and adaptation on environmental losses under a changing climate.";"Shepherd, Anita

This paper analyses the most pressing deficiencies in understanding carbon storage in both soils and above ground biomass and the related social and economic challenges associated with carbon sequestration projects. Focusing on the semi-arid and dry sub-humid systems of sub-Saharan Africa which are inhabited by many of the world's poor, we identify important interdisciplinary opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed, in order for the poor to benefit from carbon storage, through both climate finance streams and the collateral ecosystem service benefits delivered by carbon-friendly land management. We emphasise that multi-stakeholder working across scales from the local to the regional is necessary to ensure that scientific advances can inform policy and practice to deliver carbon, ecosystem service and poverty alleviation benefits.";"Stringer, L.C.

"AGRIS:US201600185373";"longâterm evaluation of applied nucleation as a strategy to facilitate forest restoration";"";"Applied nucleation is a restoration technique that seeks to facilitate woodyâplant establishment by attracting birds or other animals that may introduce seeds of dispersalâlimited species. In 1991, an experimental test of applied nucleation was initiated in an abandoned landfill in New Jersey, USA. Trees and shrubs were planted into 16 10Â ÃÂ 10Â m plots, covering <3% of the 6âha site. In 2010â2011, we sampled the plant community to test the impact of the treatments on forest cover and plant biodiversity. Siteâwide forest cover increased substantially in the 19Â years since planting from none to 59%. The original planted plots had significantly higher stem density, particularly of birdâdispersed species, than unplanted areas. Species composition outside the planted plots was dominated by the windâdispersed FraxinusÂ americana and several smallâseeded birdâdispersed species, but there were few species indicative of later successional stages. The expected model of successional development via the nucleation model that rates of colonization would be highest near plantings and that forest cover would spread outward from established clusters was not supported after this time span. Given the site's isolation from potential sources of woody propagules, the experimental treatments may not have been enough to overcome many speciesâ dispersal limitation. Regardless of the mechanism, however, the treatments transformed the once essentially treeless site into a densely wooded habitat, and did so at a rate faster than other descriptions of reforestation following disturbances or landâuse changes in the region. Despite the relatively low species richness of the community, this experiment demonstrated that reforestation of even severely degraded habitat can be achieved with minimal management after site preparation and cluster plantings.";"Corbin, Jeffrey D.

"AGRIS:US201400169530";"Timing of precision agriculture technology adoption in US cotton production";"";"The timing of technology adoption is influenced by profitability and farmer ability to bear risk. Innovators are typically more risk tolerant than laggards. Understanding the factors influencing early adoption of precision agriculture (PA) technologies by cotton farmers is important for anticipating technology diffusion over time. The factors influencing the timing of grid soil sampling (GSS), yield monitoring (YMR) and remote sensing (RMS) adoption by cotton producers was evaluated using multivariate censored regression. Data for cotton farmers in 12 states were obtained from a survey conducted in 2009. The factors hypothesized to influence the timing of adoption included farm characteristics, operator characteristics, PA information sources, adoption of other PA technologies, and farm location. The results suggest that different factors influenced when cotton farmers adopted GSS, YMR and RMS after these technologies became commercially available. For example, land ownership was associated with the timing of GSS adoption, but not YMR or RMS adoption; farmer age was correlated with the timing of GSS and YMR adoption, but not RMS adoption; and obtaining PA information from consultants affected the timing of GSS and RMS adoption, but not YMR adoption. The only factors correlated with the early adoption of all three technologies were beliefs that PA would improve environmental quality and the adoption of at least one other PA technology. Thus, the potential for improved environmental quality appears to be a strong adoption motivator across PA technologies, as is the earlier adoption of other PA technologies. This research may be useful for farmers, researchers, Extension personnel, machinery manufacturers, PA information providers and agricultural retailers to anticipate the future adoption of new and emerging PA technologies.";"Watcharaanantapong, Pattarawan

Here, we examined biophysical suitability, and a novel integrated index of “Economic Pressure on Land” (EPL) to explain land cover in the year 2000, and estimated the likelihood of future land-cover change through 2050, including protected area effectiveness. Biophysical suitability and EPL explained almost half of the global pattern of land cover (R ²� =� 0.45), increasing to almost two-thirds in areas where a long-term equilibrium is likely to have been reached (e.g. R ²� =� 0.64 in Europe). We identify a high likelihood of future land-cover change in vast areas with relatively lower current and past deforestation (e.g. the Congo Basin). Further, we simulated emissions arising from a “business as usual” and two reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) scenarios by incorporating data on biomass carbon. As our model incorporates all biome types, it highlights a crucial aspect of the ongoing REDD� +� debate: if restricted to forests, “cross-biome leakage” would severely reduce REDD� +� effectiveness for climate change mitigation. If forests were protected from deforestation yet without measures to tackle the drivers of land-cover change, REDD� +� would only reduce 30� % of total emissions from land-cover change. Fifty-five percent of emissions reductions from forests would be compensated by increased emissions in other biomes. These results suggest that, although REDD� +� remains a very promising mitigation tool, implementation of complementary measures to reduce land demand is necessary to prevent this leakage.";"Strassburg, Bernardo B.

"AGRIS:US201400066867";"Principles and guidelines for managing cattle grazing in the grazing lands of northern Australia: stocking rates, pasture resting, prescribed fire, paddock size and water points – a review";"";"Beef cattle grazing is the dominant land use in the extensive tropical and sub-tropical rangelands of northern Australia. Despite the considerable knowledge on land and herd management gained from both research and practical experience, the adoption of improved management is limited by an inability to predict how changes in practices and combinations of practices will affect cattle production, economic returns and resource condition. To address these issues, past Australian and international research relating to four management factors that affect productivity and resource condition was reviewed in order to identify key management principles. The four management factors considered were stocking rates, pasture resting, prescribed fire, and fencing and water point development for managing grazing distribution. Four management principles for sound grazing management in northern Australia were formulated as follows: (1) manage stocking rates to meet goals for livestock production and land condition; (2) rest pastures to maintain them in good condition or to restore them from poor condition to increase pasture productivity; (3) devise and apply fire regimes that enhance the condition of grazing land and livestock productivity while minimising undesirable impacts; and (4) use fencing and water points to manipulate grazing distribution. Each principle is supported by several more specific guidelines. These principles and guidelines, and the supporting research on which they are based, are presented.";"Hunt, L. P.

But, it is difficult to classify satellite images since they include both pure pixels and boundary pixels. The boundary pixels are ‘mixed’ pixels, representing an area occupied by more than one ground cover. That is, class boundaries represented by pixels, are not sharp but fuzzy. This paper discuses the application of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for classification of remotely sensed images that contains mixed pixels. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction using the Wavelet Packet Transforms (WPT) and the ANFIS trained with the back propagation gradient descent method in combination with the least squares method for classification. Genetic Algorithms (GA) based approach is analysed for the selection of a subset from the combination of Wavelet Packet Statistical Features (WPSF) and Wavelet Packet Co-occurrence (WPC) textural feature set, which are used to classify the LISS IV images. GA has been employed to reduce the complexity and increase the accuracy of classification. Four indices—user’s accuracy, producer’s accuracy, overall accuracy and kappa co-efficient are used to assess the accuracy of the classified data. Experiments show that the proposed approach produces better results compared to the results obtained when classical classifiers are used.";"Rajesh, S.

"AGRIS:US201301707364";"Conservation implications of rainforest use patterns: mature forests provide more resources but secondary forests supply more medicine";"";"1. Tropical rainforests are a global conservation priority. Robust arguments supporting rainforest conservation can attract funding and shape land-use management. However, some popular assertions regarding the value of tropical forests remain largely untested. 2. This study tests the validity of two arguments in support of mature tropical rainforest conservation: first, that these forests should be conserved based on their value as potential sources of medicine. This argument requires mature forests to be better sources of medicine than alternative land-use types, including secondary forests. Second, secondary forest use may help conserve mature forests by providing sufficient resources to buffer against resource extraction in mature forests. 3. The research was conducted in three communities in the Cordillera Azul, Peru, where 369 individuals from 66 households were surveyed. Participants recorded all flora and fauna collected in mature (>20 years) and secondary forests over 180 days in six use categories (food, medicine, wood, weavings, adornments and 'other'). Ecological knowledge of secondary and mature forest species was assessed for male and female household heads. 4. Households used 346 folk species (as defined by local classification systems) from 3668 collection events. Individuals had better knowledge of secondary forest species, but more access to mature forests. Participants collected significantly more medicines from secondary than from mature forests. In other major use categories (food, wood, weaving, adornment), secondary forests provided fewer resources than mature forests. Participants collected a different set of species from secondary and mature forests, with only 130 folk species (38%) collected in both secondary and mature forests. 5. Synthesis and applications. The arguments to protect mature rainforests as sources of new drugs may be overstated, because secondary forests can provide more medicinal plant resources than mature forests, and landscapes that incorporate forests of different ages can maximize availability of medicinal plant species. Conservation efforts must take a landscape level approach given the spread of resource use across different forest types. Because of the heterogeneity of resource availability and use among community members, and the dynamic nature of resource use on forest frontiers, conservation should embrace participatory adaptive management approaches that incorporate a variety of resource users.";"Gavin, Michael C.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land use;women";"Land & Gender";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"PER";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301707364";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01713.x";"";"";"";"1275-1282"
"AGRIS:US201400187065";"Adoption of Policy Incentives and Land Use: Lessons From Frontier Agriculture in Southeastern Peru";"";"Literature on environmental change often highlights the importance of public policies as a key driver of land use and land cover change. However, demonstration of policy impacts in agricultural settings has been hampered by the lack of systematic analysis across landholders, who may not universally adopt government policy incentives, or time periods, which may be associated with differing policy regimes. This paper evaluates the importance of voluntary adoption of policy incentives offered by Peruvian government administrations over two decades for land-use among small farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. The analysis focuses on whether farmers adopted one or more policy incentives in order to observe the effects on land uses including mature forest, agricultural crops, cattle pasture, and secondary growth. We employ multivariate statistical models to estimate the effects of policy adoption while controlling for other factors. The findings show that distinct policies are associated with particular land-uses and largely follow expectations. Specifying policy incentives promulgated by governments and differentiating among adopters and non-adopters advances understanding of the impacts of public policies on land use.";"Chavez, Andrea Birgit

"AGRIS:US201400187069";"Impacts of Global and National Policy on the Management and Conservation of Sacred Groves of India";"";"India is home to thousands of community-protected forests, called sacred groves. Sacred forests or groves are sites that have cultural or spiritual significance to the people who live around them. These areas may also be key reservoirs of biodiversity. In India, most sacred groves are managed by a community group, not by a government agency. They are often private or community land, not formal protected areas or parks. This poses an interesting challenge in terms of future management and possible policy relating to the sacred groves. On the international level, organizations such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and UNESCO have created guidelines for management of sacred sites. On the national level, India’s past Forest Acts and recent Forest Rights Act have relevance to the sacred groves. Local differences in land tenure also affect the groves. Ethnographic research conducted in 2009 and 2010 in the states of Meghalaya and Karnataka, India, evaluated the historic and current management and beliefs associated with sacred forests. Cultural change and pressure to use natural resources within the groves is leading to reduction of these forest areas. In the future, a creative combination of policy approaches to conserve groves that respects their spiritual values is recommended.";"Ormsby, Alison A.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IND;001";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400187069";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-011-9441-8";"";"";"";"783-793"
"AGRIS:US201600014040";"Looking back to see forward: the legal niceties of land theft in land rushes";"";"This paper aims to make a modest contribution to an overdue need to locate the current land rush in its historical context, less as a new phenomenon than as a surge in the continuing capture of ordinary people's rights and assets by capital-led and class-creating social transformation. It aims to do so by looking back to earlier land rushes, and particularly to those which have bearing upon sub-Saharan Africa, the site of most large-scale involuntary land loss today. In particular, the paper focuses upon a central tool of land rushes, property law. The core argument made is that land rushes past and present have relied upon legal manipulations which deny that local indigenous (‘customary’) tenures deliver property rights, thereby legalizing the theft of the lands of the poor or subject peoples. Even prior to capitalist transformation this feudal-derived machination was an instrument of aligned class privilege and power, later elaborated to justify mass land and resource capture through colonialism. Now it is routinely embedded in the legal canons of elite-aligned agrarian governance as the means of retaining control over the land resources which rural communities presume are their own.";"Alden Wily, Liz";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"property rights;land";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600014040";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.674033";"";"";"";"751-775"

"AGRIS:US201500058560";"socio-ecological drivers of forest degradation in part of the tropical peatlands of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia";"";"Connections between human activities (social systems) and nature (ecological systems) are key factors affecting forest-cover change in tropical peatland ecosystems. However, the complexity of these socio-ecological factors is often poorly understood. This study identifies the socio-ecological factors influencing land-cover change in the ex-Mega Rice Project area of Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. A systems thinking approach was used to construct two causal loop diagrams to assess the interrelationships between land-cover change, actors' choice and their motivation to convert land cover. The analysis reveals that current community livelihood activities to improve welfare and maintain food availability are the main endogenous drivers of land- and forest-cover change in the study area. Unintentional fire resulting from uncontrolled slash-and-burn practices by local communities is the main mechanism of forest-cover change. Land tenure uncertainty has also accelerated community land claiming using fire. Our analysis indicates that forest access, commodity prices and rainfall patterns are dominant exogenous drivers of land-cover change. Programmes that emphasize sustainable sources of food and income for local communities in conjunction with physical peatland restoration activities, such as drainage canal-blocking and reforestation, should be the key features of interventions aimed at preventing further peatland degradation.";"Medrilzam, Medrilzam

"AGRIS:US201400153769";"mass-balance study on chloride fluxes in a large central European catchment during 1900–2010";"";"Using data on long-term monitoring of water quality, mass budgets, and empirical models, we quantified chloride (Cl) leaching from major diffuse and point sources in a large central European catchment (upper Vltava river, Czech Republic) over a 110-year period (1900–2010), with the major aim to evaluate the influence of historical changes in land use and management practices on Cl leaching from agricultural land. The Cl input to farmland in synthetic fertilizers, livestock feed, and atmospheric deposition tripled in the 1950s–1980s (from 23 to 64� kg� ha⁻¹� year⁻¹ on average), and then abruptly decreased to ~14� kg� ha⁻¹� year⁻¹ during 1990–2010. The proportion of drained agricultural land rapidly increased from 4� % in the 1950s to its maximum of 43� % in the 1990s. Until the 1950s, the Cl leaching from agricultural land followed a simple dose–response function. Then, agricultural soils retained on average 16� ±� 4� kg� ha⁻¹� year⁻¹ of Cl during 1959–1985, when the most important changes in land use and management practices occurred, and subsequently became a net Cl source of 11� ±� 3� kg� ha⁻¹� year⁻¹ on average during 1986–2010, when Cl input to soils declined and drainage of new land ceased. Our data suggest that the temporal changes in the Cl storage in agricultural land are associated with changes in Cl concentrations in both permanent soil water and soils. Physico-chemical conditions in freshly drained soils, namely elevated aeration and high concentrations of soil organic matter (SOM), and high Cl inputs probably resulted in a Cl immobilization in soils by formation of organic chlorine (Clₒᵣg) and adsorption that was higher than the Cl production from Clₒᵣg mineralization and desorption. In contrast, Clₒᵣg mineralization and Cl desorption exceeded the Cl retention during the consecutive period of low Cl inputs and decreasing SOM concentrations in agricultural soils. Our study implies that changes in land use and agricultural management can significantly affect dose–response functions even for Cl, which is traditionally considered and modelled as a conservative ion.";"Kopáček, Jiří

Such reforestation will also sequester carbon. Whereas most investigative emphasis has been on carbon stored in biomass, the effects of reforestation on soil organic carbon (SOC) stores and fertility are not known. Two 26year old reforestation experiments with four Eucalyptus species (E. cladocalyx var nana, E. occidentalis, E. sargentii and E. wandoo) were compared with agricultural sites (Field). SOC stores (to 0.3m depth) ranged between 33 and 55Mgha⁻¹, with no statistically significant differences between tree species and adjacent farmland. Farming comprised crop and pasture rotations. In contrast, the reforested plots contained additional carbon in the tree biomass (23–60Mgha⁻¹) and litter (19–34Mgha⁻¹), with the greatest litter accumulation associated with E. sargentii. Litter represented between 29 and 56% of the biomass carbon and the protection or utilization of this litter in fire-prone, semi-arid farmland will be an important component of carbon management. Exch-Na and Exch-Mg accumulated under E. sargentii and E. occidentalis at one site. The results raise questions about the conclusions of SOC sequestration studies following reforestation based on limited sampling and reiterate the importance of considering litter in reforestation carbon accounts.";"Harper, R.J.

The status of 119 previously identified (2009) abandoned residential housing developments was reinvestigated in 2013 using the most current available high-resolution aerial photography with a randomly selected number of sites (40) in Greenville, Pickens and Spartanburg Counties in South Carolina. The original land cover before any housing developments was determined based on historical infrared aerial imagery (1999). Development sites were categorized based on the development status: no change, active development or completed development. Site locations were used to determine network distance to major cities and schools to determine if location is related to current development status. Historical aerial photos showed that the majority of land originally developed was forest land. Site visits indicated that 24 out of 40 sites previously identified as abandoned are in various stages of recent construction (three out of five in Pickens County, three out of 15 in Spartanburg County and 18 out of 20 in Greenville County). Of the 19 sites that were labeled as active through a field visit 15 were positively identified as active by using the aerial imagery. Sites with recent construction were closest to schools, but distance to urban centers was not a factor. This study suggests that proximity to schools may be a driving factor in restarting previously abandoned developments.";"Post, Christopher

"AGRIS:US201301624231";"Assessment of Water Quality Trends in the Minnesota River using Non-Parametric and Parametric Methods";"";"Excessive loading of sediment and nutrients to rivers is a major problem in many parts of the United States. In this study, we tested the non-parametric Seasonal Kendall (SEAKEN) trend model and the parametric USGS Quality of Water trend program (QWTREND) to quantify trends in water quality of the Minnesota River at Fort Snelling from 1976 to 2003. Both methods indicated decreasing trends in flow-adjusted concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphorus (OP) and a generally increasing trend in flow-adjusted nitrate plus nitrite-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration. The SEAKEN results were strongly influenced by the length of the record as well as extreme years (dry or wet) earlier in the record. The QWTREND results, though influenced somewhat by the same factors, were more stable. The magnitudes of trends between the two methods were somewhat different and appeared to be associated with conceptual differences between the flow-adjustment processes used and with data processing methods. The decreasing trends in TSS, TP, and OP concentrations are likely related to conservation measures implemented in the basin. However, dilution effects from wet climate or additional tile drainage cannot be ruled out. The increasing trend in NO3-N concentrations was likely due to increased drainage in the basin. Since the Minnesota River is the main source of sediments to the Mississippi River, this study also addressed the rapid filling of Lake Pepin on the Mississippi River and found the likely cause to be increased flow due to recent wet climate in the region.";"Johnson, Heather O.

How do companies manage IP? What role do donations of IP play in IP management? We used in-depth interviews and an on-line survey to gather data. We found that firms develop their IP position from a wide variety of sources such as joint ventures, acquisitions, and consulting contracts, but internal development is still the primary source of IP. Organizationally, three structural archetypes of IP management were identified: a centralized structure, a purely decentralized IP structure and a compromise structure involving a divisional assignment where a multi-business unit or division committee oversees IP. IP donations clearly do not appear to be a major phenomenon at the present time. Our survey results suggest that tax benefits are an important driver and that recent tax law changes have diminished the incentives to donate IP. The uncertainty of tax benefits and the costs associated with IP valuation appear to be the main disincentives.";"Carlsson, Bo

"AGRIS:US201500219875";"Water content dynamics in a volcanic ash soil slope in southern Chile";"";"Andisols present exceptional physical properties, making up < 1% of the world's soils. While there is a lot of information about non‐volcanic soil properties, research about soils of volcanic origin is limited. Specifically, no major studies have been carried out to improve our knowledge of these soils' hydrological behavior, which is relevant due to the impact of climate change on water resources and to the soil's role in the hydrological cycle. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze the water content dynamics of a soil slope derived from volcanic ashes under different land covers. We hypothesized that land cover, rainfall, and air temperature, in addition to the hydraulic properties of the volcanic ash soil, regulate the slope's water content dynamics. Our study was conducted in S Chile, in a fluvial terrace covered by pastures in the uplands, a native forest in the adjacent slope, and a hygrophilous forest in the floodplain at the base of the slope, surrounding a stream. Soil physical properties, such as bulk density (Db), volume of macropores (wCP), plant available water (PAW) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were studied. Rainfall, air temperature, volumetric water content (θFᵢₑₗd) and soil temperature were continuously measured with data loggers. The groundwater level was also measured. Water content dynamics reflect the behavior of rainfall and air/soil temperatures under different land covers, as well as, revealing the specific behavior of volcanic soil's pore system (e.g., Db < 0.9 Mg m⁻³). Soil depths exposed to more intensive and dynamic wetting and drying cycles presented well‐defined water release ranges as compared to the pore system of deeper soil horizons. Soils present large water holding capacities (PAW > 24%), however, during summer they can reach volumetric water contents near to the permanent wilting point quickly at a depth of 5 cm. The water table altitude was directly related to the temporal changes of θFᵢₑₗd measured at a depth of 50 cm, highlighting the fact that the saturated and unsaturated zones are connected.";"Dörner, José

"AGRIS:US201301827785";"effects of early and late-season fires on mortality, dispersal, physiology and breeding of red-backed fairy-wrens (Malurus melanocephalus)";"";"Context. Mismanaged fire is one of the main processes threatening biodiversity in northern Australian savannas. While the suite of species adversely affected by fire has been quite well documented, empirical studies that seek to identify the ecological mechanisms that underpin these declines are rare. This dearth of mechanistic knowledge is hindering the refinement and development of conservation management practices and policy, such as early dry-season prescribed burning programmes. Aims. Our aim was to describe why red-backed fairy-wrens (RBWs; Malurus melanocephalus) decline after fire, as shown by previous studies. Methods. We examined the effects of early and late dry-season fire (and an unburnt control) on the mortality, dispersal, physiology and breeding of colour-marked RBWs. We also tested whether the early fire area became an important refuge after the late fire. Key results. Neither fire treatment caused a detectable increase in mortality. Individuals relocated short distances to unburnt habitat following both fires. Some individuals used the early fire area after the late fire, but only if they were already living nearby and most also relied on adjacent unburnt habitat. Blood-parasite infection and pectoral-muscle attrition were unaffected by the treatments. The early fire caused loss of body mass at a time when the control population gained mass after breeding, whereas the late fire had no effect on mass. Blood haemoglobin concentrations in birds affected by the late fire deviated from the levels observed in the control population, presumably because of disruption of behaviours associated with the onset of the breeding season. Mayfield estimations of daily egg-survival probability showed no difference among the treatments, whereas the daily probability of nestling survival was significantly lower in the late fire area. Pairs affected by the late fire also had a shorter breeding season and none attempted multiple broods after earlier successes. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the reproductive output of RBWs is low following late dry-season fire, and that this is the main mechanism that explains their decline. Implications. This study provides support for the value of using early dry-season prescribed burning to limit the effects of late dry-season wildfire. However, there are important caveats to this, such as the retention of near-by unburnt habitat, and the consideration of variable regeneration rates for different vegetation types.";"Murphy, Stephen A.

"AGRIS:US201600056860";"Comparative Investigation of Image Fusion in the Context of Classification";"";"Image fusion assists in visual interpretation, mapping, change detection and many other applications. Multispectral and Panchromatic images are fused to produce images having enhanced spatial and spectral properties. These properties are generally distorted from original images. The aim of this paper is to identify the effectiveness of the several fusion techniques based on the distortions and applications. This paper employs seven image fusion techniques namely, Brovey transform, intensity hue saturation, high pass filter, principle component analysis, UNB Pansharpening, wavelet transform and multiplicative, available in various commercial image processing software. The data for this study are panchromatic image of Cartosat-1 and multispectral image of IRS - P6 LISS 4 sensor of study area, Bhopal Municipal Corporation area, M.P. State, India. The effectiveness of image fusion techniques is determined by quantitative and qualitative assessments. Quantitative assessment is divided into two parts: 1) assessment of fusion techniques by statistical parameters and 2) accuracy assessment of land use maps generated from the fused images. For part 1, three parameters namely, mean bias, correlation coefficient and Q4 quality index, have been used. Based on the results of part 1, UNB Pansharpening and wavelet transform are the best among seven fusion techniques. For part 2, Gaussian and Artificial Neural Network classifiers have been used to generate land cover maps. However, the accuracy results are inconclusive to identify a single best method. Nevertheless, image fusion by wavelet transform has provided best results in both the sector. Hence, wavelet transform is concluded as the best among selected fusion techniques.";"Gupta, Anshu

Using field work data we examine whether homebuyers willingness to pay is influenced by the biological condition of the neighboring riparian habitat and how homebuyers value alternative manmade green areas, specifically golf courses. We also explore the relationship between the field data and remote sensing vegetation indices.  The results of a hedonic analysis of houses that sold within 0.2 miles of 51 stratified-random selected riparian survey sites in Tucson, Arizona reveals that homebuyers significantly value habitat quality and negatively value manmade park-like features.  Homebuyers are willing to pay twenty percent more to live near a riparian corridor that is densely vegetated and contains more shrub and tree species, particularly species that are dependent on perennial water flow. These environmental premiums are significant, outweighing structural factors such as an additional garage or swimming pool. Likewise, proximity to a riparian habitat with low biological quality or to a golf course lowers property values.";"Katz, G.

"AGRIS:US201500198182";"Objective classification of air quality monitoring sites over Europe";"";"The observation sites that make up air quality monitoring networks can have very different characteristics (topography, climatology, distance to emission sources, etc), which are partially described in the meta-information provided with data sets. At the scale of Europe, the description of the sites depends on the institute(s) in charge of the air quality monitoring in each country, and is based on specific criteria that can be sometimes rather subjective. The purpose of this study is to build an objective, homogeneous, and pollutant-specific classification of European air quality monitoring sites, primarily for the purpose of model verification and chemical data assimilation. Most studies that tackled this issue so far were based on limited data sets, and often took into account additional external data such as population density, emission estimates, or land cover maps. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of a classification only based on the past time series of measured pollutants. The underlying idea is that the true fingerprint of a given monitoring site lies within its past observation values. On each site to be categorized, eight indicators are defined to characterize each pollutant time series (O₃, NO₂, NO, SO₂, or PM₁₀) of the European AirBase and the French BDQA (Base de Données de Qualité de l’Air) reference sets of validated data over the period 2002–2009. A Linear Discriminant Analysis is used to best discriminate the rural and urban sites. After projection on the Fisher axis, ten classes are finally determined on the basis of fixed thresholds, for each molecule. The method is validated by cross-validation and by direct comparison with the existing meta-data. The link between the classes obtained and the meta-data is strongest with NO, NO₂, and PM₁₀. Across Europe, the classification exhibits interesting large-scale features: some contrasts between different regions depend on the pollutant considered. Comparing the classes obtained for different pollutants at the same site reveals an interesting consistency between the separate classifications. The robustness of the method is finally assessed by comparing the classifications obtained for two distinct subsets of years. The robustness – and thus the skill of the objective classification – is satisfying for all of the species, and is highest with NO and NO₂.";"Joly, Mathieu

In this study, we proposed a localized bookkeeping model and estimated the sources and sinks of carbon from forest land use and managements between 1961 and 2010 in two arid regions of Central Asia, e.g., Kazakhstan and Xinjiang, China. The results indicate that the forest land use in these two regions acted as a carbon sink, with a total carbon sequestration of 43.27Tg and 20.74Tg respectively. Accelerated afforestation led to strong carbon sequestration (47.43Tg in Xinjiang and 34.29Tg in Kazakhstan) and forest fire were the main carbon sources (2.99Tg in Xinjiang and 12.51 in Kazakhstan) in both regions. Although there were large amounts of wood production from logging, the carbon flux from this activity was small due to the joint action of wood oxidization and trees recovery. Compared with logging, deforestation area for cultivation was much smaller, but its carbon emission was considerable. The differences on the forestry regimes such as afforestation incentives, logging and fire prohibitions in these two regions were significant, resulting in different effects on their carbon fluxes. This study elucidates the carbon function of forest land use in Central Asia and further deepens our understanding of the influence of forest land use on the global carbon balance.";"Chen, Yaoliang

Concentrations of SO₄ ²⁻ and K⁺, and pH in creek water were lower, and NO₃-N and Na⁺ concentrations were higher in shifting-cultivation land compared to land with either plantation or natural forest or a combination of these cover types. Shifting cultivation effects on some water quality parameters were not significant due to change in land cover of the watershed between two sampling periods either through introduction of planted tree species or naturally regenerated vegetation. Conductivity and concentrations of HCO₃ ⁻, PO₄ ³⁻, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in creek water showed no definite trend between shifting cultivation and the other land cover types. At one area near the Forest Range Office of Barkal, creek water pH was 5.8 under land cover with a combination of shifting cultivation and plantation. At this area Na⁺ concentration in shifting-cultivation land ranged from 32.33 to 33.00 mg·L⁻¹ and in vegetated area from 25.00 to 30.50 mg·L⁻¹ in 2007. At another area, Chaliatali Chara, SO₄ ²⁻ concentration in a shifting-cultivation watershed ranged from 4.46 to 10.51 mg·L⁻¹, lower than in a vegetated watershed that ranged from 11.69 to 19.98 mg·L⁻¹ in 2007. SO₄ ²⁻ concentration in this shifting-cultivation area ranged from 1.28 to 1.37 mg·L⁻¹ and in the vegetated area from 1.37 to 3.50 mg·L⁻¹ in 2008.";"Karmakar, Shyamal

About 55% of Malaysianland area is forested and endows a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Peat swampforests constitute a significant component of forest and account for about 75% of thecountry’s total wetlands. Many peat swamp forests have already been converted tonew land uses including palm oil plantations, agriculture and housing. The south-eastPahang peat swamp forest (SEPPSF), located at Pahang state is the largest peatswamp forest cover in Peninsular Malaysia and is believed to be the mainland Asia’slargest and intact peat swamp forest. It harbours unique flora and fauna, providesbenefits and services of national interest and supports the livelihood of the aborigines(Orang Asli) communities. Many of the benefits and services from peat swamp forestsare unpriced and this can lead to faulty land use decision making. Non marketvaluation can provide important information on the value of many currently unpriceditems and enable decision makers to consider the opportunity costs of proposed landuse changes. Total economic value (TEV), which includes use and non-use values, isa complex method to determine the estimated total benefits for a tropical forest. Thisstudy reports on a contingent valuation study of existence value (non-use value) of theSEPPSF.

"AGRIS:US201301606753";"Barriers to adoption of sustainable agriculture practices: Change agent perspectives";"";"Conventional agriculture systems of production often lead to environmental degradation, economic problems and even social conflict. The efficacy of agriculture systems conducive to the economic, environmental and social sustainability of farming operations has been demonstrated, yet the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is not widespread. This qualitative study is based on a web-based survey instrument designed to elicit the barriers to adoption of sustainable agriculture practices (SAP) perceived by a positional and network sample of 269 change agents working with farmers in the US South. The analysis examines the general proposition that reluctance to change to SAP is an overused rationale of change agents that tends to mask real barriers that we endeavor to elicit in the survey. It was found that despite having support from technical assistance providers, farmers are rarely adopting SAP. Change agents often are not well prepared to attend to farmers' needs regarding SAP, particularly the needs of specific farming situations. Thus, farmers often struggle to obtain accurate information about the benefits of SAP. Government support programs often fail to encourage adoption due to lack of funding, inappropriate design and ineffective targeting of incentives. Reluctance to change is frequently mentioned by change agents, but more as a way of blaming farmers for nonadoption than explaining the often tangible reasons for their behaviors. Social barriers, land tenure, infrastructure and incompatibility are other significant impediments to adoption. Strategies such as improved management of the existing information, careful design of economic support programs and extension efforts addressed to change agents themselves could help overcome some of the barriers identified by change agents.";"Rodriguez, Joysee M.

"AGRIS:US201500216520";"Using satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration and groundwater changes to determine anthropogenic water fluxes in land surface models";"";"Irrigation is a widely used water management practice that is often poorly parameterized in land surface and climate models. Previous studies have addressed this issue via use of irrigation area, applied water inventory data, or soil moisture content. These approaches have a variety of drawbacks including data latency, accurately prescribing irrigation intensity, and a lack of conservation of water volume for models using a prescribed soil moisture approach. In this study, we parameterize irrigation fluxes using satellite observations of evapotranspiration (ET) compared to ET from a suite of land surface models without irrigation. We then incorporate the irrigation flux into the Community Land Model (CLM) and use a systematic trial-and-error procedure to determine the ground- and surface-water withdrawals that are necessary to balance the new irrigation flux. The resulting CLM simulation with irrigation produces ET that matches the magnitude and seasonality of observed satellite ET well, with a mean difference of 6.3 mm month−1 and a correlation of 0.95. Differences between the new CLM ET values and satellite-observed ET values are always less than 30 mm month−1 and the differences show no pattern with respect to seasonality. The results reinforce the importance of accurately parameterizing anthropogenic hydrologic fluxes into land surface and climate models to assess environmental change under current and future climates and land management regimes.";"Anderson, R.

"AGRIS:US2016220409";"Determinants of Land-Use Change In the United States 1982-1997";"";"Changes in the use of land in the United States produce significant economic and environmental effects with important implications for a wide variety of policy issues, including protection of wildlife habitat, management of urban growth, and mitigation of global climate change. In contrast to previous descriptive and qualitative analyses of the trends in national land use, this paper uses an econometric approach to isolate the importance of historical changes in land-use profits and key government policies in determining national land-use changes from 1982 to 1997. The policies we examine are the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and total government payments to crop producers. We estimate a national-level discrete choice model of changes among the major land-use categories (crops, pasture, forest, urban, range, and CRP) with parcel-level observations of land use and land quality from the U.S.D.A. National Resources Inventory (NRI) and measures of county-level land-use net returns from a variety of sources. We then use fitted values from the econometric model to simulate land-use change from 1982 to 1997 under a series of factual and counterfactual scenarios that isolate the effects of different economic and policy factors. The simulations suggest how changes in economic returns and government policies have driven land-use changes in the past and will continue to affect nationwide land-use changes in the future. For example, we find that the introduction of the CRP and the decline in crop profits were the most significant explanatory factors driving the decline in cropland. Our results highlight some ""unintended consequences"" of government policies and the importance of net returns to a range of alternative land uses as determinants of land area change for each particular use.";"Lubowski, Ruben N.

"AGRIS:US201600195311";"Sand winning in Dormaa as an interlocking of livelihood strategies with environmental governance regimes";"";"In this article, the attempt is made to address regime interaction in environmental governance by emphasising human livelihood action as a causal factor in this interaction. The paper elucidates how governing human behaviour on environmental resources is a process of interaction between different environmental governance regimes. With a qualitative case study of sand winning in the Dormaa Municipality and Dormaa East district in midwestern Ghana, the article shows strategic ways landowners and sand vendors pursue and legitimise their livelihood, and in the process bring about interaction between a tax regime on sand winning and the customary property rights regime of the area. It notes therefore that regime interaction is not only caused by differences in the structure of institutions, but also through the ways humans act to pursue their livelihoods. Based on this, the paper highlights the need for consciousness towards livelihoods of people and how such livelihoods are pursued as important contexts within which regimes function and interact.

We found that key nutrients were likely to be lost at the landscape scale as grazing increased, rather than just being redistributed. Water infiltration increased but runoff was probably lost more readily due to the lack of barriers to flow. Water and nutrients were largely decoupled. We surmised that any increased production in drainage lines capturing runoff did not compensate for lost production on surrounding slopes. Recovery was unlikely to be spontaneous and would depend on reconstructing the landscape's natural heterogeneity and managing grazing carefully. Options for intervention would be constrained by cost.";"Sparrow, A.D.

"AGRIS:US201500058742";"Halland's forests during the last 300 years: a review of Malmström (1939)";"";"Carl Malmström's historical forest maps of the province of Halland, in south-western Sweden, were published over 70 years ago, but are still important to science and conservation. They show the transformation of a seventeenth century landscape of temperate broadleaves to a landscape dominated by open land and heather (Calluna vulgaris) in the nineteenth century, and to a landscape of coniferous forest plantations in the twentieth century. This article summarizes and reviews the original research, first published in Swedish in 1939. Malmström concludes that the large changes to forest abundance and composition over the last 300 years were predominantly the product of human endeavours. The most important causal factors behind the decrease in forest area until the mid-nineteenth century were the incentives to increase arable land and meadows, the grazing and burning of Calluna heaths, and logging for timber, fencing and firewood. The subsequent increase in forest abundance after this period were due to agricultural improvements, the cessation of heather burning and active reforestation. Malmström had a relatively holistic view of the ecosystem for his time, yet his perspective remains that of an early twentieth century silviculturalist as he did not put his observations into the context of conservation or landscape ecology. Despite acknowledging that beech forest is the natural vegetation for the area, he still concludes that coniferous plantations have won full domiciliary rights. Recent research has confirmed Malmström's views on the patterns and processes that characterized changes in land use and forest composition in the province of Halland, although there has been some question as to the “naturalness” of seventeenth century beech forests.";"Lindbladh, Matts

Also, the types of land management practices farmers use differ across thedifferent ecological zones. The policy implication is that agricultural interventions should bedeveloped on the basis of agro-ecological zones, and blanket crop improvement packagesshould be avoided. The recommended policy action is that food crop farmers should behelped to improve the management of their agricultural lands by ecological zones at twolevels. First, the practices that are common and promote agricultural production in each zoneshould be targeted for improvement. Such a policy will re-orient farmers towards theadoption of more sustainable farm practices. Second, land management practices that are notcurrently being used by farmers in each zone but have potential to improve crop productionshould be identified and promoted in the respective agro-ecological zones.

Producers' acreage response was included in the dynamic model considering crop rotation effect. In the crop rotation model, a modified Bellman equation was used to dynamically optimize the net present value of farm profit for a five-year interval. This simulation process was repeated through the year 2050. Then yield, price, and acreage response were compiled to generate realized profit. Results generally indicated that reduction in crop yields due to climate change results in reduced farm profitability for most of the states studied. Predicted climate change is more likely to pose a problem for agricultural production and profitability in the southern U.S. states as compared to the northern U.S. states. Our results also suggest that acreage response alone is not sufficient to ameliorate the potential negative effects of global climate change on agricultural production and profitability.The results of this research are expected to provide a foundation for future related research to aid producers' crop rotation decisions in an unstable price environment.";"Cai, Ruohong

Thus, information about how vegetation composition and structure varies with disturbance is fundamental to conservation of such areas. This study aimed to investigate the effects of disturbance on the population structure and regeneration potential of five dominant woody species within forest where local communities harvest wood and graze livestock. Vegetation structure and environmental variables were assessed in 50 quadrats (20 m × 20 m). In most of both disturbed and undisturbed treatments, Juniperus procera was the highest contributor to the basal area of the forest, while that of Olinia rochetiana was the lowest. Analysis of population structure showed high density at lower Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and low density at higher DBH classes. Undisturbed forest treatments had 84% canopy cover, 22 m mean vegetation height and a density of 1320 trees of dominant species and 1024 seedlings/saplings ha⁻¹. In disturbed habitats, canopy cover (73%), mean vegetation height (18 m) and density of dominant trees and saplings were significantly lower than in undisturbed habitats. Thus, to ensure species, survival and maintain species diversity managed use of the protected area is essential.";"Kidane, Leul

Changes in land use leads to changes in both meteorological and chemical fields. In this study, the impact of land use change in Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ, indicating Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) areas on meteorology and ozone concentrations are studied using the WRF–Chem model. Land use change is represented by two different land cover data sets: USGS and MODIS. Monthly-average simulations show that urbanization causes an increase in 2-m temperature by maximum 2.4 °C and 3.2 °C in these two areas, respectively. Wind speed simulations suggest a decrease (average 1.2 m s⁻¹) in daytime for YRD, and in nighttime for JJJ. Dew point differences show a dry effect over both areas, with maximum −3 °C in JJJ and −2.4 °C in YRD. Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) height increases by 400 m (maximum in JJJ) and 600 m (maximum in YRD) for daytime, and nighttime increases are less than 100 m. Daytime ozone concentrations in JJJ increase by 20 ppb due to urbanization, while in YRD the difference is around 5 ppb. Compared to observations, mean errors in urban areas was improved when using updated land use information by 14.2% and 35.6%, and in suburban areas by 5.8% and 10.7%. Updating land use data set in air quality modeling is important in application to regions with rapid urbanization such as China. The effects due to land use change can be as large as those due to 20% increase in emissions.";"Yu, Man

Vegetatively propagated turf bermudagrass cultivars have been extensively used in the turf industry not only in the USA but also in many other countries. Accordingly, the objectives of the study were to examine simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for their ability to distinguish commonly grown clonal turf bermudagrass cultivars, which were derived through crosses and mutations, from each other and their respective parent cultivars and to develop a set of SSR markers for accurate identification of commercially used clonal cultivars. Thirty-two clonal turf bermudagrass genotypes comprising 29 commercially released cultivars and 3 Oklahoma State University experimental lines were assessed by 11 microsatellite markers. A total of 141 DNA fragments were generated for the 11 primer pairs in the 32 bermudagrass genotypes, with an average of 12.8 bands per primer pair. Forty-four fragments were cultivar specific. The SSR markers successfully identified 22 cultivars when mutant cultivars had the same banding patterns as the 2 parent cultivars, ‘Tifgreen’ and ‘Tifway’. It was concluded from the study that the SSR markers are highly polymorphic and can be utilized as a reliable tool for accurate cultivar identification in nonmutated bermudagrass.";"Wang, Zan

Trees can help prevent landdegradation and increase biodiversity while at the same time allow for the continued use of the land toproduce agricultural crops. In fact, growing trees alongside crops is known to improve both the productivityand sustainability of the land. However, due to high labour-input requirements, high costs of establishment,and delayed revenue returns, trees are often not economically attractive to landholders. Because of theKyoto Protocol, and the growing emphasis on market-based solutions to environmental problems, theability of trees to sequester and store CO2 has altered the economic landscape of agroforestry systems. Theeconomic and management implications of carbon-sequestration payments on agroforestry systems areaddressed in this study using a bioeconomic modelling approach. An agroforestry system in Indonesia issimulated using a biophysical process model. A general economic analysis of this system, from thestandpoint of individual landholders, is then developed and the implications for management and policy arediscussed.";"Wise, Russell M.

The method applied to create the map is based on five categories of areas with different characters of underground mining influence making use of the so-called building site categories. The individual areas with different groups represent various suitability or unsuitability for founding new structures in such influenced territories. They will also reflect a higher or lower degree of influence on already existing structures. Areas affected by underground mining of category V are suitable without any significant restrictions. Areas of the medium category represent influence of building site categories III and IV with economically acceptable measures for founding engineering purposes. The last type is areas with high influence in the category I and II and they are clearly unsuitable for new development. Structures may be founded there in exceptional cases only. This methodology was applied on four map sheets in 1:10,000 scale in a coal mining region in the town of Karviná and its environs in the direction to the City of Ostrava (Czech Republic).

Historically, humans have increased agricultural output primarily by cropland expansion and agricultural intensification. The cropland area was primarily gained at the expense of grassland and forests. Apart from grassland conversion, increasing consumption of calorie- and meat-intensive diets drives the intensification of livestock systems, which is shifting steadily from grazing to feeding with crops. To cope with the environmental degradation due to agriculture, various forms of ‘green payment’ were implemented to promote the adoption of sustainable farming practices over the last two decades in the European Union. The aim of this study is to monitor the recent transitions (1992–2010) between grassland and cropland during two Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms at the French mainland scale. We proposed an innovative approach to link grassland conversion to agricultural commodities and farming systems practices. We first assessed the grassland-to-cropland conversion and further investigated the crop sequence patterns that were observed to be dominant after the conversion through mining land-cover survey data Teruti and Teruti-Lucas. We found the trends of the transitions between grassland and cropland over the two time intervals: The loss of grassland (1992–2003) and restoration or re-expansion of grassland (2006–2010) in mainland France. Our finding on the crop sequence patterns after the grassland conversion reveals two notable evolutions of agricultural production systems. These evolutions were related to the increase in the proportion of cropland in the total agricultural land use. One evolution was most likely influenced by the demand for fodder: The conversion from grazing livestock to feeding livestock. Another evolution was the conversion from livestock production to field crop production. Our results indicate that the intensification of livestock farming systems continued over the last two decades in France. We conclude that, the approach developed in this study can be considered as a generic method for monitoring the transitions between grassland and cropland and further identifying the crop sequence patterns after the grassland conversion from time-series land cover data.";"Ying Xiao, Catherine Mignolet, Jean-Fran?ois Mari, Marc Beno?t

While private ranchers have the option to limit the severity of wildfires through fuels removal treatments, few ranchers engage in such land treatments. Without internalizing the public cost of wildfire suppression in the decision problem, private ranchers likely to under-invest in fuels treatments. In this article, using a bio-economic model of rancher decision making, we analyze the private incentives for engaging in land treatments. We find that the downside shocks on available grazing land due to wildfires are proportionately smaller for larger ranches and that for that reason larger ranches exhibit a greater ability to adjust production in response to wildfires, thus implying a potential source of increasing returns to scale in ranch operation in presence of wildfire risks. We also find that valuation of fuels treatment is substantially different between a private rancher and a “social planner” that internalizes wildfire suppression costs in the decision problem.";"Kobayashi, Mimako

"AGRIS:US201600024937";"Effectiveness of Control Treatments on Young Saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) Plants";"";"Preventing the establishment of saltcedar in new areas requires early detection and rapid response. However, it is unclear when saltcedar develops perennating tissue and which treatments are most efficacious for young plants. The effectiveness of mowing, herbicide, and fire treatments, alone and in combination, was evaluated on saltcedar plants grown from seed to 4, 8, and 12 wk age in 2011 and 6 and 12 wk age in 2012. Plants were clipped to 2 cm height or remained intact. Plants were then exposed to no treatment (control), herbicide application (0.12 mg ae imazapyr), or treated with fire for 30 or 60 s. Six weeks after treatment, plant survival and tallest living shoot height were recorded and roots were dried and weighed for biomass comparison. Saltcedar survival increased with greater plant age. No 4-wk-old plants survived herbicide or fire treatments, whereas 6-wk-old plants were eliminated by fire. Clipping alone did not control plants of any age but clipping before fire was the most effective control for older plants. Herbicide alone did not kill 8- and 12-wk-old plants during the study period, but reduced plant vigor suggests that these applications may be effective in the long-term. Fire alone for 60 s was the most effective single treatment for 12-wk-old plants. Root biomass was reduced for all treatments relative to untreated plants with the lowest biomass typically associated with fire treatments. Resprouts were shortest for combined clipping and herbicide and clipping and fire treatments. Results indicate that saltcedar grown from seed can develop viable belowground reproductive tissues between 6 and 8 wk after germination. Multiple intensive control practices may be required to kill saltcedar plants ≥8 wk of age, whereas younger plants can be controlled by single, less-intensive treatments such as fire.Nomenclature: Arsenal; imazapyr; saltcedar, Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. TARA; T. chinensis Lour. TACH; Tamarix hybrids.Interpretive Summary: Early detection and rapid response is the primary campaign for managing weeds in the United States, yet little is known about the best method for controlling new saltcedar infestations. Older saltcedar individuals are often difficult to control because of the presence of belowground reproductive tissues but when these structures become viable is poorly understood. This research found that young saltcedar response to control treatments is dependent on plant age and treatment. All plants treated with clipping between 4 and 12 wk of age were able to recover and produce robust plants. Destructive treatments such as fire eliminated 4- and 6-wk-old plants but 8- and 12-wk plants often regrew vigorous shoots from belowground buds following complete top-kill by fire. These results suggest that belowground reproductive tissues can become viable between 6 and 8 wk of age. Fire and herbicide alone resulted in younger plant mortality and reduced growth for older saltcedar but the use of these practices will depend on land management options. Clipping prior to herbicide or fire treatment was the most effective control and could be used to treat small populations or individual plants. Fire may be preferred over herbicide application in areas where vegetation is adapted to this disturbance and burn programs are already established. On the other hand, herbicide may be desired where saltcedar density is high, there is minimal herbicide-susceptible native vegetation, and/or the landscape is unsuitable for burning or other mechanical removal methods. Spot fire treatment to individual plants, rather than a large-scale field burn, may be another control option although this technique has not been field-tested.";"Ohrtman, Michelle K.

In this study, we analysed only four periods (excluding 1982 revision plans): 1969, 1991, 2002 and 2012. Between 1969 and 2012, overall changes included a net increase of 3,026� ha in forested areas. Cumulative forest improvement accounted for 2.12� % and the annual rate of total forest improvement averaged 0.08� %. In addition, productive forest areas increased from 36,174 to 70,205� ha between 1969 and 2012. This translates into an average annual productive forest improvement rate of 1.54� %. At the same time, fully covered forest areas with crown closure of “3” (>70� %) increased about 21,321� ha, and young forest areas in developmental stage of “a” (diameter at breast height (dbh) < 8� cm) increased from 716 to 13,305� ha over the 43-year study period. Overall changes show that productive and fully covered forest areas have increased egregiously with a focus on regenerated and young developmental stages. A spatial analysis of metrics over the 43-year study period indicated a more fragmented landscape resulting in a susceptible forest to harsh disturbances.";"Kadioğullari, Ali İhsan

"AGRIS:US2016216279";"Economic Incentives to Conserve Wildlife on Private lands: Analysis and Policy";"";"Some believe that provision of private property rights in wildlife on private land can provide a powerful economic incentive for nature conservation because it enables property owners to market such wildlife or its attributes.  If such marketing is profitable, private landholders will conserve the wildlife concerned and its required habitat.  But land is not always most profitably used for exploitation of wildlife, and many economic values of wildlife (such as non-use economic values) cannot be marketed.  The mobility of some wildlife (their fugitive nature) adds to the limitations of the private property approach.  While some species may be conserved by this approach, it is suboptimal as a single policy approach to nature conservation.  Nevertheless, it is being experimented with in the Northern Territory of Australia where landholders have the possibility of harvesting on their properties a quota of eggs and chicks of red-tailed black cockatoos for commercial sale.  This scheme is expected to provide an incentive to private landholders to retain hollow trees essential for the nesting of these birds.  Aspects of this approach are analysed using this case, and related ones, from Northern Australia.  It is noted that the private property rights approach adopted in southern Africa is unlikely to be equally successful everywhere.The long-term survival of some species depends on their ability to use private lands without severe harassment, either for their migration or to supplement their available resources, for example, the Asian elephant in Sri Lanka.  Nature conservation on private land is often a useful, if not essential, supplement to conservation on public lands.  Community and public incentives for such conservation are outlined.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"002;AUS;LKA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016216279";"http://purl.umn.edu/48973";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201600090632";"Predicting the future effectiveness of protected areas for bird conservation in Mediterranean ecosystems under climate change and novel fire regime scenarios";"";"AIM: Global environmental changes challenge traditional conservation approaches based on the selection of static protected areas due to their limited ability to deal with the dynamic nature of driving forces relevant to biodiversity. The Natura 2000 network (N2000) constitutes a major milestone in biodiversity conservation in Europe, but the degree to which this static network will be able to reach its long‐term conservation objectives raises concern. We assessed the changes in the effectiveness of N2000 in a Mediterranean ecosystem between 2000 and 2050 under different combinations of climate and land cover change scenarios. LOCATION: Catalonia, Spain. METHODS: Potential distribution changes of several terrestrial bird species of conservation interest included in the European Union's Birds Directive were predicted within an ensemble‐forecasting framework that hierarchically integrated climate change and land cover change scenarios. Land cover changes were simulated using a spatially explicit fire‐succession model that integrates fire management strategies and vegetation encroachment after the abandonment of cultivated areas as the main drivers of landscape dynamics in Mediterranean ecosystems. RESULTS: Our results suggest that the amount of suitable habitats for the target species will strongly decrease both inside and outside N2000. However, the effectiveness of N2000 is expected to increase in the next decades because the amount of suitable habitats is predicted to decrease less inside than outside this network. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Such predictions shed light on the key role that the current N2000 may play in the near future and emphasize the need for an integrative conservation perspective wherein agricultural, forest and fire management policies should be considered to effectively preserve key habitats for threatened birds in fire‐prone, highly dynamic Mediterranean ecosystems. Results also show the importance of considering landscape dynamics and the synergies between different driving forces when assessing the long‐term effectiveness of protected areas for biodiversity conservation.";"Regos, Adrián

Here eddy covariance techniques are used to obtain ecosystem-scale measurements of CO₂ fluxes (FC) from a suburban area of Baltimore, Maryland, USA (2002–2006). These are among the first multi-year measurements of FC in a suburban area. The study area is characterized by low population density (1500inhabitants km⁻²) and abundant vegetation (67.4% vegetation land-cover). FC is correlated with photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), soil temperature, and wind direction. Missing hourly FC is gap-filled using empirical relations between FC, PAR, and soil temperature. Diurnal patterns show net CO₂ emissions to the atmosphere during winter and net CO₂ uptake by the surface during summer daytime hours (summer daily total is −1.25gCm⁻²d⁻¹).

According to the relevant statistical data from 1978 to 2006, dynamic change and its driving forces of cultivated land area in Zhejiang Province are analyzed. ① Since the year 1978, cultivated land area has shown a significant fluctuant decreasing trend in Zhejiang Province, China. ② Cultivated land at the two stages of 1984-1988 and 1990-1995 decreases sharply. Large area of cultivated land is occupied by non-agricultural construction. ③ Economic development, population growth and agricultural scientific and technological development are the main driving forces. Contradiction between land and human beings becomes more acute; and the load of cultivated land becomes increasingly heavy. ④ Cumulative reduction area of cultivated land changes with time, showing a ""S""-shaped curve and according with the Logistic Equation. Change of cultivated land of Jiangsu Province in future is forecasted by Logistic Equation. Result shows that the cumulative reduction area of cultivated land will stop increasing until the year 2020 with the total reduction area of 90.91 thousand hectares. Cultivated area of Zhejiang Province will either be stable at the level of 1498.24 thousand hectares or will fluctuate around it. With the development of industrial structure, encroachment of urbanization and industrialization on cultivated land is not ever-increasing, but will tend to stop at a certain stage. Overall consideration on land use demand for food safety and for urbanization and industrialization may become possible with the advancement of technology and the increase of land inputs.";"Qiao, Ruibo

"AGRIS:US201301607792";"Fire frequency influences composition and structure of the shrub layer in an Australian subcoastal temperate grassy woodland";"";"Little is known about the relationship between fire regimes and plant diversity in Australia's temperate grassy woodlands. The effect of fire frequency on shrubs in grassy woodland remnants across Western Sydney's Cumberland Plain was examined. Shrub species richness and composition were compared in sites that had experienced a high, moderate or low frequency of fire over the previous 20 years. Nine sites were surveyed, three in each fire frequency category; most sites, including all low-fire-frequency sites, had burnt 9-36 months prior to sampling. Fire frequency had a profound effect on the composition and structure of the shrub layer. Per cent frequency and density of the prickly shrub Bursaria spinosa (Pittosporaceae) was considerably higher in low-fire-frequency sites than where fires had occurred at least once a decade. In sites where fire had been absent for decades prior to a recent fire, this species dominated the landscape, while elsewhere it occurred as clumps in a grassy matrix. Per cent frequency of other native shrubs, particularly obligate seeders, was greatest at moderate fire frequencies. Exotic shrubs were recorded most often where fire had been rare. While ordination clearly separated out the low-fire-frequency sites, complete separation between high- and moderate-fire-frequency blocks was not achieved. The increase in Bursaria in the absence of fire mirrors the encroachment of woody plants into a range of grassy ecosystems around the world. The sensitivity of obligate seeder species, many of them short-lived legumes with fire-cued seeds, to both very frequent and very infrequent fire shows the vulnerability of these species to extreme fire regimes, despite the safeguards conferred by hard-seededness. Competition from Bursaria, as well as loss of viable seed in the soil, may have contributed to the low frequency of these species after a long inter-fire interval.";"WATSON, PENNY J.

The ethnographic study of one village in each of the two countries contextualizes women's lives in the kinship and marriage system in which power and gender relations are embedded. Current land policies, when implemented in the existing kinship and marriage system, make women's entitlement to land more vulnerable than men's, limit women's choices and weaken their power position. Variations in kinship rules in the two countries lead to different outcomes. In the Chinese village the dominance of patrilocal marriage and exogamous marriages limits women's access to land, whereas in the Vietnamese village the rigid concentration of inheritance to males puts women in a difficult position. The comparison between communities of rural China and Vietnam reveals the importance of considering gender and kinship when studying the implementation and impact of land policies.";"BÉLANGER, DANIÈLE

"AGRIS:US2016222835";"Land Use Consequences of Crop Insurance Subsidies";"";"There have long been concerns that federal crop insurance subsidies may significantly impact land use decisions. It is well known that classical insurance market information asymmetry problems can lead to a social excess of risky land entering crop production. Our conceptual model shows that the problem will arise absent any information failures. This is because the subsidy is i) proportional to acres planted, and ii) greatest for the most production risky land. Using farm-level data, we follow this observation through to establish the implications of subsidies for the extent of crop production, with particular emphasis on U.S. regions where the cropland growth is likely to have marked adverse environmental impacts. Simulation results show that when subsidy rate decreases by 5 percentage points, then about 0.60 percent of insured cropped land will be converted to non-cropped land.  When crop price decreases by 5 percent, then about 1.01 percent of insured cropped land will be converted to non-cropped land.";"Miao, Ruiqing

"AGRIS:US201500067150";"Estimation of runoff, peak discharge and sediment load at the event scale in a medium-size Mediterranean watershed using the AnnAGNPS model";"";"Sediment transport in rivers is an indicator of soil eroded from various sediment sources, of which agricultural land can be a significant one, and the intensity of the phenomenon provides a measure of land degradation at a watershed level. The use of distributed models to solve problems in water resources applications including environmental impacts of land-use changes, effects of climate change on water resources, and water planning and management in a catchment, is quite complex in large Mediterranean catchments for the lack of sufficient data to characterize spatial variability, for the integration of field measurements and model parameter element, and for the imperfect representations of the real processes. In this paper the AnnAGNPS model has been used to estimate runoff, peak discharge and sediment load at the event scale in a semi-arid, medium-size watershed. The study area is the Carapelle torrent (Southern Italy), where continuous rainfall, streamflow and sediment load data are available. Nineteen flood events have been registered in the period 2007-2009 and selected for the application of the model. The aim of the paper is the evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model, given the specific conditions of the semi-arid environments. Particular attention has been focused on the definition of the local crop parameters, of the management scheduling features and to the influence of the synthetic storm distributions on peak discharge predictions. The sensitivity analysis for the most meaningful parameters has been carried out to evaluate the weight of each factor and to assign the correct parameterization avoiding a long sequence of proves to calibrate the model. The SCS Type I was found to be the suitable storm distribution as it provided the highest values of the statistical parameters used to evaluate the performance of the model. The model predictions have proven to be good for runoff and peak discharge and satisfactory for sediment yield. The relative error is lower for high events, this result being quite interesting in semi-arid environments, where most of the annual sediment yield is concentrated in few, severe events.";"Bisantino, T.

"AGRIS:US201500063867";"Food Security and Fossil Energy Dependence: An International Comparison of the Use of Fossil Energy in Agriculture (1991-2003)";"";"The serious food crisis in 2007 has reinstated the issue of food security. In particular, it evokes an old set of questions associated with the sustainability of an adequate food supply: are we facing a systemic shortage of arable land for food production? How serious is the oil dependence of food security in relation to peak oil (the point in time when the maximum rate of global oil extraction is reached)? To answer these questions one has to study the role of technical inputs in agricultural production, especially those inputs generated from fossil energy (how much fossil energy is used? for which inputs? in relation to which tasks?). This paper provides a synchronic comparison—e.g., comparing the use of technical inputs in 21 countries belonging to different typologies, at a given point in time—and a diachronic comparison, e.g., comparing the use of technical inputs in the same sample of 21 countries, over a time window of 12 years (1991–2003). The results confirm the conclusions of previous studies and include the following: (i) current pattern of inputs use reflects the existence of different typologies of constraints in different typologies of countries. Wealthier countries must have a very high productivity of labor, whereas poor and crowded countries must have a very high productivity of land. Different technical inputs are used for different purposes: irrigation and fertilizers are used to boost yield per hectare; machinery and infrastructures to boost the productivity of labor; and (ii) when looking at the changes over the period of 12 years we see a constant and worrisome trend. The pattern of energy use in agriculture associated with the paradigm of industrial agriculture (High External Input Agriculture) has been simply amplified, by doing more of the same, with only minor adjustments in special countries. For those looking for a major transition toward a different pattern of production more focused on rural development, ecological compatibility and quality food, this is a reason for concern.";"Arizpe, Nancy

For landholders of private conservation lands, management for conservation of biodiversity and risk reduction is complicated. Private conservation landholders in eastern Australia directed far less effort towards fire management than other conservation management actions, despite clearly acknowledging the risk and associated responsibilities of fire management on their lands. Nonetheless, landholders did undertake actions to reduce fuel hazards and prepare for wildfire events on their land. Despite the established role and benefits of fire to many ecosystems in the region, landholder understanding of the ecological role of fire was generally poor. Few landholders were aware of ecologically appropriate fire regimes for the vegetation types on their property, and few undertook fire management actions to achieve ecological outcomes. Site-specific obstacles, lack of fire management knowledge and experience, and legal and containment concerns contributed to the low level of fire management observed. There is a need for property-specific fire management planning across all private conservation lands, to further integrate ecological fire requirements into biodiversity management, and prioritise actions that aim to improve conservation outcomes while safeguarding life and property.";"Halliday, Lucy G.

"AGRIS:US201500163355";"Landscape heterogeneity metrics as indicators of bird diversity: Determining the optimal spatial scales in different landscapes";"";"Species distribution models are often used to study the biodiversity of ecosystems. The modelling process uses a number of parameters to predict others, such as the occurrence of determinate species, population size, habitat suitability or biodiversity. It is well known that the heterogeneity of landscapes can lead to changes in species’ abundance and biodiversity. However, landscape metrics depend on maps and spatial scales when it comes to undertaking a GIS analysis. We explored the goodness of fit of several models using the metrics of landscape heterogeneity and altitude as predictors of bird diversity in different landscapes and spatial scales. Two variables were used to describe biodiversity: bird richness and trophic level diversity, both of which were obtained from a breeding bird survey by means of point counts. The relationships between biodiversity and landscape metrics were compared using multiple linear regressions. All of the analyses were repeated for 14 different spatial scales and for cultivated, forest and grassland environments to determine the optimal spatial scale for each landscape typology. Our results revealed that the relationships between species’ richness and landscape heterogeneity using 1:10,000 land cover maps were strongest when working on a spatial scale up to a radius of 125–250m around the sampled point (circa 4.9–19.6ha). Furthermore, the correlation between measures of landscape heterogeneity and bird diversity was greater in grasslands than in cultivated or forested areas. The multi-spatial scale approach is useful for (a) assessing the accuracy of surrogates of bird diversity in different landscapes and (b) optimizing spatial model procedures for biodiversity mapping, mainly over extensive areas.";"Morelli, Federico

Finally, there were chosen three uniform ecological-economic zones: the northern, central and the southern, and in each of these zones – the western and eastern subzones. There were shown the main characteristics, which reflect the peculiarities of the selected zones.";"Kalmykov, A.V., Belarus State Academy of Agriculture, Gorki (Belarus)";"";"";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"ru";"environment;land use;land management;zoning;land";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"BLR";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=BY2012000814";"http://elc.baa.by/vestnik2012-1/vestnik_bgsha_1_2012%20.zip";"";"";"";"111-119"

Based on disaster theory and using shallow groundwater of the lower reaches of Liaohe River Plain as the study area, we built an evaluation index system and a contamination index model for groundwater contamination risks from the perspectives of intrinsic vulnerability, external stresses, and functional value. We used data acquisition technology (remote sensing) and spatial analysis technology (GIS) to calculate the value of groundwater contamination risks. The spatial distribution of hotspots was obtained by calculating G index. Results show that groundwater contamination is above a mid-level risk in most of the study area. Areas with extreme high risk account for 37.86%, areas with high risk 32.47%, areas with moderate risk 12.07%, areas with light risk 3.17%, and areas with slight risk 14.43%. Hotspots areas are mainly located in central Shenyang City, northwest of Xinmin City, Beizhen City and Liaozhong County. Coldspots are mainly in Panjin City, Yingkou City, Dashiqiao City, Dawa County and Panshan County. The results reflect the spatial distribution and mechanism of groundwater contamination risk in the study area and provide relative references for land use planning and groundwater resource protection in the lower reaches of the Liaohe River Plain.";"Caizhi, Sun

The objective of this research is to identify priority areas for forest landscape restoration in Knox County, Tennessee. A cost-benefit analysis is conducted to determine individuals’ willingness to accept reforestation as a substitute for other potential land uses, given the explicit costs and benefits of reforestation. A sequence of hedonic models is used to estimate differences in values attached to housing prices of multiple potential sites for restoration projects values. This approach allows the establishment of an overall price-distance relationship between the amenity values attributable to both deforested and forested areas and their proximities to housing locations within the county. Based on the overall price-distance relationship, the sum of the differences between amenity values of deforested and forested areas is estimated, as reflected in housing prices across different proximities to potential restoration sites. The results of this study show that there are potentially great gains to the community through reforestation projects but those benefits can vary greatly depending on the acreages of potential target sites, the number of houses in the surrounding area, and the proximity of houses surrounding the site.";"Chadourne, Matthew H.

The aim of this article is to investigate the reasons for introducing 3D property in a legal system. This is illustrated by using the Swedish system as an example. In general, without the possibility of forming 3D property units with direct ownership, other forms have to be used, such as indirect ownership or granted user rights. Benefits of ownership in comparison with different types of rights include a more secure way of guaranteeing the possession of real property and the possibility of mortgaging the property. There are lower transaction costs compared with user rights, arising from legally securing three-dimensionally delimited parts of real property. 3D property also enables an increase in the density of private ownership. 3D property is a useful way of solving problems related to the use of space by different parties with different needs. In the Swedish legislation the introduction of 3D property formation has increased the possibility of constructing and financing in particular large and more complex facilities. It has created more secure and clear ways of constructing infrastructure objects and separating them from other types of use within the space of the same traditional property.";"Paulsson, Jenny";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use;property rights;private ownership";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217504";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.12.019";"";"";"";"195-203"

The six steps of Gray Series Forecasting Model are introduced, including generation of series, generation of mean value, establishment of GM (1,1) model, reducing reaction, reliability test, and extrapolation forecast. According to the data of cultivated land area in Puan County from the year 1998 to 2007, Gray System Theory is used to establish the Gray Series Forecasting Model of cultivated land area in Puan City. Since it has passed the reliability test, this model has relatively high fitting accuracy and can be used for extrapolation forecast. Based on this Gray Series Forecasting Model, extrapolation forecast of cultivated land change is conducted in Puan County from 2009 to 2012. Result shows that the expected area of cultivated land will be reduced by 1050 hectares in the years 2009-2012, an annual decrease of 270 hectares. Cultivated land area shows a declining trend year by year. Result of the forecasting model is close to actual value with small prediction error.

"AGRIS:US201400143480";"GIS‐analysis of tree‐line elevation in the Swiss Alps suggests no exposure effect";"";"Counter intuition, an analysis of tree‐line position across the Swiss Alps based on a geographical information system (GIS) with a spatial resolution of 100 m (2.5 million points) revealed no difference in climatic tree‐line altitude with slope exposure. Through step wise discrimination procedures our analysis accounts for anthropogenic tree‐line depression. Any land cover bias affects the frequency of GIS‐points corresponding to tree‐line forests rather than the mean elevation of such points, captured by our analysis. We explain this phenomenon (1) by the absence of significant drought effects in the Alps (no disadvantages for southwest slopes), (2) by the fact that tree tops, unlike low stature vegetation, do not profit from greater radiation warming on south slopes during the growing season but are thermally coupled to free air circulation, and (3) by preliminary data for root zone temperatures during the growing season, which do not differ between south and north slopes, as long as the soil is screened by a closed forest canopy. The overall difference in season length and snow cover, often seen between south and north slopes, does not seem to affect tree‐line position but explains greater natural forest fragmentation on north slopes. It is this greater fragmentation and patchiness (avalanche tracks, snow beds etc.) which seem to have nourished the idea of a generally lower limit of tree growth and tree lines at northern slopes. These results are in line with a recently developed theory, which suggests that tree‐line elevations in humid climates correspond to similar isotherms, irrespective of latitude and thus, season length.";"Paulsen, Jens

This is not as straightforward as might be imagined. It presupposes an unambiguous definition of what constitutes ‘a farm’ and a means of distinguishing those farms which areconsidered to be ‘small’ from the remainder of other farms, that is larger farms. This in turn presupposes an accepted measure of farm size (or amalgam of such measures) and adoption of an agreed size threshold below which farms might be described as ‘small’. However the choices in respect of measure of farm size and threshold for a farm being considered as ‘small’ may depend,respectively, on the particular policy context (for example, contribution to output or employment or land use) and the size distribution of farms within the country(ies) in question. In particular, andanalogous with the definition of poverty, there is a choice to be made as to whether farm size is to be assessed in absolute or relative terms. If the former, virtually all farms in some countries may be considered to be small; if the latter, the existence of a ‘small farm’ sector will inevitably continue.";"Lund, Philip J.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-08-20";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016207854";"http://purl.umn.edu/52847";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US2016209452";"IMPACTS OF PROGRAMS AND ORGANIZATION ON THE ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES IN UGANDA";"";"The government of Uganda is currently decentralizing many of its services including those directly related to agriculture and the environment. Non-government organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) are being asked to take the lead in the provision of government services such as agricultural extension during the transition to demand driven fee-for-service. This paper explores the role of government programs, NGOs and CBOs in the adoption of land management technologies. We find that government programs were better distributed throughout Uganda and were more likely to operate in poorer areas than NGOs and CBOs. This raises the question of whether or not incentives should be provided for NGOs and CBOs to locate or evolve in less-favored areas. Our analysis of household level involvement in organizations between 1990 and 2000 indicates that female-headed households, households with higher proportions of women, and households with higher levels of natural resource dependence were more likely than other households to be involved in organizations whose main focus was not agriculture or the environment. We also found that social capital is an important determinant of organizational participation. The results of our analysis indicate that the presence of an agriculture or environment focused program or organization at the community level had a negative effect on the adoption of animal manuring and a positive affect on the adoption of pesticides. This suggests that spillover effects of programs and organizations may be greater for technologies that have short-term benefits, and which require some degree of coordination to be most effective. Household level involvement in an agriculture or environment focused organization had a positive effect on the adoption of inorganic fertilizer and mulching. Adoption of land management technologies such as manuring that yield longer-term benefits apparently do not spill over to non-participants in local programs and organizations. Thus, direct involvement of households in programs and organizations that promote such technologies may be necessary to ensure technology diffusion throughout communities. This information may be taken as an indicator of the effectiveness or impact of agriculture and environment focused organizations in Uganda, and should be considered in the broader context of the government devolution of services to NGOs and CBOs. Our findings indicate that careful consideration needs to be given to the potential for NGOs and CBOs to fulfill the roles traditionally filled by government programs in the context of land management. The limited impact of agriculture and environment focused organizations on technology adoption is discouraging - though may be linked to the limited profitability of technology adoption in the short-run.";"Jagger, Pamela

"AGRIS:US201400003452";"Accounting for geographical variation in species–area relationships improves the prediction of plant species richness at the global scale";"";"AIM: The species–area relationship (SAR) is a prominent concept for predicting species richness and biodiversity loss. A key step in defining SARs is to accurately estimate the slope of the relationship, but researchers typically apply only one global (canonical) slope. We hypothesized that this approach is overly simplistic and investigated how geographically varying determinants of SARs affect species richness estimates of vascular plants at the global scale. LOCATION: Global. METHODS: We used global species richness data for vascular plants from 1032 geographical units varying in size and shape. As possible determinants of geographical variation in SARs we chose floristic kingdoms and biomes as biogeographical provinces, and land cover as a surrogate for habitat diversity. Using simultaneous autoregressive models we fitted SARs to each set of determinants, compared their ability to predict the observed data and large‐scale species richness patterns, and determined the extent to which varying SARs differed from the global relationship. RESULTS: Incorporating variation into SARs improved predictions of global species richness patterns. The best model, which accounts for variation due to biomes, explained 46.1% of the species richness variation. Moreover, fitting SARs to biomes produced better results than fitting them to floristic kingdoms, supporting the hypothesis that energy availability complements evolutionary history in generating species richness patterns. Land cover proved to be less important than biomes, explaining only 36.4% of the variation, possibly owing to the high uncertainty in the data set. The incorporation of second‐order interactions of area, land cover and biomes did not improve the predictive ability of the models. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of SARs and improves the applicability of SARs through regionalization. Future models should explicitly consider geographically varying determinants of SARs in order to improve our assessment of the impact of global change scenarios on species richness patterns.";"Gerstner, Katharina

Large increases in numbers of livestock and pastoralist households (11- and 9-fold, respectively) during the past 60 yrs have variously degraded the majority of grasslands in Inner Mongolia (78 M ha) and jeopardize the livelihoods of 24 M human inhabitants. A prevailing strategy for alleviating poverty and grassland degradation emphasizes intensification of livestock production systems to maintain both pastoral livelihoods and large livestock numbers. We consider this strategy unsustainable because maximization of livestock revenue incurs high supplemental feed costs, marginalizes net household income, and promotes larger flock sizes to create a positive feedback loop driving grassland degradation. We offer an alternative strategy that increases both livestock production efficiency and net pastoral income by marketing high quality animal products to an increasing affluent Chinese economy while simultaneously reducing livestock impacts on grasslands. We further caution that this strategy be designed and assessed within a social-ecological framework capable of coordinating market expansion for livestock products, sustainable livestock carrying capacities, modified pastoral perceptions of success, and incentives for ecosystem services to interrupt the positive feedback loop that exists between subsistence pastoralism and grassland degradation in Inner Mongolia.";"Briske, David D.

"AGRIS:US201600130978";"Application of the Anthropogenic Allee Effect Model to Trophy Hunting as a Conservation Tool";"";"Trophy hunting can provide economic incentives to conserve wild species, but it can also involve risk when rare species are hunted. The anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE) is a conceptual model that seeks to explain how rarity may spread the seeds of further endangerment. The AAE model has increasingly been invoked in the context of trophy hunting, increasing concerns that such hunting may undermine rather than enhance conservation efforts. We question the appropriateness of uncritically applying the AAE model to trophy hunting for 4 reasons. First, the AAE assumes an open‐access resource, which is a poor characterization of most trophy‐hunting programs and obscures the potential for state, communal, or private‐property use rights to generate positive incentives for conservation. Second, study results that show the price of hunting increases as the rarity of the animal increases are insufficient to indicate the presence of AAE. Third, AAE ignores the existence of biological and behavioral factors operating in most trophy‐hunting contexts that tend to regulate the effect of hunting. We argue that site‐specific data, rather than aggregated hunting statistics, are required to demonstrate that patterns of unsustainable exploitation can be well explained by an AAE model. Instead, we suggest that conservation managers seeking to investigate and identify constraints that limit the potential conservation role of trophy hunting, should focus on the critical governance characteristics that shape the potential conservation role of trophy hunting, such as corruption, insecure property rights, and inadequate sharing of benefits with local people.

"AGRIS:US201600198713";"Emerging models for voluntary urban ecological stewardship on private property";"";"As global urban populations grow, green spaces in cities are under increasing pressure to provide urban habitat and perform important ecosystem services. While public natural areas are typically called upon to provide key habitat in cities, green spaces on private property make up large parts of the urban land base and provide important roles for habitat and ecosystem services that support city function. However voluntary strategies for encouraging ecological stewardship on private property in cities are not well studied. This paper accesses available literature, case studies, municipal and organizational reports, and first-person interviews to describe four emerging strategies for catalyzing voluntary private property stewardship in cities: (a) indirect incentives; (b) market-based certifications; (c) community-based initiatives; and (d) payments for ecosystem services. Each offers the potential to combine the individual actions of multiple urban landowners in order to optimize the landscape-scale benefits of these actions in a strategic way. Components, methods and drivers are identified for each model and examples are provided to illustrate their application. The challenge of scale in optimizing ecological benefits in cities, and the potential for institutional partnering on multi-parcel, private property stewardship efforts to generate both site-scale and landscape-scale ecological outcomes is discussed. Voluntary, urban ecological stewardship strategies offer a different set of solutions than regulatory models, and open a new land base that would otherwise be inaccessible for improving ecological function as cities change and grow.";"Cerra, Joshua Frank";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"urban population;landowners";"Urban Tenure";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600198713";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.06.016";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500078539";"Why landscape ecologists should contribute to life cycle sustainability approaches";"";"CONTEXT: Understanding the consequences of changes in land use and land cover is among the greatest challenges in sustainability science, yet key themes related to land cover change are often left out of sustainability assessment tools. Because sustainability teaching is expanding at a rapid rate, incorporation of interdisciplinary, rigorous, quantitative tools to distinguish sustainable and unsustainable landscape change are needed. OBJECTIVE: As a heuristic exercise, we contrast and synthesize two approaches to quantifying sustainability using a case study of palm oil and tropical deforestation in Borneo, Indonesia. METHODS: First, we use Markovian land cover change analysis (from 2000 to 2010) to estimate changes in forest cover, project these rates of change into the near future, and estimate changes in carbon stocks due to palm oil conversion. Second, we estimate greenhouse gas emissions from a typical Indonesian palm oil biodiesel plantation using a life cycle assessment approach (LCA). RESULTS: These two approaches show conflicting assessments for the carbon footprint of palm biodiesel: a sustainable endeavor when short-term global warming potential is evaluated yet highly unsustainable when rates of forest loss are measured. Furthermore, accounting for carbon that incorporated prior land cover dramatically altered sustainability assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, integration of these two approaches reveals the importance of including both historic and future land cover changes into sustainability assessments. This synthesis demonstrates the importance of using a plurality of approaches from different disciplines when teaching sustainability, and highlights the unique role that landscape ecological approaches can play in sustainability assessments such as LCA.";"Eddy, Ian M.

"AGRIS:US201400165403";"Differential influence of land use/cover change on topsoil carbon and microbial activity in low-latitude temperate forests";"";"Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the main factors that control the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. We examined the effect of LUCC on topsoil C, microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbes mediated processes related to C circulation and their relationship with other soil properties in low-latitude mountain temperate forests. We selected three sites in the northwest of Cofre de Perote volcano (Mexico) in an altitudinal gradient (piedmont, lower mountain slope and mid slope). At each site we selected three land use/cover units as a chronosequence: (1) reference forest, (2) agriculture, and (3) regeneration/reforestation. At each of the nine land use/cover units we collected five soil samples (0–10cm) for determination of total soil C (CT), MBC, basal soil respiration, metabolic quotient and enzymatic activity (β-glucosidase and dehydrogenase activities, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis). Forest conversion to agriculture diminished the CT concentration in the three sites (72%, 20% and 61% on piedmont and lower and mid slopes, respectively); however, CT content only decreased at piedmont soils. The vulnerability of piedmont soils to C loss due to this LUCC is higher than in mountain slope Andosols. Furthermore, this LUCC differentially affected absolute MBC (i.e. on dry soil base) and specific MBC (i.e. on CT base). Specific site environmental conditions and MBC reference levels seem to determine the sensitivity of MBC to LUCC. Forest recovery after agricultural use only caused an increase of CT concentration (55%) in piedmont soils. There are different controls of soil C storage and circulation in the altitudinal gradient studied. At piedmont and mid mountain slope soils MBC, its activity, nutrient availability and physical soil properties play an important role; meanwhile, at lower mountain slope Andosols mineralogical properties, specifically the Al–humus complexes exerts the main control.";"Gamboa, Ana María

In this research, satellite images of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 1992, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) 2001 and Egypt Sat-1 2009 have been used to study the urban sprawl and its impact on agricultural land in Qalubiya Governorate. Maximum likelihood supervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied for monitoring the urban sprawl in this study area. Ground truth collected during several field trips conducted in 2009 and a topographic map from 1992 were used to assess the accuracy of the classification results. Using ancillary data, visual interpretation and expert knowledge of this area through GIS further refined the classification results. Post-classification change detection technique was used to produce change image through cross-tabulation. Combining the soil and land capability maps, on one hand, and the urban thematic layers, on the other hand, using GIS, made it possible to point out the risk of urban expansion on the expense of the highly capability class. During the (1992–2009) period, the high capable soils (Class I) decreased from 683.2 km² to 618.5 km². The moderate capable soils decreased from 100.5 km² to 93.8 km² whereas the marginally capable soils decreased from 209.1 km² to 198.3 km², during the same period. The urban encroachment over the non-capable soils was very limited during the 1992–2001 period. The pattern of urban sprawl changed during the 2001–2009 period whereas most of the urban expansion was on the expense of the non-capable soils.";"Shalaby, Adel. A.

Data captured through the synergy of an aerial photo, satellite image and ground-based socio-economic survey were analysed by GIS and SPSS. The results showed a decline in shrub-grassland and riverine trees at 21.5 and 16.3 ha per year, respectively, and increase in plantation trees, annual crops and bare/open grasslands at 2.8, 12.5 and 24.8 ha per year, respectively. The results are interpreted in the light of population dynamics, socio-economic condition and policy framework. The findings warrant that land-use and land-cover change in the region is very rapid, and unless the existing management of land resources is up-scaled, land ownership is secured, and family planning is mainstreamed in regional and local development plans, the region's fragile ecological balance would collapse irrecoverably.";"Mengistu, Daniel Ayalew

For a long time, human activities, namely the overuse of land, have been influencing the natural processes on and in soils; therefore, various types of soil degradation can be observed in many parts of the country. The understanding and the consideration of direct and indirect effects of human activities on soils are indispensable for the prediction of the human impact on soil degradation processes. There are many important direct and indirect anthropogenic causes that play an effective role in soil degradation; they have a significant relationship with the natural resource management in Iran. Population dynamics, deforestation, and overgrazing as main causes and salinization, alkalinization, water-logging, soil erosion, and desertification as main effects of human-induced soil degradation are highlighted in this overview. Population in urban areas of Iran strongly increased from 1936 (21% of total population) to 2010 (72% of total population). Nearly 5 million hectares of forest were converted to farmland and urban areas from the 1950s to 2008. The area of Iran's cultivated land was enhanced by more than four times. Livestock population is around three times higher today than the capacity of the rangelands. Regarding this overview the study of land management, soil degradation, and soil conservation in Iran needs an integrative approach. Therefore, a transdisciplinary model to assess environmental, economical and social factors (and thus sustainability), namely in arid and semi-arid areas, is offered too.The most important aim of this overview is the illustration of the principal causes of soil degradation in Iran, highlighting the important subjects for sustainable soil management. The overview also notes that our understanding about human-induced soil degradation in Iran is still at a rudimentary stage; therefore, some research topics need more attention in future.";"Emadodin, Iraj

"AGRIS:US201600126316";"Monitoring forest dynamics with multi-scale and time series imagery";"";"To learn the forest dynamics and evaluate the ecosystem services of forest effectively, a timely acquisition of spatial and quantitative information of forestland is very necessary. Here, a new method was proposed for mapping forest cover changes by combining multi-scale satellite remote-sensing imagery with time series data. Using time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images (MODIS-NDVI) and Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) images as data source, a hierarchy stepwise analysis from coarse scale to fine scale was developed for detecting the forest change area. At the coarse scale, MODIS-NDVI data with 1-km resolution were used to detect the changes in land cover types and a land cover change map was constructed using NDVI values at vegetation growing seasons. At the fine scale, based on the results at the coarse scale, Landsat TM/ETM+ data with 30-m resolution were used to precisely detect the forest change location and forest change trend by analyzing time series forest vegetation indices (IFZ). The method was tested using the data for Hubei Province, China. The MODIS-NDVI data from 2001 to 2012 were used to detect the land cover changes, and the overall accuracy was 94.02 % at the coarse scale. At the fine scale, the available TM/ETM+ images at vegetation growing seasons between 2001 and 2012 were used to locate and verify forest changes in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, and the overall accuracy was 94.53 %. The accuracy of the two layer hierarchical monitoring results indicated that the multi-scale monitoring method is feasible and reliable.";"Huang, Chunbo

We used for that purpose phyto-ecological studies, data about life-form, grazing value and demography and circumstantial data.

"AGRIS:US201500162710";"β-Glucosidase kinetic parameters as indicators of soil quality under conventional and organic cropping systems applying two analytical approaches";"";"Soil enzymes are widely used as indicators of soil quality because they are sensitive to various land management practices. In particular, enzyme kinetic behaviour and the derived kinetic parameters (Vₘₐₓ and Kₘ) can be indirectly influenced by changes of soil structure, organic matter quantity and quality due to the addition of organic amendments to the soil. When measuring enzyme kinetics, the calculation of the specificity constant (Kₐ), i.e.: the ratio Vₘₐₓ to Kₘ, is advisable to obtain additional information on the whole catalytic process. Many assays for a wide range of soil enzymes have been set up and they differ for the substrate used, incubation conditions and detection methods: the most widely used are those based on spectrophotometric and fluorimetric techniques. However, the comparative information between the two assays is poor. Therefore this study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) Can β-glucosidase kinetic parameters be considered reliable indicators in detecting changes due to soil management? (2) Can the specificity constant (Kₐ) be considered an additional kinetic parameter useful as a new ecological indicator? (3) Do different analytical approaches give the same results? Both experimental approaches, fluorimetric and spectrophotometric, were effective in highlighting changes occurred under organic and conventional management indicating higher level of enzyme (Vₘₐₓ) under organic cropping system. However the specificity constant (Kₐ) demonstrated that organic management did not affect the whole catalytic behaviour of β-glucosidase. On the other hand, as regards the two analytical approaches, Kₐ increased significantly using the fluorogenic substrate, 4-MUF-β-d-glucopyranoside, indicating a higher catalytic efficiency of the enzyme with the fluorimetric approach.";"Moscatelli, M.C.

This remote-sensing approach has been used to obtain a land cover map in order to define the main vegetation types and to detect the large canopy gaps (>150 m ²). The structural characteristics have been delineated in a 50-ha study area in which a regular 120-m grid was superimposed over a 1:10,000 raster map and 30 sampling points have been obtained. The forest is characterized by a high volume of living trees (1029.6 m ³ ha ⁻ ¹) and coarse woody debris (420.4 m ³ ha ⁻ ¹) and by small-scale disturbances (individual trees to small groups) with a low incidence of intermediate disturbances (18 forest canopy gaps>150 m ² over 1230 ha). The two approaches have proved useful to delineate the spatio-temporal dynamics.

"AGRIS:US201500205309";"Mosaic surface storages of a small boreal catchment";"";"Recent studies have suggested that the hydrologic connectivity of northern headwater catchments is likely controlled by antecedent moisture conditions and land cover patterns. A water storage model (EWS), based on water levels (WLs), specific yield (Sy) and surface elevation (SE) changes, was compared with a basic water budget of a small, boreal, patterned fen (13 ha) during the ice‐free period. Results showed that the EWS model reproduced well storage variations derived from the water budget. These results suggest that storage variations can be properly represented by the fluctuations of WLs when we consider the heterogeneous soil properties. However, storage deviations occurred at the daily scale and could be explained by a lack of information on water retention in unsaturated layers, canopy interceptions and preferential flows. Despite the significant impact of SE changes on the different peatland cover storage budgets (strings and lawns), using Sy mean values had a low impact on storage estimations. This can be explained by the large proportion of pools and high WLs throughout the fen. At the fen scale, high storage in the pools seemed to reduce the Sy difference between strings and lawns. The results of this study provide new insights about the complex hydrological behaviour of northern catchments and allow for conceiving new hydrological modelling perspectives.

This study explicitly considers farmer behavior with respect to agricultural opportunity in carbon offset provision and ability of adaptation to mitigate the production cost impact under a cap-and-trade climate policy. Based on empirically estimated farmer behavior models, a policy simulation with agricultural census data identifies farmer acreage enrollment in carbon offset provision, carbon offset supplies and revenues, the production cost impacts of carbon prices, and impacts on net farm income and their distributions among heterogeneous farmers. Our analysis find that: 1) farmer ex ante preferences in general are biased against participating in carbon credit programs although farmer involvement increases with carbon prices; 2) with the fertilizer industry exempted from cap-and-trade regulation, the production cost impacts would be small, and more than half of the farms or farmland would probably gain for a carbon price higher than $10 per metric ton of carbon; and 3) the production cost impacts with a capped fertilizer industry would be 2 times higher, and more than half of the farms or farmland would lose unless the carbon price could reach beyond $55 per metric ton of carbon.

"AGRIS:US201500077813";"Modelling habitat suitability for alpine rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta helvetica) combining object-based classification of IKONOS imagery and Habitat Suitability Index modelling";"";"The maintenance and restoration of high-quality habitats of wildlife species in alpine ecosystems are key issues in conservation biology. The rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta helvetica), which prefers open habitats above the treeline, is listed in Annex II of the EU Bird Directive. Large areas identified as potentially important for conservation and restricted financial resources for the implementation of conservation activities necessitate the development of tools supporting habitat monitoring and management. We developed a knowledge-based Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model for rock ptarmigan and combined it with results of an object-based image analysis of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images (IKONOS) to create a rock ptarmigan habitat suitability map in the eastern Alps of Austria. The mechanistic habitat model contained 9 habitat variables, decisive for summer habitat use of rock ptarmigan (i.e., slope, patchiness, and land cover classes for: rocks, rocks intermixed with vegetation, scree, dwarf shrubs, dwarf pine, alpine/subnival grassland, and forest). We used Definiens Professional 5.0© software for the object-based image analyses, applying multi-resolution segmentation methods. We generated a classification hierarchy comprising the same variables used in the HSI model, each augmented by areas “in shadow”, and took into account clouds, water bodies and human infrastructures. We assessed classification accuracies, applying an Error Matrix based on TTA Mask. We reached an overall classification accuracy of 0.75 and a kappa statistic value of 0.70, the latter indicating good to very good agreement. The classification results indicated that the object-oriented image classification approach using VHR data was appropriately used to create an adequate thematic map for further habitat modelling. We calculated the habitat suitability maps using MapModels. Model output was validated with ptarmigan presence–absence data, using signs (droppings) as indicators of presence. We compared presence–absence data and results of habitat suitability classification employing contingency tables and non-parametric correlations. Frequencies of sample plots with rock ptarmigan signs significantly differed between the habitat suitability classes and significantly correlated with the HSI level. Combining the mechanistic HSI model with an object-base image analysis of VHR satellite images was an effective tool for the spatially explicit assessment of habitat suitability and could be useful in regional monitoring, planning and management activities for ptarmigan.";"Zohmann, Margit

"AGRIS:US201301573565";"impact of two arable field margin management schemes on litter decomposition";"";"A primary objective of agri-environment schemes is the conservation of biodiversity; in addition to increasing the value of farmland for wildlife, these schemes also aim to restore natural ecosystem functioning. The management of scheme options can influence their value for delivering ecosystem services by modifying the composition of floral and faunal communities. This study examines the impact of an agri-environment scheme prescription on ecosystem functioning by testing the hypothesis that vegetation management influences decomposition rates in grassy arable field margins. The effects of two vegetation management practices in arable field margins - cutting and soil disturbance (scarification) - on litter decomposition were compared using a litterbag experimental approach in early April 2006. Bags had either small mesh designed to restrict access to soil macrofauna, or large mesh that would allow macrofauna to enter. Bags were positioned on the soil surface or inserted into the soil in cut and scarified margins, retrieved after 44, 103 and 250 days and the amount of litter mass remaining was calculated. Litter loss from the litterbags with large mesh was greater than from the small mesh bags, providing evidence that soil macrofauna accelerate rates of litter decomposition. In the large mesh bags, the proportion of litter remaining in bags above and belowground in the cut plots was similar, while in the scarified plots, there was significantly more litter left in the aboveground bags than in the belowground bags. This loss of balance between decomposition rates above and belowground in scarified margins may have implications for the development and maintenance of grassy arable field margins by influencing nutrient availability for plant communities.";"Smith, Jo

"AGRIS:US201300770473";"Integrating stream bioassessment and landscape ecology as a tool for land use planning";"";"1. Bioassessment has evolved significantly from a method of deciding whether an ecosystem exposed to stressors should 'pass' or 'fail' (or how badly it fails). Society wants some notion of what has caused any observed degradation of ecosystems, and what management strategies might improve degraded ecosystems. Managers also want to predict what negative or positive effects different land use strategies will have on the component ecosystems of a landscape, including lakes and streams. 2. Here we illustrate an approach to providing these tools to managers with data from a bioassessment study of streams in the Fraser River Basin of British Columbia, Canada. 3. Landscape scale descriptors of both the natural (e.g. catchment size, surficial geology) and stressor (e.g. hard rock mines, forest harvest) environment of each site were used to define the natural and stressor environments of each of the 242 stream sites. 4. We classified 206 reference (relatively unexposed to human activity) sites using their benthic macroinvertebrate community composition, and then discriminated among the faunally defined groups with landscape scale descriptors of the natural environment of the sites. 5. This discriminant function model allowed us to predict which group each of the test sites would be in if it were in reference condition, and then measure the relationship between the amount of human activity and the biota in each of these groups. 6. These relationships were turned into projections of what will happen to a stream ecosystem's biota if the stressor environment is either improved or degraded. These projection models form the basis of evidence-based land use planning that takes into account the health of freshwater ecosystems.";"BAILEY, ROBERT C.

"AGRIS:US201400169179";"agent based model to simulate structural and land use changes in agricultural systems of the argentine pampas";"";"The Argentine Pampas, one of the main agricultural areas in the world, recently has undergone significant changes in land use and structural characteristics of agricultural production systems. Concerns about the environmental and societal impacts of the changes motivated development of an agent-based model (ABM) to gain insight on processes underlying recent observed patterns. The model is described following a standard protocol (ODD). Results are discussed for an initial set of simplified simulations performed to understand the processes that generated and magnified the changes in the Pampas. Changes in the structure of agricultural production and land tenure seem to be driven by differences among farmers’ ability to generate sufficient agricultural income to remain in business. In turn, as no off-farm or credit is modeled, economic sustainability is tied to initial resource endowment (area cropped). Farmers operating small areas are economically unviable and must lease out their farms to farmers operating larger areas. This leads to two patterns: (a) a concentration of production (fewer farmers operating larger areas) and, (b) an increase in the area operated by tenants. The simulations showed an increase of soybean area, linked to the higher profitability of this crop. Despite the stylized nature of initial simulations, all emerging patterns are highly consistent with changes observed in the Pampas.";"Bert, Federico E.

We studied the response of a native forest specialist, the Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus), to immediate and ongoing environmental changes facilitated by urbanization. We found evidence of a synergistic effect of native land cover loss followed by increased aggressive interactions with a native generalist, the Bewick’s wren (Thryomanes bewickii), resulting in the decline of Pacific wrens in urbanizing environments. Pacific wren relative abundance decreased dramatically during and after development, while Bewick’s wrens increased and persisted at greater abundance post-relative to pre-development. Breeding territories of the two species overlapped minimally, suggesting spatial segregation either by differential resource use or territorial aggression. A comparison of territory characteristics revealed the species generally used different resources, although territory composition was increasingly similar at urbanizing sites where the species co-occurred. Territorial playback experiments confirmed that the two species interact aggressively. Analyses of body size, body condition and reproductive success did not suggest Bewick’s wrens negatively impact fitness of Pacific wrens at sites where they co-occurred. In established subdivisions (>10years old) Bewick’s wrens appear to limit the abundance of Pacific wrens, however this was not yet the case at sites we studied immediately after development. Although the results of this study are not conclusive, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that new environmental gradients and communities created by urbanization increase competitive interactions among native species.";"Farwell, Laura S.

The subsequent rounds of price surges hit landless poor consumers hard, and transferred billions of dollars from them to landowners worldwide. Economists offered a list of highly plausible explanations for the recent jumps in grain price levels. Key findings included the large harvest shortfalls caused by climate change, energy prices, and fertilizer prices, as well as demand increases due to the large and persistent annual income increases in India and China. Several declared various combinations of the above factors to be a ‘perfect storm’ in grain markets. In fact little more than a quick series of online searches easily reveals that only the last is plausible as a major cause of recent grain price jumps. In particular there was no major global grain production shortfall. On the other hand biofuels mandates, relatively neglected in many studies, introduced a new source of grain demand that tightened markets and drove up prices. The disconnect between economic analysis and easily verified facts is a disturbing feature of recent economic analyses of grain markets.";"Wright, Brian D.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"climate change;landowners";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"";"IND;CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400163589";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12074";"";"";"";"538-553"

All areas were located at MARDI Peat Research Station, Sessang, Sarawak. The CO2 flux was measured using static chamber method connected to a portable CO2 infrared gas analyser. Soil CO2-C flux exhibited diurnal pattern with peak rates as high as 950 mg/m2/h occurred during the mid afternoon (1100-1300). Emission of CO2 was highly correlated with soil temperature (r2 =0.85) and water table (r2 = 0.63). Annual CO2 flux from the peat soil surface varies significantly among land clearing techniques. The highest estimated annual carbon loss as CO2 emission was 48.3 Mt/ha/y under MOP area. Annual emissions of CO2 from LDP are lower and no significant differences between the annual CO2 flux from LOP and NP. Arthropod biodiversity were monitored with light traps in those three areas. Arthropod community was more even in undisturbed peatland ecosystem (NP). It tended to be more variable in the first part of the study, and seemed able to recover as the season progress.

TOC and runoff have been monitored at several sites in the Simojoki watershed (3160� km²) since the early 1960s. Annual TOC fluxes have increased significantly together with increased inter‐annual variability. Acid deposition in the area has been low and has not significantly influenced losses of TOC. Forest management, including ditching and clear felling, had a minor influence on TOC fluxes – seasonal and long‐term patterns in TOC were controlled primarily by changes in soil frost, seasonal precipitation, drought, and runoff. Deeper soil frost led to lower spring TOC concentrations in the river. Summer TOC concentrations were positively correlated with precipitation and soil moisture not temperature. There is some indication that drought conditions led to elevated TOC concentrations and fluxes in subsequent years (1998–2000). A sensitivity analysis of the INCA‐C model results showed the importance of landscape position, land‐use type, and soil temperature as controls of modeled TOC concentrations. Model predictions were not sensitive to forest management. Our results are contradictory to some earlier plot‐scale and small catchment studies that have shown more profound forest management impacts on TOC fluxes. This shows the importance of scale when assessing the mechanisms controlling TOC fluxes and concentrations. The results highlight the value of long‐term multiple data sets to better understand ecosystem response to land management, climate change and extremes in northern ecosystems.";"Lepistö, Ahti

A case study of Rwanda";"";"Sustainable land use planning involves both policy- and farmer-oriented agricultural land use strategies. In this paper, a spatially and temporally explicit multi-scale decision support system that reveals the biophysical indicators affecting land use choices of these different stakeholders, is explained and demonstrated. It comprises three different environmental assessment tools, designed to run with data supplied by traditional soil surveys and organised into a land resources information system. A qualitative land suitability classification procedure is adapted to translate the large-scale biophysical data supplied by a reconnaissance soil survey, into five suitability classes. At local scale, the productivity of the soil units identified during the semi-detailed soil survey is estimated using a three-level hierarchical crop productivity estimator, simulating the potential, water-limited and land production potential. At the smallest spatial and temporal resolution, a daily water balance approach is linked to a crop growth model, using daily climatic data recorded at different meteorological stations and the description, physical and chemical analyses of the soil profiles. The decision support system was applied and validated using the land resources information system of Rwanda. The system was capable to reveal the biophysical properties affecting crop regionalisation at national and local scale. Yield gaps between the potential, water-limited and land production potential, identified options for productivity optimisation such as irrigation or fertilisation. The crop growth model illustrated the delicate equilibrium between sowing date, crop cycle length and the length of the rainy seasons, limiting options for intensification. Combination of a multi-scale nature with scale-specific environmental assessment tools thus proved successful in identifying the different driving forces affecting land use choices made by different stakeholders involved, ranging from agricultural policy makers to individual farmers. This comprehensive approach is essential to realistic and sustainable land use planning.";"Verdoodt, A.

Simulated retrieved soil moisture products are created using three distinct retrieval algorithms based on the characteristics of passive microwave measurements expected from Hydros. The accuracy of retrieval products is evaluated through comparisons with benchmark soil moisture fields obtained from direct aggregation of the original simulated soil moisture fields. The analysis provides a quantitative description of how land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and inversion parameter uncertainty impacts propagate through the measurement and retrieval process to degrade the accuracy of Hydros soil moisture products. Results demonstrate that the discrete set of error sources captured by the OSSE induce root mean squared errors of between 2.0% and 4.5% volumetric in soil moisture retrievals within the basin. Algorithm robustness is also evaluated for the case of artificially enhanced vegetation water content (W) values within the basin. For large W(>3 kg· m-2), a distinct positive bias, attributable to the impact of sub-footprint-scale land cover heterogeneity, is identified in soil moisture retrievals. Prospects for the removal of this bias via a correction strategy for inland water and/or the implementation of an alternative aggregation strategy for surface vegetation and roughness parameters are discussed.";"Crow, Wade T.

Remote sensing techniques applied to Landsat TM imagery were used to evaluate land use/land cover changes while the value transfer method was used to assess the value of ES by land cover category. Five wetland types and other four land covers were found as representative of the coastal landscape. Findings reveal a 14 % decrease in the saltmarsh/forested mangrove area and a 12 % increase in the area of shrimp pond aquaculture (artificial wetland) during the study period. ES valuation shows that the total value flow increased by 9 % from $215 to $233 million (2007 USD) during the 10-year period. This increase is explained as result of the high value worldwide assigned to saltmarsh.

We analyzed parasitism in codling moth diapausing larvae from a total of 122 apple orchards in southeastern France during five consecutive years (2006–2010) in relation to the agronomic and land cover characteristics at both the local and landscape levels. Three species of hymenoptera parasitoids were observed, including two primary (Braconidae and Ichneumonidae) and one hyperparasitoid (Perilampidae) wasps. Parasitoid community compositions differed according to the year (in term of the relative abundance of the primary parasitoid species) and the presence of windbreaks and spontaneous hedgerows around the orchards (in terms of the relative abundance of primary vs. hyperparasitoid species). The parasitism rates were globally low in all orchards each year (<4.5% in average), but they were significantly higher in organic orchards than in conventional orchards as well as in orchards surrounded by a low proportion of conventional orchards in a 250m vicinity. These results are discussed here in terms of biocontrol enhancement and conservation.";"Maalouly, Mariline

"AGRIS:US201400162984";"Managing semi-arid woodlands for carbon storage: Grazing and shrub effects on above- and belowground carbon";"";"Shrub cover has increased in semi-arid regions worldwide. This change has generally been viewed as land degradation, due to shrub-induced declines in pastoral productivity. As a consequence, widespread management treatments to reduce shrub density have been applied in many pastoral areas. These treatments, however, often do not have long-term positive benefits for forage production. Alternative uses for shrub-encroached lands have received little consideration, but a recent move towards economic incentives for carbon (C) storage could lead to financially viable alternative land management strategies. We examined changes in above- and belowground C storage following 20 years of factorial land management treatments (grazing/no grazing and shrub removal/no removal) in an Australian semi-arid woodland. Disturbance by shrub removal (root ploughing) and/or livestock grazing significantly reduced the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC). The most disturbed treatment (grazed and ploughed) contained the least SOC (15.30MgCha⁻¹) while protection from grazing and shrub removal led to the greatest SOC (28.49MgCha⁻¹). Declines in SOC in shrub removal treatments (with and without grazing) were compensated, in part, by enhanced aboveground C accumulation, derived mainly from woody plants. Destocking currently grazed shrublands for two decades resulted in a net C accretion, over 20 years, in the order of 6.5Mgha⁻¹, almost entirely through increasing belowground C. At the current price for C in Australia, the economic benefit for C accumulation from removing livestock grazing would be similar to the economic benefit of grazing. The results suggest that C farming in this semi-arid woodland system may offer an economically viable alternative management strategy to grazing, although uncertainties in future climate, C credit value, and assessment protocols present hurdles for implementing alternative management aimed at C farming.";"Daryanto, Stefani

Sustainability of already fragile ecosystems is threatened. Farmers place a high priority on satisfying subsistence food needs with on-farm production. Population pressure is high throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Farmers in those regions are challenged by the need to put continually more food on their table over the coming years. An optimal control model was developed to investigate alternative farming practices within this setting. Namely, whether farmers would choose continued land expansion of if they would adopt crop intensive practices. The model included an environmental subcomponent to estimate the degradation costs from continued expansion onto marginal areas. The modeling activities from the Sahel of West African reinforce farmers' observed propensity to clear new land in lieu of crop intensification. Model activities suggest an important role for crop intensification under adequate policy conditions as well as the need to introduce new technology before degradation erodes its potential.";"Vitale, Jeffrey D.

Surveys along roads allow for easy and reliable access over time and the ability to survey large geographic areas in a relatively short period of time. However, if the landscape directly adjacent to these roadside transects is not representative of the greater landscape inhabited by the bird species, then estimates of abundance along the route may not be accurate for the greater landscape. Moreover, inferences regarding abundance, distribution, population trend, and habitat use in the greater landscape may not be valid. Using land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), we recently conducted an assessment that revealed a satisfactorily high level of similarity in land cover composition between landscapes immediately adjacent to North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes (Buffer distance of 0.4 km on either side of route) and the larger landscapes (buffer distance of 10 km) in which they are embedded. Thus, local representativeness was high, as was regional representativeness (a comparison of similarity between combined local landscapes and a larger region containing the routes). Motivated by this positive outcome, we now provide a data set of land cover composition in six differentâsized landscapes and land configuration in four differentâsized landscapes surrounding each of 3980 BBS routes. We used a geographic information system (GIS) to produce 30 Ã 30 m raster maps of NLCD 2006 land cover types for each route in each of 30 Bird Conservation Regions. For each BBS route, the data set consists of pixel counts for each of 16 land cover types. These pixel counts are suitable for conversion into proportions for comparison of landscapes of different sizes. Additionally, we provide three measures of landscape configuration for each BBS route. The data set will be useful to researchers analyzing BBS bird data as it represents the first time that a vast majority of BBS routes have been individually linked to a land cover database.";"Small, Michael F.

Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and fine spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the UK, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) and fine-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the UK. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identified unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the fine landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices.";"Razgour, Orly

Land use change, shifting climate, and poor natural regeneration are making it increasingly difficult to establish the species; therefore, artificial regeneration is critical to ensure this timber species maintains its productive role on the landscape. New stocktypes are continually being developed to aid target seedlings for difficult sites, and critical, non-confounding evaluations of them are needed for target seedling development. This research evaluates the effect of container parameters on potential target seedlings. It examines tolerance thresholds of western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) with respect to moisture and temperature status in the rhizosphere during early establishment. A suite of morphological measurements was used to assess seedling quality and relative performance following transplant. Modifying a commercially available container developed four distinct stocktypes of 111, 143, 175 and 207� ml that were paired with a volume-dependent nutrient regime at two culturing densities. Seedling phenotype was affected to a greater extent by container density than by container volume. Despite changes to container volume, root:shoot were found to be similar, indicating benefits of a tailored nutrient regime during nursery culture. Simulated field trials revealed that a low density growing arrangement improved post-transplant seedling growth, specifically root growth. Also, the 207� ml container facilitated greater growth in dry soil conditions compared to smaller containers. Lower (10� °C) rhizosphere temperature hindered root growth; however, seedling survival was 100� %, warranting the testing of earlier outplanting windows for this species. This evaluation of stocktype performance contributes to a greater body of work with this species and its congeners, which will ultimately benefit reforestation and afforestation efforts alike.";"Aghai, Matthew M.

Optical remotely sensed data have often been used to characterize and monitor these ecosystems, which are among the environments most threatened by climate change and anthropogenic activity worldwide. The present study sought to evaluate the spectral response of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images for the interpretation of different wetlands and associated environments at the mouth of the Amazon River, including mangroves, saltmarshes, beaches, and dunes, as well as secondary vegetation, water with different levels of sediment suspension, and human occupation. A Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier was applied to the analysis of Landsat-5 TMsatellite imagery to evaluate the potential for the mapping of these coastal wetland land cover classes. The characterization and comparison of the different spectral classes were obtained through the collection of at least 20 polygonal samples (5� ×� 5 pixels) for each class, with a total of 4,544 points. Spectral separability indices for each pair of classes were based on an Analysis of Variance, with Tukey post-test. The results indicated that most land cover classes could be separated spectrally with Landsat-5 TM. The overall accuracy and Kappa indices for the results of the classification were 86.1 and 0.84� %, respectively. The results of this spectral analysis demonstrated the potential of the SAM classifier for the classification of the different tropical wetlands in a typical Amazon coastal setting from optical remotely sensed data.";"Cardoso, Gustavo F.

We found that each refuge's position confers different opportunities for securing a water supply and entails unique management challenges linked to agricultural water uses. Acquiring contextually-appropriate water rights portfolios was important for protecting these arid region wetlands and was accomplished through various strategies. Once acquired, water is managed to buffer wetlands against fluctuations caused by a dynamic climate and agricultural demands, especially during droughts. Management plans are responsive to needs of neighboring water users and values of the public at large. Such context-specific adaptations will be critical as the West faces climate change and population growth that threaten wetlands and agricultural systems to which they are linked.";"Downard, Rebekah

We estimated frequency curves of the flood discharge during the pre-dam (1976-1996) and post-dam (1997-2006) periods and simulated the flood frequency at sampling points within sites under pre-dam, post-dam and dam-removal (using the pre-dam flood discharge and post-dam cross-sections) scenarios. Changes in channel morphology and land cover were investigated by analyzing aerial photographs. Our results indicate that the 20-year flood at the upper site decreased substantially (from 599 to 271 m³/s) after dam operation, while that of the lower site decreased slightly (from 1025 to 977 m³/s). Within the upper site, the proportion of >20-year return periods increased considerably (from 31.0 to 48.6%) while the proportion of 1- to 20-year return periods decreased (from 30.5 to 8.9%) after dam operation. Flood frequency results for the dam-removal scenario were similar to those for the pre-dam period, suggesting that a return to pre-dam discharge rates would restore the pre-dam distribution of flood frequency at the upper site. Within the lower site, however, the distribution of flood frequency varied little between the pre- and post-dam scenarios, because tributary inflows between the sites mitigated the impacts of dam-regulated flows. Land cover types were associated with flood frequency at both sites. The reduced flood frequency of the upper site resulted in increased area of riparian vegetation and decreased area of active channel.";"Takahashi, Mayumi

A mail survey was distributed to NIPF landowners throughout Mississippi to elicit their preferences concerning the utilization of logging residues from harvesting operations to produce bioenergy. When presented with hypothetical situations that compared the bioenergy utilization harvesting attributes along with those of standard clearcutting in pine plantations, more landowners preferred those associated with the bioenergy utilization scenarios, even when more money was offered for the standard clearcutting option. Older landowners with larger landholdings were less likely to prefer the bioenergy scenarios. Landowners with more formal education who were financially motivated, considered habitat management an important goal, and thought global climate change was an important issue, were more likely to prefer the bioenergy utilization scenario over the standard clearcut. This indicates that a market for logging residues, in the form of wood-based bioenergy, could increase NIPF landowner harvest rates based solely on the different harvesting attributes, and that most woody biomass feedstocks from pine plantations would be available for the production of bioenergy in Mississippi.";"Gruchy, Steven R.

This study analyzed the capabilities of Landsat ETM+ remote sensing data combined with existing ecological land unit classifications to discriminate and quantify patterns of succession at the landscape scale over the 4200 ha University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in northern Lower Michigan. In a hierarchical approach first multi-temporal Landsat ETM+ was used with a landscape ecosystem classification to map upland forest cover types (overall accuracy 91.7%). Next the aspen cover type was subset and successional pathways were mapped within that type (overall accuracy 89.8%). Results demonstrated that Landsat ETM+ may be useful for these purposes; stratification of upland from wetland types using an ecological land unit classification eliminated confounding issues; multi-temporal methods discriminated evergreen conifer versus deciduous understories. The Landsat ETM+ classifications were then used to quantify succession and its relationship to landform-level ecological land units. Forests on moraine and ice contact landforms are succeeding distinctly to northern hardwoods (95% and 88% respectively); those on outwash and other landforms show greater diversity of successional pathways.";"Bergen, Kathleen M.

Landscape planning and management tools are essential to implement best management practices targeted at locations where they are needed most. Although many soil/water-landscape studies have been published in the last 2 decades, progress in developing operational tools for supporting landscape planning to minimize land and water degradation in developing regions is still modest. Some of the existing tools are data demanding and/or complicated to be useful to data scarce regions. Some require detailed understanding of the hydrological and modelling processes and thus less applicable to local stakeholders involved in land use planning and management. A user-friendly LAndscape Planning and MAnagement Tool (LAPMAT) developed to facilitate land management decision-making. LAPMAT is a menu-oriented interactive graphical user interface that can aid decision makers identify hotspot areas of soil erosion and evaluate the effects of alternative land use management practices at a catchment scale. The modelling framework and its interfaces are designed to guide the user through a series of menus that: 1) allow input model parameters, adjusting coefficients, visualizing input parameters and executing the model; 2) enable changing land use and management practices and re-evaluating potential consequences; 3) allow viewing results in tabular, graphical or map form side-by-side; and 4) (re)-evaluating the respective impacts of management/conservation options. The framework has been applied to assess the severity of soil erosion and simulate the impact of different land management practices using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) adjusted for sediment delivery ratio in an example catchment of northern Ethiopia. The results showed average sediment yield rate of 55� t� ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. Conservation measures targeted at high soil loss areas and gullies gave the maximum reduction in sediment yield by about 80� %. Since LAPMAT allows users handle the selection of management/planning options and provide fast and responsive outputs, it can assist in effective multi-stakeholder negotiations over land-use planning where the minimization of land/water degradation is the ultimate goal.";"Tamene, Lulseged

"AGRIS:US201400147834";"Cross-fence comparisons: Theory for spatially comprehensive, controlled variable assessment of treatment effects in managed landscapes";"";"Historically monitoring of grazing impacts in rangelands has been seriously compromised by the small area, infrequency and variability of field-based sampling plots. Remote sensing of vegetation cover, which can be a surrogate for overall ecosystem condition, permits adequate spatial and temporal monitoring of land condition but can still be compromised by considerable inter and intra-paddock (field) variability. Cross-fence sample pairs control for local clines and patchiness in spatial and temporal variables such as vegetation, landform, soil type, surface-flows, and rainfall. We describe the theory behind a novel monitoring methodology that utilizes cross-fence sample pairs to rank paddocks, whether adjacent or not, using a system of linear equations and field based or preferably remotely-sensed data. This methodology outputs a condition ranking for each paddock in the system, with the aforementioned spatial and temporal variables controlled. Within paddock variability, such as differential grazing distribution, can be readily incorporated as weighting factors when suitable models are developed. This methodology may also be applicable to other grazing, agricultural and natural systems and applications where land management units have distinguishable boundaries.";"Kilpatrick, Adam D.

In turn, knowledge of the motivations and intentions of nonindustrial private landowners may be extremely important because such knowledge may be vital in terms of our ability to predict future timber supply and the availability of nontimber amenities. Also, the effectiveness of public policies targeting nonindustrial private forest landowners may depend critically on their motivations and intentions. In this article, we analyzed 8,373 responses to the National Woodland Owner Survey to compare characteristics, motivations, and intentions of multigeneration forest landowners against those of single-generation forest landowners. In brief, we found there were significant differences in their motivations and management behavior; inheritors are more active forest managers and manage for both timber and nontimber forest products more aggressively than noninheritors who typically value esthetics, privacy, protection of biodiversity, and nonhunting recreation.";"Majumdar, Indrajit

"AGRIS:US201600185779";"Herbicide Control Strategies for Ventenata dubia in the Intermountain Pacific Northwest";"";"Ventenata dubia is an exotic annual grass that has become increasingly invasive in various perennial grass systems throughout the Intermountain Pacific Northwest. Currently, little information is available to landowners about herbicide control options. In our first field study, we evaluated V. dubia control efficacy and perennial grass tolerance of herbicides applied pre-emergence (PRE) at two locations and as an early postemergence (EPOST) application at four different conservation reserve grasslands, with each grassland dominated by different perennial grass species. Treatments included flufenacet plus metribuzin (303 + 76 g ai haâ»Â¹ [0.27 + 0.07 lb ai acâ»Â¹]), propoxycarbazone-sodium (49 g ai haâ»Â¹ [0.04 lb ai acâ»Â¹]), rimsulfuron (53 g ai haâ»Â¹ [0.05 lb ai acâ»Â¹]), sulfosulfuron (53 g ai haâ»Â¹ [0.05 lb ai acâ»Â¹]), and imazapic (105 g ai haâ»Â¹ [0.09 lb ai acâ»Â¹]). Rimsulfuron and flufenacet plus metribuzin applied PRE provided >â90% control 10 mo after treatment (MAT). Rimsulfuron and sulfosulfuron applied EPOST provided >â90% control 9 MAT. Herbicide injury to bluebunch and intermediate wheatgrass was negligible across treatments. Imazapic and sulfosulfuron applied EPOST resulted in significant injury to smooth brome and timothy. In our second study, we addressed the following question: Will fall herbicide plus fertilizer treatments improve V. dubia control compared with herbicide treatments alone? We imposed fall herbicide treatments in main plots and fertilizer treatments (fall N, fall P, fall K, fall PK, spring N, NPK) in split plots at three study locations. Herbicide treatments resulted in high levels of V. dubia control. Differences in V. dubia abundance among fertilizer treatments were negligible 9 MAT. Within herbicide control plots, spring N and NPK treatments resulted in significant increases in perennial grass cover and decreases in V. dubia cover (9 MAT). This result indicates that spring N applications timed to the onset of perennial grass growth could be utilized as a component of an integrated management strategy for V. dubia in invaded perennial grass systems.Nomenclature: Flufenacet; imazapic; metribuzin; propoxycarbazone-sodium; rimsulfuron, sulfosulfuron; ventenata, Ventenata dubia (Leers) Coss.

BROIN; timothy, Phleum pratense L. PHLPR.Management Implications: Ventenata dubia is an increasingly problematic invasive annual grass in the Intermountain Pacific Northwest. In the Palouse Bioregion, V. dubia has reduced forage production in hay and pasture, can negatively affect wildlife habitat and soil erosion management goals within Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands, and has invaded canyon grasslands and Palouse Prairie remnants. Currently, little information is available to land managers about how to control V. dubia across the range of perennial grass systems in which it invades. We used two field experiments to identify effective herbicide control options that also limit potential herbicide injury to perennial grass species and promote perennial grass competition. We evaluated flufenacet plus metribuzin (Axiom DF) at 303 + 76 g ai haâ»Â¹, propoxycarbazone-sodium (Canter DG) at 49 g ai haâ»Â¹, rimsulfuron (Matrix DG) at 53 g ai haâ»Â¹, sulfosulfuron (Outrider DG) at 53 g ai haâ»Â¹, and imazapic (Plateau SL) at 105 g ai haâ»Â¹ applied at PRE and EPOST application timings at two study sites and an EPOST application timing at four study sites. Rimsulfuron and flufenacet plus metribuzin provided the most consistent V. dubia control (>â90%) at the PRE timing. Rimsulfuron and sulfosulfuron provided the most consistent control (90%) at the EPOST timing. Sulfosulfuron can be used in grass hay, grazed rangelands and CRP lands, but our study demonstrated the potential for perennial grass injury to smooth brome and timothy. In comparison, rimsulfuron provided greater safety to perennial grasses but is restricted to nongrazed perennial grass systems. Our study also indicates that PRE applications of flufenacet plus metribuzin provide high levels of V. dubia control without injury to timothy, which provides an effective control option for timothy hay producers who have limited labeled control options. In our second field experiment, we evaluated various fertilizer treatments (NPK) with or without a fall herbicide application. Fertilizer treatments did not result in lower ventenata abundance (% cover) within the first growing season when used with herbicide applications. However, in the absence of an herbicide application, spring N only and NPK applications reduced V. dubia abundance because of increases in perennial grass competitiveness. These results suggest that N fertilization timed to the onset of perennial grass growth in the spring can be an important tool for managing V. dubiaâinvaded perennial grass systems.";"Wallace, John M.

"AGRIS:US201600189704";"Evaluation of Ecosystem Services related to Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) for land use decision making across different planning scales";"";"Landscape connectivity is of paramount importance not only in maintaining both functionality and resilience of social-ecological systems, but also in providing Ecosystem Services (ESs). Despite recent efforts, several issues still need to be faced to fully integrate ESs evaluation relating to landscape connectivity into effective plans and environmental assessment procedures. Choosing an appropriate scale of analysis is one of the most problematic topics, since it can profoundly affect the evaluation of single patch contribution to global connectivity. Moreover, the effect of different scales on ESs assessment based on spatial modelling has not yet been investigated.In this paper, an innovative approach to the assessment of Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) and related ESs for Biodiversity conservation, is presented, based on the PANDORA 3.0 landscape evolution model. A new index (dMtot) for the evaluation of each patch's contribution to global BELC is proposed and employed to build a new formulation for the assessment of ESs in monetary terms. A set of Non Urbanized Areas (NUAs) is therefore analyzed in the Metropolitan area of Bari (Southern Italy) across three planning scales commonly adopted in planning practice.The results bring to light the sensitivity of evaluation to the choice of scale, underlining the need to consider a higher level of analysis when local plans are drawn up for land use decision making. A thorough evaluation of this larger extension could therefore require more resources. As a result, modelling approaches that are less data and time consuming would become even more necessary. In this view, the PANDORA 3.0 model could provide a valid and reliable support, since it uses data that are usually available to land managers (e.g. land cover/land use maps, soil maps, Digital Elevation Models). Moreover, it could also be employed to assess land use scenarios at different scales relatively quickly.Limits of the current approaches and research challenges are then discussed. The final goal of the article is to provide an additional tool, which will allow ESs and Landscape Ecology concepts to be integrated not only into assessment procedures (e.g. EIA, SEA) but also into landscape and urban planning practice.";"Pelorosso, R.

In fact, one of the most common applications of remote-sensing images is the extraction of land-cover information for digital image base maps by means of classification techniques. The aim of the study was to compare the potential classification accuracy provided by pan-sharpened orthoimages from both GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 (WV2) VHR satellites over urban environments. The influence on the supervised classification accuracy was evaluated by means of an object-based statistical analysis regarding three main factors: (i) sensor used; (ii) sets of image object (IO) features used for classification considering spectral, geometry, texture, and elevation features; and (iii) size of training samples to feed the classifier (nearest neighbour (NN)). The new spectral bands of WV2 (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared-2) did not improve the benchmark established from GeoEye-1. The best overall accuracy for GeoEye-1 (close to 89%) was attained by using together spectral and elevation features, whereas the highest overall accuracy for WV2 (83%) was achieved by adding textural features to the previous ones. In the case of buildings classification, the normalized digital surface model computed from light detection and ranging data was the most valuable feature, achieving producer's and user's accuracies close to 95% and 91% for GeoEye-1 and VW2, respectively. Last but not least and regarding the size of the training samples, the rule of ‘the larger the better' was true but, based on statistical analysis, the ideal choice would be variable depending on both each satellite and target class. In short, 20 training IOs per class would be enough if the NN classifier was applied on pan-sharpened orthoimages from both GeoEye-1 and WV2.";"Aguilar, M.A.

"AGRIS:US201400149778";"Requirements for labelling forest polygons in an object-based image analysis classification";"";"The ability to spatially quantify changes in the landscape and create land-cover maps is one of the most powerful uses of remote sensing. Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) have also improved classification techniques for developing land-cover maps. However, when using an OBIA technique, collecting ground data to label reference units may not be straightforward, since these segments generally contain a variable number of pixels as well as a variety of pixel values, which may reflect variation in land-cover composition. Accurate classification of reference units can be particularly difficult in forested land-cover types, since these classes can be quite variable on the ground. This study evaluates how many prism sample locations are needed to attain an acceptable level of accuracy within forested reference units in southeastern New Hampshire (NH). Typical forest inventory guidelines suggest at least 10 prism samples per stand, depending on the stand area and stand type. However, because OBIA segments group pixels based on the variance of the pixels, fewer prism samples may be necessary in a segment to properly estimate the stand composition. A bootstrapping statistical technique was used to find the necessary number of prism samples to limit the variance associated with estimating the species composition of a segment. Allowing for the lowest acceptable variance, a maximum of only six prism samples was necessary to label forested reference units. All polygons needed at least two prism samples for classification. †Present address: School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USAPresent address: Math and Science Division, Babson College, Babson Park, MA, USA.";"MacLean, Meghan Graham

This paper evaluates the anthropogenic influence on agricultural soil quality variation in Zhangjiagang County, China from 1980 to 2004 based on indicator selection and standard scoring function (SSF). The results indicated that after 24 years of anthropogenic influence, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and available phosphorus (av-P) increased significantly and total phosphorus (TP) and available potassium (av-K) decreased slightly. Soil pH increased slightly for Cambosols and decreased significantly for Anthrosols. According to analysis of an integrated soil quality index (SQI), both Cambosol and Anthrosol soil quality have improved. For Cambosols, class II and III soil increased by 4.4% and 5.7%, respectively; class IV soil decreased by 10.1%. For Anthrosols, Class II soil increased in area by 74.6%; class III soil decreased to 8.1%. ΔSQI showed the same variation trend for Cambosols and Anthrosols. Among the total selected indicators, SOM was the main driving factor and pH was the limiting factor of soil quality base on path analysis. Current anthropogenic influence on soil quality variation was double-edged, stakeholders must pay close attention to this tendency and closely monitor not only agricultural production yields but also crop safety, long-term soil quality and environmental quality indicators, and timely direct agricultural and economic activities to achieve the best economic performance while protecting natural resources.";"Qi, YB

However, owing to the lack of large-scale GHG data, a quantitative description of the relationships between land-cover changes and GHG concentrations does not exist on a regional scale. The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) launched by Japan on 23 January 2009 can be of use in investigating this issue. In this study, we first calculated the monthly average GHG concentrations in East Asia from April 2009 to October 2011 and found that CO₂ concentration displays a seasonal cycle, but that the CH₄ seasonal trend is unclear. To understand the relationship between land cover and GHG concentrations, we used GHG data from GOSAT, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and land-cover data from EAS-GlobCover (2009) to analyse the correlation coefficients between land cover and GHG concentrations. We observed that vegetation may generally be considered as a source of, but not a sink for, CO₂ and CH₄, either on a yearly scale or during the growing season. With respect to the relationships between land-cover types and GHG concentrations, we conclude that on a yearly scale, land-cover types are not closely correlated with GHG concentrations. During the growing season, croplands and scrublands are negatively correlated with XCO₂ (the ratio of the total number of CO₂ molecules to that of dry air molecules), and forest, grasslands and bare areas are positively correlated with XCO₂. Forest and croplands can be viewed as CH₄ sources, while scrublands and grasslands can be thought of as CH₄ sinks.";"Guo, Meng

The Sahel is a vast region holding a large number of wintering trans-Saharan migratory European birds, and current land-use changes there may represent a threat for these species. We used satellite tracking data from the migratory Montagu’s harrier to evaluate habitat use of the species during the wintering season, and whether the current network of protected areas is effective to provide their habitat needs during that season. We also developed an ecological niche model for the species in Western-Central Sahel to check if the most suitable sites are included within current protected areas. Tracked harriers occupied a large region encompassing a total of eight countries. The most preferred habitats during winter were croplands and some natural vegetation habitats, especially grasslands. Protected areas only covered a small proportion of the overall wintering grounds of tracked harriers and the most suitable areas for the species in Western-Central Sahel. Increasing the extent of preferred natural habitats within protected areas should benefit the conservation of this and probably other insect-eating raptors. However, substantial increases in extent and number of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa are very unlike to occur. Conservation actions in the region should therefore be mostly focused on improving land use planning and management outside protected areas, specially enhancing agricultural practices to make biodiversity conservation compatible with poverty alleviation.

"AGRIS:US201400189812";"Can active restoration of tropical rainforest rescue biodiversity? A case with bird community indicators";"";"There is vigorous debate about the potential for reforestation to offset losses in biodiversity associated with tropical deforestation, but a scarcity of good data. We quantified developmental trajectories following active restoration (replanting) of deforested pasture land to tropical Australian rainforest, using 20 different bird community indicators within chronosequences of multiple sites. Bird species composition in restored sites (1–24years old) was intermediate between that of reference sites in pasture and primary rainforest. Total species richness was much less sensitive to land cover change than composition indicators, because of contrasting species-specific response patterns. For example, open-country (grassland/wetland) bird species declined in richness and abundance with increasing site age, while rainforest-dependent species increased. Results from two different landscapes (uplands and lowlands) were remarkably consistent, despite differing bird assemblages. After 10years, restored sites averaged about half the number of rainforest-dependent bird species typical of rainforest. Mean values at around 20years overlapped with the “poorest” rainforest reference sites, but projections suggest that >150years are required to reach mean rainforest levels, and high variability among sites means that many were not on track towards ever achieving a rainforest-like bird community. Regional rainforest endemics were half as likely to occupy older revegetated sites as non-endemic rainforest-dependent species. Between-site variability and slow colonisation by regional endemics strongly constrain the potential of rainforest restoration to offset the biodiversity impacts of tropical deforestation. The results also mean that ongoing monitoring of biodiversity is an essential part of restoration management.";"Catterall, Carla P.

"AGRIS:US201400182333";"assessment of the effectiveness of a rotation forest ensemble for land-use and land-cover mapping";"";"Increasing the accuracy of thematic maps produced through the process of image classification has been a hot topic in remote sensing. For this aim, various strategies, classifiers, improvements, and their combinations have been suggested in the literature. Ensembles that combine the prediction of individual classifiers with weights based on the estimated prediction accuracies are strategies aiming to improve the classifier performances. One of the recently introduced ensembles is the rotation forest, which is based on the idea of building accurate and diverse classifiers by applying feature extraction to the training sets and then reconstructing new training sets for each classifier. In this study, the effectiveness of the rotation forest was investigated for decision trees in land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping, and its performance was compared with performances of the six most widely used ensemble methods. The results were verified for the effectiveness of the rotation forest ensemble as it produced the highest classification accuracies for the selected satellite data. When the statistical significance of differences in performances was analysed using McNemar's tests based on normal and chi-squared distributions, it was found that the rotation forest method outperformed the bagging, Diverse Ensemble Creation by Oppositional Relabelling of Artificial Training Examples (DECORATE), and random subspace methods, whereas the performance differences with the other ensembles were statistically insignificant.";"Kavzoglu, Taskin

An Irish National Farm Survey is used to produce individual farm-level WTP estimates for the year 2006. These figures are then aggregated to obtain a total value figure for the farming community of corncrake conservation in Ireland. We focus on the willingness to pay of farmers rather than the WTP of the general Irish population, as farmers will ultimately be the ones that will have to take responsibility if targets set out in the All Ireland Action Plan for corncrake conservation are to be achieved. Quantifying willingness to pay on the part of farmers can help inform the design of agri-environment schemes aimed at improving conservation of many bird species on farmland. Results indicate that the non-market benefit of corncrake conservation in Ireland may significantly outweigh the costs of existing conservation schemes.";"Hynes, Stephen

However, for this potential to be realized, many institutional details and technical challenges must be addressed. In this review, we discuss six critical issues for creating effective PES markets: using the appropriate type of market institution, defining suitable spatial and temporal scales for the market, promoting additionality (avoiding payments for services that would have been provided even in the absence of payments) so that payments result in increased services, offering incentives for projects that generate multiple ecosystem services, considering practiceâbased versus performanceâbased payments, and eliminating opportunities for strategic behavior aimed at âgaming the systemâ.

They also continue to struggle for recognition and preservation of cultural identities, lifestyles, and livelihoods--a struggle contingent on control and protection of traditional lands and associated natural resources (hereafter, self-determination). Indigenous lands and the biodiversity they support are increasingly threatened because of human population growth and per capita consumption. Application of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to tribal lands in the United States provides a rich example of the articulation between biodiversity conservation and indigenous peoples' struggle for self-determination. We found a paradoxical relationship whereby tribal governments are simultaneously and contradictorily sovereign nations; yet their communities depend on the U.S. government for protection through the federal-trust doctrine. The unique legal status of tribal lands, their importance for conserving federally protected species, and federal environmental regulations' failure to define applicability to tribal lands creates conflict between tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and constitutional authority. We reviewed Secretarial Order 3206, the U.S. policy on ""American Indian tribal rights, federal-tribal trust responsibilities, and the ESA,"" and evaluated how it influences ESA implementation on tribal lands. We found improved biodiversity conservation and tribal self-determination requires revision of the fiduciary relationship between the federal government and the tribes to establish clear, legal definitions regarding land rights, applicability of environmental laws, and financial responsibilities. Such actions will allow provision of adequate funding and training to tribal leaders and resource managers, government agency personnel responsible for biodiversity conservation and land management, and environmental policy makers. Increased capacity, cooperation, and knowledge transfer among tribes and conservationists will improve biodiversity conservation and indigenous self-determination.";"SCHMIDT, PAIGE M.

The study explores whether the willingness of landowners with large-sized landholdings (i.e., minimum 20 ha) is influenced by characteristics that describe the private lands and the owners of these private lands. The results show that trends towards land parcelization, afforestation and loss of agricultural lands may impact the availability of lands for forest harvesting and hunting.

In this context, a distinction has emerged between mere citizen involvement in planning initiated by public agencies to grassroots and bottom-up planning that originates from within neighborhoods and citizen groups and whose decisions are adopted by public agencies.Through a case study based in Madison, Wisconsin, this paper identifies an institutional alternative that addresses some of the tensions related to community participation in planning and the problems associated with collaboration: a resident-nonprofit collaborative within a larger urban context facilitative of neighborhood planning. The paper provides a brief overview of the process, identifies lessons from this process for community participation and grassroots planning, and places this experience in the larger debates on participation.

Determination of appropriate threshold levels for change/no-change identification is a critical factor that influences change detection result accuracy. The most used method to determine the threshold values is based on the standard deviation (SD) from the mean, assuming the amount of change (due to increase or decrease in brightness values) to be symmetrically distributed on a standard normal curve, which is not always true. Considering the asymmetrical nature of distribution histogram for the two sides, this study proposes a relatively simple and easy ‘Independent Two-Step’ thresholding approach for optimal threshold value determination for spectrally increased and decreased part using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) difference image. Six NDVI differencing images from 2007 to 2009 of different seasons were tested for inter-annual or seasonal land cover change/no-change identification. The relative performances of the proposed and two other methods towards the sensitivity of distributions were tested and an improvement of ∼3% in overall accuracy and of ∼0.04 in Kappa was attained with the Proposed Method.

"AGRIS:US2012202402";"AN ANALYSIS OF LAND DISTRIBUTION AND CONCENTRATION IN BOLIVIA";"";"Despite the implementation of Bolivia's land reform in 1953, the agrarian structure continues to have an extreme concentration of land.  Furthermore, in the last two decades regional agrarian structure have been aggravated by population pressures and a lack of new technological
practices for most small scale farmers and peasants. Public and private institutions and urban residents observe hundreds of landless and near-landless families in the cities searching for jobs. Most end up becoming part of the growing unemployed labor force in the urban sector.

The lack of industrialization policies to create job opportunities for the rural population and the explosive population growth in some rural area has contributed to the increasing levels of poverty among Bolivia's peasantry. Since a considerable proportion of the population increase must be absorbed by the agricultural sector, this has had a disadvantageous effect on those who are dependent on agriculture. Meanwhile, biased distribution of land has contributed to a reduction in the size of the land holding of most peasants in the subsistence or traditional sector. Many land holding are becoming smaller, sometimes leading to small scattered strips, while in other areas there is a gradual depletion of soil fertility due to exhaustive methods of production. It is believed that the demographic pressure is increasing so much that farming methods employed are causing environmental deterioration, such as soil exhaustation and erosion, with all the attendant effects on production. This land fragmentation has led to significant decreases in income of most family production units.

At the same time, tenure conditions are becoming less favorable for small farmers and peasants, since landowners are placed in a stronger position relative to the peasants. Furthermore, agricultural land prices in the lowlands and new frontiers have been increasing, which makes land
more attractive for capitalists to buy as investments. With the difficult access to land, the high population growth rates in some areas, and the extreme concentration of land, Bolivian peasants are unable to make a living on their own and are forced to find employment as farm or urban
laborers. As a result, wages have stagnated or even fallen through the years, while unemployment has risen dramatically.

While Bolivia has experiences a radical and highly publicized land reform, in the last four decades old inequalities and insecurities are reappearing. The family smallholding system with private ownership has led to intense subdivision and fragmentation of land in the highlands and valleys. Furthermore, yields of most cash crops are low in comparison to other Latin American countries. Research and extension have been practically nonexistent throughout the last two decades. Credit has been highly subsidized and concentrated among large scale enterprises. Substitution of illegal crops (coca leaves) has been increasing due to the lack of labor opportunities and agricultural incentives.  Peasants are being pushed off their land in some prominent agricultural areas by large scale farmers, irrespective of the land markets and agrarian laws.

Under these conditions, poverty among Bolivia's peasantry continues due to the lack of coordinated development strategies in the agricultural sector. Two of the leading causes of this rural poverty is the lack of access to sufficient land for the peasantry and land distribution patterns that have arisen in the last two decades. Therefore, studies of land concentration, which has a direct relationship with the distribution of wealth in the rural economy, must be a priority in order to develop the sector.";"Valdivia, Fernando Crespo";"";"";"AGRIS";"1991-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"BOL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012202402";"http://purl.umn.edu/11003";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201600080018";"rise of flex crops and commodities: implications for research";"";"As a concept and phenomenon, ‘flex crops and commodities’ feature ‘multiple-ness’ and ‘flexible-ness’ as two distinct but intertwined dimensions. These key crops and commodities are shaped by the changing global context that is itself remoulded by the convergence of multiple crises and various responses. The greater multiple-ness of crops and commodity uses has altered the patterns of their production, circulation and consumption, as novel dimensions of their political economy. These new patterns change the power relations between landholders, agricultural labourers, crop exporters, processors and traders; in particular, they intensify market competition among producers and incentivize changes in land-tenure arrangements. Crop and commodity flexing have three main types – namely, real flexing, anticipated/speculative flexing and imagined flexing; these have many intersections and interactions. Their political-economic dynamics involve numerous factors that variously incentivize, facilitate or hinder the ‘multiple-ness' and/or ‘flexible-ness' of particular crops and commodities. These dynamics include ‘flex narratives' by corporate and state institutions to justify promotion of a flex agenda through support policies. In particular, a bioeconomy narrative envisages a future ‘value web’ developing more flexible value chains through more interdependent, interchangeable products and uses. A future research agenda should investigate questions about material bases, real-life changes, flex narratives and political mobilization.";"Borras, Saturnino M.

We allow property rights to improve as the country transforms natural resources into capital. The ensuing power struggle about the control of resources is solved as a non-cooperative differential game. Prices of resources and depletion increase faster than suggested by the Hotelling rule, especially with many competing factions and less secure property rights. As a result, the country substitutes away from resources to capital too rapidly and invests more than predicted by the Hartwick rule. The theory suggests that power struggle boosts output but depresses aggregate consumption and welfare, especially in highly fractionalized countries with less secure property rights. Also, adjusted net saving estimates calculated by the World Bank using market prices over-estimate welfare-based measures of genuine saving. Since our theory suggests that genuine saving is zero while empirically they are negative in resource-rich, fractionalized countries, we suggest ways of resolving this puzzle.";"van der Ploeg, Frederick";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301920183";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-010-9400-7";"";"";"";"105-128"

The question arises whether and at which speed this browning will continue under future climate change. To answer the question we predicted the absorbance (a₄₂₀) in 6347 lakes and streams of the boreal region under future climate change. For the prediction we modified a numerical model for a₄₂₀ spatial variation which we tested on a temporal scale by simulating a₄₂₀ inter-annual variation in 48 out of the 6347 Swedish waters. We observed that inter-annual a₄₂₀ variation is strongly driven by precipitation that controls the water flushing through the landscape. Using the predicted worst case climate scenario for Sweden until 2030, i.e., a 32 % precipitation increase, and assuming a 10 % increase in imports of colored substances into headwaters but no change in land-cover, we predict that a₄₂₀ in the 6347 lakes and streams will, in the worst case, increase by factors between 1.1 and 7.6 with a median of 1.3. This increase implies that a₄₂₀ will rise from the present 0.1–86 m⁻¹ (median: 7.3 m⁻¹) in the 6347 waters to 0.1–154 m⁻¹ (median: 10.1 m⁻¹), which can cause problems for the preparation of drinking water in a variety of waters. Our model approach clearly demonstrates that a homogenous precipitation increase results in very heterogeneous a₄₂₀ changes, where lakes with a long-term mean landscape water retention time between 1 and 3 years are particularly vulnerable to climate change induced browning. Since these lake types are quite often used as drinking water resources, preparedness is needed for such waters.";"Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.

The paucity of high resolution palaeoenvironmental records long hampered a detailed understanding of the human impact on erosion rates. This paper analyses Holocene sediment dynamics in the context of regional climatic conditions, land cover and human occupation based on an extended compilation of recently published high-resolution paleoenvironmental proxy data from both terrestrial and marine environments. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction identified four main aridification episodes (A) at 5600–4700 (A4), 4100–3400 (A3), 2800–2500 (A2), and 1900–1300/1200 (A1) cal. BP. Most of the severe aridification phases were climatically induced, not human-driven and well correlated with a large dataset of paleoenvironmental records from the Western Mediterranean Basin and North Atlantic Ocean. The phases of enhanced aridity are generally associated with enhanced sediment dynamics, independent of the intensity and type of human occupation. In contrast, wet climatic conditions are found to be associated with both high and low sediment dynamics dependent on the human impact on the environment. The mid-late Phoenician, Phoenician II/Republican Rome civilizations and the Christian Reconquest are all associated with high human impact on the environment, and high erosion rates are reported for the Vera basin and NE Spain despite the improved hydrological conditions. Human occupation is not necessarily associated with geomorphic instability, as shown by the Post Argaric, Omeya and Nazarene periods that are characterized by low erosion rates and geomorphic stability.";"Bellin, Nicolas

The Kyoto Protocol was ratified by the Government of India in August 2002 and one of India's objectives in acceding to the Protocol was to fulfil the prerequisites for implementation of projects under the CDM in accordance with national sustainable priorities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of using large-scale forestry projects under the CDM in achieving its twin goals using Karnataka State as a case study. The Generalized Comprehensive Mitigation Assessment Process (GCOMAP) Model is used to observe the effect of varying carbon prices on the land available for A/R projects. The model is coupled with outputs from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) Dynamic Global Vegetation Model to incorporate the impacts of temperature rise due to climate change under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2, A1B and B1. With rising temperatures and CO2, vegetation productivity is increased under A2 and A1B scenarios and reduced under B1. Results indicate that higher carbon price paths produce higher gains in carbon credits and accelerate the rate at which available land hits maximum capacity thus acting as either an incentive or disincentive for landowners to commit their lands to forestry mitigation projects.";"Khatun, Kaysara

"AGRIS:US201301828205";"evolution of the timber sector in lowland Bolivia: Examining the influence of three disparate policy approaches";"";"This paper assesses the influence of forest policies on forestry development, and especially timber production, in Bolivia during three different periods of time. The first period began in the early 1970s when a conservative forest policy was adopted privileging commercial logging companies, and thus fueling land conflicts in particular with indigenous people, allowing a minority to accumulate considerable wealth, and marking the onset of forest degradation. From the mid-1990s, innovative policies were implemented to promote sustainable forest management, enhance the collection of forest royalties, improve the sector access to international timber markets, and include a wide range of social actors in the forest sector. While the adopted policy led to initial improvements in forest management practices, it failed to tackle inherent institutional weaknesses and increase the economic benefits from forest use to local forest users, which stimulated informal logging expansion. A third period emerged when the Morales administration came to office in 2006, questioning the underlying principles of the previous policy reform, and adopting a discourse in favor of a more equitable income distribution. Main answers to promote better income distribution are found in the distribution of public lands, but with a lack of actions to leveling the playing field among different forest users. Ironically, these policies could strengthen the bargaining position of timber companies, and foster short-term decision making in forest use, and thus illegal logging in a context of weak state control and persistence of elite capture.";"Pacheco, Pablo

"AGRIS:LV2016000840";"Stability evaluation of the number of farmers farms and declared agricultural land in Lithuania";"";"The beginning of the restitutional land reallocation reform in 1991 brought a rapid change in agricultural land utilisation and user groups resulting in the decrease of state land users’ categories and the growth of private agricultural land areas used by farmers and other natural and legal entities. The aim of the article is to analyse the stability of farmers farms and their agricultural areas in Lithuania during the period between 2009 and 2014. The research estimates the stability of the number of farms and the utilised agricultural area in separate Lithuanian administrative units, i.e. municipalities. The survey results revealed that the most stable farmers' land holdings group was farms that utilised more than 10 ha of agricultural land. The number of farms stability coefficient in Lithuania is 1.08 on average. The complex index of the stability of the utilised agricultural area in Lithuania is 1.13 on average. The value of index is the lowest only in 8 of the 51 municipalities in Lithuania, i.e. from 1.00 to 1.09. This means that the farm land use in those districts is the most stable since the municipality has no possibilities to increase it significantly by ploughing up or otherwise using the abandoned and fallow land.";"Atkoceviciene, V., Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ., Akademija, Kaunas distr.

The main aim of the study was to identify the most desirable attributes of agricultural property and to verify whether those features affect the prices of traded farmland. The survey was conducted in the region of Warmia and Mazury. A statistical analysis (a multiple regression model of real estate prices was based on the conducted transactions) revealed that the market price of farmland is affected by factors: the location of land relative to rural settlements, soil quality, land fragmentation, forest cover and location of farms in less favoured areas with natural handicaps for agricultural production. Location was the most robust predictor of agricultural property prices - about 1565.48 PLN/ha. Farmland situated far from rural settlements is associated with higher production costs and lower income. Soil quality was also an important determinant of property prices - about 574.88 PLN/ha. Land fragmentation and forest cover have a negative impact on property prices. Every additional land plot traded in a single notarial transaction reduced the price of 1 ha by PLN 60.88. A 10% increase in forest cover decreases the value/price of 1 ha of farmland by PLN 48.71. The price of agricultural property situated in less-favoured areas with natural handicaps (LFAs) was higher by PLN/ha 363.46 (EUR 1 = 4 PLN). The last attribute results from Poland's membership in the European Union and participation in the Common Agricultural Policy. The support scheme increased the prices of agricultural property. Results are largely consistent with the findings of international studies.

The region is endowed with many fragile and fragmented ecosystems, and land use and land cover changes have accelerated destructive processes with irreversible effects on ecosystems. The paper aims to (1) find proximate and underlying causes of land use and land cover changes; (2) analyse the drivers of change; and (3) reflect on the role of governance and policy. We used land use maps for the years 1968 and 2007 to highlight the extent and type of land use changes, and household surveys and expert interviews were conducted to collect quantitative and qualitative data for detecting and analysing the drivers of change. Results of household surveys and expert interviews show that technological and environmental factors, accessibility and proximity to local markets, immense use of firewood, conflicting property rights and other institutional weaknesses, and over-grazing of alpine pastures were the main driving forces for agriculture expansion and deforestation. Given the present governance structure of forest management in Pakistan a multi-sectoral and multi-scale framework is required to conserve the Swat's natural landscape and associated ecosystem services. A carefully crafted reform programme is required to clarify and assign unambiguous property rights, provisions for communal management and market-based incentives, depending on the social, economic, and ecological characteristics of the different zones under consideration. Only with such policies in place can the current rapid rate of deforestation be avoided and sustainable natural resources use be ensured.";"Qasim, Muhammad

We examined patterns of native and exotic plant species richness in temperate forests that have been undergoing reforestation since the turn of the twentieth century to test the influence of disturbance arising from land-use history on this relationship. Overall, we found no relationship between native and exotic plant species richness. Instead, we found a positive relationship between native and exotic richness in older but not younger-growth forests, suggesting that the same processes that drove exotic plant richness in older forests also facilitated native plants. In contrast, younger forests had similar numbers of native species relative to older forests, but 41% more exotic species and 24% more compacted soils. Moreover, exotic but not native species richness was positively correlated with increasing soil compaction across all sites. Overall, our results suggest that elevated exotic plant invasions in younger forests are a legacy of soil disturbance arising from agricultural practices at the turn of the century, and that native and exotic plants may respond differentially to disparate environmental drivers.";"Parker, John D.

We investigated the efficiency of MODIS fire products to account for the variability of fire regimes in relation to changes in land cover and savanna vegetation. The specificity and complementarities of both MODIS active fire (MOD14A2 and MYD14A2) and burnt area (MCD45A1) products were assessed in order to characterize fire regimes and to relate them with land cover. In addition the distribution of plant species among landscape units characterised by specific fire regimes was assessed. The calculation of the mutual information made it possible to set apart species more frequent in landscapes little or not at all subject to fire and species more frequent in burnt areas. The first group is the expression of the nature of the unburnt land-cover units, made up mainly of the agricultural areas dominated by fields and fallows. It consists of more potential threats (weeds, encroachers, invasive species etc.) than the second group, which is more typical of sudanian savannas, where fire provides the long-term stability needed to preserve the ecosystem.";"Devineau, Jean-Louis

Savannas belong to the biomes where land cover mapping with remote sensing faces the most difficulties and several studies already addressed the challenging definition of savanna land cover classes. With the aim to standardize ongoing mapping activities, the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) was initiated in 1993. The classification scheme has been repeatedly utilized for global approaches with coarse resolution remote sensing data, while local or regional applications are still limited in number. This study systematically explored the potential of Terra-ASTER data for LCCS classification in Burkina Faso using 502 field sites. Due to the small-scale landscape heterogeneity, pixel-based classifiers were applied and training data were clustered according to their spectral signatures. Overall classification accuracy decreased from 95.6% over 88.4% to 78.5% when considering the LCCS dichotomous-phase classifiers presence of vegetation, edaphic conditions, and artificiality of cover, respectively. For 16 classes, an overall accuracy of 61.4% was achieved. Altogether, this study is a step towards the systematic combination of standardized LCCS legends with continuously available remote sensing data – one of the core challenges for land cover mapping in the future.";"Cord, Anna

It is necessary for rational behaviour. Factors that are likely to influence valuations, the difficulties of getting agreements about valuations and the limited perspective of economics as a basis for valuation are discussed generally in this article. Attributes of Otago Peninsula that seem to be valuable and worth conserving are listed and discussed, taking into account possible conflicts in getting maximum value from these attributes. Particular attention is given to the economic value of conserving wildlife species on the Otago Peninsula. As a result of the presence of these species and their use for tourism, expenditure of over $100 million NZ is generated annually in the Dunedin regional economy (directly or indirectly) and that 800-1000 full-time equivalent jobs are created. The economic opportunity cost of this wildlife conservation on the Peninsula is low and that the economic benefits from this conservation are well in excess of the costs involved. When non-use economic values and the social values associated with Otago Peninsula are taken into account, this further adds to the value of conserving this wildlife. While there has been remarkable expansion in wildlife tourism on the Otago Peninsula and its economic impact in the Dunedin region in the last two decades, (especially in the viewing of Yellow-eyed Penguins), difficulties and constraints are emerging that are likely to hamper its future expansion. However, wildlife tourism on the Otago Peninsula will still have a huge economic impact on Dunedin’s regional economy in the future. Consequently, even if assessed solely in terms of their economic value, the wildlife attractions of the Otago Peninsula are well worth conserving. Furthermore, the value of conserving biodiversity on the Peninsula exceeds its touristic and its economic value. Some conservation organizations (such as the Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust), even though not directly involved in tourism, add to its economic value as well as to its social value and promote the highly desired goal of conserving biodiversity.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-06-31";"en";"";"";"";"NZL";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016208886";"http://purl.umn.edu/55108";"";"";"";""

First, a hierarchy of seven image segmentations of different scales was created for an urban scene, and preliminary classifications were performed for each of the segmentations using a classification algorithm that provides the probability that a segment belongs to a land-cover class in addition to the class assignment. A higher probability for the assigned class indicates that a segment is more likely to have been classified correctly. The class assignment and probability for image segments in each of the six coarser segmentations were added to the segments that they contained in the finest scale segmentation to allow for a comparison across all of the scales. For the final classification, the finest scale segments were assigned to the class that gave the highest probability in any of the segmentations.

Building on this, the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) rainfall-runoff model and the Integrated Catchment Model of Nitrogen (INCA-N) are applied to simulate the observed flow and N dynamics. This is done to help us to understand which factors and processes control the flow and N dynamics in different climate zones and to assess the relative inputs from diffuse and point sources across the catchment. This is the first application of the linked HBV and INCA-N models to a major European river system commensurate with the largest basins to be managed under the Water Framework Directive. The simulations suggest that in the lowlands, seasonal patterns in the stream water NO3-N concentrations emerge and are dominated by diffuse agricultural inputs, with an estimated 75% of the river load in the lowlands derived from arable farming. The results confirm earlier European catchment studies. Namely, current semi-distributed catchment-scale dynamic models, which integrate variations in land cover, climate, and a simple representation of the terrestrial and in-stream N cycle, are able to simulate seasonal NO3-N patterns at large spatial (>300 km2) and temporal (>or= monthly) scales using available national datasets.";"Tisseuil, Clement

Assessing their accuracy would be greatly facilitated by a global validation database of reference sites that allows for comparative assessments of uncertainty for multiple land-cover data sets. We propose a stratified random sampling design for collecting reference data. Because the global validation database is intended to be applicable to a variety of land-cover products, the stratification should be implemented independently of any specific map to facilitate general utility of the data. The stratification implemented is based on the Köppen climate/vegetation classification and population density. A map of the Köppen classification was manually edited and intersected by two layers of population density and a land water mask. A total of 21 strata were defined and an initial global sample of 500 reference sites was selected, with each site being a 5 × 5 km block. The decision of how to allocate the sample size to strata was informed by examining the distribution of the sample area of land cover for two global products resulting from different sample size allocations to the 21 strata. The initial global sample of 500 sites selected from the Köppen-based stratification indicates that these strata can be used effectively to distribute sample sites among rarer land-cover classes of the two global maps examined, although the strata were not constructed using these maps. This is the first article of two, with the second paper presenting details of how the sampling design can be readily augmented to increase the sample size in targeted strata for the purpose of increasing the sample sizes for rare classes of a particular map being evaluated.";"Olofsson, Pontus

This is done through the lens of two plant species endemic to southern Africa: Hoodia gordonii , succulent plants developed as appetite suppressants based on traditional knowledge of the indigenous San peoples, and Pelargonium sidoides , a widely used global phytomedicine harvested by rural communities in the region. Southern Africa is a hub for biodiversity commercialisation, and trade in these two plant species has been caught up in the turbulent world of access and benefit sharing, intellectual property rights, traditional knowledge, uncertain land tenure, unclear regulatory regimes, overlapping governance regimes, and tension between producers, the private sector, NGOs, and traditional authorities and democratically elected government structures. Investigating the evolving dynamics of these actors, the consequences of their interactions and changes in their involvement over time provides insight into the complexities of governance in these value chains, exposing the pressure and friction which can result when global ideals such as equity and sustainability envisioned by the Convention on Biological Diversity encounter local realities. Decision-makers need to provide tailored solutions that are better informed, that reflect the voice and diversity of different actors and that are rooted by realities on the ground.";"Wynberg, Rachel

In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Pearson correlation analysis were used to determine whether there were relationship between land use types and stream water quality at the sub-basin scale in the Wei River basin, China, during the dry and rainy seasons in 2012. Temporal variation of these relations was observed, indicating that the relationships between water quality variables and different land uses were weaker in rainy seasons than that in dry seasons. Compared with other land uses, agriculture and urban lands had a stronger relationship with water quality variables in both rainy and dry seasons. Topographic characteristics of land use were employed to further analyze these relationships. The results showed that seasonal variation also occurred in the complex relationship, and land uses in steeper slopes generally had a stronger influence on stream water quality than those in flatter ones. For the riparian zone of each sampling site, the slope coefficients were weaker than those at the sub-basin scale. Land use type near stream water was generally a better indicator for the effectiveness of water quality. These results suggest that the slope and proximity should be taken into account for better land use management.";"Yu, Songyan

"AGRIS:US201500160925";"role of tree domestication in green market product value chain development";"";"Internationally, there is interest in increasing the trade in ‘green’ market products, such as organic, fair trade, reduction of deforestation and forest degradation/reduction of deforestation and forest degradation+ for reduced deforestation and mitigation of climate change, and environmental goods and services. This crucially needs to be extended to the many poor, hungry and marginalized smallholder farmers in developing countries. In this context, agroforestry tree domestication has made great progress over the last 20 years, especially in Africa with the emergence of many new tree crops for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries across many agro-ecological zones. Tree domestication is important for the enhancement of economic returns as value chains from local to global become more sophisticated and demand higher quality, greater uniformity and a regular and continuous supply. Local farmers are now developing cultivars creating direct benefits from the marketing of food and non-food products in local and regional markets. This creates business and employment opportunities in local cottage industries. Likewise, through the indirect environmental and ecological services provided by trees, food security can be greatly enhanced by closing the yield gap (the difference between the potential and actual yield) of modern crop varieties. In this way, agroforestry is adding income generation to agroecological approaches which together reverse the cycle of land degradation and social deprivation and transforming the lives of poor farmers. However, these benefits do not come without some risks from the loss of genetic diversity, local rights over genetic resources and exploitation by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. Agroforestry developments are therefore focusing on better access to ‘green’ business opportunities for poor smallholder farmers in Africa by maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks.";"Leakey, Roger

This paper provides a summary of the main outputs with a focus on the role of EO technologies in supporting the implementation of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The summary contains a qualitative analysis of the state of the art and considers possible directions and priorities for future research, development and application of EO-based technologies in wetland management. In this context we: 1) highlight those applications where EO technologies are ready for wider uptake by wetland managers, and provide suggestions for supporting such uptake; 2) indicate where EO technologies and applications currently in the research and development stages could potentially be useful in wetland management; and 3) provide recommendations for new research and development of EO technologies, that can be utilized to address aspects of wetland management not covered by the range of current EO applications.";"MacKay, H.

"AGRIS:FR2016227185";"Potential impact of the EU 2003 CAP reform on land idling decisions of French landowners: results from a survey of intentions";"";"The 2003 reform of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced Single Farm Payments (SFPs) which are decoupled payments conditional on cross-compliance, and allows these payments to be claimed for land kept fully idle but maintained in good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC). This paper focuses on the potential impact of the reform on land idling decisions in France with the help of a survey of the intentions of landowners. Both operator and non-operator landowners were considered since, although SFP entitlements are owned only by operator landowners in France, non-operator landowners may now have a higher incentive to switch to operating land by idling land and maintaining it under GAEC in order to claim SFPs. The key variables in landowners’ decisions to idle land in GAEC appear to be both monetary and non-monetary. Despite the likely difference in conversion and cross-compliance costs, operators and non-operators were shown to be equally uninterested in GAEC, suggesting that no dramatic changes in terms of idling land should occur in France as a result of the 2003 reform.";"Bougherara, Douadia

"AGRIS:US201301804232";"Managing Sources and Sinks of Greenhouse Gases in Australia's Rangelands and Tropical Savannas";"";"Rangelands and savannas occupy 70% of the Australian continent and are mainly used for commercial grazing of sheep and cattle. In the center and north, where there are extensive areas of indigenous land ownership and pastoral production is less intensive, savanna burning is frequent. Greenhouse gas emissions from rangelands have been overwhelmingly from land clearing and methane production by livestock. Reductions in the rate of land clearing have substantially reduced Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, but these have been controversial with the reduced potential pasture production being of concern to many land managers. Reductions in direct livestock emissions are possible through manipulation of the genetics, rumen flora, or diet of animals. However, the greatest potential benefit is a whole-property approach with improved animal husbandry and attention to other aspects of property management such as fossil fuel consumption. Focus on emissions per unit of land area is likely to have other ecological benefits for land condition and to capture the effects of changes in carbon stocks in vegetation and soils. In much of northern and central Australia, changes in settlement patterns have led to more frequent and intense fires than under indigenous management regimes before European settlement. The implementation of more benign regimes of savanna burning has great potential benefit for greenhouse abatement, biodiversity, and livelihoods of indigenous people in remote settlements.";"Cook, Garry D.

"AGRIS:US201301645967";"Application of remote and in situ information to the management of wetlands in Poland";"";"The protection and regeneration of wetlands has been of crucial importance as a goal in ecological research and in nature conservation for some time and is more important than ever now. Knowledge about the biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation retrieved from satellite images enables us to improve the monitoring of these unique areas, which are otherwise very often impenetrable and therefore difficult to examine, analyze and assess by means of site visits. The Biebrza Wetlands are situated in the North-East part of Poland and are one of the largest areas made up of marshes and swamps in the entire EU. This is still one of the wildest areas and one of the least destroyed, damaged or changed by human impact. However, in the recent decades there have been attempts made to intensify and overexploit the natural resources of the region and implement new agriculture practices in the area. In this period, drainage canals have been built, and a good deal of the area has been drained. The area of this precious ecosystem covers 25 494 ha. This valuable area of peat with unique vegetation species and with very special birds is one of the most valuable areas in Europe and in 1995 was added to the list of Ramsar sites. The investigation of wetlands in the Biebrza River Valley has been carried out at ground level by taking measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, Leaf Area Index, wet and dry biomass and the levels of ground water and meteorological parameters. Also examined were radiative temperature, detailed vegetation mapping, and APAR. For some years the deterioration of peat lands has been noticed due to the drying out of the area and the frequent outbreak of fires. The consequence is the succession of new vegetation and the appearance of new ecosystems. The Remote Sensing Centre in the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography has undertaken the investigation by applying ERS-2.SAR and ENVISAT ASAR of IS2 and IS4 and VV, HH, HV polarization for the purpose of modeling soil moisture and humidity changes of the area under investigation. The investigation also aimed at finding the best biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation to characterize marshland habitats and its changes. At the same time as registering the microwave data, the optical data from Landsat ETM+, SPOT VEGETATION, ERS-2.ATSR, ENVISAT MERIS, and NOAA/AVHRR have been registered and information about the biomass and heat fluxes as sensible and latent heat has also been calculated. The vegetation indices are calculated from EO satellite data taking into account jointly the features of vegetation responsible for reflection in various bands and combining this information from several spectral bands. Also, the changes in the humidity of the area have been examined by extracting the backscattering coefficients from two SAR images that were taken at a similar period of the year but with a gap of 5 years. The information about soil moisture as retention, soil moisture changes, heat fluxes and evapotranspiration are all very important for estimates of CO2 sequestration. The ENVISAT images have been obtained for the ESA AO-ID122 project. Also the SMOS and ALOS data will be applied for the Biebrza Wetlands in the future.";"Dabrowska-Zielinska, Katarzyna

We estimated TC and four soil C fractions, namely recalcitrant C (RC), hydrolyzable C (HC), hot-water-soluble C (SC), and mineralizable C (MC), at 0 to 30 cm across a 3585-km2 mixed-use watershed in north-central Florida. We used lognormal block kriging (BK) and regression block kriging (RK) to upscale soil C using 102 training samples and compared the models using 39 validation samples. Regression kriging produced the most accurate models for TC and RC, whereas the labile C fractions (HC, SC, and MC) were best modeled by BK. Maps produced by BK showed similar spatial patterns due to the strong correlation between the labile C fractions and the similarity of their spatial dependence structure. Estimates of TC and RC were similar due to their high correlation and the similarity of their global trend models. Total soil C amounted to 27.40 Tg across the watershed, indicating the potential of these soils to store C. Recalcitrant C totaled 22.49 Tg (82% of TC), suggesting that a large amount of TC could be potentially stored for centuries to millennia. Our estimates of soil C and fractions within a mixed-use watershed in Florida highlight the importance of appropriately characterizing the inherent spatial dependence structure of soil C, as well as relevant regional environmental patterns (e.g., hydrology), to better explain the variability of soil C.";"Vasques, Gustavo M.

Land managers generally consider sod farms on an equal footing with other, sustainable agricultural land uses. We measured soil losses associated with sod harvesting in farms in the northeastern United States. Sod harvest resulted in soil losses ranging from 74 to 114 Mg ha–1 yr–1, considerably higher than the tolerable soil loss of 6.7 Mg ha–1 yr–1. Soil losses were proportional to time under sod production, with soil removal rates of 0.833 cm yr–1. We estimate that sod harvesting in the United States results in the net, permanent loss of 12.0 to 18.7 Tg of agriculturally productive soil from sod farms—and associated ecosystem services—every year. The soil losses reported here have important implications in terms of land use planning, transactions involving the purchase of development rights, and tax deductions for soil depletion.";"Millar, David

The first step entails imposing nutrient restrictions on food consumption following dietary recommendations. The resulting diet is then used as a proxy for demand in agricultural commodities, to test the impact of such a scenario on agricultural land use and production.Results of the diet optimisation indicate a severe drop in foods rich in saturated fats and sugar, essentially cheese and sugar-based products, along with lesser cuts in fat and meat products Conversely, consumption of fruit & vegetables, cereals, and flour would increase to meet dietary fibre recommendations. Such a shift in demand would dramatically affect production patterns: the margin of England and Wales agriculture would rise, due to increased production of high market value and high margin crops. Some regions would however be negatively affected, mostly those regions dependent on beef and sheep production that could not benefit from an increased demand for cereals. The effects of these changes would also be felt in upstream industries such as feed suppliers.";"Arnoult, Matthieu H.

Three model components including dynamic variable, hydrology, and sediment components are described. The dynamic variable component includes interactive soil, plant growth, and residue decomposition subcomponents which predicts temporal changes in hydrology- and detachment-related soil parameters, crop variables, and the decomposition of three types of residues, respectively, according to applied land management practices. The hydrology components include interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, percolation, overland flow, channel flow, interflow, and base flow components.

Currently, restoration of degraded land is limited to species with high tolerances of salinity. Biochar application has the potential to improve physical, biological and chemical properties of these soils to allow establishment of a wider range of plants. In a glasshouse trial, we applied biochar made from Acacia pycnantha (5 Mg ha⁻¹) or no biochar to either a low (ECₑ 4·75 dS m⁻¹, ESP 6·9), a moderate (ECₑ 27·6 dS m⁻¹, ESP 29·3) or a high (ECₑ 49·4 dS m⁻¹, ESP 45·1) saline sodic soil. The regional common reforestation species Eucalyptus viminalis and Acacia mearnsii were planted as tubestock in to the soils. Early establishment indicators, including growth, plant condition and nutrition, were assessed at the end of a simulated growing season, 108 days after biochar application. Application of biochar increased height, and decreased root : shoot and the concentration of Mn, N and S in plants of E. viminalis when grown in the highly saline sodic soil. Biochar application increased the concentration of B in leaves of E. viminalis and increased the concentration of P, K and S in leaves of A. mearnsii when grown in the low saline sodic soil. The results confirm that there is potential for biochar to assist in reforestation of saline sodic soils. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Drake, Jessica A.

"AGRIS:US201600131833";"Use of Goats Grazing to Restore Pastures Invaded by Shrubs and Avoid Desertification: A Preliminary Case Study in the Spanish Cantabrian Mountains";"";"Spanish mountains have been affected by the expansion of shrubs and forests since the mid‐20th century. This secondary succession in vegetation has some positive effects, but also drawbacks, such as an increase in fire risk, loss of diversity in land use, a reduction in landscape and cultural value, less water available in river channels and reservoirs, constraints on livestock farming, a reduced number of local species and loss of biodiversity. This paper analyses the potential for grazing domestic goats to help control the spread of several species of shrubs such as the common broom (Cytisus scoparius), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and roses (Rosa sp.) that are commonly found in degraded pastures in the Cantabrian Mountains of northern Spain. Using experimental plots, the effects of two levels of stocking density (4·5 and 9 goats ha⁻¹ y⁻¹) are compared with other land management systems used in the region: burning, mechanical clearing and trimming. The combined use of goats with support from burning, clearing and trimming controls the spread of shrubs. The most efficient treatment was found with nine goats ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. Goat grazing also changes the distribution of shrubs, transforming a dense and continuous coverage into separate clumps and thereby enabling livestock to graze more easily. Maintaining a mixed structure of shrubs and pastures is the best treatment due to the low population density of the Cantabrian Mountains, as this enhances the biodiversity, controls fire risk and enriches the landscape; it also allows extensive livestock grazing as a main economic resource.

"AGRIS:US201500205539";"HERBIVORE‐DRIVEN LAND DEGRADATION: CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANT DIVERSITY AND SOIL IN ARID SUBTROPICAL THICKET IN SOUTH‐EASTERN AFRICA";"";"Investigations were made of plant and soil responses to severe degradation through heavy grazing and browsing in arid, succulent, subtropical thicket. Severe degradation of thicket is of major concern in terms of threatened biodiversity, unsustainable utilization and collapse of other ecosystem services. We used a natural, field contrast, case‐study approach, sampling within plots under lightly and heavily stocked conditions. Mean plant species diversity and richness did not change significantly at sample plot level although there was a 27 per cent decline in richness with degradation at the scale of the study site. On degraded plots, there was a high species turnover and high beta diversity, which created a replacement zone rather than an impoverished zone. Replacement species were confirmed as mainly, but not exclusively, weedy annual grasses and alien forbs. The few persisting perennials were small trees that survived above the browse line, and hardy shrub species. Perennial persisting and replacement species below the browse line may suggest potential candidates for restoration. Nitrogen was the only measured nutrient that showed a significant decrease with degradation. Phosphorous, potassium and magnesium increased significantly, with the first two mentioned reaching potentially excessive levels. Soil salinization occurred with an order of magnitude increase in sodium. Thus, the increased cation exchange capacity occurred together with development of a nutrient imbalance. The elevation in some nutrients and soluble salts is ascribed to wind‐determined directional grazing that concentrate livestock in the degraded area. The implications of the above altered soil conditions for thicket restoration need to be further explored. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Rutherford, M. C.

Both have suffered habitat loss and fragmentation throughout their ranges. The goal of this study, conducted in the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetland Complex (MKWC) in northwestern Madagascar, was to assess the effects of historical change in the species' habitats, and to model the potential impact of further land-use change on their habitats. The IDRISI Andes Geographical Information System and image-processing software was used for satellite-image classification, and the Land Change Modeler was used to compare the natural habitat of the species from 1973 to 2005, and to predict available habitat for 2050. We analyzed two forests in the MKWC occupied by P. coronatus (Antsilaiza and Anjohibe), and three forests occupied by P. deckenii (Tsiombikibo, Marofandroboka and Andohaomby). The two forests occupied by P. coronatus contracted during the period 1949â1973, but then expanded to exceed their 1949 area by 28% in 2005. However, the land change model predicted that they will contract again to match their 1949 area by 2050, and will again lose their corridor connection, meaning that the conservation gains for this species in the complex are at risk of being reversed. The three forests occupied by P. deckenii have declined in area steadily since 1949, losing 20% of their original area by 2005, and are predicted to lose a further 15% of their original area by 2050. Both species are therefore at risk of becoming even more threatened if land-use change continues within the complex. Improved conservation of the remaining forest is recommended to avoid further loss, as well as ecological restoration and reforestation to promote connectivity between the forests. A new strategy for controlling agriculture and forest use is required in order to avoid further destruction of the forest.";"Andriamasimanana, Rado H.

Unsupervised classification (ISODATA) and a hierarchy decision tree were applied to eight scenes of the Landsat images to derive the land use/land cover (LULC) around the Shenyang metropolitan region from 1986 to 2007. Landsat TM/ETM+ thermal infrared (TIR) images (band 6) were used to investigate the urban surface thermal patterns by retrieving land surface temperature (LST) using a mono-window algorithm. Results reveal that the built-up area has doubled from 1986 (20.2 %) to 2007 (42.3 %), most of which is converted from croplands around the urban fringe area. The built-up area has close association with the population increase (R² = 0.89), the gross domestic production (R² = 0.94), and fixed asset investments (R² = 0.95). These illustrate the contributions of socioeconomic factors to the rapid urban expansion in Shenyang. Three urban heat island (UHI) indices [i.e., heat effect contribution index (H ᵢ), weighted heat unit index (D₁), and regional weighted heat unit index (D₂)] were used to characterize the urban thermal patterns for removing the phenological effects and to confirm the linkage between UHI and urban expansion. Results show that urban areas have an obvious daytime heating effect (heat source) that is strongly correlated with urban expansion, wherein a higher percentage of an impervious surface is usually associated with a higher surface temperature. Further analyses indicate that urban expansion is fairly correlated to H ᵢ ' (R² = 0.63) but strongly to D₂(R² = 0.91). Additional research is needed to further quantify the inner urban area to gain a better understanding of UHI resulting from various heat fluxes and urban components.";"Lu, Dongmei

"AGRIS:US201500205533";"ASSESSMENT OF LAND COVER CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECT ON SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND SOIL TOTAL NITROGEN IN DAQING PREFECTURE, CHINA";"";"The aim of this study was to examine the influence of land cover changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in the Daqing Prefecture of China, where heavy industrialisation in the form of dense oil wells has impacted the environment. Time‐series presentations for the period 1978 to 2008 of remotely sensed data and soil survey data were used to assess the extent of the changes. The study revealed soil degradation under all land cover types and in all soil types, grassland retreat (−15 per cent), swampland retreat (−45 per cent) and increases in the area of farmland (+19 per cent), sand land (+1450 per cent) and alkaline land (+52 per cent). Depletion of the SOC pool occurred in swampland (−64 per cent) both because of the decrease in the area of swampland and because of a decrease in SOC density (−34 per cent). An increase in the SOC pool occurred in alkaline land because of the increase in the area and also because of an increase in SOC density (+297 per cent), but there was little change in the SOC pool in farmland because the increase in area was largely offset by a decrease in SOC density (−14 per cent). The decrease in the STN pool was substantial (−44 per cent), with the largest contributor being the decrease in swamplands (−74 per cent), partly because of the decrease in the area of swampland and partly because of a decrease in STN density (−52 per cent). Large decreases in the STN pool also occurred in farmland (−22 per cent) and grassland (−41 per cent). The direct impacts of construction associated with the expansion of the oil industry were overshadowed by indirect impacts such as interference with water flows and water levels resulting in salinisation of soil. The study also revealed that land cover changes are much more dynamic than a simple analysis would reveal, and because of lag times in the loss of SOC, soil degradation will continue even if land cover changes cease.

"AGRIS:US201500205534";"EFFECT OF SOIL BUNDS ON RUNOFF, SOIL AND NUTRIENT LOSSES, AND CROP YIELD IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF ETHIOPIA";"";"The effects of soil bunds on runoff, losses of soil and nutrients, and crop yield are rarely documented in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia. A field experiment was set up consisting of three treatments: (i) barley‐cultivated land protected with graded soil bunds (Sb); (ii) fallow land (F); and (iii) barley‐cultivated land without soil bund (Bc). For 3 years (2007–2009), the effect of soil bunds on runoff, losses of soil and nutrients, and crop productivity was studied. Daily runoff and soil and nutrient losses were measured for each treatment using standard procedures while barley yield was recorded from the cultivated plots. The results showed that Sb brought about significant reduction in runoff and soil losses. Plots with Sb reduced the average annual runoff by 28 per cent and the average annual soil loss by 47 per cent. Consequently, Sb reduced losses of soil nutrients and organic carbon. However, the absolute losses were still high. This implies the need for supplementing Sb with biological and agronomic land management measures to further control soil erosion. Despite these positive impacts on soil quality, Sb do not increase crop yield. Calculated on a per‐hectare basis, Sb even reduce crop yield by about 7 per cent as compared with control plots, which is entirely explained by the reduction of the cultivable area by 8·6 per cent due to the soil bunds. Suitable measures are needed to compensate the yield losses caused by the construction of soil bunds, which would convince farmers to construct these land management measures that have long‐term beneficial effects on erosion control.

"AGRIS:US201500205537";"DECADAL MODELLING OF RAINFALL EROSIVITY IN BELGIUM";"";"Hydrological extremes are major weather related disasters, but little is known about their long‐term patterns in the context of environmental change. Better understanding of damaging rainfall (e.g. rainfall‐erosivity events) occurring at different time‐scales has important implications for hydrological and land degradation management. The study of the interdecadal variations may help in understanding some of the consequences of abrupt environmental changes over long time periods. Thus, a decadal‐scale rainfall erosivity model (DREM), comparable with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), was developed based on a parsimonious interpretation of rain aggressiveness (95th percentile of rainfalls). The DREM was parameterised to capture interdecadal erosivity variability at the Ukkel station (Belgium), which has the longest RUSLE‐based rain‐erosivity series in Europe (1898–2007). The DREM performed well against decadal RUSLE data, with a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0·72 and a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index of 0·71. The model outperformed three well‐established models used in this study (R² ~ 0·4). For a spatial evaluation of the DREM, a pattern of decadal rainfall erosivity was provided for an area around Ukkel, which includes the western part of Germany bordering Belgium, and was compared with maps from the RUSLE approach for 1961–1990. The 95th percentile of June–September rainfalls proved to be a better predictor of decadal rainfall erosivity than yearly based precipitation amount. These results lay the foundation for estimating decadal erosivity in the surrounding areas of Ukkle as well as for historical reconstructions where detailed hydrological data are unavailable, and assumptions cannot be met, for physically based models.

"AGRIS:US201500205536";"SOIL EROSION IN THREE GRAZED PLANT COMMUNITIES IN NORTHEASTERN PATAGONIA";"";"Grazing has been identified as the main cause of land degradation in Patagonia. However, land degradation is highly variable among areas, even within the same paddock. This strongly suggests that different plant communities differ in their resistance to land degradation. In this study, we have evaluated soil erosion at both microsite and community scales in coexisting plant communities subject to sheep grazing in northeastern Patagonia. Three plant communities coexist in the area: two shrub steppes dominated by Chuquiraga avellanedae Lorentz and Nassauvia ulicina (Hook. f.) Macloskie, and a grass steppe dominated by Nassella tenuis (Phil.) Barkworth. At a community scale, our results indicate that shrub steppes generally experienced soil erosion, whereas the grass steppe commonly did not show signs of soil erosion/deposition. At a microsite scale, non‐vegetated soil surface types and degraded mounds never accumulated sediments, regardless of plant community. In contrast, we found that in some sites, the intact mounds and grasses entrapped sediments, but in other sites, soil erosion prevailed. Our results highlight the fact that soil erosion measurements are scale dependent, because results at microsite and community scales often differ. When comparing among communities, grass steppe is more intensely grazed, but at the same time, it shows less evidence of past and present erosion. In contrast, the N. ulicina community showed a direct relationship between grazing and soil erosion. Finally, soil erosion was not related to grazing in the C. avellanedae community. Our results demonstrate that the grass steppe is more resistant to land degradation than shrub steppes. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Palacio, Romina G.

A better understanding of the ability of plants to promote soil microbial process in these conditions is necessary for successful soil reclamation. The current study was to investigate the ability of four different plant species to regenerate the microbiological processes in the rhizosphere soil and to discuss which species were the most effective for the reclamation of the coastal zone. The rhizosphere soils were studied by measuring microbial abundance (bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and ammonifiers), enzyme activities (invertase, catalase, urease, and phosphatase) and their relationship. Microbial abundance greatly varied among rhizospheres of different plant species (p < 0.05). Phragmites australis supported the highest amount of bacterial, actinomycetes, and ammonifiers abundance, and Echinochloa crusgalli supported the highest fungi abundance. In addition, the significant differences in rhizosphere enzyme activities of different plant species were also observed. There was a significant linear correlation between rhizosphere soil microbial abundances and enzyme activities between bacteria and urease and between fungi and catalase, but no such significant relationship was found between all rhizosphere soil microbial abundance and phosphatases. It was concluded that different plant species in coastal areas have different rhizosphere soils due to the impact of the different root exudates and plant residues of the microbial properties. In addition, natural grasslands (P. australis and E. crusgalli) are the most effective for revegetating coastal sandy soils.";"Zhang, L.

Smallholder farmers still rely heavily on livestock manure for soil fertility management.  To explore the determinants of soil fertility management practices, including both the use of cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer, data are used from a sample of 3,330 geo-referenced farm households across Central and Western Kenya.  A bivariate probit model is applied to jointly examine the use of the two technologies.  Particular attention is given to measures of location related to market access and agroclimate, which in the adoption literature have typically been addressed using crude proxies.  To avoid such proxies, GIS-derived variables are integrated into the household decision model.  Their use also allows the spatial prediction of uptake based on parameter estimates.  The results show clearly the derived-demand nature of soil fertility services, based on markets for farm outputs.  They also illustrate that supply of manure for soil fertility amendments is conditioned by demand for livestock products, especially milk.  The integration of GIS-derived variables is shown to better estimate the effects of location than the usual measures employed, and offers scope to wider use in technology adoption research.";"Staal, Steven J.

"AGRIS:US201400184065";"Design of ecoregional monitoring in conservation areas of high-latitude ecosystems under contemporary climate change";"";"Land ownership in Alaska includes a mosaic of federally managed units. Within its agency’s context, each unit has its own management strategy, authority, and resources of conservation concern, many of which are migratory animals. Though some units are geographically isolated, many are nevertheless linked by paths of abiotic and biotic flows, such as rivers, air masses, flyways, and terrestrial and aquatic migration routes. Furthermore, individual land units exist within the context of a larger landscape pattern of shifting conditions, requiring managers to understand at larger spatial scales the status and trends in the synchrony and spatial concurrence of species and associated suitable habitats. Results of these changes will determine the ability of Alaska lands to continue to: provide habitat for local and migratory species; absorb species whose ranges are shifting northward; and experience mitigation or exacerbation of climate change through positive and negative atmospheric feedbacks. We discuss the geographic and statutory contexts that influence development of ecological monitoring; argue for the inclusion of significant amounts of broad-scale monitoring; discuss the importance of defining clear programmatic and monitoring objectives; and draw from lessons learned from existing long-term, broad-scale monitoring programs to apply to the specific contexts relevant to high-latitude protected areas such as those in Alaska. Such areas are distinguished by their: marked seasonality; relatively large magnitudes of contemporary change in climatic parameters; and relative inaccessibility due to broad spatial extent, very low (or zero) road density, and steep and glaciated areas. For ecological monitoring to effectively support management decisions in high-latitude areas such as Alaska, a monitoring program ideally would be structured to address the actual spatial and temporal scales of relevant processes, rather than the artificial boundaries of individual land-management units. Heuristic models provide a means by which to integrate understanding of ecosystem structure, composition, and function, in the midst of numerous ecosystem drivers.";"Beever, Erik A.

We describe an iterative, three-phased process for developing sampling designs based on our efforts to establish a vegetation monitoring program in southwest Alaska. In the first phase, we defined a sampling frame based on land ownership and specific vegetated habitats within the park boundaries and used Path Distance analysis tools to create a GIS layer that delineated portions of each park that could be feasibly accessed for ground sampling. In the second phase, we used simulations based on landcover maps to identify size and configuration of the ground sampling units (single plots or grids of plots) and to refine areas to be potentially sampled. In the third phase, we used a second set of simulations to estimate sample size and sampling frequency required to have a reasonable chance of detecting a minimum trend in vegetation cover for a specified time period and level of statistical confidence. Results of the first set of simulations indicated that a spatially balanced random sample of single plots from the most common landcover types yielded the most efficient sampling scheme. Results of the second set of simulations were compared with field data and indicated that we should be able to detect at least a 25% change in vegetation attributes over 31years by sampling 8 or more plots per year every five years in focal landcover types. This approach would be especially useful in situations where ground sampling is restricted by access.";"Thompson, William L.

The boundaries of the study area corresponded to those of six local councils: Guglionesi, Montecilfone, Montenero di Bisaccia, Petacciato, San Giacomo degli Schiavoni and Termoli. It is an area which has undergone a great anthropic agricultural impact after the II World War, but, however, still has natural settings worth preserving, as can be seen by the presence of seven Sites of Community Interest (sensu Habitat Directive 92/43/EC). For the analyses of the land cover changes, geo-databases were consulted or specially constructed. The aerial photographs from GAI 1954-55 flight, appropriately georectified, and the aerial photograph ITA2000 and AGEA 2004 flights were adopted to draw up the land use/cover maps at a scale of 1.10.000.The study of vegetation was performed using the phytosociological method. In brief, the results show that the landscape of the study area has become more fragmented due mostly to effects of continuous human disturbances and agricultural improvement during the study period. Overall, the landscape is today characterised by the predominance of agricultural use and the sparse colonization of the natural vegetation, mainly by linear vegetational formations (mainly riparian woods).";"Piera Di Marzio

In this paper we present some of the major challenges salmon farming is facing today. We discuss issues of relevance to how to ensure sustainability, by focusing on animal production systems, breeding approaches, sources for feed ingredients, and genetic engineering strategies. Other crucial issues such as animal welfare, environmental quality, and ethics are elaborated with regard to relevance for the sustainability of aquaculture. Additionally, we comment on socio-economic distributive implications by intellectual property rights (IPR) strategies on access to genetic material and traceability. To improve sustainability of salmon farming we suggest that there is a need for new approaches to guide research, for identification of ethical issues, and for engaging stakeholders in resolving these challenges.";"Olesen, Ingrid

It was set up in cooperation with the stakeholders involved to provide information on the impact of land use, e.g., agriculture, nature (forested areas), recreation, and urban areas, on the quality of both infiltrating and abstracted groundwater. This NSS combined simulation programs that calculate (1) the concentrations of nitrate in shallow groundwater for each land-use area and (2) the transport of nitrate in the groundwater-saturated zone. The user interface of the NSS enabled scenario analyses. The NSS was validated at a drinking-water abstraction near Holten (the Netherlands) using a spatial planning process aimed at sustainable land-use and groundwater-resource management. Two land-use scenarios were considered: a base scenario reflecting the autonomous development and an adapted land-use scenario. The calculated results for shallow groundwater provided an explicit spatial overview of the impact of historical land use and N application on the quality of abstracted groundwater as well as insight into the impact of changes in land use and N application. Visualization of the conflicting interests of agriculture and the drinking-water abstraction helped all stakeholders accept the necessary changes in land use identified by the adapted land-use scenario of the NSS. These changes were included in the preferred land-use management option in the regional planning process, which has since been formalized. The NSS provided system insight, scoping analyses, and education, in addition to generating quantitative information on the impact of land-use functions on groundwater quality.";"van den Brink, Cors

The constraints on the areas devoted to the land uses considered in addition to those imposed by their joint and individual availabilities, are that they must reach levels considered to satisfy existing demand for those uses or their products, and that the areas devoted to maize and fodder must be sufficient for maintenance of dairy farm production. The program generates comprehensive samples of the Pareto-optimal set, and also allows interactive convergence on a solution that is satisfactory to the decision-maker or interactive exploration of the Pareto-optimal set.

"AGRIS:DJ2012067453";"Land management strategies for the long-term persistence of boreal woodland caribou in central Saskatchewan";"";"We investigated landscape changes and their potential effects on woodland caribou-boreal ecotype (Rangifer tarandus caribou) within a portion of the Smoothstone-Wapaweka Woodland Caribou Management Unit (SW-WCMU). The SW-WCMU is one of eight areas delineated by the Province of Saskatchewan for potential recovery planning efforts for boreal caribou, and is one of four management units located on the Boreal Plain Ecozone. The Prince Albert Greater Ecosystem (PAGE) study area was selected within the SW-WCMU for intensive study from 2004 - 2008. Studies focused on quantifying a suite of landscape and population parameters. This paper presents a summary of study results to date and recommends land management strategies intended to contribute to the long-term viability of boreal caribou in the central boreal plain ecoregion of Saskatchewan. The PAGE study area has undergone structural changes from an area that historically presented a lesser amount but well connected mature coniferous forest, to a currently larger amount of mature coniferous stands fragmented by a highly developed network of roads and trails. Movement data pointed to highly clustered use of the landscape by small groups of caribou and smaller home ranges when compared to 15 years ago. Calving sites were located within each individual home range in treed peatland and distant from hardwood/mixedwood forest stands, roads and trails access. Adult annual survival rates were low, averaging 73% over the course of the study. In order to ensure a self-sustaining population level, study results clearly point to the need for landscape restoration to reduce the level of anthropogenic disturbances in some key parts of the study area. Key strategies include retention of mature softwood forest interior proximate to local areas of caribou activity, protection of calving habitat, improving structural connectivity, planning disturbances (forest harvesting, fire salvage, resource exploration, access development) in ways to minimize the anthropogenic footprint, and recovery action planning integrated with other land-use planning initiatives.";"A.

"AGRIS:US201400192556";"Consider the source: The impact of media and authority in outreach to private forest and rangeland owners";"";"Over half of the United States is privately owned. Improving environmental sustainability requires that the scientific and management communities provide effective outreach to the many landowners making decisions about land use and management practices on these lands. We surveyed California forest and rangeland owners in ten counties throughout the state to assess the impact of existing outreach and identify gaps in information distribution and content. Although a number of organizations provide land management advice highly-ranked by landowners, no individual organization currently reaches more than 30% of forest and rangeland owners, and these groups together reach less than 60% of landowners. The lowest ranked advice came from wildlife and land management agencies, whereas the highest ranked advice came from private consultants and advisory organizations. The ecosystem services provided by forests and rangelands are strongly influenced by conservation scale, and this appears to be recognized in current outreach efforts. Owners of large properties (>200 ha) were substantially more likely to have received land management advice than smaller-sized properties, and from a broader group of organizations. As ownerships become increasingly fragmented, outreach focus and methods will need to shift to more effectively target the owners of smaller properties. On the other hand, some major outreach goals, such as conservation of wildlife, ranchland, or agricultural communities, will continue to rely on effective outreach to owners of larger properties.";"Ferranto, Shasta

"AGRIS:DJ2012055957";"Does a property rights regime affect the outcome of European inland commercial fisheries? Le régime des droits de propriété affecte-t-il les résultats des pêcheries commerciales des eaux continentales européennes ?";"";"European inland commercial fisheries exhibit a wide spectrum of fishing modes, and have  experienced major changes over recent decades. A peculiar feature of inland fisheries is  the deep dependence on resources usually owned by someone else than a fisher. Therefore  institutions such as property rights regimes, have a profound influence on the  prerequisites to carry out commercial inland fisheries. We examined whether two main  property right regimes, public or private, have alleviated commercial inland fishers’  access to fishing grounds in member countries of the European Inland Fisheries Advisory  Commission, EIFAC. Public ownership prevailed in two countries out of three. Commercial  inland catch and employment (number of fishers) for countries with mostly public ownership  were nearly six times greater than for those with mostly private ownership. Ratios of both  commercial inland catch and employment to inland water area were over nine times greater  for countries were fisheries were publicly managed in comparison with privately managed  fisheries. This outcome contradicts the presumption of privatisation of fishing rights as  a tool to increase efficiency of commercial utilisation of inland water fish resources.  Les pêcheries commerciales dans les eaux continentales européennes présentent une large  gamme de modes de pêche et ont subi des changements importants ces dernières décades. Une  caractéristique particulière des pêcheries intérieures est la forte dépendance des  ressources souvent possédées par d’autres que les pêcheurs. Par conséquent, les  institutions comme les régimes de droit à la propriété ont une forte influence sur les  conditions préalables à la mise en place des pêcheries commerciales intérieures. Nous  avons examiné comment les deux régimes principaux de droit à la propriété, public ou  privé, influent sur l’accès des pêcheurs commerciaux aux sites de pêche dans les pays  membres de la Commission Européenne Consultative pour la Pêche dans les Eaux Intérieures,  CECPI. La propriété publique prévaut dans deux pays sur trois. Les captures commerciales  et le nombre d’emplois dans les pays de propriété publique principale sont près de six  fois plus forts que dans les pays à propriété privée majoritaire. Les rapports à la fois  entre captures commerciales, emploi et la surface des eaux pêchées sont plus de neuf fois  supérieurs pour les pays où les pêcheries sont gérées publiquement. Ces résultats  contredisent la supposition que la privatisation des droits de pêche serait un moyen  d’accroître l’efficacité d’utilisation des ressources piscicoles des eaux intérieures.";"Sipponen M.

Normally large farms use more energy than small farms and obtain higher labor productivity which is one of the reasons for their superiority. We presume energy includes a component of negative externality if fossil energy is used and carbon CO2are counted. Moreover it can be intended to use farming for carbon sequestration. In the paper we will analyze, how a new pathway can be developed, that includes incentives (taxes and subsidies) to save energy and develop coexistence between large and small farms. In favoring small scale farming because of less emission, a contribution to global warming reduction is envisaged. The issue is how can we address farm size, make incentives visible, help to switchtechnologies and promote farmers who adopt CO2 saving technologies? The paper suggests aframework of linear programming and quadratic expositions of farm behavior to depict policy for optimal farm operation size and farm structures composed of large and small scale farms. A moderate position is taken with respect to sustainable farming and the question of farm size and energy use is given to policy instruments.";"Nuppenau, Ernst-August";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-08-20";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016208787";"http://purl.umn.edu/52805";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400192558";"Assessing the benefits and costs of dryland forest restoration in central Chile";"";"Investment in natural capital restoration is increasing as a response to the widespread ecological degradation of dryland forests. However, finding efficient mechanisms to promote restoration among private landowners is a significant challenge for policy makers with limited financial resources. Furthermore, few attempts have been made to evaluate the costs and benefits of restoration interventions even though this information is relevant to orient decision making. Hence, our goal was to estimate the benefits and costs of dryland forest restoration by means of reforestation with native trees in a study area in central Chile. To determine benefits we applied a Contingent Valuation questionnaire that allowed for the calculation of willingness to pay measures. Restoration costs were calculated based on market prices following existing technical recommendations developed for the study area. The results showed that the restoration project had a negative NPV irrespective of the discount rate applied in the analysis. Thus, the NPV varied between –US$71,000 and –US$258,000. The NPV attained positive results only for negative discount rates (US$15,039 for −2%) and only when the national subsidy available for forest restoration was taken into account. This shows that landowners in Colliguay do not have incentives for carrying out restoration interventions due to a classic market failure: that in which ecosystems are mismanaged because many of their benefits are externalities from the perspective of landowners. Overall, these results stress the need for developing new compensation mechanisms and enhancing those in existence, with the aim of making restoration competitive with other land uses.";"Schiappacasse, Ignacio

"AGRIS:US201400008744";"Identifying nascent wetland forest conversion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo";"";"Wetlands cover large areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, their extent and distribution have not been accurately mapped. While wetland forests remain largely undisturbed, increasing threats by anthropogenic activities have been observed in areas with high population density per arable or exploitable land. The scarcity of terra firma forests in some territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has forced local communities to develop cropping methods that allow for cultivation in periodically flooded areas. Assessing wetlands extent and status is critical for long term conservation of these highly vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, we use multi-source and multi-resolution optical and radar remotely sensed data and elevation derived indices to map the wetlands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Results showed that wetlands are a significant part of the landscape in the country, covering an estimated 440,000 km² or 19.2 % of the total country area. By combining the wetlands map with a previously produced land cover depiction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a map including forested wetlands as a thematic class was derived. We investigated whether high terra firma population density and low percent remaining terra firma forest are related at the lowest administrative level (Sector); specifically, we tested these two variables as predictors of wetland forest cover loss. A polynomial regression relating population and primary terra firma forest to wetland forest cover loss yielded an r ² of 0.76, illustrating a nascent and significant land cover change dynamic. Areas most at risk for future wetland forest loss lie in the western Cuvette, and include (north–south) the Sud-Ubangi, Mongala, Equateur and Mai-Ndombe Districts. By quantifying available upland forest resources and overlaying with population density, it was possible to identify stressed areas inside of the forest domain (traditionally known for having generically high levels of forest resources). Results illustrate the need for addressing issues of wetland forest management and protection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially where increasing populations are exhausting primary terra firma forest resources.";"Bwangoy, Jean-Robert B.

"AGRIS:US201400008745";"role of the landscape in structuring immature mosquito assemblages in wetlands";"";"The distribution of mosquito populations is spatially heterogeneous and influenced by factors acting at a wide range of scales. The aim of this study was to assess the role of environmental heterogeneity at the landscape level in shaping the composition of immature mosquito communities inhabiting surface water habitats. The Paraná Lower Delta (Argentina) is a temperate wetland that extends along a 1º north–south gradient and presents high landscape heterogeneity, due to the combined action of geomorphology, hydrology and human intervention. Immature mosquitoes were collected every 2 weeks (Nov 2011–April 2012) from surface water habitats within 11 peridomestic areas interspersed along a 75 km north–south transect. The environment was quantified by 24 variables regarding the geomorphology, geography, economic use, climate, landcover and topography of each site and its surroundings at three radii. The association between the mosquito assemblage and the environment was tested by two multivariate approaches, the community-based outlying mean index and by-species generalized linear models. The former explained 93.6 % of the marginality of all taxa as a function of the type and diversity of landcover, precipitation, presence of cattle and altitude. The niche of six species, most of which were floodwater mosquitoes of the genera Ochlerotatus and Psorophora, deviated significantly from uniformity. The by-species approach rendered significant models for four species as a function of landcover type and precipitation. Both methodologies were broadly consistent in pointing that landscape elements affect the distribution of immature mosquitoes, thereby shaping the composition of the mosquito assemblage in peridomestic environments within wetlands.";"Cardo, María Victoria

"AGRIS:US201400084028";"Characterizing the error distribution of lidar elevation data for North Carolina";"";"Spatial data quality is a paramount concern in all geographical information systems (GIS) applications. Existing standards and guidelines for spatial data commonly assume the positional error is normally distributed. While non-normal behaviour of the error in digital elevation data has been observed in previous research, current guidelines for digital elevation data still assume that the errors for observations in open terrain are normally distributed. This research employed an accuracy assessment dataset from a substantial lidar data collection effort, the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program. Strong evidence was found that the vertical error of lidar elevation data is not normally distributed and that both major and minor outliers are very common. Of the five land cover types considered, only the distribution for urban areas approximated a normal distribution, even though these observations were generally much less accurate than those for open terrain. No influence of slope on the occurrence of non-normal behaviour in the distributions was found. The RMSEz (root mean square error) statistic used to characterize the fundamental accuracy of digital elevation data was found to be very sensitive to the occurrence of outliers, questioning its use in current guidelines.";"Zandbergen, Paul A.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover;urban areas";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400084028";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160903474939";"";"";"";"409-430"

The distribution of AAROs was investigated in 11 soils representing different land management and vegetation zones and was correlated with several geochemical parameters including pH, organic matter (OM), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and nitrogen oxides (NO ₓ –N: mostly NO₃⁻–N). The distribution of individual clades encoding enzymes with potentially different substrates were correlated with different environmental factors, suggesting differential environmental controls on the distribution of specific enzymes as well as sequence diversity. For example, individual clades associated with phthalate dioxygenases were either strongly negatively correlated with pH, or not correlated with pH but showed strong positive correlation with organic carbon content. A large number of clones clustering in a clade related to PAH oxygenases were positively correlated with pH and nitrogen, but not with organic matter. This analysis may yield insight into the ecological forces driving the distribution of these catabolic genes.";"Weidow, Christopher A.

Time series of MODIS 250-m data over three contrasting land cover types in the Amazon were used in conjunction with rainfall data, a land cover map and a forest inventory survey to support the interpretation of our findings. Each vegetation physiognomy was characterized by a particular intra-annual variability detected by a combination of the fraction images. Both vegetation and shade fractions were important to evaluate the seasonality of the open tropical forest (OTF). The association of these results with forest inventory data and the literature suggests that Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and vegetation fraction images are sensitive to structural changes in the canopy of OTF. In cerrado grassland (CG) the phenology was better characterized by combined soil and vegetation fractions. Soybean (SB) areas were characterized by the highest ranges in the vegetation and soil fraction images. Vegetation fraction and vegetation indices for the OTF showed a significant positive relationship with EVI but not with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Significant relationships for vegetation fraction and vegetation indices were also found for the CG and soybean areas. In contrast to vegetation index approaches to monitoring phenology, fraction images provide additional information that allows a more comprehensive exploration of the spectral and structural changes in vegetation formations.";"Anderson, Liana O.

When analyzing different levels of aggregation, the use ofsingle models may not be sufficient. In this paper we establish an interface between the European Simulation Model (ESIM) and the Farm Modelling Information System (FARMIS). The linkage of the two models allows us to quantify adjustment processes both at the sectoral level and at the farm group level for the German agricultural sector. Different liberalization scenarios arepresented and compared to a reference scenario. The abolishment of market price support leads to a reduction of farm incomes, especially if direct payments are also reduced. The low absolute levelof return to labor, particularly in grazing livestock farms, suggests strong changes in farm structure as well as the farm input industry in Germany under the full liberalization scenario.";"Deppermann, Andre

"AGRIS:US201500010963";"Denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in a temperate re-connected floodplain";"";"The relative magnitudes of, and factors controlling, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were measured in the soil of a re-connected temperate floodplain divided into four different land management zones (grazing grassland, hay meadow, fritillary meadow and a buffer zone). Soil samples were collected from each zone to measure their respective potentials for nitrate attenuation using ¹⁵N both at the surface and at depth in the soil column and additional samples were collected to measure the lability of the organic carbon. Denitrification capacity ranged between 0.4 and 4.2 (μmol N g⁻¹ dry soil d⁻¹) across the floodplain topsoil and DNRA capacity was an order of magnitude lower (0.01–0.71 μmol N g⁻¹ d⁻¹). Land management practice had a significant effect on denitrification but no significant effects were apparent for DNRA. In this nitrogen-rich landscape, spatial heterogeneity in denitrification was explained by differences in lability and the magnitude of organic carbon associated with different management practices (mowing and grazing). The lability of organic carbon was significantly higher in grazing grassland in comparison to other ungrazed areas of the floodplain, and consequently denitrification capacity was also highest in this area. Our results indicate that bacteria capable of DNRA do survive in frequently flooded riparian zones, and to a limited extent, compete with denitrification for nitrate, acting to retain and recycle nitrogen in the floodplain. Exponential declines in both denitrification and DNRA capacity with depth in the floodplain soils of a hay meadow and buffer zone were controlled primarily by the organic carbon content of the soils. Furthermore, grazing could be employed in re-connected, temperate floodplains to enhance the potential for nitrate removal from floodwaters via denitrification.";"Sgouridis, F.

"AGRIS:US201301656079";"Assessment of Trends in the Extent of Swidden in Southeast Asia";"";"Swidden systems consisting of temporarily cultivated land and associated fallows often do not appear on land use maps or in statistical records. This is partly due to the fact that swidden is a diverse and dynamic land use system that is difficult to map and partly because of the practice of grouping land covers associated with swidden systems into land use or land cover categories that are not self-evidently linked to swiddening. Additionally, in many parts of Southeast Asia swidden systems have changed or are in the process of changing into other land use systems. This paper assesses the extent of swidden on the basis of regional and national sources for nine countries, and determines the pattern of changes of swidden on the basis of 151 cases culled from 67 articles. Findings include (1) a majority of the cases document swidden being replaced by other forms of agriculture or by other livelihood systems; (2) in cases where swiddening is still practiced, fallow lengths are usually, but not always, shorter; and (3) shortened fallow length does not necessarily indicate a trend away from swidden since it is observed that short fallow swidden is sometimes maintained along with other more intensive farming practices and not completely abandoned. The paper concludes that there is a surprising lack of conclusive data on the extent of swidden in Southeast Asia. In order to remedy this, methods are reviewed that may lead to more precise future assessments.";"Schmidt-Vogt, Dietrich

We studied the habitat preference of the Scops Owl by assessing the habitat occupancy of 401 territories distributed in a large area in northwest Italy, with a special focus on 98 territories located in a high-density area (Monferrato). Habitat characteristics were analyzed with maximum entropy (MAXENT) models that included both vegetational (16 land use categories) and physical features estimated from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) (altitude, slope, hillshade). In the Monferrato area, a comparison of 2009 landcover was also made with year 1954/55 characteristics obtained from aerial photographs. In the full northwest Italy area, the Scops Owl preferred areas located at middle altitude with intermediate slope. The preferred habitats included riparian areas and pasture-grassland, while woodlands and zones with Robinia pseudoacacia shrublands were avoided. In the Monferrato area, Scops Owl occupancy occurred in sites where the landuse (croplands/vineyard mosaic) had changed little since the mid-1950s. Our study suggests that conservation activity should focus on interventions halting riparian zone transformation and subsidies promoting agricultural practices favouring pastures and grassland.";"Treggiari, A.

By focusing on the basin trajectory this paper illustrates the importance of understanding how local-level institutional arrangements interface with national-level policies and basin-wide institutions. We expand Molle's typology of basin actors responses by explicitly introducing a meso-layer which depicts the interface where State-level and local-level initiatives and responses are played out; and focus on how this interaction finds expression in the creation and modification of hydraulic property rights. We subsequently apply this perspective to the case of Pangani River Basin in Tanzania. The Pangani River Basin development trajectory did not follow a linear path and sequence of responses. Attempts by the state government to establish ‘order’ in the basin by issuing water rights, levying water fees and designing a new basin institutional set-up have so far proven problematic, and instead generated ‘noise’ at the interface. So far water resources development in the Pangani has primarily focused on blue water, and the paper shows how investments in infrastructure to control blue water have shaped the relationship between water users, and between water user groups and the State. It remains unknown, however, what the implications will be of widespread investments in improved green water use throughout the basin – not only hydrologically for the availability of blue water, but also socially for the livelihoods of the basin population, and for the evolving relationships between green and blue water users, and between them and the State. The paper concludes with a question: will green water development engender a similar double-edged material-symbolic dynamic as blue water development has. The findings of this paper demonstrate that the expanded typology of basin actors’ responses helps to better understand the present situation. Such an improved understanding is useful in analysing current and proposed interventions.";"Komakech, Hans

During the last decade three global land cover datasets have been created, i.e. the GLC-2000, MODIS and GlobCover, but comparison studies have shown that there are large spatial discrepancies between these three products. One of the reasons for these discrepancies is the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the development of these products. To address this issue, a crowdsourcing tool called Geo-Wiki has been developed. Geo-Wiki has two main aims: to increase the amount of in-situ land cover data available for training, calibration and validation, and to create a hybrid global land cover map that provides more accurate land cover information than any current individual product. This paper outlines the components that comprise Geo-Wiki and how they are integrated in the architectural design. An overview of the main functionality of Geo-Wiki is then provided along with the current usage statistics and the lessons learned to date, in particular the need to add a mechanism for feedback and interaction as part of community building, and the need to address issues of data quality.

A problem with the evaluation of agroforestry using long-run static models and traditional discounting techniques is that the present value of the forestry enterprise is generally much lower than that of other production activities. This problem is common with Australian native species which tend to have a high environmental value but a low market value. This paper presents an economic analysis of an agroforestry operation in land prone to degradation and in the presence of positive externalities provided by trees. The value of the land is estimated based on the present value of expected returns in perpetuity under optimal management. Simulation analysis is used to evaluate the loss in land value caused by dryland salinity. A nonlinear programming model is developed and used to study the effects of timber prices and forest planting costs on optimal forest area and the level of salinity. Elasticities of relevant variables with respect to prices and costs are derived and policy implications of results are discussed.";"Cacho, Oscar J.";"";"";"AGRIS";"1999-12-31";"en";"land degradation;land economics";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012200474";"http://purl.umn.edu/12931";"";"";"";""

This study provides estimates for PPE relative to Poaceae for ten taxa, characterizing the cultural landscape of south Estonia and the RSAP for 40 lakes with an average radius of approximately 100m (22–274m, average 101m) in the region. We evaluate the effects on those estimates of various combinations of factors, such as the analytical methods (i.e. three Extended R value (ERV) sub-models), the distance-weighting methods used to determine plant abundance, and alternative classification schemes of vegetation and land cover data around study sites. Different combinations of ERV sub-models and distance-weighting methods lead to estimates of RSAP varying between 1500m and 2000m. The differences in the estimated RSAP are strongly related to the patch size of the vegetation data. According to ERV sub-model 1, which shows the highest log-likelihood among the three sub-models, most of the taxa have PPE that are higher (Picea, Pinus, Quercus), slightly higher (Salix, Artemisia, Filipendula) or similar (Betula, Cerealia, Cypreraceae) to that of Poaceae. The three ERV sub-models produce only slightly different PPE. However, the selection of distance-weighting method for vegetation has considerable influence on the PPE values. The inverse distance-weighting methods, which do not consider inter-taxonomic differences in pollen dispersal, tend to underestimate PPE for taxa with heavy pollen grains and overestimate PPE for taxa with light pollen grains, compared to the results obtained using other methods that consider taxon specific pollen-dispersal. General land-cover data, based on the classification scheme similar to the CORINE (COoRdination of Information on the Environment) database, could be used for estimating the RSAP and PPE, although some potential problems remain when the classification is too simplified and consolidated.";"Poska, Anneli

This paper aims to document the dynamic, traditional forest knowledge (TFK) of the Yi, including: forest categorization methods; routine forest utilization; land tenure and use-right arrangements; benefit-sharing mechanisms; customary regulations; and forest-related beliefs. Our analysis is based on rapid investigations conducted in two dozen Yi ‘natural villages’ and in-depth studies of three Yi natural villages in Nanhua County, Yunnan. The interrelationship between the forests and Yi livelihoods has developed through farming systems and daily livelihood practices. TFK has contributed to the protection of old-growth forests, which are essential to biodiversity conservation, as well as to human–nature harmonization and equitable resource access through benefit-sharing schemes. However, this knowledge appears to be vulnerable to government policy interventions, the expansion of increasingly globalized market economies, and declining interest in traditional wisdom, knowledge, and lifestyles among younger generations. Further, Yi people remain excluded from processes of policy formulation and implementation. This paper concludes that the inclusion of minority groups such as the Yi in policy formulation could substantially enhance sustainable forest management and social and economic development, while providing an avenue through which to recover and preserve rapidly-vanishing traditional knowledge and practices.";"Jinlong, Liu

This federative concept can help it to build concerted policies of landscape planning.

We tested the algorithm using Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) data for eastern Africa. Using a unique sequence of four statistical change-point detection methods, we identified significant increases or decreases in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), estimated the approximate time of change, and characterized the likely forms of change (i.e. linear trend, abrupt mean and/or variability change, and hockey-stick shaped change). Our method allows not just the identification of the change point but also the manner of change, and it can provide considerable insights into land-cover trajectories. In that sense, our approach has a significant advantage over other types of change-detection methods commonly reported in the remote-sensing literature. Although we demonstrated our algorithm using annual averages for coarse resolution data, our method can be easily adapted to finer spatial or temporal scale data, assuming assumptions of normality and independence are met. Overall, the changes detected by the algorithm are consistent with changes observed by other authors for the East Africa study area. We have demonstrated a powerful new tool for the detection of land-cover change using multi-temporal satellite data.";"Kim, Dong-Yun

Spatial and landscape planning can help create alternative urban patterns protecting ecosystems and thus supporting the provision of needed services they provide. While many approaches exist to make the values of nature explicit, new tools are needed to interpret the vast quantity of information in an integrated assessment to support planning. In this study, we present a new spatial decision support tool PALM (âPotential Allocation of urban development areas for sustainable Land Managementâ) aimed at supporting the allocation of urban development zones. A GIS-based MCDA approach was integrated into a web-based platform that allows distributing a requested amount of urban development areas within a selected perimeter based on ecosystem services and locational factors. The short running time of different user-defined scenarios allows exploring consequences and tradeoffs between decisions in an interactive way, thus making it a useful tool to support discussions in participatory planning processes. The results of the application of PALM in a case study region in Switzerland show that integrating ecosystem services when distributing urban development areas is particularly effective in urban peripheries, where building zones are shifted towards urban centers securing the productive soils located around cities. This shift of building zones from the urban peripheries to the urban centers when considering ecosystem services is less pronounced in rural areas, as they provide fewer ecosystem services. However, the results also show that integrating ecosystem services in spatial planning needs to be embedded in the right policy context: Ecosystem services can only be traded-off for locational factors if the perimeter of the case study ranges across municipalities. Whereas this transparent and flexible platform offers a suitable tool at the beginning of a planning process, we also discuss further development needs.";"GrÃªt-Regamey, Adrienne

Such surveys are time consuming, demanding of expertise, and expensive to perform and interpret. Approaches to make survey efforts simpler or more effective would be valuable. In particular, it would be good to be able to easily identify areas of old-growth forest. The average density of the wood of a tree species is closely linked to its successional status. We used tree inventory data from eastern Borneo to determine whether wood density can be used to quantify forest disturbance and conservation importance. The average density of wood in a plot was significantly and negatively related to disturbance levels, with plots with higher wood densities occurring almost exclusively in old-growth forests. Average wood density was unimodally related to the diversity of tree species, indicating that the average wood density in a plot might be a better indicator of old-growth forest than species diversity. In addition, Borneo endemics had significantly heavier wood than species that are common throughout the Malesian region, and they were more common in plots with higher average wood density. We concluded that wood density at the plot level could be a powerful tool for identifying areas of conservation priority in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia.";"SLIK, J.W. FERRY

The outflow from these sources is very changeable and depends strongly on weather conditions, in particular precipitation. Therefore, it is very difficult to measure the runoff from those sources. This study presents a possibility of forecasting the pollution by main nutrients based on the land cover within the watersheds. It offers an option of using landscape metrics to identify the areas designed to protect waters against nitrate pollution by agriculture, or to locate the sampling sites. As many as 59 water quality indices were analysed for 259 measurement sites located on the rivers in the Warta basin (Poland). Next, an analysis of the land cover structure was performed for the watersheds located upstream of the measurement sites. As many as 14 landscape indices – measuring the composition and configuration in each watershed – were calculated using Fragstats 3.3.

"AGRIS:US201600190794";"Synergistic effects of climate and land-use change on representation of African bats in priority conservation areas";"";"Bats are considered important bioindicators and deliver key ecosystem services to humans. However, it is not clear how the individual and combined effects of climate change and land-use change will affect their conservation in the future. We used a spatial conservation prioritization framework to determine future shifts in the priority areas for the conservation of 169 bat species under projected climate and land-use change scenarios across Africa. Specifically, we modelled species distribution models under four different climate change scenarios at the 2050 horizon. We used land-use change scenarios within the spatial conservation prioritization framework to assess habitat quality in areas where bats may shift their distributions. Overall, batsâ representation within already existing protected areas in Africa was low (â¼5% of their suitable habitat in protected areas which cover â¼7% of Africa). Accounting for future land-use change resulted in the largest shift in spatial priority areas for conservation actions, and species representation within priority areas for conservation actions decreased by â¼9%. A large proportion of spatial conservation priorities will shift from forested areas with little disturbance under present conditions to agricultural areas in the future. Planning land use to reduce impacts on bats in priority areas outside protected areas where bats will be shifting their ranges in the future is crucial to enhance their conservation and maintain the important ecosystem services they provide to humans.";"Smith, Alain

"AGRIS:US201500162989";"Linking biotopes to invertebrates in rivers: Biological traits, taxonomic composition and diversity";"";"There is a long tradition of river monitoring using taxonomy-based metrics to assess environmental quality in Europe via benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A promising alternative is the use of their species life-history traits. Both methods (taxonomy-based and trait-based), however, have relied on the time-consuming identification of taxa. River biotopes, (i.e. 1–100m² ‘habitats’ with associated species assemblages), have long been seen as a useful and meaningful way of linking the ecology of macroinvertebrates and river hydro-morphology and can be used to assess hydro-morphological degradation in rivers. However, between-river taxonomic differences, especially at large spatial scale, had prevented a general test of this concept until now. The species trait approach may overcome this obstacle across broad geographical areas, using biotopes as the hydro-morphological units which have characteristic species trait assemblages. We collected macroinvertebrate data from discrete 512 patches, comprising 13 river biotopes, from seven rivers in England and Wales. The aim was to test whether river biotopes were better predictors of macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition (genera, families, orders) in rivers, independently of the phylogenetic effects and catchment scale characteristics (i.e. hydrology, geography and land cover). We also tested whether species richness and diversity were better related to biotopes than to rivers. River biotopes explained 40% of the variance in macroinvertebrate trait profiles across the rivers, largely independently of catchment characteristics. There was a strong phylogenetic signature, however. River biotopes were better at predicting macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition across rivers, whatever the taxonomic resolution. River biotopes were better than river identity at explaining the variability in taxonomic richness and diversity (40% and ≤10%, respectively). Detailed trait-biotope associations agreed with independent a priori predictions relating trait categories to near river bed flows. Hence, species traits provided a much needed mechanistic understanding and predictive ability across a broad geographical area. We show that integration of the multiple biological trait approach with river biotopes at the interface between ecology and hydro-morphology provides a wealth of new information and potential applications for river science and management.";"Demars, Benoît O.L.

According to the concept of SOC saturation, the ability of SOC to increase with C input decreases as SOC increases and approaches a SOC saturation level. In a 12‐year experiment, six semi‐arid cropping systems characterized by different rates of C input to soil were compared for ability to sequester SOC, SOC saturation level, and the time necessary to reach the SOC saturation level. SOC stocks, soil aggregate sizes, and C inputs were measured in durum wheat monocropping with (Ws) and without (W) return of aboveground residue to the soil and in the following cropping systems without return of aboveground residue to soil: durum wheat/fallow (Wfall), durum wheat/berseem clover, durum wheat/barley/faba bean, and durum wheat/Hedysarum coronarium. The C sequestration rate and SOC content were lowest in Wfall plots but did not differ among the other cropping systems. The C sequestration rate ranged from 0.47 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in Ws plots to 0.66 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ in W plots but was negative (−0.06 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹) in Wfall plots. Increases in SOC were related to C input up to a SOC saturation value; over this value, further C inputs did not lead to SOC increase. Across all cropping systems, the C saturation value for the experimental soil was 57.7 Mg ha⁻¹, which was reached with a cumulative C input of 15 Mg ha⁻¹.

However, enclosure benefits cannot be generalized as there are variations across dryland ecosystems and societies. This study assessed the qualitative and quantitative benefits derived from rehabilitating degraded rangelands using private enclosures in Chepareria, West Pokot County, Kenya. Dry‐season grazing reserves, healthier livestock, improved livestock productivity, easier livestock management, food security, reduced animal losses, ecosystem services, land ownership, independence and improved standard of living were the main qualitative benefits from private enclosures identified. Quantitative benefits were manifested through various enclosure enterprise combinations, sale of enclosure marketable products and adoption of alternative income generating activities. They included the sale of livestock and livestock products, maize, wood cutting, grass cuttings, contractual grazing, grass seeds, poultry products, fruits and honey, amongst others. Livestock production directly accounts for 42·4% of the total enclosure income and is the main source of livelihood in Chepareria. There was a significant trend of increasing total enclosure income with enclosure acreage (p ≤ 0·05) while enclosure age was insignificant. Enclosures cushion households against climatic shocks such as drought by providing additional flexibility in land, fodder, livestock management and the uptake of various income generating activities. We conclude that enclosures have the potential of contributing to resilience as attested from the benefits reported in this study. However, private enclosure tradeoffs such income differentiation, reduced communal land and conflict have implications on how the ecological and socio‐economic aspects may be impacted as the establishment of private enclosures in Chepareria continues.

In Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs), the change ofpolitical and economic regime virtually tore into the agriculture in beginning of 1990s, destroying the existing structure of land estates by the privatization, restitutions or restoration of ownership rights resulting in fragmentation of land ownership. Over the past 10-15 years this situation has not undergone any fundamental changes. Due to economic and political situation in the transition countries market forces can not function as primary engine for land consolidation. For that very reason the land-estate policy is of outmost importance nowadays in these countries. The main goal of this paper is to show the process of agricultural reformsdriven mainly by land estate policy in connection with their outcomes in CEECs.";"Fekete-Farkas, Maria

After 1990, Romanian agricultureexperienced critical shifts in farming structures, reflected also in the production ones. Whilearable land represents 63% of the UAA, a restrictive production factor in developing acompetitive agriculture resides in the fact that 61.7% of total arable land is utilized in excessivelyfragmented family farms  14303 thousands plots. This is seriously hampering family farmsproductivity, if we take into account that they are producing an estimated 74% of the total cropoutput of the sector level (2004). Under the present conditions, the agricultural producers actunder two major objective restrictions: (i) integration of the Romanian agriculture into Europeanstructures, under the implementation of the 2007-2013 CAP reform; (ii) the relative lowpossibilities for backing up the financial support received through different EU-funded programs.The present study tries to assess the evolution of the Romanian farm structures during transition,together with the policies aiming to land ownership and consolidation, by analysing the maindeterminants of the changes, the expectations, the successes and failures, as well as to appraisethe problems encumbering the further restructuring process, given the need for successfullycompeting in the EU Single Market.";"Turtoi, Crina Sinziana

"AGRIS:US201500204753";"integrated GIS-based interval-probabilistic programming model for land-use planning management under uncertainty—a case study at Suzhou, China";"";"A large number of mathematical models have been developed for supporting optimization of land-use allocation; however, few of them simultaneously consider land suitability (e.g., physical features and spatial information) and various uncertainties existing in many factors (e.g., land availabilities, land demands, land-use patterns, and ecological requirements). This paper incorporates geographic information system (GIS) technology into interval-probabilistic programming (IPP) for land-use planning management (IPP-LUPM). GIS is utilized to assemble data for the aggregated land-use alternatives, and IPP is developed for tackling uncertainties presented as discrete intervals and probability distribution. Based on GIS, the suitability maps of different land users are provided by the outcomes of land suitability assessment and spatial analysis. The maximum area of every type of land use obtained from the suitability maps, as well as various objectives/constraints (i.e., land supply, land demand of socioeconomic development, future development strategies, and environmental capacity), is used as input data for the optimization of land-use areas with IPP-LUPM model. The proposed model not only considers the outcomes of land suitability evaluation (i.e., topography, ground conditions, hydrology, and spatial location) but also involves economic factors, food security, and eco-environmental constraints, which can effectively reflect various interrelations among different aspects in a land-use planning management system. The case study results at Suzhou, China, demonstrate that the model can help to examine the reliability of satisfying (or risk of violating) system constraints under uncertainty. Moreover, it may identify the quantitative relationship between land suitability and system benefits. Willingness to arrange the land areas based on the condition of highly suitable land will not only reduce the potential conflicts on the environmental system but also lead to a lower economic benefit. However, a strong desire to develop lower suitable land areas will bring not only a higher economic benefit but also higher risks of violating environmental and ecological constraints. The land manager should make decisions through trade-offs between economic objectives and environmental/ecological objectives.";"Lu, Shasha

To reduce the casualty and damages, an effective and accurate method of assessing landslide susceptibility is necessary. Object-based data mining methods were applied to a case study of landslide susceptibility assessment on the Guojiaba Town of the Three Gorges. The study area was partitioned into object mapping units derived from 30� m resolution Landsat TM images using multi-resolution segmentation algorithm based on the landslide factors of engineering rock group, homogeneity, and reservoir water level. Landslide locations were determined by interpretation of Landsat TM images and extensive field surveys. Eleven primary landslide-related factors were extracted from the topographic and geologic maps, and satellite images. Those factors were selected as independent variables using significance testing and correlation coefficient analysis, including slope, profile curvature, engineering rock group, slope structure, distance from faults, land cover, tasseled cap transformation wetness index, reservoir water level, homogeneity, and first and second principal components of the images. Decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) models with the optimal parameters were trained and then used to map landslide susceptibility, respectively. The analytical results were validated by comparing them with known landslides using the success rate and prediction rate curves and classification accuracy. The object-based SVM model has the highest correct rate of 89.36� % and a kappa coefficient of 0.8286 and outperforms the pixel-based SVM, object-based C5.0, and pixel-based SVM models.";"Wu, Xueling

These landscapes, characterized by intermixed land use and indefinite boundaries, require particular attention in applying the patch-corridor-matrix model when classifying patches and their delineation. In a case study area in southeast Portugal, mainly characterized by agro-silvo pastoral systems, the land cover for 1990 has been mapped. The paper discusses the consequences of the complexity of some Mediterranean land use systems for land cover mapping dealing with detailed landscape dynamics. Within this scope a land cover mapping project in a small case study area is compared with the mapping undertaken within a national land cover database. Both studies were carried out on the same scale and through visual interpretation of aerial photographs. Differences in land cover classification and allocation are explored using matrix with levels of agreement. Recommendations for future land cover mapping projects are: the application of fuzzy approaches to land cover mapping in agro-silvo-pastoral landscapes should be explored and land cover classifications should be standardized in order to enhance consistency between databases. On the other hand, the fuzziness of the boundaries in this kind of landscapes is inherent to the system and should be accepted as such. The accompanying uncertainties should be taken into account when undertaking landscape analysis on the basis of land cover data.";"Doorn, Anne M. van

Currently there is a general lack of methodology for examining the relationship between land surface temperatures (LST) derived from TIR data and landscape patterns extracted from optical sensors. A separation of landscapes into values directly related to their scale and signature is a key step. In this study, a Landsat ETM+ image of Indianapolis, Unites States, acquired on June 22, 2000, was spectrally unmixed (using spectral mixture analysis, SMA) into fraction endmembers of green vegetation, soil, high albedo, and low albedo. Impervious surface was then computed from the high and low albedo images. A hybrid classification procedure was developed to classify the fraction images into seven land use and land cover (LULC) classes. Using the fractional images, the landscape composition and pattern were examined. Next, pixel-based LST measurements were correlated with the landscape fractional components to investigate LULC based relationships between LST and impervious surface and green vegetation fractions. An examination of the relationship between the LULC and LST maps with landscape metrics was finally conducted to deepen understanding of their interactions. Results indicate that SMA-derived fraction images were effective for quantifying the urban morphology and for providing reliable measurements of biophysical variables. LST was found to be positively correlated with impervious surface fraction but negatively correlated with green vegetation fraction. Each temperature zone was associated with a dominant LULC category. Further research should be directed to the theoretical and applied implications of describing such relationships between LULC patterns and urban thermal conditions.";"Weng, Qihao

This study shows an approach to use ecohydrological modelling results for assessing water-related ecosystem services in three lowland river basins in Western Siberia. Based on the results of the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, Arnold et al., 1998), simulated output variables were used as indicators for the two regulating services water flow regulation and erosion regulation. The model results were translated into a relative ecosystem service valuation scale, which facilitates the comparison of different ecosystem services and which serves as the base for the applied mapping approach. The ecosystem service maps show different spatial and seasonal patterns. Although the daily modelling results were aggregated to seasonal maps to generate an understandable amount of information for stakeholders, differences can be depicted: during snowmelt, low regulation can be determined, especially for water flow regulation, but a very high regulation was calculated for the vegetation period during summer and for the winter period. Erosion regulation is high in two basins during all seasons. Spatio-temporal differences were modelled only for the largest basin. The SWAT model serves as a suitable quantification method for the assessment of the selected water-related regulating services.";"Schmalz, B.

To explore the forces driving the construction of greenbelts, this paper examines how past land use and land cover decisions and current socioeconomic factors have affected the development of the artificial greenbelt zone in China’s Shanghai metropolitan area. Using aerial photographs from 1994, 2005, and 2010, we find that the area of afforested greenbelt was generally related to past land use/cover decisions. Compared with cropland and grassland, factory, village, and urban land use/cover types showed higher resistance to transitioning to forest during the study period. Moreover, the Mantel test showed little spatial autocorrelation between protected land and geodetic coordinates. Principal coordinates of neighbour matrices analysis showed that socioeconomic and urban contextual variables explained 9 % of the variation in protected land, whereas the spatial variables explained 24 %. Population migration towards the city’s suburban fringes negatively affected the greenbelt area, while district-level finance revenue was a positive factor and town/sub-district-level gross domestic product was a negative factor, depending on the investment sources for greenbelt construction. Furthermore, distance to the sub-centre and distance to a subway station had positive influences. Understanding these driving forces can help improve greenbelt planning and management.";"Wang, Hong-Bing

"AGRIS:US201400152436";"Assessment of Spatiotemporal Varying Relationships Between Rainfall, Land Cover and Surface Water Area Using Geographically Weighted Regression";"";"Traditional regression techniques such as ordinary least squares (OLS) are often unable to accurately model spatially varying data and may ignore or hide local variations in model coefficients. A relatively new technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been shown to greatly improve model performance compared to OLS in terms of higher R 2 and lower corrected Akaike information criterion (AICC). GWR models have the potential to improve reliabilities of the identified relationships by reducing spatial autocorrelations and by accounting for local variations and spatial non-stationarity between dependent and independent variables. In this study, GWR was used to examine the relationship between land cover, rainfall and surface water habitat in 149 sub-catchments in a predominately agricultural region covering 2.6 million ha in southeast Australia. The application of the GWR models revealed that the relationships between land cover, rainfall and surface water habitat display significant spatial non-stationarity. GWR showed improvements over analogous OLS models in terms of higher R 2 and lower AICC. The increased explanatory power of GWR was confirmed by the results of an approximate likelihood ratio test, which showed statistically significant improvements over analogous OLS models. The models suggest that the amount of surface water area in the landscape is related to anthropogenic drainage practices enhancing runoff to facilitate intensive agriculture and increased plantation forestry. However, with some key variables not present in our analysis, the strength of this relationship could not be qualified. GWR techniques have the potential to serve as a useful tool for environmental research and management across a broad range of scales for the investigation of spatially varying relationships.";"Brown, Stuart

"AGRIS:US201400157159";"Changing climate alters inputs and pathways of mercury deposition to forested ecosystems";"";"Although land cover and meteorological conditions are known to impact mercury (Hg) deposition processes, few studies have addressed how changes in forest cover and shifting climatic conditions will impact the Hg cycle. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of forest type (hardwood vs. conifer) and meteorological variation on atmospheric Hg deposition in two forest stands in Huntington Wildlife Forest in upstate New York, USA. Mercury deposition associated with litterfall was similar between the hardwood and conifer stands, but total Hg deposition was greater in the coniferous stand due to larger throughfall Hg. Soil evasion losses of Hg were significantly higher in the hardwood plot. Although Hg deposition was greater and evasion losses were lower in the conifer plot, soil Hg pools were smaller than in the hardwood plot. Annual variability in meteorological conditions was substantial between 2009 and 2010, and changes in Hg deposition over this period appear to be related to variation in temperature and precipitation quantity. The results from this study suggest that projected increases in temperature and precipitation in the northeastern United States could alter Hg deposition and availability by decreasing litterfall Hg inputs and increasing throughfall Hg inputs.";"Blackwell, Bradley D.

This requires an integrated knowledge representation and web implementation of static land cover and change information, as well as the related operations for geo-computing. The temporal logic relations among land cover snapshots and increments were examined with a matrix-based three-step analysis. Twelve temporal logic relations were identified and five basic spatial operations were formalized with set operators, which were all used to develop algorithms for deriving implicit change information. A knowledge representation for land cover change information was then developed based on these temporal logic and operation relations. A prototype web-service system was further implemented based on OWL-DL. Both online access and conversion of land cover spatio-temporal information can be facilitated with such a web service system.";"Chen, Jun

Time-series of MODIS data capture dynamic phenomena of vegetation and its environment, and are considered as one of the most effective data sources for land cover mapping at a regional and national level. However, the time-series, multiple bands and their derivations such as NDVI constitute a large volume of data that poses a significant challenge for automated mapping of land cover while optimally utilizing the information it contains. In this study, time-series of 10-day cloud-free MODIS composites and its derivatives – NDVI and vegetation phenology information, are fully assessed to determine the optimal data sets for deriving land cover. Three groups of variable combinations of MODIS spectral information and its derived metrics are thoroughly explored to identify the optimal combinations for land cover identification using a data mining tool. The results, based on the assessment using time-series of MODIS data, show that in general using a longer time period of the time-series data and more spectral bands could lead to more accurate land cover identification than that of a shorter period of the time-series and fewer bands. However, we reveal that, with some optimal variable combinations of few bands and a shorter period of time-series data, the highest possible accuracy of land cover classification can be achieved.";"Zhou, Fuqun

"AGRIS:US201600060064";"new Likelihood Ratio for supervised classification of fully polarimetric SAR data: An application for sea ice type mapping";"";"One of the potential applications of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is the classification of land cover, such as forest canopies, vegetation, sea ice types, and urban areas. In contrast to single or dual polarized SAR systems, full polarimetric SAR systems provide more information about the physical and geometrical properties of the imaged area. This paper proposes a new Bayes risk function which can be minimized to obtain a Likelihood Ratio (LR) for the supervised classification of polarimetric SAR data. The derived Bayes risk function is based on the complex Wishart distribution. Furthermore, a new spatial criterion is incorporated with the LR classification process to produce more homogeneous classes. The application for Arctic sea ice mapping shows that the LR and the proposed spatial criterion are able to provide promising classification results. Comparison with classification results based on the Wishart classifier, the Wishart Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic (WLRTS) proposed by Conradsen et al. (2003) and the Expectation Maximization with Probabilistic Label Relaxation (EMPLR) algorithm are presented. High overall classification accuracy of selected study areas which reaches 97.8% using the LR is obtained. Combining the derived spatial criterion with the LR can improve the overall classification accuracy to reach 99.9%. In this study, fully polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 data collected over Franklin Bay, Canadian Arctic, is used.";"Dabboor, Mohammed

On the other hand, continuous maps of forest attributes are required to support strategic analyses of regional policy and management issues. We have therefore produced maps covering 4.03 Ã 10â¶ kmÂ² of inventoried forest area for the 2001 base year using standardised observations from the NFI photo plots (PP) as reference data. We used the k nearest neighbours (kNN) method with 26 geospatial data layers including MODIS spectral data and climatic and topographic variables to produce maps of 127 forest attributes at a 250 Ã 250 m resolution. The stand-level attributes include land cover, structure, and tree species relative abundance. In this article, we report only on total live aboveground tree biomass, with all other attributes covered in the supplementary data (http://nrcresearchpress.com/doi/suppl/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401). In general, deviations in predicted pixel-level values from those in a PP validation set are greater in mountainous regions and in areas with either low biomass or sparse PP sampling. Predicted pixel-level values are overestimated at small observed values and underestimated at large ones. Accuracy measures are improved through the spatial aggregation of pixels to 1 kmÂ² and beyond. Overall, these new products provide unique baseline information for strategic-level analyses of forests (https://nfi.nfis.org).";"Beaudoin, A.

Aims To describe changes in arable land-use intensity and land use in lowlands and at higher altitudes from 1982 to 2000 focusing on changes around 1990 when agricultural intensity declined and to test how these changes affected farmland bird populations. Methods Population trends for 24 species in lowlands (areas up to 300 m a.s.l.) and at higher altitudes (300–600 m a.s.l.) were calculated for time periods 1982–1990 and 1990–2000. Per hectare cereal yield represented a measure of arable land-use intensity and Corine Land Cover together with harvested area of cereals indicated land-use changes. Annual population growth rate of particular bird species was related to agricultural indicators. Results In lowlands, arable land-use intensity declined after 1990, but this did not result in a lower decline of birds. At higher altitudes, arable land-use intensity did not change, but considerable areas of arable land were converted into pastures. This change was related to population improvement for two species and deterioration for three species. Conclusion Trends in farmland bird populations in the Czech Republic were more likely driven by the arable land conversion to pastures rather than by changes in the arable land-use intensity.";"Hanzelka, Jan

"AGRIS:US201301921914";"impacts of global change in the humid tropics: selected rainfall-runoff issues linked with tropical forest-land management";"";"Within the framework of IWRM, a major concern in the humid tropics is the effects of ‘global warming' on the storm rainfall-runoff hydrology of both forests and converted forest lands. Further how such effects need to be incorporated within adaptive, forest-water-land management. But since the mid- 20th century, dramatic changes in land- use (LU) and land cover (LC) have also occurred which have led to rapid rates of deforestation and an expansion of land--forest degradation. How much these man-induced impacts have been influential on climate -water relations, as against the effects of inherent climate variability and predicted climate change scenarios, still remains a major challenge to quantify. Thus embedded within the global warming issue are these additional LU/LC change impacts on climate-rainfall-storm runoff across scales which also require consideration under the broader mandate of ‘global change'. The work will initially succinctly summarize the existing uncertainties linked with both Global Climate Models (GCMs). Subsequently more detailed attention will be given to uncertainties linked with LC/LU change. The experiences of hurricane Mitch in Central America will then set the scene for an alternative strategy. A principle message is a call for more concentrated research effort on geographically the outer margins of the ‘maritime continent' (centred on the Indonesian Archipelago) in the Western Pacific where tropical cyclone frequency is very high. This region presents a diversity of socio-economies and an opportunity to produce adapted forest-land management measures in preparation for future global change (warming and anthropogenic). Such measures can then be extrapolated to currently less frequently, affected areas from extreme events like hurricane Mitch. Examples from research in the tropical- cyclone prone, “Wet Tropics” of northeast Australia linked with the management of tropical rainforests and the adjoining sugar cane lands are then used to demonstrate these opportunities.";"Bonell, Mike";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"deforestation;land cover;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS;013";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301921914";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10795-010-9104-8";"";"";"";"279-325"

The evaluation is performed using different sets of fused and combined data. This article also proposes to apply the principal component (PC) technique to the multipolarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR), prior to the optical and radar data PC fusion process, aiming at the use of all available polarized information in the fusion process. Although the fused images improve the visual interpretation of the land use classes, the best results are achieved with the simple combination of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/phased array L-Band SAR (PALSAR) with the LANDSAT5/Thematic Mapper (TM) images. Radar information is found to be particularly useful for improving the user accuracies (UAs) of Soybean with 40 days after seeding (an increase of about 55%), Dirty Pasture (22%), Degraded Forest and Regeneration (5%), and the producer accuracies (PAs) of Clean Pasture (39%), Fallow Agriculture (16%), Degraded Forest and Regeneration (3%), and Primary Forest (2%). Information from the HH (horizontal transmit and horizontal receive) polarization contributes more than that from HV (horizontal transmit and vertical receive) polarization to discriminate the classes, although the use of both polarizations produces results that are statistically better than those obtained with a single polarization.";"Pereira, Luciana de Oliveira

"AGRIS:US201500210918";"Validating the geometric accuracy of high spatial resolution multispectral satellite data";"";"Uses of high spatial resolution data obtained from satellite-based sensors include creating land cover maps, deriving large-scale quantitative assessments such as vegetation indices, and visually assessing an area for qualitative information only assessable from large-scale digital data. One of the more popular uses of high spatial resolution data is to use the image as a base map for on-screen digitizing spatially dependent vector products. Since most geographic information system (GIS) databases store a variety of current and historical data, the accuracy of any on-screen digitized product is dependent on the spatial accuracy of the reference data. Therefore, it is important to understand and validate the accuracy of data used to create spatially referenced product, even though the data come with high spatial resolution. One of the more popular and historical high spatial resolution data within most GIS labs is QuickBird's multispectral data at 2.44 × 2.44 m ². Although there are current sensors available with a higher spatial resolution, the sometimes prohibitive expense of obtaining high spatial resolution data necessitates the need to utilize and assess historic data. Since the QuickBird has been the mainstay of high spatial resolution data since 2001, understanding the geometric accuracy of the DigitalGlobe's QuickBird user-defined panchromatic and multispectral image bundle product remains relevant. In this study, we assessed the positional accuracy of this product for its utility as an “off the shelf” base map for creating other spatially referenced products. The average Euclidean distance, RMSE (root mean square error), and RSME (root square mean error) between QuickBird-identified Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates and coincident in situ GPS-collected UTM coordinates were calculated at 33 systematically selected locations throughout the city of Nacogdoches, Texas, USA. The average Euclidean distance, RMSE, and RSME between QuickBird's projected UTM coordinates and its corresponding GPS-collected UTM coordinates measured at 5.34 meters, 5.79 meters, and 4.05 meters, respectively. They were well within DigitalGlobe's stated RMSE positional accuracy of 14.0 meters for a panchromatic and multispectral QuickBird image bundle.";"Unger, Daniel R.

Drawing on the findings of an interdisciplinary study examining how farm management practices impact on the loss of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) and potential pathogens from land to water, the paper argues that the overwhelming focus on integration at the catchment level may risk ignoring the sub-catchment as an equally appropriate unit of hydrological analysis. Further the paper suggests that many of the management decisions relevant to water quality are made by land occupiers and, therefore, that the identification of relevant socio-spatial units – the ‘private spaces’ of land holdings – may be as important or more important to the effective management and planning of water resources as catchment-level planning.";"Winter, Michael

Remotely sensed land cover data are widely used in intelligent areal interpolation methods to solve this problem. This article examines the usefulness of different publicly available remotely sensed land cover data sets as ancillary data used in conjunction with different areal interpolation methods. Two land cover data sets were compiled at the national scale; one by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (the National Land Cover Dataset or NLCD) and one by the Coastal Change Analysis Program. A third land cover data set was compiled at a regional scale for the state of Connecticut by the Center for Land Use Education and Research. Results show that for areal interpolation, greater detail in the classification of developed areas was important whether the data were developed for use at a national or a regional scale. Even more important is the further enhancement of remotely sensed land use categories by incorporating local road or parcel data layers. The worst performing interpolation method using enhanced remote sensing-derived land cover data produced more accurate results than the best performing method using only the original land cover data. The results also show that parcels produce better enhancements than road buffers because they remove the areas of the roads themselves from population consideration.";"Lin, Jie

In addition to problems arising from unsustainable land use, water resource availability driven in part by climatic forcing is also a threat to livelihoods in this region. To understand climate impacts on farming practice in poor areas of China, field observation and village reconnaissance took place in the summer of 2009 in three selected counties of Shaanxi and Ningxia Province, northern China. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with householders in rural communities aiming to explore the impacts of recent climate and environmental changes and the role of land management practices on individual and community livelihood incomes as well as individual understanding and engagement with these concepts. The findings were complemented with secondary agricultural, economic and climatic data from the study regions. Respondents argued that land conversion programmes improved income potential, sustainability of livestock grazing and environmental quality in the region. However, water availability was thought to increasingly limit agriculture and human wellbeing in some of the regions with water resources becoming notably scarcer. Understanding of climate change as a concept varied amongst farmers potentially hampering the ability to adapt existing farming practices to maximise livelihood incomes sustainably. Positive effects of the government's land management schemes were unevenly distributed within villages and amongst regions, often linked to a lack of knowledge transfer and shared resources resulting in marginalised households and/or communities. Off-farm labour (in many cases relating to young adult rural to urban migration) appears a crucial source of income for households in the study region. Respondents in Ningxia expressed reservations about the future prospect of productive farming if the water availability continued to diminish.";"Sjögersten, S.

This approach leads to a role-playing game designed by a pluridisciplinary workgroup (researchers and reserve manager), used as management support and as a tool to help people regarding the stakes of sustainable development. For several years, Ushant Island (Brittany, France) was in the process of social and environmental restructuration due to land-use and land-cover changes. Major land-use changes resulted in fallow land encroachment and its consequences on landscape, traditional activities and biodiversity. This situation raises the question as to the different types of actors (stakeholders, scientists, local population) in relation to the future and the consequences of individual actions on common good. The stakes of sustainable development are set. In this study, the transdisciplinary process leads to a geographical agent-based model, simulations and a role-playing game. The role-playing game, final step of our companion modelling approach, is developed in order to assist the awareness raising and the involvement of all, be they elected representatives or not. This contribution describes the steps which led to the role-playing game design, the contents of the play sessions, their results and prospects in terms of learning tools.

By ignoring the domestic component of carbon leakage, the literature can either overestimate or underestimate leakage, depending on the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator of the leakage formulas. Unlike the literature, we include the land and agricultural markets in the analysis of carbon leakage with forestation policies. In this model, carbon leakage depends on: (1) supply and demand elasticities of timber production and consumption, respectively in the country introducing a RED policy (Home country) and in the rest of the world; (2) Home country’s production and consumption share in the world timber production and consumption, respectively; (3) prices of land and crop products in the Home country and the rest of the world; (4) initial allocation of land between forestry and agriculture; (5) share of total forest area  set aside under RED; and (6) relative carbon sequestration potential of the forest planted on an afforested land and of the forest withdrawn from timber harvest. These potentials depend heavily on the forest species as well as on timing of the policy, and on the discount rate and time path of increasing carbon prices.";"de Gorter, Harry

However, little if any empirical research has been conducted on the effectiveness of this land use policy in terms of reducing actual damage caused by floods. Our study addresses this issue by statistically examining the performance of open space dedicated for flood mitigation purposes across a nationally representative sample of local jurisdictions. We measure the amount of open space protection designated under FEMA's Community Rating System (CRS) program for 450 local communities, and then test the degree to which this strategy reduces insured flood damages over an eleven-year period from 1999 to 2009. Results indicate that, even when controlling for environmental, socioeconomic, and policy-related variables, open space protection is an important land use planning tool for mitigating the adverse impacts of flood events in the U.S. Our findings provide insights for local planners and decision makers interested in pursuing an avoidance strategy of flood mitigation, where people and structures are essentially removed from the most vulnerable locations.";"Brody, Samuel D.

Because projections of climatic changes and their environmental and societal impacts in local settings are uncertain, policies to reduce vulnerability and strengthen adaptation should be informed by ongoing processes in sites already exposed to climatic variability and change. This paper examines vulnerability to hydrological change in Northern Ecuador and shows how access to irrigation water mediates the ability of different groups of farmers to adapt. We argue that present vulnerabilities need to be understood in the context of the history of resource rights distribution in the area and that agricultural adaptation would be aided by a reform of current water rights, allowing water resources to be more equitably distributed.";"Skarbø, Kristine

"AGRIS:US201300807762";"Regression Techniques for Examining Land Use/Cover Change: A Case Study of a Mediterranean Landscape";"";"In many areas of the northern Mediterranean Basin the abundance of forest and scrubland vegetation is increasing, commensurate with decreases in agricultural land use(s). Much of the land use/cover change (LUCC) in this region is associated with the marginalization of traditional agricultural practices due to ongoing socioeconomic shifts and subsequent ecological change. Regression-based models of LUCC have two purposes: (i) to aid explanation of the processes driving change and/or (ii) spatial projection of the changes themselves. The independent variables contained in the single 'best' regression model (that is, that which minimizes variation in the dependent variable) cannot be inferred as providing the strongest causal relationship with the dependent variable. Here, we examine the utility of hierarchical partitioning and multinomial regression models for, respectively, explanation and prediction of LUCC in EU Special Protection Area 56, 'Encinares del río Alberche y Cofio' (SPA 56) near Madrid, Spain. Hierarchical partitioning estimates the contribution of regression model variables, both independently and in conjunction with other variables in a model, to the total variance explained by that model and is a tool to isolate important causal variables. By using hierarchical partitioning we find that the combined effects of factors driving land cover transitions varies with land cover classification, with a coarser classification reducing explained variance in LUCC. We use multinomial logistic regression models solely for projecting change, finding that accuracies of maps produced vary by land cover classification and are influenced by differing spatial resolutions of socioeconomic and biophysical data. When examining LUCC in human-dominated landscapes such as those of the Mediterranean Basin, the availability and analysis of spatial data at scales that match causal processes is vital to the performance of the statistical modelling techniques used here.";"Millington, James D.

The selected municipalities are: Medicina, Borgo Tossignano and Castel del Rio, which represent the main territorial aspects of the Nuovo Circondario Imolese.The land use transformations are quantified through the GIS comparison of the land use maps of the years 1995, 1976, 1994 and 2003. The corresponding legends are transformed into the five categories of the first level CORINE Land Cover classes. The naturalness increases in the three territories throughout the period 1955-2003, but with different quantitative importance: limited for the territory of Medicina and progressively increasing from Borgo Tossignano to Castel del Rio. Urban areas increase too, but following a gradient opposite to the one concerning naturalness. The land use transformations in the Nuovo circondario imolese are similar to the trends reported for the same period in Italy as a whole and in many other European countries. Concerning the effects of land use transformations on the territory naturalness and biodiversity, our results highlight the critical state of the intensively used areas and the marginal areas.

"AGRIS:US2016220429";"Global Implications of U.S. Biofuels Policies in an Integrated Partial and General Equilibrium Framework";"";"With the increasing research interests in biofuels, global implications of biofuels production have been generally examined either in a partial equilibrium (PE) or general equilibrium (GE) frameworks. Though both of these approaches have unique strengths, they also suffer from many limitations due to complexity of addressing all the relevant aspects of biofuels. In this paper we have exploited the strengths of both PE and GE approaches for analyzing the economic and environmental implications of the U.S. policies on corn-ethanol and biodiesel production. In this study, we utilize the Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model (FASOMGHG: Adams et al. 1996, 2005; Beach et al. 2009), a non-linear programming, PE model for the United States. We also use the GTAP-BIO model (Birur et al. 2008), a multi-region, multi-sector CGE model for global-scale assessment of biofuels policies. Following Britz and Hertel (2009), we link the GTAP-BIO model through a static, quadratic restricted revenue function obtained from perturbing crop prices from the FASOMGHG model. With this linkage we implement the U.S. Corn ethanol and biodiesel scenarios in the GTAP-BIO model and obtain the FASOMGHG-consistent, global land use changes. The resulting crop price changes from the GE model are fed back into the FASOMGHG model to obtain the disaggregated impacts in the U.S.";"Birur, Dileep K.

Part of Nizamabad District of Andhra Pradesh State in India is considered for developing and testing the methods developed. First the study area is stratified as a pre-field work exercise for a focused land use analysis. Stratification of the land into categories on the basis of land use analysis objectives, such as crop management improvement, crop selection and conservation helped focus on these distinct areas with different analysis requirements. The relations between _land_ as a biophysical factor and its _use_ as a socio-economic factor were analysed using GIS techniques to spatially differentiate these categories. Two categories viz., Crop Management Improvement and Crop Selection were analysed further. Identifying yield-limiting factors in support of planning and extension agencies is the focus of study in areas identified for Crop Management Improvement. While traditional yield gap studies compared yields at research stations and in farmers_ fields, we considered yield variability among farmers_ fields in similar socio-economic and environmental conditions. In this situation, the yield gaps are mainly due to differences in management practices. What if?- scenarios, generated using the multiple goal optimisation modelling tool, were integrated with a stakeholder communication matrix (SCM) in the Crop Selection areas. SCM indicates the level of communication and information-sharing among key stakeholders in the district. The multiple goal model considered the aspirations of various stakeholders and the matrix presented the communication and information-sharing dynamics, understanding of which is essential for participatory land use analysis. Integration of the goal model with the SCM allowed identification of the possible bottlenecks in the implementation of the model results, allowing resource managers to initiate curative measures where required. Fuzzy modelling of farmers_ perceptions of land suitability emphasised the need for biophysical planners to consider the views of farmers while formulating land viii use options. The preference of farmers for crops was based on variables such as cropping season, soils and water availability. The study explores similarities and contrasts in the way scientists and farmers perceive land suitability.";"Nidumolu, U.B.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"land use;geographical information systems";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=NL2005740201";"http://www.library.wur.nl/wda/dissertations/dis3667.pdf";"";"";"";""

Az ökológiai termelést végző vállalkozások nagy része jó adottságokkal rendelkező nagygazdaság, amelyek párhuzamos termelést folytatnak, és olyan elkötelezett kisvállalkozás, amelyek gazdasági súlya nem jelentős.

A sertés szerepe nem nagy. Az ökológiai állattartásba vont állatok száma az ország állatállományához képest szinte jelentéktelen. Az ökológiai gazdálkodásban olcsóbb takarmányt előállítani, mint állatot tenyészteni, ezért a hazai számosállatlétszám nem jelentős, így a talajok szerves trágyával való ellátása kérdésessé válik. A hazai ökológiai gazdálkodás exportközpontú, a hazai piac szűk. A termelők többsége a német nyelvterületű országok (Ausztria, Németország, Svájc) részére termelt. Stabil piaci kapcsolatok nem minden esetben alakultak ki, mivel a hazai termékek többsége feldolgozatlan gabonafélékből és takarmányokból áll, amelyek könnyen helyettesíthetők.

Since 2004 the number of farms and the growth rate of the size of organic farm land have decreased, followed by recession. The majority of organic farms are either big farms with good quality lands and managing parallel production or committed small farms with insignificant economic impact. Some farmers retooled their bad quality lands to organic production in order to receive subsidies. The ratio of grass (53.6%) is higher and that of arable land (26.4%) is lower than in agricultural production. Grass lands are easily converted to organic land but their economic value is not significant. In crop structure, cereals (49.8%), oil plants (19.3%), and fodder plants (26.4%) are dominant. Like the agricultural production characteristic of Hungary, cereals and oil plants have the greatest economic importance in crop structure. Cattle and sheep are significant in animal husbandry. The role of pork is not great. The production of fodder plants is cheaper than animal husbandry, therefore the number of livestock is not significant. As a result, the necessary supply of organic dung for soils becomes doubtful. Hungarian organic farming is export oriented and the domestic market is small. The majority of organic farmers produce for German-speaking countries (Germany, Switzerland, and Austria). Few stable partner relationships were established in the organic trade, because the majority of export products consist of unprocessed cereals and fodder plants which can be easily substituted. The ratio of processed, “hungaricum” products is insignificant in the product structure.

Key Motivators in Decision Making";"";"When communicating with farmers and ranchers, land conservation professionals would be better equipped if they understood key influences on their target audience's decisions to permanently preserve their land from development. This study predicted key factors influencing rancher engagement in a conservation easement (CE) agreement. Specifically, theory of planned behavior, trust, environmental identity, past behavior, perceptions of specific CE characteristics and selected participant demographics were used as predictors. A mixed-methods approach was applied involving interviews, a two-phase pilot study, and a statewide mail-administered questionnaire. Final interview domains guided the quantitative survey instrument, which was administered to 1,000 Florida cattle ranchers. A 60% response rate was received. Multiple linear regression demonstrated ranchers were more likely to enter into a CE agreement if they 1) had a positive attitude about the outcomes associated with CEs; 2) felt influential others would positively support CEs; 3) indicated higher trust in conservation organizations and agencies; 4) believed their land had significant conservation value; 5) supported sale or donation of certain property rights; and 6) were positively influenced by financial incentives, primarily estate tax deductions. These six variables explained over 50% of intent to engage in a CE agreement. Understanding these influences will aid land conservationists in their future communication efforts with farmers and ranchers.";"Brain, Roslynn G.

It is an area which has undergone a great anthropic agricultural impact after the II World War, but, however, still has natural settings worth preserving, as can be seen by the presence of seven Sites of Community Interest (sensu Habitat Directive 92/43/EC). For the analyses of the land cover changes, geo-databases were consulted or specially constructed. The aerial photographs from GAI 1954-55 flight, appropriately georectified, and the aerial photograph ITA2000 and AGEA 2004 flights were adopted to draw up the land use/cover maps at a scale of 1.10.000.The study of vegetation was performed using the phytosociological method. In brief, the results show that the landscape of the study area has become more fragmented due mostly to effects of continuous human disturbances and agricultural improvement during the study period. Overall, the landscape is today characterised by the predominance of agricultural use and the sparse colonization of the natural vegetation, mainly by linear vegetational formations (mainly riparian woods).";"Piera Di Marzio

Land use is the results of various socioeconomic activities taking place at various urban and regional setups. In this paper, landscape dynamic characteristics are investigated by using remote sensing and geographic information system in mountainous watershed of Abha, Saudi Arabia. Land use classes were mapped and assessed from a time series of maps of year 2000–2010. The LULC transformations were also analyzed according to elevation and slope. Assessment of the data shows that LULC had undergone substantial changes in this semi-arid mountainous watershed from 2000 to 2010. During this period, the sparse vegetation and water bodies decreased from 48.47 to 39.31 km²and 0.30 to 0.11 km², respectively, whereas build-up area increased from 17.02 to 36.36 km². The area under water bodies has reduced due to construction activities, disturbance in drainage network, and sedimentation in the watershed. The areas having high altitudes were exposed to changes in landscape characteristic. In the regions having lower altitude (1,950–2,350), an agricultural land has decreased, whereas build-up land has increased. As a result of rough structure, only small flat areas, located in this sections and valley channels, may be used as build-up land. Slope gradient had also an influence on the distribution of LULC. The assessment of land use and land cover type distribution by slope category provided the baseline for the implementation of the nationwide land conservation policy of conversion of agricultural land to forestland in order to control high soil erosion risk. The changes in land use and land cover in the studied watershed were mainly controlled by human factors (land management, construction, and population pressure) rather than natural factors.";"Mallick, Javed

Variables and aquatic insect assemblages were sampled during the dry and rainy seasons, in six streams draining different land covers, including forest, pasture, and agriculture. Aquatic insect assemblages were related to forest cover and riparian vegetation, as well as to various physical and chemical parameters of streams. Certain insect genera (Suragina and Anacroneuria) were indicators of little forest cover and forested streams, respectively. Functional Feeding Groups were related to physical and chemical parameters. Seasonality was also found to influence both the physical and chemical characteristics of streams and insect assemblages. Our findings reveal that cloud forest streams in La Antigua watershed are diverse and their insect assemblages are affected by land cover both in the watershed and the riparian zone, and by the associated changes in the stream physical and chemical characteristics.";"Astudillo, Manuel R.

"AGRIS:CH2013100701";"The Effectiveness of Conservation Reserves: Land Tenure Impacts upon Biodiversity across Extensive Natural Landscapes in the Tropical Savannahs of the Northern Territory, Australia";"";"This study examines whether there is a biodiversity benefit (“dividend”) associated with the existence and management of conservation reserves in the extensive and largely natural landscape of northern Australia. Species richness and abundance of vertebrate fauna and the intensity of a range of disturbance factors were compared across a set of 967 sampled quadrats, located either in pastoral lands, Indigenous lands or conservation reserves, with all sampled quadrats within a single vegetation type (open forests and savannah woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus miniata and/or E. tetrodonta). The relationships with land tenure varied between major taxonomic groups, but generally (and particularly for threatened species) values were highest for conservation reserves. This “biodiversity dividend” associated with conservation reserves is considered to be due to the effects of management rather than because conservation reserves were established on lands supporting atypically high conservation values. The impact of weeds and (unsurprisingly) livestock was greatest on pastoral lands, and pig impact was greatest in conservation reserves. Although pastoral and Indigenous lands supported lower biodiversity tallies than reserved lands, the conservation values of reserved lands in this region are probably substantially supported by the maintenance of relatively intact ecological systems across  all lands.";"John C.Z.

The basic public investments to make settlement economically viable have yet been made in many areas of Zambia.- Depending of future land allocation policy, access to good quality land with a market potential may become increasingly beyond the reach of many small-scale farm households, making it more difficult to achieve a smallholder-led, pro-poor agricultural development trajectory.";"Jayne, Thomas S.

"AGRIS:US201301597214";"Property rights, food security and child growth: Dynamics of insecurity in the Kafue Flats of Zambia";"";"This paper provides arguments for discussions of the role of property rights for food security and child nutrition in rural Africa. The results are drawn from a case study in the Kafue Flats of Zambia. They show that unclear jurisdictional boundaries and weak authorities facilitated re-negotiations of property rights related to natural resources in the context of the Southern African food crisis 2002-2003. Access to natural resources was skewed towards the more powerful. On average, food intake was temporarily 50% lower than the annual mean, compared to a less than 10% decrease in the lean season 2003-2004. Large inequalities existed between different clusters of villages, according to the history of immigration and ethnicity. Yet the variability was greatest within villages. Households, which reported increasing difficulties with access to natural resources, had less diversified income-generating activities, lower food intake and more children showing impaired growth. Discussions addressing the growing disparities in rural areas should focus on a realistic implementation and enforcement of property rights in context of situated local power-relations, next to the harmonization of different tenure systems related to natural resources.";"Merten, Sonja

"AGRIS:US201500192776";"Linking irreplaceable landforms in a self‐organizing landscape to sensitivity of population vital rates for an ecological specialist";"";"Irreplaceable, self‐organizing landforms and the endemic and ecologically specialized biodiversity they support are threatened globally by anthropogenic disturbances. Although the outcome of disrupting landforms is somewhat understood, little information exists that documents population consequences of landform disturbance on endemic biodiversity. Conservation strategies for species dependent upon landforms have been difficult to devise because they require understanding complex feedbacks that create and maintain landforms and the consequences of landform configuration on demography of species. We characterized and quantified links between landform configuration and demography of an ecological specialist, the dunes sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus arenicolus), which occurs only in blowouts (i.e., wind‐blown sandy depressions) of Shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) sand‐dune landforms. We used matrix models to estimate vital rates from a multisite mark‐recapture study of 6 populations occupying landforms with different spatial configurations. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses demonstrated demographic rates among populations varied in sensitivity to different landform configurations. Specifically, significant relationships between blowout shape complexity and vital rate elasticities suggested direct links between S. arenicolus demography and amount of edge in Shinnery oak sand‐dune landforms. These landforms are irreplaceable, based on permanent transition of disturbed areas to alternative grassland ecosystem states. Additionally, complex feedbacks between wind, sand, and Shinnery oak maintain this landform, indicating restoration through land management practices is unlikely. Our findings that S. arenicolus population dynamics depended on landform configuration suggest that failure to consider processes of landform organization and their effects on species’ population dynamics may lead to incorrect inferences about threats to endemic species and ineffective habitat management for threatened or endangered species. As such, successful conservation of these systems and the biodiversity they support must be informed by research linking process‐oriented studies of self‐organized landforms with studies of movement, behavior, and demography of species that dwell in them.";"Ryberg, Wade A.

"AGRIS:US201600183137";"Koala and Possum Populations in Queensland during the Harvest Period, 1906-1936";"";"The Queensland Koala Phascolarctos cinereus and possum harvests were regulated from 1906-1927 and 1906-1936, respectively. Before that, there was an uncontrolled harvest. Historical data from the harvest period were analysed to gain information on P. cinereus and possum (mainly Trichosurus vulpecula) population ecology and status. P. cinereusi> numbers peaked in southern Queensland around the turn of the century or in the first decade of the 20th century. In central Queensland, they peaked later, probably in the 1920s, and in north Queensland there does not appear to have been any pronounced fluctuation in numbers. P. cinereus populations experienced diseases similar to those occurring today. Chlamydial diseases were common and occurred in most parts of the State, with cystitis being more common. Some diseases were not clearly identified. In contrast to current populations, P. cinereus populations then had many more episodes of high mortality, population size appears markedly more volatile and overall abundance was much higher. Southern Queensland populations declined greatly at the time of the harvests, but the central Queensland population expanded after the last harvest and harvest mortality does not provide an adequate explanation of population decline. Although it is sometimes said, particularly with regard to island populations, that Queensland (and New South Wales) P. cinereus populations differ from those of Victoria in that they do not exhibit local irruptions and excessively high abundance, the population phenomena appear similar to those occurring in Victorian populations. Queensland populations achieved very high growth rates that resulted in unsustainable population densities and, eventually, mass mortality. Possum populations were subject to very high harvests that were apparently sustainable, at least in the short term, and showed fluctuations that were partly similar to those of P. cinereus. The P. cinereus, and probably also the possum population fluctuations, are mostly consistent with models of herbivore irruptions. The koala population fluctuations are interpreted in terms of herbivore irruption theory. We suggest that koala population expansion was a response to an increase in food availability (possibly due to the development of regrowth vegetation and/or waves of dieback) resulting from land development patterns. A subsequent decline in food availability, accompanied by severe outbreaks of chlamydial disease (probably due to poor nutrition), led to severe declines in koala population size, often to levels well below the apparent carrying capacity. Populations of at least some possum species (T. vulpecula and possibly P. peregrinus) also appear to have experienced irruptions and declines, but the fluctuations do not correlate as closely with major aspects of the development of land for pastoralism and agriculture as do the changes in P. cinereus populations. Specific factors responsible for the expansion and decline of T. vulpecula and P. peregrinus populations were not identified. Very high harvests in 1919 and 1920 also seemed to affect possum numbers.";"Gordon, Greg

"AGRIS:US2012203690";"THE IMPACT OF THE MICHIGAN FARMLAND AND OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION ACT OF LANDOWNER BEHAVIOR IN THE GREATER LANSING AREA";"";"It is generally recognized that Michigan's agricultural base is among the most diversified in the nation.  Producing more than fifty varieties of commodities, the industry as a whole contributes more than $15 billion in value added to the state's economy.  And in terms of employment, it is estimated that one out of every eight of the state's workers are engaged in agriculturally related activities.
	In recent years, however, the viability of farming as a contributor to the state's economy has been threatened by a variety of sources.  The use of lands for non-farm developments such as shopping centers and condominiums led to a yearly loss of an estimated 20,000 acres of prime farmland between the years 1977 and 1982.  While such a conversion can be considered a natural consequence of an expanding economy, the most productive and ecologically fragile lands are often turned over first.
	Since the supply of these lands is finite and irreplaceable, their transformation can lead to increasing pressure on lands which remain in farming.  And beyond the obvious loss of food production caused by non-farm development of USDA classified prime and unique lands, there has also been concern over the loss of scenic open space and the deterioration of wooded areas and wildlife, as well as a potential increase in surface water runoff in the areas affected.  Poorly planned development affects both the general landscape as well as the viability of farming.
	The land buffer which is added by development to allow the continuation of farming can further accentuate this loss of farmland.  Haphazard development often transforms the landscape from open space to urban sprawl.  As the area become more intensively settled, property taxes typically rise as greater revenues are required for the provision of services such as sewers and water, schools, and police and fire protection.  In response to farmer and public concern over the related problems of farmland loss and high property taxes, the State of Michigan in 1974 enacted Public Act 116, the Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act, which was primarily designed to diminish the loss of prime farmland that occurs in conjunction with the growth of urban sprawl.
	The purpose of this study is to determine the impact which the program has had on individual land use decision making in a growing metropolitan area-greater Lansing.  Toward this end, it documents the response of these landowners, enrollees and non-enrollees, to the objectives of the program.  Behavior based on factors not related to program incentives such as the age of the landowner, location, and development expectations is also considered.  Also the effectiveness of the program in encouraging delays in non-farm development among individual landowners is closely examined.";"Frankel, Andrew Edwin";"";"";"AGRIS";"1987-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012203690";"http://purl.umn.edu/11032";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400160646";"Does watershed size affect simple mathematical relationships between flow velocity and discharge rate at watershed outlets on the Loess Plateau of China";"";"An empirical power function model of V=kQᵐ has been used worldwide to describe the relationship between flow velocity (V, ms⁻¹) and discharge rate (Q, m³s⁻¹) for rill and open channel flows. However, it has seldom been applied to watershed outlet channels taking into account the impacts of watershed size. In this study, observed data from four experimental watersheds of different sizes, ranging from about 1 to 100km², were used to verify the stability of the power function model for use at a watershed level on the Loess Plateau. An alternative logarithmic function model of V=elnQ+d was also tested. Results showed that the constant parameters in both model types were impacted by watershed size, which are inherently directly related to the size of the outlet channels. The constants k and d, which represent flow velocity for unit discharge rate, were negatively correlated with watershed size. However, the exponential constants m and e, which determine the rate of change in flow velocity with respect to discharge rate, were shown to be independent of watershed size. Furthermore, soil and water conservation land use management on the Loess Plateau was also shown to indirectly affect the flow velocity–discharge rate relationship in the smallest watersheds (1km²). The study indicated that, although the performance of the logarithmic function model was acceptable, the power function model generally performed better over a larger range of flow velocity values and was better able to represent the flow velocity–discharge rate relationship in the unique context of the Loess Plateau.";"Zhou, Shu-mei

Fieldwork was focused on the comparative study of seasonal patterns of inorganic nutrients, organic nitrogen, and erosion over the most abundant vegetation types of the area, such as olive groves, maquis, and wetlands. Nutrient losses via the pathway of erosion were provided by the determination of nutrient concentrations in runoff sediments. Results showed that nutrient levels are higher and more susceptible to rapid changes in the zones that host agricultural activities and animal husbandry. The behavior of nitrogen and phosphorus showed remarkable stability in the maquis, where dynamic processes were mainly affected by soil erosion, which led gradually to land degradation, especially on sloping terrains. The aim of this study was to form the basis for the quantification of the interconnections within the Mediterranean-type ecosystems and to conceptualize their operational properties.";"Arhonditsis, G.

In this article, drawing on research conducted in the Yerer and Daketa Valleys, eastern Ethiopia, we use the notion of entitlements to examine how, under increasing pressure for resource access, various agro-pastoral households manage conflicting interests in common grazing resources. We observed that in times of drought and resource scarcity incumbent agro-pastoralists find peaceful sharing arrangements with intruding pastoralists. Asset-poor agro-pastoralists enter into mutually beneficial arrangements with pastoralists, trading their resource endowments to grazing land for other assets from the pastoralists, whereas wealthier households prefer a reciprocal risk-management strategy. These multiple arrangements have distributional effects because asset-poor agro-pastoralist households can stabilize or enhance their household assets and their capabilities in times of drought, and thus benefit from assisting pastoralist migrants to the common grazing land.";"Bogale, Ayalneh

The paper discusses advantages of using the GCP instead of the Gross Domestic Product. The paper reveals that the GCP falls sharply as temperature increases in the region. A 1°C increase in temperature would decrease the productivity with an elasticity of −2.4. A 1 per cent decrease in precipitation would decrease productivity with an elasticity of −2.3. However, forest vegetation on the coasts will benefit from initial warming. We find that the changes in climate means are potentially more harmful than changes in climate variability. In the long term, a 3.4° warming coupled with 6.6 mm decrease in rainfall would decrease the GCP by 34 per cent by 2060. The damage is largely accounted for by population effects. The paper confirms that Australia is highly constrained by climate and geographic factors.";"Seo, S.

This study builds on temperate agroforestry adoption research by empirically testing a statistical model of interest in native fruit and nut tree riparian buffers using technology and agroforestry adoption theory. Data were collected in three watersheds in Virginia’s ridge and valley region and used to test hypothesized predictors of interest in planting these buffers. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to verify independence of underlying latent measures. Multiple linear regression was used to model interest using the Universal Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). A second model that added agroforestry-specific predictors from Pattanayak et al. (Agrofor Syst 57:173–186, 2003) to UTAUT was tested and compared with the first. The first model was robust (Adj R ²� =� 0.49) but was improved by adding agroforestry specific predictors (Adj R ²� =� 0.57). Model generalizability was confirmed using double cross validation and normality indices. Social influence, risk expectancy, planting experience, performance expectancy, parcel size, and the interaction of gender and risk were significant in the final model. In addition, socioeconomic variables were used to characterize landowners according to their level of interest. Respondents with greater interest were newer owners that have higher incomes and are less active in farming. The result implies that future agroforesters may in large part consist of owners that have recently acquired land and manage their property more extensively with higher discretionary income and multiple objectives in mind.";"Trozzo, Katie E.

We report results of a rainfed rotation experiment, conducted in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan, during 1995-1999 to evaluate effects of residue retention and fertiliser N on N2 fixation inputs and yields of a mungbean (Vigna radiata)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) sequence, and a lentil (Lens culinaris)-summer cereal sequence. Mungbean and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or maize (Zea mays) were grown in the summers and lentil and wheat in the winters. Immediately after grain harvest, above-ground residues of all crops were either completely removed (−residue), or chopped into 5-20 cm pieces, spread across the plots and incorporated by chisel plough (+residue). Fertiliser N rates were nil or 120 kg N/ha for wheat and nil or 150 kg N/ha for sorghum/maize. The percentage of mungbean N derived from N2 fixation (%Ndfa) ranged from 47% to almost 100% (mean of 75%). On average, mungbean fixed 112 kg N/ha (+residues) and 74 kg N/ha (-residues), with N balances of +64 kg N/ha (+residues) and +9 kg N/ha (-residues). Lentil %Ndfa ranged from 50 to 87% (mean of 73%). Values for crop N fixed were 42-85 kg N/ha, with a mean of 68 kg N/ha. Average N balances for lentil were +27 kg N/ha (+residues) and +16 kg N/ha (-residues). Grain yields of the 0N wheat responded to the previous mungbean (36% increase over the 0N sorghum), but showed an even greater response to fertiliser N applied to the previous sorghum (150% increase). Highest yields were recorded for the N-fertilised wheat (average of 2.27 t/ha). Shoot biomass yields of the 0N sorghum and maize responded strongly to the previous lentil crop (49% average increase over the 0N wheat) and fertiliser N, applied either to the crop itself (140%) or to the previous wheat crop (32%). Residue retention increased shoot biomass yields of both the summer (average of 20%) and winter crops (average of 9%). Grain yield benefits of residues were 13% for mungbean, and 8% for wheat and lentil. Soil organic N and total organic C, labile C and C management index (CMI), were all increased by N inputs, from both fertiliser and N2 fixation, and by retention of residues. We concluded that retention of residues improves the N economy of the cropping system and enhances crop productivity through the additional N and other soil effects. The question of whether farmers who traditionally remove residues for fodder and fuel would change practices and return the residues to the soil will depend to a large extent on the relative profitability of both options.";"Shah, Z.

"AGRIS:US201400192707";"‘Tolerable’ hillslope soil erosion rates in Australia: Linking science and policy";"";"This paper reviews water-borne soil erosion in Australia in the context of current environmental policy needs. Sustainability has emerged as a central tenet of environmental policy in Australia and water-borne hillslope soil erosion rates are used as one of the indicators of agricultural sustainability in State of the Environment reporting. We review attempts to quantify hillslope erosion rates over Australia and we identify areas at risk of exceeding natural baseline rates. We also review historical definitions of sustainable, or ‘tolerable’ erosion rates, and how to set these rates. There are many ways to estimate hillslope erosion and these can create confusing results. Moreover their application for land management purposes requires nuanced interpretations that ultimately depend on the desired objective of decision-makers. Soil is the earth surficial material that serves as a medium for plant growth and the notion of tolerable soil erosion arose historically to assess the impact of soil loss on agricultural uses. However now that the impact of erosion on aquatic ecosystems been recognized as a major concern for Australia, the concept of tolerable erosion needs to be revised. Here we discuss three definitions of tolerable soil erosion, following recent literature. We derive estimates of long-term agricultural sustainability based on natural soil production rates and discuss this in relation to other defined land-management objectives such as aquatic ecosystem health. We conclude that the desired objectives of land managers must be clearly articulated before questions of ‘where to invest to control erosion’ and ‘how to assess return-on-investment’ can be answered.";"Bui, Elisabeth N.

Bioeconomic modelling combined with sensitivity analysis is used to explore how new annual legume species may impact on farm profit and land use. If introduced on all suitable soils the new pastures lead to a 26% increase in farm profit with an additional 12% of farm area being switched into pasture to support more livestock. However, stocking rates decline slightly, the enterprise mix becomes less diversified and several rotational changes are required. If the new pastures are only introduced on particular soils then farm profit increases by a lesser percentage and the pathways to additional profit vary, with both the pasture area and stocking rate either increasing or decreasing. To extract maximum profit from pasture improvement on any particular land management unit often requires management changes on other land management units, apart from those on which pasture improvement initially takes place. The economic value of pasture improvement is found to depend on the portfolio of pastures available for improvement and the nature and mix of the farm's land management units.";"Bathgate, A.

The aim of this work is to characterize the insect fauna associated to the foliage of Antarctic beech forests and scrublands in the Baker river basin. Insects were collected in spring (October 2006) and summer (January 2007), in five beech forests and 10 scrub patches from latitudes 47°2' S - 72°48' W to 47°15' S - 73° W. Six orders of insects were identified, being Coleóptera the most diverse. The phytophagous-beetle guild was the most representative in both forest types and climatic seasons. No significant differences were found in insect taxonomic composition or mean abundance of guilds between forest types or climatic seasons. Additionally, abundant defoliation by Ormiscodes sp. larvae, infestation by parasitic plants and fungi, and insect galls were observed. More exhaustive samplings in autumn and winter, complemented with more efficient sampling methods, would allow identifying the year-round insect diversity associated to Antarctic beech foliage.

A SPOT-5 HRG image of Yanqing County, Beijing, China, was used, in which agriculture and forest dominate land use. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), including the adaptive backpropagation (ABP) algorithm, Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm, Quasi-Newton (QN) algorithm and radial basis function (RBF) were carefully tested. The LM–ANN and RBF–ANN, which outperform the other two, were selected to make a detailed comparison with support vector machines (SVMs). The experiments show that those well-trained ANNs and SVMs have no significant difference in classification accuracy, but the SVM usually performs slightly better. Analysis of the effect of the training set size highlights that the SVM classifier has great tolerance on a small training set and avoids the problem of insufficient training of ANN classifiers. The testing also illustrates that the ANNs and SVMs can vary greatly with regard to training time. The LM–ANN can converge very quickly but not in a stable manner. By contrast, the training of RBF–ANN and SVM classifiers is fast and can be repeatable.";"Song, Xianfeng

Because the underlaying surface feature records most human activities, it is important to recognize the correlation between aerosol distribution and the underlaying surface. In this research, the dark object algorithm and a second-generation operational algorithm of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol retrieval are used to estimate aerosol optical depth from Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images acquired by the Landsat 7 satellite system in urban regions, and the correlations between aerosol distribution and urban underlaying surface features (including landform, land cover and urbanization level) is analysed. Results show that (1) it is feasible to apply a second-generation algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth with ETM+ images. When a validation is performed with the ground observation meteorological range converted into aerosol optical depth with the correlation model acquired by a Moderate-Resolution Atmospheric Transmission (MODTRAN) simulation, the retrieval error is about 0.0094. For higher spatial resolution of an ETM+ image, it is better to study the aerosol distribution features in the urban regions. Additionally, (2) there are obvious variations in spatial distribution of aerosol over the different features of the underlaying surface. For the landform, aerosol optical depth is mountain < hill < plain; for the land cover, aerosol optical depth is dense vegetation < sparse vegetation < water < bare soil < residential area; for the different urbanization-level regions, there is bigger and bigger aerosol optical depth with increasing of the urbanization level. On the whole, as human activities increase, so too does the aerosol optical depth.";"Hou, Peng

The optimal decision rules differ significantly from the expected net present value rule, which ignores learning, and from real option models that allow only one way conversions into energy crops. These models also predict drastically different patterns of land conversions into and out of energy crops over time.

Large area forest monitoring programs often utilize field and remotely sensed data sources. Sampling, via field or photo plots, enables the collection of data with the desired level of categorical detail in a timely and efficient manner. When sampling, the aim is to collect representative detailed data enabling the statistical reporting upon the characteristics of larger areas. As a consequence, approaches for investigating how well sample data represent larger areas (i.e., the sample neighbourhood and the population) are desired. Presented in this communication is a quantitative approach for assessing the nature of sampled areas in relation to surrounding areas and the overall population of interest. Classified Landsat data is converted to forest/non-forest categories to provide a consistent and uniform data set over a 130,000 km² study region in central British Columbia, Canada. From this larger study area 322 2 x 2 km photo plots on a 20 x 20 km systematic grid are populated with composition and configuration information for comparison to non-sampled areas. Results indicate that typically, within the study area, the spatial pattern of forest within a photo plot is representative of the forest patterns found within primary and secondary neighbourhoods and over the entire population of the study. These methods have implications for understanding the nature of data used in monitoring programs worldwide. The ability to audit photo and field plot information promotes an increased understanding of the results developed from sampling and provides tools identifying locations of possible bias.";"Wulder, Michael A.

Ecological studies in LBA focus on how tropical forest conversion, regrowth, and selective logging influence carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, trace gas fluxes, and the prospect for sustainable land use in the Amazon region. Early results from ecological studies within LBA emphasize the variability within the vast Amazon region and the profound effects that land-use and land-cover changes are having on that landscape. The predominant land cover of the Amazon region is evergreen forest; nonetheless, LBA studies have observed strong seasonal patterns in gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange, as well as phenology and tree growth. The seasonal patterns vary spatially and interannually and evidence suggests that these patterns are driven not only by variations in weather but also by innate biological rhythms of the forest species. Rapid rates of deforestation have marked the forests of the Amazon region over the past three decades. Evidence from ground-based surveys and remote sensing show that substantial areas of forest are being degraded by logging activities and through the collapse of forest edges. Because forest edges and logged forests are susceptible to fire, positive feedback cycles of forest degradation may be initiated by land-use-change events. LBA studies indicate that cleared lands in the Amazon, once released from cultivation or pasture usage, regenerate biomass rapidly. However, the pace of biomass accumulation is dependent upon past land use and the depletion of nutrients by unsustainable land-management practices. The challenge for ongoing research within LBA is to integrate the recognition of diverse patterns and processes into general models for prediction of regional ecosystem function.";"Keller, M.

For just over a decade, a process of intense deforestation has resulted from the expansion of mechanized farming, carried out without any form of land management or planning; this has led to the fragmentation of the forests in this region. This study has taken satellite imagery from 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2007 with the purpose of determining the average size of the fragments and the rate of forest discontinuity; the results of this multi-temporal imagery analysis show that (a) in some areas of the Central Chaco, the forest matrix was transformed principally into cropped areas; (b) the majority of the fragments are isolated from one other; and (c) the areas mostly covered by forests are in the north-northeastern and northwestern areas and this is mainly as a result of a greater concentration of protected areas. In conclusion, the vulnerability of the vegetation formations increases with the fragmentation process, to which we should add an increased frequency of fires, a reduced resilience and homeostasis of the vegetation formations; thus these are highly exposed to climate change factors. It is imperative that the forest landscapes be restored, through the implementation biological corridors, to ensure the continuity of the remaining forests.";"Mereles, María Fátima

According to some researches that have considered various factors such as breed, productivity, production costs and levels of technology, the most feasible bio-ingredients are rape and barley. By means of the benefit-cost analysis, rape has positive values in the net profits when considered with indirect benefits. Also, it is estimated that rape is feasible when produced in place of barley for double-cropping. Soybean is feasible when cultivated in fallow grounds. When all factors are taken into consideration,  the government's support has to be continued in order to reduce a burden of production costs at the initial stage of the biofuel's introduction.

One of its subsystems is the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) system, which has two slow-drying fuel moisture codes: the drought code (DC) and the duff moisture code (DMC). Both codes are used in this study as a surrogate of dead fuel moisture. We evaluate the capability of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) observations to map DC and DMC. A comparison was made between 16-day composite MODIS images acquired in the 2000 to 2004 fire seasons over Grasslands National Park of Canada (GNPC), Saskatchewan, Canada and DC and DMC data interpolated from weather station records. Overall, spectral variables and DC and DMC exhibited clear seasonal trends, and were therefore influenced more by temporal factors than by land cover factors. Data were then grouped into temporal categories, by year and seasons, for stepwise multiple regression calculations. We note that the use of shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based variables slightly improved the performances of both DC and DMC models. Spectrally derived DC and DMC data showed improved spatial resolution of mapping drought over pre-burned areas compared to broadly interpolated weather station-based estimations. The spectral estimation was improved by applying the Getis statistic (Gᵢ*) to the resulting maps, showing the potential of combining the Gᵢ* statistic and MODIS data in predicting fuel moisture codes in relationship to fire occurrence.";"Merzouki, A.

In such cases, transaction costs linked to property rights, asymmetric and hidden information and packaging problems have often prevented otherwise valuable deals from being negotiated in relation to the environment. However new capabilities and a better knowledge and understanding of the problems at hand now mean that where the objective is clear, and the knowledge, skills and capability exist to understand, model and measure the relevant characteristics of the problem transaction costs are low enough that economists can, in certain cases, design market based instruments that match demand with supply. In general the findings from the National MBI Pilot Program indicate that cap-and-trade systems, auctions and offsets systems can be effective tools to achieve natural resource management.

This study tests the response of river metabolism and loss in cotton strip tensile strength across a land use pressure gradient in non-wadeable rivers of northern New Zealand, and reports extent estimates for river metabolism and decomposition rates. Following adjustment for probability of selection, ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) for the target population of order 5–7 non-wadeable rivers averaged −7.3 and 4.8gO₂m⁻²d⁻¹, respectively, with average P/R<1 indicating dominance by heterotrophic processes. Ecosystem respiration was <−3.3gO₂m⁻²d⁻¹ for 75% of non-wadeable river length with around 20% of length between −10 and −20gO₂m⁻²d⁻¹. Cumulative distribution functions of cotton strength loss estimates indicated a more-or-less linear relationship with river km reflecting an even spread of decay rates (range in k 0.0007–0.2875d⁻¹) across non-wadeable rivers regionally. A non-linear relationship with land cover was detected for GPP which was typically <5gO₂m⁻²d⁻¹ where natural vegetation cover was below 20% and greater than 80% of upstream catchment area. For cotton strength loss, the relationship with land cover was wedge-shaped such that sites with >60% natural cover had low decay rates (<0.02d⁻¹) with variability below this increasing as natural cover declined. Using published criteria for assessing waterway health based on ER and GPP, 232–298km (20–29%) of non-wadeable river length was considered to have severely impaired ecosystem functioning, and 436–530km (42–50%) had no evidence of impact on river metabolism.";"Collier, K.J.

"AGRIS:US201600190809";"Doubly segmented proxy images for multi-scale landscape ecology and ecosystem health";"";"Multi-band remotely sensed image data contain information on landscape pattern and temporal changes that are greatly underutilized in this technological era when monitoring of disturbance and ecological dynamics is increasingly important to address questions regarding sustainability of ecosystem health and climate change. Among the reasons for this loss of analytical opportunity are the inadequacy of methods for systematic extraction of pattern elements, incongruity between information paradigms for remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), and the sheer volume of remotely sensed image data when acquired regularly over time. Long-term cooperative landscape ecological investigations concerning habitat and change detection in conjunction with remote sensing and GIS have yielded a pattern-based approach to progressively segmenting images (PSI) that culminates in a doubly segmented image representation by sets of approximating signal vectors that serve as parsimonious proxies for pixel vectors. The coarser level of segmentation is entirely congruent with raster map structures for GIS, and yet mimics the appearance of an image display by colorization using information on typical spectral properties of segments contained in attribute tables. The components of the coarser representation as spatial segments constitute explicit elements of pattern at several levels. The explicit nature of these pattern elements enables spatial pattern matching for change detection that resolves difficulties with phenological variability and continuity of sensor configurations over time. Conversion to segmented representation can be applied to multi-temporal change indices so as to elicit longer-term patterns of change from temporal sequences of images. The finer level of segmentation for spectral detail enables restoration of image bands in the manner of a low-pass filter for analysis according to the usual paradigms of remote sensing. Mapping of the residuals for the finer detail of image approximation provides further information on exceptional features of landscape ecological pattern.";"Myers, W.L.

"AGRIS:US201500027056";"Identifying motivators for state-pastoralist dialogue: Exploring the relationships between livestock services, self-organisation and conflict in Nigeria's pastoralist Fulani";"";"Historical tensions between Nigeria's pastoralist Fulani and settled indigenous farmers have intensified in recent years, with dwindling natural resources and land availability greatly contributing to the ongoing, escalating conflict in the north of the country. The urgent requirement to engage with, rather than isolate, Nigeria's Fulani from various socioeconomic and environmental management strategies is fundamental to peace and agricultural productivity in the region. This requires a greater understanding of formal and informal governance mechanisms and their relative impact on the Fulani. This study examines the existing and potential roles of various actors within the transhumant Fulani community of the Kachia Grazing Reserve in Nigeria's Kaduna State, triangulated with views from external public and private sector representatives.The findings reveal three main spheres of governance that intertwine and impact on the largely self-organising Fulani: religious or customary laws overseen by the imams, ‘informal’ laws of the community overseen by Fulani civil leaders and the ‘formal’ laws outlined in the official policies of the state. In addition, peripheral entities such as Fulani co-operatives, non-governmental organisations and the private sector can have considerable influence. The health and husbandry of livestock was identified as a key motivator for successful self-governance, integral to Fulani daily life. Understanding and appreciating the self-governance structures of the Fulani, particularly given their current isolation from formal state policy processes, can help identify motivators and opportunities for dialogue between the Fulani and various external actors. Improved veterinary service provision and livestock extension services are potentially powerful entry points for both the public and private sectors alike.";"Okello, Anna L

Small burnet was evaluated for tolerance to spring and fall POST applications of aminopyralid, bromoxynil, clethodim, clopyralid, dicamba, dimethenamid-P, imazamox, metribuzin, pendimethalin, quinclorac, and 2,4-DB. Injury, seed yield, seed viability, and dry matter yield (DMY) were measured in the spring following application. Injury was observed in response to all spring and fall herbicide applications. Injury from aminopyralid was the highest for both spring and fall applications at 24 and 79%, respectively. Fall application of imazamox and dicamba resulted in 57 and 31% injury, respectively. Spring-applied aminopyralid and 2,4-DB both reduced DMY by 16%, whereas fall applications of imazamox, dicamba, and aminopyralid reduced DMY by 36, 12, and 67%, respectively. Fall applications of imazamox and aminopyralid reduced seed yield by 33 and 65%, respectively. Fall-applied aminopyralid reduced seed germination by 43%. None of the spring-applied herbicides affected seed yield or seed germination. Small burnet is severely injured by aminopyralid and to a lesser degree by imazamox and dicamba. Bromoxynil, clethodim, clopyralid, dimethenamid-P, metribuzin, pendimethalin, and quinclorac did not affect small burnet DMY, seed yield, or germination the year after application.Nomenclature: 2,4-DB; aminopyralid; bromoxynil; clethodim; clopyralid; dicamba; dimethenamid-P; imazamox; metribuzin; pendimethalin; quinclorac; small burnet, Sanguisorba minor scop.";"Nelson, Ryan L.

However, the true production effects of these policies are still unclear. We show how the exclusion restrictions of U.S. direct payments, namely, the fruit and vegetable restriction and the requirement of keeping land in good agricultural use, cause the decoupled payment to become fully coupled over time as relative profits adjust. Theoretically, decoupled payments can be more trade distorting than an equivalent (same level of taxpayer expenditure) fully coupled subsidy.";"Just, David R.

The innovative models cover buying shares of contract management rights, transforming from rural residents to urban residents and mortgaging contract management rights. The plights exist in the reform are analyzed, among which the plights of buying shares of contract management rights are introduced from the following five aspects: the conflict with the present land contract laws, the possible new round of massive scale land loses, the confounded functions of government and enterprise caused by risk transference and the difficulties of handling assets when the contract management rights expired. Besides, the plights of the transforming from rural residents to urban residents are analyzed from four aspects, which include the particularity of reform, high financial pressure, emergence of interbedded people and difficulties of payoff of village-based companies. From the facets of limited mortgage area, risks of reimbursing the loan, legal risks of mortgage. The results show that the stock purchasing model of contractual management rights reveals the capital value of land and it is of theoretical and practical significance in law and economics. However, the social security system is not perfect, so the stock purchasing model of contractual management rights can not be expended. In addition, the participation of more famers and the expansion of enterprises are limited. The land comprehensive reform model of transforming from rural residents to urban residents is of positive significance to the comprehensive exploration of farmland property system reform, but this kind of model should based on strong economy. The stock purchasing model of contractual management rights is of significance to perfect the contractual management rights, but it is conflict with the existing laws and financial systems.";"Zheng, Cai-gui

This paper assesses the potential consequences of a land-reformscheme that draws on proposals from Zimbabwe’s government in 1998 and 1999. Weanalyze the impact of the reform on resettled farm households and as a developmentproject for which we conduct cost-benefit analysis. The analysis, which considers costsand benefits during a 15-year period, relies on a set of models of family farms that aretypical of those that would benefit from land redistribution. The cost-benefit analysis ismore comprehensive, also considering the different costs and benefits that affect thegovernment. The results of our analysis indicate that a government-supported landreform could be economically viable under what we consider as realistic assumptionsregarding the performance of the beneficiaries and the costs that will be faced by thegovernment and other stakeholders. Land reform can generate sustainable livelihoods forthe beneficiaries. If viewed as a project, the NPV of the reform is positive for a discountrate that is as high as 20%. The project can also increase employment in the agriculturalsector. The analysis takes a long-run perspective, covering a 15-year period. During thefirst resettlement years, some disruption of agricultural production should be expected.These results are preliminary and based on a partial equilibrium perspective. They aredriven by the assumption that the land reform is carried out in a manner that allowsfarmers on the resettled lands to achieve their productive potential. Such an outcomedepends critically on the assumption that the farmers are able to operate in an enablingenvironment, including critical government support, especially during years 1-5.";"Robilliard, Anne-Sophie

The analyses were performed for the settlements closer than 35 km from the Drava River (northern Croatia). Sixteen habitat characteristics were determined around 257 settlements occupied with white stork nests and 152 control sites without white stork nests within the same geographic region. We performed multivariate inspection of the data and a non-metric multidimensional preference analysis. The best variables for stork habitat selection were: distance to the nearest grassland habitat (P < 0.0001), distance to three nearest grassland habitats (P < 0.0001), altitude of the settlements above the sea level (P < 0.001), sum of distances to the three nearest agricultural mosaic habitats (P < 0.005) and standardized area proportion of forests (P < 0.05). The explanatory capacity of the model was 81.1%. We conclude that it is possible to define a small number of habitat characteristics derived from CLC database which can indicate the occurrence of white stork nests.";"RadoviÄ, Andreja

"AGRIS:US201600196291";"basic motivational drivers of northern and central European farmers";"";"Farmers are key actors in land management confronted with societyâs increasing demand for public goods. Understanding farmersâ values and motivations is essential to policy makers to foster more sustainable production practices. So far, no definite value profile for European farmers exists. Based on Schwartzâs theory of basic human values, we statistically analyzed six rounds of the European Social Survey to explore farmersâ value orientations in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Our results revealed that farmers are less open to change and instead more conservative in their value orientation than the general population. Comparison of value orientations across farmers showed that this value profile is particularly pronounced for Austrian, Finnish, and German farmers. Furthermore, there is a slight tendency for farmers to be less motivated by self-interest and instead more concerned with common welfare than the general population, but this observation needs further validation. Based on these value profiles, we argue that agri-environmental schemes will receive better acceptance when they represent a long-term modification of existing schemes, when they do not trade off commodity production, and when they provide benefits to society. Compensation for income losses resulting from reduced on-farm output appears to be an ineffective incentive.";"Baur, Ivo

Models were developed with and without exclusion of rare taxa at a site. BRT models are robust, requiring few assumptions compared with traditional modeling techniques such as multiple linear regression. The BRT models were constructed to provide baseline support to stressor delineation by identifying natural physiographic and human land use gradients affecting stream biological condition statewide and for eight ecological regions within the state, as part of the development of numerical biological objectives for California’s wadeable streams. Regions were defined on the basis of ecological, hydrologic, and jurisdictional factors and roughly corresponded with ecoregions. Physiographic and land use variables were derived from geographic information system coverages. The model for the entire state (n = 1,386) identified a composite measure of anthropogenic disturbance (the sum of urban, agricultural, and unmanaged roadside vegetation land cover) within the local watershed as the most important variable, explaining 56 % of the variance in O/E values. Models for individual regions explained between 51 and 84 % of the variance in O/E values. Measures of human disturbance were important in the three coastal regions. In the South Coast and Coastal Chaparral, local watershed measures of urbanization were the most important variables related to biological condition, while in the North Coast the composite measure of human disturbance at the watershed scale was most important. In the two mountain regions, natural gradients were most important, including slope, precipitation, and temperature. The remaining three regions had relatively small sample sizes (n ≤ 75 sites) and had models that gave mixed results. Understanding the spatial scale at which land use and land cover affect taxonomic completeness is imperative for sound management. Our results suggest that invertebrate taxonomic completeness is affected by human disturbance at the statewide and regional levels, with some differences among regions in the importance of natural gradients and types of human disturbance. The construction and application of models similar to the ones presented here could be useful in the planning and prioritization of actions for protection and conservation of biodiversity in California streams.";"May, Jason T.

"AGRIS:US201500062329";"International Soil Moisture Network: a data hosting facility for global in situ soil moisture measurements";"";"In situ measurements of soil moisture are invaluable for calibrating and validating land surface models and satellite-based soil moisture retrievals. In addition, longterm time series of in situ soil moisture measurements themselves can reveal trends in the water cycle related to climate or land cover change. Nevertheless, on a worldwide basis the number of meteorological networks and stations measuring soil moisture, in particular on a continuous basis, is still limited and the data they provide lack standardization of technique and protocol. To overcome many of these limitations, the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu) was initiated to serve as a centralized data hosting facility where globally available in situ soil moisture measurements from operational networks and validation campaigns are collected, harmonized, and made available to users. Data collecting networks share their soil moisture datasets with the ISMN on a voluntary and no-cost basis. Incoming soil moisture data are automatically transformed into common volumetric soil moisture units and checked for outliers and implausible values. Apart from soil water measurements from different depths, important metadata and meteorological variables (e.g., precipitation and soil temperature) are stored in the database. These will assist the user in correctly interpreting the soil moisture data. The database is queried through a graphical user interface while output of data selected for download is provided according to common standards for data and metadata. Currently (status May 2011), the ISMN contains data of 19 networks and more than 500 stations located in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The time period spanned by the entire database runs from 1952 until the present, although most datasets have originated during the last decade. The database is rapidly expanding, which means that both the number of stations and the time period covered by the existing stations are still growing. Hence, it will become an increasingly important resource for validating and improving satellite-derived soil moisture products and studying climate related trends. As the ISMN is animated by the scientific community itself, we invite potential networks to enrich the collection by sharing their in situ soil moisture data.";"Dorigo, W. A.

"AGRIS:US2016203123";"Linking biodiversity, land-use and incomes at the farm level: an interdisciplinary modelling approach";"";"Recent decades have witnessed substantial losses in biodiversity in Europe, partlydriven by the ecological changes associated with intensification of agriculturalproduction. These changes have particularly affected biodiversity in marginal areas,such as the uplands in UK, since habitat change has been greater than in lowlandzones. Livestock farming is the main land use in these areas, and economic viabilityof farmers substantially relies on income coming from agricultural subsidies and agrienvironmentalpayments. The production decisions have an effect on biodiversity,although the precise links are subject of much debate. To assess the effects of policychanges on farm incomes and biodiversity, we developed ecological-economicmodels for three typical farm types in the Peak District National Park in UK. Weanalyse the effect of decoupling and agri-environment schemes on birds. The resultsshow that the impact of these policies varies across farm types and across biodiversityindicator. This means that from a biodiversity point of view whatever future policyoptions are chosen will result in winners and losers.";"Acs, Szvetlana

Nowadays, development of urban spaces has taken a hasty growth. In the meanwhile, the natural green spaces are severely damaged. The current study aims at investigating the trend of changes in green space of Tabriz City, the second large industrial city in Iran, on the basis of landscape ecology principles. In order to prepare the land-cover maps, Landsat TM and IRS LISS-III of the years 1989 and 2006 were applied. Alongside, landscape percentage metrics, the largest patch index, number of patches, patch density, edge density, total edge, class area and landscape shape index were also used to analyse the changes. Metric analysis of the landscape within the studied years revealed that a large part of the region has enjoyed a rapid growth (equivalent to 64.5 %) in constructions. As the obtained results showed, the smallest landscape percentage (3.9 %) in the study area is belonged to the municipal green space, while the largest landscape percentage (66 %) is allocated to the barren land. This shows that the constructions have not balanced with creation of new green spaces, and the lack of green space per capita continues to be felt.";"Olad Ghaffari, Parisa

Surprisingly, existing systems for representing these global patterns, including biome classifications, either ignore humans altogether or simplify human influence into, at most, four categories. Here, we present the first characterization of terrestrial biomes based on global patterns of sustained, direct human interaction with ecosystems. Eighteen âanthropogenic biomesâ were identified through empirical analysis of global population, land use, and land cover. More than 75% of Earth's iceâfree land showed evidence of alteration as a result of human residence and land use, with less than a quarter remaining as wildlands, supporting just 11% of terrestrial net primary production.

The dynamic relationships between oil wells, roads, and landscape fragmentation indices in the Yellow River Delta, China were explored. Oil wells, roads and land cover were mapped from TM images in 1992, 2000, 2006, and 2009, respectively. Changes and relationships were compared among three selected typical sections using linear regression models. We also evaluated the fragmentation effects of oil exploitation on protected wetlands in the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve (NR). The results showed that oil wells and roads increased greatly. Oil well density and road length density were positively related to patch number and negatively related to patch shape indices. Both drivers have cumulative effects on landscape fragmentation. Influences of old oil wells and roads were stronger than those of new ones. Current management strategies of the NR have failed to effectively prohibit the disturbances of oil activities at the regional scale. The ecological function of protected wetland systems has been damaged by the increase of oil wells. Therefore, based on the principles of landscape ecology, effective approaches were proposed to minimize the negative effects of oil exploitation on the coastal area.";"Bi, Xiaoli

Recurrent turnover of landâcover types will affect ecosystems over and above major, oneâtime changes (eg deforestation). Here, we show how a deeper appreciation of the temporal dynamics of landâcover change is needed to understand its effects on ecosystems. We distinguish between four key components of landâchange regimes: (1) frequency of landâcover changes over a period of time, (2) the sequence of landâcover types, (3) the time span over which each landâcover type extends, and (4) the magnitude of difference between landâcover types. We synthesize the impacts of these four components on ecological communities, showing that frequent landâcover changes are likely to favor species that are habitat and dietary generalists. Greater attention to the complex dynamics of landâcover changes is critical for a better understanding of the future impacts that humanâgenerated landâuse changes will have on global biodiversity.";"Watson, Simon J

This study has demonstrated the ability to produce a highly detailed (both spatially and thematically) land cover/land use dataset over Russia – by combining existing datasets into a hybrid information system. The resulting dataset contains detailed subclasses of land cover and attributes necessary for biogeochemical modeling. In lieu of suitable validation data, a confidence map was produced creating six classes of confidence in the agreement between the various remote sensing and statistical datasets. In specific regions, a significant difference between the remote sensing products and the official statistics was observed. For example, in the northwest of Russia the statistics appear to be underreporting the amount of forest land which has likely been increasing in recent decades because of encroachment of forests on abandoned marginal agricultural land.";"Schepaschenko, Dmitry

This study modeled the potential risk of sand dunes encroachment related to their terrain characteristics in the Western Desert of Egypt. The Food and Agricultural Organization's land cover map of Egypt derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper was used to locate the sand dunes bodies. Four parameters were derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data, namely the elevation, slope, aspect, and relative moisture index. Ten-year average data for prevalent wind direction and speed were used. A GIS cartographic model was applied using the six parameters as criteria maps. The output is a sand dunes risk index map which was overlaid with the existing urban features. The result identified those urban features vulnerable to sand dunes encroachment risk. The model was verified using a high-resolution image. Such a risk map is essential for land use planning and environmental management.";"Effat, Hala A.

We investigated CN under continuous longterm no-till corn (Zea mays L.; watershed WS191) and compared it with other potentially high infiltration agricultural practices using data from three experimental watersheds (average area = 0.74 ha [1.83 ac]) at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed (NAEW) near Coshocton, Ohio. Practices compared were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and first- and second-year meadow as part of a 4-year corn–wheat–meadow–meadow rotation (CWMM), continuous meadow, and continuous no-till corn, mulch-tilled corn, and conventionally tilled corn (i.e., moldboard plow). Double-mass curves of runoff for no-till and permanent meadow documented the significant and immediate reduction in runoff from the no-till management. Runoff was generated at a rate of 4.9 mm y–1 (0.19 in yr–1) during the no-till period compared with permanent pasture at 44 mm y–1 (1.73 in yr–1) (no-till was 11% of the meadow rate). The asymptotic CN (CNi) for the 48-year record of continuous no-till corn practice at WS191 decreased substantially to 66.3 (–24.3 CN units) from the period of conventional corn in rotation on the same site. The Natural Resources Conservation Service handbook value for no-till CN was 16 CN units larger at 82. The larger than expected reduction in CN was probably due the presence of a thriving earthworm population and numerous earthworm-created macropores that enhance infiltration. The CN for the mulchtilled corn culture treatment (74.6) was lower than conventional corn (90.6 largest) by 16 CN units. CN was surprisingly high (77.4) for a watershed in continuous meadow, which was similar to mulch-tilled corn. The wheat years in rotation also had some of the smallest CN values (63.7), suggesting a smaller CN for a practice similar to that used in organic agriculture today. Continuous no-till corn had a slightly larger CN (66.3) than meadow (61.9) in the CWMM rotation, suggesting that simple grass establishment can be as effective as longterm no-till to reduce runoff. CN of approximately 60 was the lowest found. The results are applicable for areas of similar terrain, management practices, geology, soils, subsoil permeability, and climate of the NAEW watersheds. Differences between handbook and measured CN suggest that local values are more representative than handbook values.";"Bonta, J. V.

We analyze both the economic–theoretical foundations of virgin natural resource taxation, and the empirical experiences of aggregates taxes i.e., taxes on, for instance, gravel, rock, stone, etc. in three European countries. These include Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The theoretical analysis indicates that taxing natural resource output or use typically represents a ‘second-best’ policy alternative, which can be used when, for instance, the monitoring of non-point source emissions is difficult or efficient property rights regimes cannot be established. The empirical analysis shows that the European aggregate taxes have assisted in reducing virgin resource use in spite of the relatively low own-price responses. However, generators of recycled materials typically have few incentives to enhance their waste sorting activities in the presence of a tax on virgin materials. Unless additional policies to increase the supply of recycled materials are implemented, supply will not increase much even in the presence of high demand. Finally, although second-best taxes are sometimes motivated by the desire to keep administration costs low, they could come at the cost of improper incentives and of limited policy legitimacy.";"Söderholm, Patrik";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"150;SWE;GBR;DNK";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600002564";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.05.011";"";"";"";"911-922"

The objectives of this field study were to: (1) examine runoff water quality characteristics following land application of manure to sites with and without wheat residue, (2) compare the water quality impacts of land application of manure to meet 0-, 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-year P-based requirements for corn, and (3) evaluate the effects of varying runoff rates on runoff nutrient loads. Three 30-min simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were applied at an intensity of 70 mm h-1 to 0.75 m wide by 2.0 m long plots on which manure has been previously applied and incorporated. Runoff loads of dissolved phosphorus (DP), total phosphorus (TP), NO3-N, NH4-N, and total nitrogen (TN) were significantly greater on the plots with residue cover. Manure application rate significantly influenced runoff loads of DP, TP, NO3-N, NH4-N, and TN. No significant differences in runoff loads of DP and TP were found between sites where manure was applied to meet a 1-year or 2-year P requirement for corn. However, runoff loads of DP and TP were significantly greater on the sites where manure was applied to meet a 4-year rather than a 2-year P requirement. Each of the measured water quality parameters except electrical conductivity (EC) was significantly influenced by runoff rate. The application of manure to meet multiple-year crop nutrient requirements may increase nutrient loads in runoff.";"Thayer, C.A.

"AGRIS:US201400190422";"Environmental factors of spatial distribution of soil salinity on flat irrigated terrain";"";"Inefficient irrigation and the excessive use of water on agricultural land in the Aral Sea Basin over several decades have led to saline soils. The main objective of this paper is to identify the environmental predictors to model the spatial distribution of soil salinity in a highly irrigated landscape. Soil salinity at farm scale was measured in the topsoil (Total Dissolved Solids, TDS) and down to a depth of 1.5m by electromagnetic conductivity meter (CMv) over a regular grid covering an area of approximately 15km² in Khorezm Province, Uzbekistan. Six nested samplings within selected grids were conducted to reveal short-distance variation. Apart from widely-used terrain indices and those acquired from remote sensing, data on distance to drainage channels and long-term average groundwater observations were used to account for local parameters possibly influencing soil salinity. Topsoil salinity (TDS) was seen to be highly variable even at short distances (40m) compared to average bulk soil salinity (CMv). CMv readings were better correlated with factors obtained from remote sensing and distance to drains than TDS. This might be attributable to the fact that topsoil salts are dynamic in nature, and land management practices (e.g. leaching, cultivation, and irrigation) might have contributed considerably to spatial variation. The CMv shows the average amount of salt within a larger soil volume and to greater depth and is less affected by land management than topsoil salinity, which is reflected in the TDS. Most terrain indices showed a low correlation with topsoil and bulk salinity. There was a strong indication that the effects of water management are dominant and tend to outweigh the effects of environmental factors. The very low R² for relationship of TDS with environmental factors is evidence that taking TDS samples close to the soil surface is not a good way to assess salinity trends in irrigated land. These findings have important implications for salinity survey methods on flat irrigated terrain: CMv seems to be a more reliable predictor than environmental proxy factors, even if the latter are easier to determine.";"Akramkhanov, A.

"AGRIS:US201400049032";"Origins, Nature, and Content of the Right to Property: Five Economic Solitudes";"";"The thesis of this article is that the now extensive contemporary literature on the economics of property rights has generated more heat than light. Economists have invoked at least five distinct theories of ownership or property rights in their work. Unfortunately, authors frequently fail to acknowledge the existence of competing theories of property rights that stand as conceptual rivals to the theory that they, often implicitly, invoke. Nowhere is this problem more evident than in the literature on regulatory takings, a literature that has a justifiable reputation for its inconsistent conclusions. Other fields in which theories of property rights play an important role include intellectual property, the economics of contracts, competition analysis and policy, externalities, and the economics of information. This article compares and evaluates five competing theories of property rights that have been advanced and used by economists: classical liberalism, utilitarianism, legal positivism, pragmatism, and modern libertarianism. These theories present divergent accounts of the origin and the nature of ownership claims. They also conceptualize the evolution of ownership institutions as well as ownership patterns quite differently. There are also important differences in incentives that exist under institutional regimes based on each theory. Le présent article repose sur la thèse selon laquelle la volumineuse littérature contemporaine sur l’économie des droits de propriété génère plus de controverse que d’explications. Les économistes ont invoqué au moins cinq théories distinctes de la propriété ou des droits de propriété dans leurs travaux. Malheureusement, les auteurs omettent fréquemment de tenir compte de l’existence de théories des droits de propriété concurrentielles qui se présentent sous l’étiquette de rivales conceptuelles à la théorie qu’ils ont, souvent implicitement, invoquée. Ce problème n’est nulle part plus évident que dans la littérature sur l’expropriation indirecte, une littérature qui possède une réputation justifiée en raison de ses conclusions contradictoires. La théorie des droits de propriété joue également un rôle important dans d’autres domaines, tels que la propriété intellectuelle, l’économie des contrats, l’analyse et la politique de la concurrence, l’externalité et l’économie de l’information. Le présent article compare et évalue cinq théories des droits de propriété concurrentielles avancées et utilisées par les économistes : le libéralisme classique, l’utilitarisme, le positivisme juridique, le pragmatisme et le libertarisme moderne. Ces théories présentent des versions divergentes de l’origine et de la nature des revendications de propriété. Elles conceptualisent également l’évolution des institutions et des structures de propriété de façon totalement différente.

The question is about how to introduce this shift. This paper discusses five different options for power supply, metering and energy pricing in the farm sector and the expected outcomes of implementing each vis-a-vis efficiency of groundwater and energy use, equity in access and sustainability of groundwater. It concludes that establishing an energy quota for each farm-based on sustainability considerations, and metering and charging pro rata for power used are the best options to manage groundwater and the energy economy.";"Kumar, M.

"AGRIS:US201500067747";"Chemical weathering rates of silicate-dominated lithological classes and associated liberation rates of phosphorus on the Japanese Archipelago—Implications for global scale analysis";"";"Lithology is an important characteristic of the terrestrial surface, whose properties influence chemical weathering rates. Specifically non-silicate minerals may contribute significantly to the weathering derived fluxes from silicate-dominated lithological classes. The Japanese Archipelago consists of predominantly silicate-dominated lithologies with a high proportion of volcanics. However, the spatially explicit representation of chemical weathering rates remains difficult for such a large region, because many controlling factors on chemical weathering rates are correlated with each other. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of lithology, a multi-lithological model approach to estimate spatially explicit chemical weathering rates for unmonitored areas is applied here. To achieve this, hydrochemical data of 381 catchments are used to train a set of models, recognizing the contribution of a variety of proposed factors influencing chemical silicate rock weathering rates (CSRWR: cations plus dissolved silica flux). The monitored catchments cover ~44% of the Japanese Archipelago. Cation chemical weathering rates (excluding Si) are linearly correlated with CSRWR and show outliers if basic volcanics or pyroclastic flows are present due to increased silica release rates. Lithology and runoff are identified as the strongest predictors for chemical weathering rates. Temperature and gradient of slope are of less relevance for the regional scale prediction while further proposed factors like soil properties or land cover are not identified as major predictors. Latter findings are partly attributed to geodata quality, low variability of parameter values as well as spatial correlations of proposed controlling factors with lithology or runoff. The calculated average CSRWR of the Archipelago is ~25tkm⁻²a⁻¹ and ranges from 5.9 to 107tkm⁻²a⁻¹ in monitored catchments. Weathering rates per lithological class as a function of runoff can be grouped into three classes: a) pyroclastic flows showing the highest chemical weathering rates; b) alluvial deposits, mixed sediments and basic to intermediate volcanics with medium rates; and c) metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, acid volcanics, acid plutonics and unconsolidated sediments (other than alluvial deposits), showing the lowest rates. The recognition of lithogenic sulfur would add 9.7% to CSRWR of considered catchments. Results suggest that the lithological classes acid volcanics and unconsolidated sediments contribute above average to the sulfur fluxes. Possible biases of this observation are discussed. The contribution of Ca-fluxes from non-silicate calcic minerals (named Ca-excess, Ca-fluxes in addition to silicate Ca-fluxes) is about 10% of the CSRWR on average and is attributed by a wide value range. The calculated ratio “Ca-excess to total Ca-fluxes” from chemical weathering averages around 62%, 75%, 56%, 83% and 84% for the lithological classes acid plutonics, metamorphics, siliciclastic sediments, mixed sediments and acid volcanics, respectively. This suggests a major Ca-contribution from non-silicate calcic minerals for these lithological classes. Phosphorus release from rocks due to chemical weathering is estimated to be between 1kg Pkm⁻²a⁻¹ and 390kgPkm⁻²a⁻¹. The P-release patterns in dependence of runoff per lithological class are different from CSRWRs due to differences of applied P-content in rocks. The identified spatial P-release patterns suggest that the consideration of dynamic and spatially resolved P-release rates by chemical weathering might improve ecosystem studies. Later findings may be of importance for analysing the influence of P-release from rocks on the climate system via ecosystem functioning on geological time scales. A first application of the P-release model to the global scale suggests an annual release of 1.6Mt P (13.8kgPkm⁻¹a⁻¹) by chemical weathering of silicate dominated lithological classes (excluding carbonate sedimentary rocks).";"Hartmann, Jens

"AGRIS:US201600076902";"foundations of planetary agrarianism. Thomas Berry and Liberty Hyde Bailey";"";"The challenge of pursuing sustainability in agriculture is often viewed as mainly or wholly technical in nature, requiring the reform of farming methods and the development and adoption of alternative technologies. Likewise, the purpose of sustainability is frequently cast in utilitarian terms, as a means of protecting a valuable resource (i.e., soil) and of satisfying market demands for healthy, tasty food. Paul B. Thompson has argued that the embrace of these views by many in the consumer/environmental movement enables easy co-optation by agribusiness. It also reflects a critical weakness in this movement: a lack of commitment to philosophical principles that depart from the utilitarian premises of the industrial model of agriculture. This paper draws on the writings of Thomas Berry and Liberty Hyde Bailey to identify the philosophical principles of what we call planetary agrarianism. From the perspective of planetary agrarianism, the pursuit of sustainability is a broad and challenging moral, educational, and political task. Berry helps us see that it is fundamentally a project of worldview transition, which requires a new cultural narrative that must rival, in form and appeal, the mythic power of the utilitarian industrial vision. Liberty Hyde Bailey, author of The Holy Earth (1915) and a leader in the land-grant education and nature-study movements, took up the project of worldview transition in his life work. While in some ways dated and flawed, Bailey’s writings are a valuable source of guidance for developing and pursuing a viable philosophy of agriculture for the 21st century.";"Morgan, Paul A.

We carried out a 5-year (2010 to 2014) study to characterize the soil erosion and nitrogen and phosphorus losses caused by rainfall under different fertilizer application levels in order to provide a theoretical evidence for the agricultural production and coordinate land management to improve ecological environment. The experiment took place under rotation cropping, winter wheat-summer maize, on a 15° slope purple soil in Chongqing (China) within the Three Gorges Region (TGR). Four treatments, control (CK) without fertilizer, combined manure with chemical fertilizer (T1), chemical fertilization (T2), and chemical fertilizer with increasing fertilization (T3), were designed on experimental runoff plots for a long-term observation aiming to study their effects on soil erosion and nutrients losses. The results showed that fertilization reduced surface runoff and nutrient losses as compared to CK. T1, T2, and T3, compared to CK, reduced runoff volume by 35.7, 29.6, and 16.8 %, respectively and sediment yield by 40.5, 20.9, and 49.6 %, respectively. Regression analysis results indicated that there were significant relationships between soil loss and runoff volume in all treatments. The combined manure with chemical fertilizer (T1) treatment highly reduced total nitrogen and total phosphorus losses by 41.2 and 33.33 %, respectively as compared with CK. Through this 5-year experiment, we can conclude that, on the sloping purple soil, the combined application of manure with fertilizer is beneficial for controlling runoff sediments losses and preventing soil erosion.";"Bouraima, Abdel-Kabirou

In this paper, an integrated watershed model considering important hydrological processes has been presented for the event based runoff simulation. Green–Ampt–Mein–Larson model has been used for the estimation of infiltration. For runoff estimation, kinematic wave equations are solved for a channel network using finite-element method. Remotely sensed data have been used for evaluating land use/land cover data. Geographical information systems have been used for the preparation of digital elevation model and various thematic maps. The developed integrated model has been applied to Harsul watershed in India. Calibration of the model has been carried out using six rainfall events and validation with four rainfall events. From the results, it is seen that the model is able to simulate the hydrographs with reasonable accuracy. A sensitivity analysis of the model has also been carried out. The developed model is useful for runoff estimation in small watersheds.";"Reddy, K. Venkata

Resulting Landsat-based estimates maintained consistency with the MODIS VCF in both epochs (RMSE =8.6% in 2000 and 11.9% in 2005), but showed improved accuracy in agricultural areas and increased discrimination of small forest patches. Against lidar measurements, the Landsat-based estimates exhibited accuracy slightly less than that of the MODIS VCF (RMSE=16.8% for MODIS-based vs. 17.4% for Landsat-based estimates), but RMSE of Landsat estimates was 3.3 percentage points lower than that of the MODIS data in an agricultural region. The Landsat data retained the saturation artifact of the MODIS VCF at greater than or equal to 80% tree cover but showed greater potential for removal of errors through calibration to lidar, with post-calibration RMSE of 9.4% compared to 13.5% in MODIS estimates.

We have mapped the concentrations of these elements and identified the major influences on their distributions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We sampled the topsoil at 125 sites across 1,050� km² of peri-urban land to the south east of the city on two grids, one nested inside the other. At each site, we measured the current contents of the four trace elements in the soil. We used robust geostatistical methods to model the complex spatial distributions of the data as mixtures of fixed and random effects. The empirical best linear unbiased predictor was used to map the elements. Site descriptors (lithology, land cover, cultivation, relief, erosion, and stoniness) were then included as covariates to identify significant effects on trace element concentrations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The complex spatial distributions of the elements seem to arise from several sources. The concentrations generally increase from southeast to northwest, i.e., with increasing proximity to Madrid itself, the main potential source of pollution. This pattern is clear for lead and similar for copper and zinc, though with “hot spots” at or near industrial sites. The spatial pattern of cadmium is more complex and depends on varied lithology, industry, and land use such as irrigation and cultivation. In general, the concentrations of the four elements appear to decrease with increases in stoniness and erosion, and to be largest on the valley floors. CONCLUSIONS: Robust geostatistical methods enabled us to analyze and map the complex patterns of spatial variation of trace elements in a peri-urban region of Madrid. They show that distance to the city center, lithology, manufacturing industry, and cultivation all play their parts in loading the soil with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium. In the event, none of the metals has yet exceeded the legislative thresholds, but some concentrations are already substantially greater than would arise from natural sources, especially closest to Madrid itself.";"Vázquez de la Cueva, Antonio

In recent years, Chongqing and its surroundings have been experiencing severe environmental problems, such as urbanization, pollution, and deforestation, due to the rapid economic development of China’s inland region. Understanding the current land-cover status over a wide scale, as well as changes in land-cover over time, are necessary for improving the urban environment and implementing conservation measures in the Chongqing region. In this study, remote-sensing data from 1993 and 2001 were used to analyze land-cover changes. Due to the distinctive mountainous topography of Chongqing, digital topography data shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM)-3 were also used. The results of the analysis showed that urban area increased from 109.91� km² (5.7%) in 1993 to 166.84� km² (8.7%) in 2001. This increase came at the expense of agricultural and vegetated areas. Although irrigated paddy field and dry farm land decreased due to the development, these two land-cover categories still covered the largest agricultural area. Correlating the land-cover changes with different topography types, the results showed that forest covered a larger area and enjoyed a higher frequency of distribution at higher elevations and on steeper slopes. The increase in urban area, in contrast, was apparently associated with lower elevations and milder slopes. These results indicate that incorporating terrain characteristics into remote-sensing analysis can be a useful tool in developing conservation measures for vegetated and agricultural areas.";"Zhao, Yi

The aim of this paper is to identify the geogenic and agricultural controls on the elemental composition of European, grazing and agricultural soils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Robust factor analysis was applied to data series for Al, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, S, Se, Sr, U, Zn (ICP-MS) and SiO2, K2O, Na2O, Fe2O3, Al2O3 (XRF) based on the European GEMAS dataset. In addition, the following general soil properties were included: clay content, pH, chemical index of alteration (CIA), loss on ignition (LOI), cation exchange capacity (CEC), total organic carbon (TOC) and total carbon and total sulfur. Furthermore, this dataset was coupled to a dataset containing information of historic P₂O₅ fertilization across Europe. Also, a mass balance was carried out for Cd, Cu and Zn to determine if concentrations of these elements found in the soils have their origin in historic P₂O₅ fertilization. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Seven geogenic factors and one agricultural factor were found of which four prominent ones (all geogenic): chemical weathering, reactive iron-aluminum oxide minerals, clay minerals and carbonate minerals. Results for grazing and agricultural soils were near identical, which further proofs the prominence of geogenic controls on the elemental composition. When the cumulative amount of P₂O₅ fertilization was considered, no extra agriculture-related factors became visible. The mass balance confirms these observations. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the geological controls are more important for the soil chemistry in agricultural and grazing land soils than the anthropogenic controls.";"Saaltink, Rémon

Traditional asset classes considered available for investment include various equity market indices, commercial REITs, corporate bonds of investment- and sub investment grade, government bonds and treasury bills, corporate bonds, ex-U.S. equity indices, short term interest rate indexes, and commodity investments.  Unlevered farmland returns were constructed at the state level as the sum of cash rent and capital gains less property taxes as a fraction of asset values.  In addition, a unique, high quality data set comprised of the returns to all managed farmland properties in the NCREIF Farmland Index was also considered.  A traditional optimal E-V frontier is first identified considering optimal financial-asset only portfolios in the absence of the farmland asset class.  Results show that, relative to financial-asset only portfolios, the inclusion of farmland significantly improves the risk-efficiency of the optimal E-V frontier.  To address potential aggregation and smoothing biases, farmland returns are systematically penalized through reduced returns and increased variability.  While the mix and shares of farmland investments under these restrictions are reduced, the fundamental result remains that farmland investments significantly improve the risk-efficiency of mixed-asset portfolios.";"Hennings, Enrique

In addition to direct habitat loss, the rapid extinction of many species that are unique to these systems can be attributed to landscape deterioration through the lack of appropriate management. In this paper, we propose to use of an ecosystem classification technique that integrates potential natural vegetation distribution as a reference framework for coastal dune EU Habitats (92/43) distribution analysis and assessment. As an example, the present study analyses the EU Habitats distribution within a hierarchical ecosystem classification of the coastal dune systems of central Italy. In total, 24 land elements belonging to 8 land units, 5 land facets, 2 land systems and 2 land regions were identified for the coastal dunes of central Italy, based on diagnostic land attributes. In central Italy, coastal dune environments including all the beach area, mobile dunes and all the fixed-dune land elements contain or could potentially hold at least one EU habitat of interest. Almost all dune slack transitions present the potentiality for the spontaneous development of EU woodlands of interest. The precise information concerning these ecosystems distribution and ecological relationships that this method produces, makes it very effective in Natura 2000 European network assessment. This hierarchical ecosystem classification method facilitates the identification of areas to be surveyed and eventually bound, under the implementation of EU Habitat directive (92/43) including areas with highly disturbed coastal dune ecosystems.";"Carranza, Maria Laura

"AGRIS:US201400165288";"Changes in some soil properties induced by re-conversion of cropland into grassland in the semiarid steppe zone of Inner Mongolia, China";"";"AIMS: “Grain for Green Program” (GGP), i.e., re-conversion of cropland into forest or grassland, initiated by Chinese government has a profound impact on mitigating environmental degradation. The objectives of this study were to assess the changes of some soil properties during the processes of re-conversion from cropland to grassland over time in the semiarid steppe region of north China. METHODS: Two sites with different ages of re-conversion were selected for measurements of organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), bulk density (BD) and grain size distribution. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined by the constant hydraulic head method and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity by disc infiltrometer at tensions of 30, 60 and 150 mm. Soil water content was measured using the gravimetric method. Wetting front depths in the soil after rainfall were also recorded at the study sites. RESULTS: Natural grasslands had higher belowground biomass than re-converted grasslands. Re-converted grasslands had lower SOM and TN at depths of 0–20 cm and higher saturated hydraulic conductivity at depths of 0–10 cm than natural grassland. The natural grassland soils had higher soil water contents in the surface soil (0–20 cm) and lower soil water contents at deeper depths than re-converted grassland soils. Soil aggregate stability reached the natural steppe level 12 years after re-conversion. CONCLUSIONS: The recovery of soil properties after GGP appeared to be slow, and these properties did not return to natural grassland status before cultivation after 12 years of re-conversion.";"Zhang, Zhi-Hua

"AGRIS:US201500015718";"LandCaRe DSS – An interactive decision support system for climate change impact assessment and the analysis of potential agricultural land use adaptation strategies";"";"Decision support to develop viable climate change adaptation strategies for agriculture and regional land use management encompasses a wide range of options and issues. Up to now, only a few suitable tools and methods have existed for farmers and regional stakeholders that support the process of decision-making in this field. The interactive model-based spatial information and decision support system LandCaRe DSS attempts to close the existing methodical gap. This system supports interactive spatial scenario simulations, multi-ensemble and multi-model simulations at the regional scale, as well as the complex impact assessment of potential land use adaptation strategies at the local scale. The system is connected to a local geo-database and via the internet to a climate data server. LandCaRe DSS uses a multitude of scale-specific ecological impact models, which are linked in various ways. At the local scale (farm scale), biophysical models are directly coupled with a farm economy calculator. New or alternative simulation models can easily be added, thanks to the innovative architecture and design of the DSS. Scenario simulations can be conducted with a reasonable amount of effort. The interactive LandCaRe DSS prototype also offers a variety of data analysis and visualisation tools, a help system for users and a farmer information system for climate adaptation in agriculture. This paper presents the theoretical background, the conceptual framework, and the structure and methodology behind LandCaRe DSS. Scenario studies at the regional and local scale for the two Eastern German regions of Uckermark (dry lowlands, 2600 km²) and Weißeritz (humid mountain area, 400 km²) were conducted in close cooperation with stakeholders to test the functionality of the DSS prototype. The system is gradually being transformed into a web version (http://www.landcare-dss.de) to ensure the broadest possible distribution of LandCaRe DSS to the public. The system will be continuously developed, updated and used in different research projects and as a learning and knowledge-sharing tool for students. The main objective of LandCaRe DSS is to provide information on the complex long-term impacts of climate change and on potential management options for adaptation by answering “what-if” type questions.";"Wenkel, Karl-Otto

Model performance was evaluated at the event scale by using a database reporting hydrological, geomorphologic and land use data collected during a 2-year period. Seventeen events were modelled and compared with the corresponding observations at the watershed outlet. The model performed well in predicting the largest runoff volumes, as shown by the high values achieved for the coefficients of efficiency (E = 0·89) and determination (r2 = 0·92). However, some events resulted in zero runoff simulation. The prediction capability for peak flow and sediment yield was poor (E = 0·35 and 0·16, respectively). This inaccuracy can have several causes: the internal model deficiencies may be due to the incomplete representation of watershed complex processes, while external problems may be related to the conditions within the modelled watershed and the quality of recorded data. On the whole the AnnAGNPS model may be considered as being suitable to simulate the significant runoff events in the experimental watershed. However, the model may be seen as better suited for comparative assessments of alternative management and policy scenarios and for gross estimation of nutrient loads rather than the precise prediction of a single event, consequently helping in the prediction of land degradation problems in the experimented conditions.";"Zema, D.A.

To detect the extent of urban expansion, data from Landsat satellite images were analyzed using ERDAS IMAGINE, ENVI, and ArcGIS segmentation, classification, and mapping tools. The land tenure security situation was assessed through interviews with local farmers. Analysis shows high rates of spatial urban expansion, but stagnating levels of property registration and certification among peri-urban landholders, affecting their feelings of land tenure security. Though Ethiopia's efforts to impart land tenure security by implementing low-cost land registration programs in rural areas are promising, the programs in peri-urban areas are underdeveloped, and these areas are subject to expropriation due to urban expansion. Policies for more sensitive growth are needed in rapidly developing places like these.";"Agegnehu, Sayeh Kassaw

"AGRIS:US201500199424";"Assessing land cover and soil quality by remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS)";"";"Precise soil quality assessment is critical for designing sustainable agriculture policies, restoring degraded soils, carbon (C) modeling, and improving environmental quality. Although the consequences of soil quality reduction are generally recognized, the spatial extent of soil degradation is difficult to determine, because no universal equation or soil quality prediction model exists that fits all ecoregions. Furthermore, existing soil organic C (SOC) models generate estimates with uncertainties that may exceed 50%. Therefore it is possible that drastic changes in soil quality may be occurring in sites which are not identifiable on existing maps. Soil quality can either be directly inferred from SOC concentration, or through the assessment of the soil physical, chemical and biologic properties. Assessing the spatial distribution of SOC over large areas requires the calibration and development of models derived from laboratory or field based techniques. However, mapping SOC concentration in all soils is logistically challenging by using normal standard survey techniques. The availability of new generations of remotely sensed datasets and geographical information system (GIS) models (i.e. GEMS, RothC, and CENTURY) provides new opportunities for predicting soil properties and quality at different spatial scales. This article discusses the current approaches, identifies gaps and proposes improvements in techniques for measuring soil quality within agricultural fields.";"de Paul Obade, Vincent

Even if the dataset is limited, geostatistics can provide a valid estimation tool through a weighted moving average interpolation (kriging). Often, however, the spatial variability of soil properties appears smoothed and short range variability is underestimated by this kind of interpolation technique. A more realistic distribution of a given variable on the territory can be obtained through models based on stochastic simulation. The study area was located in Abruzzo region, Central Italy, in the Soil Region 61.3 as defined by the European Soil Bureau, and includes an economically relevant viticulture district (Controguerra “DOCG area of Colline Teramane”). Relationships between soil type distribution and terrain attributes – slope, incoming solar radiation, NDVI, TWI, etc. – were established, and the most significant were used in a multinomial logistic regression to generate simulated maps. These maps, derived from a set of measured point data, auxiliary information from a Digital Terrain Model and Landsat images, were compared with the soil subsystem map 1:250,000, realized by ARSSA. The comparison indicated that the simulated distribution of the soil classes is consistent with the pedological map and fits better with the local morphology.";"Marchetti, Alessandro

The data quality is a very important issue in landslide studies, and more accurate results will be achieved if the data is adequate, appropriate and drawn from a wide range of parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of the occurrence of landslides in Trabzon province, situated in north east Turkey. This was achieved using the following five methods the frequency ratio model, AHP, the statistical index (Wi), weighting factor (Wf) methods, and the logistics regression model, incorporating a Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. In Trabzon province there has been an increasing occurrence of landslides triggered by rainfall. These landslides have resulted in death, significant injury, damage to property and local infrastructure and threat of further landslides continues. In order to reduce the effects of this phenomenon, it is necessary to scientifically assess the area susceptible to landslide. To achieve this, landslide susceptible areas were mapped the landslide occurrence parameters were analyzed using five different methods. The results of the five analyses were confirmed using the landslide activity map containing 50 active landslide zones. Then the methods giving more accurate results were determined. The validation process showed that the Wf method is better in prediction than the frequency ratio model, AHP, the statistical index (Wi), and logistics regression model.";"Yalcin, A.

Primary data on the farming activities of the project farmers during the 2001/02 seasons and the projects' records for the period of 1995/96 to 2001/02 were summarised into socio-economic and financial performance indicators. In the Sepeteri Project, a revenue recovery level of 96% was estimated. The project is not financially viable as only 29% of its recurrent expenditure is covered. The farmers do not show commitment to making the project successful. An approximate 67% social capacity level was estimated. The relative irrigation cost and profit indexes do not show sufficient evidence that farmers would prefer irrigation farming to rain-fed farming. The Itoikin Project records a lower revenue recovery level of 75%. The project covers about 50% of its recurrent expenditure. In addition, the farmers do not appear to have a commitment to making the project successful, with a 33% social capacity level. A number of problems may be the causes of unprofitable irrigated cropping. If government increases the subvention, the O-ORBRDA prioritises irrigation service in disbursing the subvention to the projects, and the project manages the risks in the project sites, conscientises and incorporates the intended beneficiaries into managing the projects, the projects would be equipped to supply more irrigation services thereby making it more profitable and encouraging more participation of the intended beneficiaries. This would improve the socio-economic and financial performance of the projects.";"Olubode-Awosola, O.O.

We present a methodology to determine the upper and lower bounds of AOD estimates that allow the subsequent calculation of a biophysical variable of interest to a pre-determined precision. Knowledge of that range can be used to identify an appropriate method for estimating AOD. We applied the methodology to Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data in Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and determined that AOD must be estimated within approximately 0.05 of actual AOD for retrieval of foliage projective cover (FPC) to a precision of 10%. That knowledge was then used to determine the relative merit of using a fixed constant, Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) climatology, or dense dark vegetation (DDV) method for estimating AOD in QLD and NSW. It was found that using a fixed AOD of 0.05 allows estimates of FPC within 10% of their true value when the true value of AOD is less than 0.1. Such AOD values account for approximately 90% of all inland observations and 65% of coastal observations as determined by analysis of data obtained from AERONET. Using an AERONET climatology to estimate AOD was found to increase the likelihood of accurate FPC retrieval in coastal locations to 83%, although it should be noted that AERONET data are very sparse. DDV has potential in eastern and central areas for retrieving AOD observations with greater precision than fixed values or climatologies. However, more work is needed to understand the temporal variation of vegetation reflectance before the DDV method can be used operationally.";"Gillingham, S.S.

Decisions on the selection of the most suitable change detection method is often influenced by the study region landscape complexity and the type of data used for analysis. For different climatic areas, the method that suits best the seasonal land-cover change identification remains uncertain. In this study, 11 different binary change detection methods were tested and compared with respect to their capability in detecting land-cover change/no-change information in different seasons. The methods include image differencing (I_Diff), Improved image differencing (Imp_Diff), principal component image differencing (PC_Diff), vegetation index differencing (VI_Diff), change vector analysis (CVA), image ratioing (IR), improved image ratioing (Imp_IR), vegetation index image ratioing (VI_R), multi-date principal component analysis (PCA) using all bands (M_PCA), two-date bands PCA (B_PCA), and two-date vegetation index images PCA (VI_PCA). Multi-Date Thematic Mapper (TM) data were used for a wide set of change image generation. A relatively new approach was applied for optimal threshold value determination for the separation of change/no-change areas. Research results indicated that any methods involving TM Band 4 performed better than those using TM Band 3 or 5 on each of the change periods. However, irrespective of the method used, the accuracy assessment and change/no-change validation results from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based techniques outperformed all other tested techniques in the change detection process (overall accuracy >90% and kappa value >0.85 for all six change periods). The image differencing technique was found to be marginally better than PCA and IR in most cases and any of these techniques can be used for change detection. However, because of the simplistic nature and relative ease in identifying both negative and positive changes from difference images, the NDVI differencing technique is recommended for seasonal land-cover change identification in the study region.";"Sinha, Priyakant

During the post-treatments (i.e. between June 2004 and 2005), we monitored tree stump total kill, partial kill and the responses of woody species to disturbances, in terms of coppicing and seedling regeneration. Protection from disturbance promoted seedling regeneration by 4.6%. The effects of tree cutting and fire greatly reduced woody species regeneration, while tree cutting and fire combined with grazing treatment was more effective in reducing coppicing. The fire and grazing methods were effective in reducing the regeneration of seedlings, although grazing alone had no effect. The effect of the tree cutting was comparable with tree cutting and fire, as well as tree cutting and fire combined with grazing on woody species regenerations. Overall, tree cutting and fire combined with grazing were more effective in suppressing the regeneration of encroaching species. We identified two major disturbance strategies. Some species invested in coppicing, while others invested in seedling recruitment. About 10% of the species were adapted relatively to either of the strategies. Only one of the 29 woody species was ranked among the top five in both of the two disturbance-adaptation strategies. The results have important implications for post-treatment management and public education.";"Angassa, Ayana

The distribution pattern of carbon and inorganic nitrogen dissolved forms, as well as the major ion and biogenic gas concentrations in the streamwater, was similar in pristine streams, indicating that the C and N dynamics were determined by influence of some factors, such as climate, atmospheric deposition, geology, soil type, and land covering, which were analogous in the forested watersheds. The urban streams were significantly different from the pristine streams, showing low dissolved oxygen concentrations, high respiration rates, and high concentrations of carbon dioxide, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic carbon, and major ion. These differences were attributed to anthropogenic impact on water quality, especially domestic sewage discharge. Additionally, in the Indaiá stream, it was possible to observe the importance of rainfall over temporal dynamics of dissolved carbon forms, and also, the obtained specific flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was relatively elevated (approximately 11 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹). These results reveal the influence of human activity over the biogeochemistry of coastal streams and also indicate the importance N export of Atlantic Forest to the ocean.";"Andrade, Tatiana M. B.

For this assessment, a sampling and modeling approach is used. This paper provides a technical overview of the modeling approach used in CEAP cropland assessment to estimate the off-site water quality benefits of conservation practices using the Ohio River Basin (ORB) as an example. The modeling approach uses a farm-scale model, Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX), and a watershed scale model (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT]) and databases in the Hydrologic Unit Modeling for the United States system. Databases of land use, soils, land use management, topography, weather, point sources, and atmospheric depositions were developed to derive model inputs. APEX simulates the cultivated cropland, Conserve Reserve Program land, and the practices implemented on them, whereas SWAT simulates the noncultivated land (e.g., pasture, range, urban, and forest) and point sources. Simulation results from APEX are input into SWAT. SWAT routes all sources, including APEX’s, to the basin outlet through each eight-digit watershed. Each basin is calibrated for stream flow, sediment, and nutrient loads at multiple gaging sites and turned in for simulating the effects of conservation practice scenarios on water quality. Results indicate that sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads delivered to the Mississippi River from ORB could be reduced by 16, 15, and 23%, respectively, due to current conservation practices. Modeling tools are useful to provide sciencebased information for assessing existing conservation programs, developing future programs, and developing insights on load reductions necessary for hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.";"Santhi, C.

"AGRIS:US201400105445";"integrated methodology to assess future water resources under land use and climate change: an application to the Tahadart drainage basin (Morocco)";"";"The assessment of freshwater resources in a drainage basin is not only dependent on its hydrologic parameters but also on the socio-economic system driving development in the watershed area; the socio-economic aspect, that is often neglected in hydrologic studies, is one of the novelties of this study. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) presenting an integrated working methodology and (2) studying a local case of a North African watershed where scarce field data are available. Using this integrated methodology, the effects of climate and land use change on the water resources and the economic development of the Tahadart drainage basin in Northern Morocco have been evaluated. Water salinization, tourism, urbanization, and water withdrawals are a threat to water resources that will increase with future climate change. The Tahadart Basin (Morocco 1,145� km²) is characterized by rain-fed agriculture and by the presence of two water retention basins. Assessment of the effects of climate and land use change on this drainage basin was based on current and future land cover maps obtained from spatial interactions models, climate data (current and future; scenario A1b for the period 2080–2100), and hydrological models for water budget calculations. Land use suitability maps were designed assuming a A1b Special Report on Emissions Scenarios socio-economic development scenario. The most important conclusions for the period 2080–2100 are the following: (1) Freshwater availability within the watershed will likely be affected by a strong increase in evaporation from open water surface bodies due to increased temperature. This increase in evaporation will limit the amount of freshwater that can be stored in the surface reservoirs. (2) Sea level rise will cause flooding and salinization of the coastal area. (3) The risk for drought in winter is likely to increase. The methodology used in this paper is integrated into a decision support tool that is used to quantify change in land use and water resources.";"Antonellini, M.

Unfortunately, land use and management legacies can constrain the structure of biotic communities such that they fail to reflect habitat quality. The purpose of this study was to describe patterns in fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, and evaluate relationships between biota and habitat characteristics in the Chariton River system of south-central Iowa, a system likely influenced by various potential management legacies (e.g., dams, chemical removal of fishes). We sampled fishes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and physical habitat from a total of 38 stream reaches in the Chariton River watershed during 2002–2005. Fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were dominated by generalist species tolerant of poor habitat quality; assemblages failed to show any apparent patterns with regard to stream size or longitudinal location within the watershed. Metrics used to summarize fish assemblages and populations [e.g., presence–absence, relative abundance, Index of Biotic Integrity for fish (IBIF)] were not related to habitat characteristics, except that catch rates of piscivores were positively related to the depth and the amount of large wood. In contrast, family richness of benthic macroinvertebrates, richness of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera taxa, and IBI values for benthic macroinvertebrates (IBIBM) were positively correlated with the amount of overhanging vegetation and inversely related to the percentage of fine substrate. A long history of habitat alteration by row-crop agriculture and management legacies associated with reservoir construction has likely resulted in a fish assemblage dominated by tolerant species. Intolerant and sensitive fish species have not recolonized streams due to downstream movement barriers (i.e., dams). In contrast, aquatic insect assemblages reflected aquatic habitat, particularly the amount of overhanging vegetation and fine sediment. This research illustrates the importance of using multiple taxa for biological assessments and the need to consider management legacies when investigating responses to management and conservation actions.";"Quist, Michael C.

"AGRIS:US201301685031";"Modeling the land requirements and potential productivity of sugarcane and jatropha in Brazil and India using the LPJmL dynamic global vegetation model";"";"The governments of Brazil and India are planning a large expansion of bioethanol and biodiesel production in the next decade. Considering that limitation of suitable land and/or competition with other land uses might occur in both countries, assessments of potential crop productivity can contribute to an improved planning of land requirements for biofuels under high productivity or marginal conditions. In this paper we model the potential productivity of sugarcane and jatropha in both countries. Land requirements for such expansions are calculated according to policy scenarios based on government targets for biofuel production in 2015. Spatial variations in the potential productivity lead to rather different land requirements, depending on where plantations are located. If jatropha is not irrigated, land requirements to fulfill the Indian government plans in 2015 would be of 410 000 to 95 000 km2 if grown in low or high productivity areas respectively (mean of 212 000 km2). In Brazil land requirements, are of 18 000-89 000 km2 (mean of 29 000 km2), suggesting a promising substitute to soybean biodiesel. Although future demand for sugarcane ethanol in Brazil is approximately ten times larger than in India, land requirements are comparable in both countries due to large differences in ethanol production systems. In Brazil this requirement ranges from 25 000 to 211 000 km2 (mean of 33 000 km2) and in India from 7000 to 161 000 km2 (mean 17 000 km2). Irrigation could reduce the land requirements by 63% and 41% (24% and 15%) in India (Brazil) for jatropha and sugarcane respectively.";"Lapola, David M.

"AGRIS:US201600198553";"Quantifying land surface temperature change from LISA clusters: An alternative approach to identifying urban land use transformation";"";"Despite the potential to provide new insight into the underlying heterogeneity of urban thermal landscapes, local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) remains underutilized in land surface temperature (LST) related study. The present research applies local Moran's I as a unique approach to recognize the pattern of statistically significant LST increase by detecting clusters of localized hot spots. The single channel algorithm has been applied to extract LST from nine temporal Landsat datasets ranging from 2001 to 2013. LST difference maps generated with 2001 as the base year have been filtered by local Moran's I at four different spatial weights (90m, 120m, 150m and 200m) to represent a spatially homogeneous form of LST clusters. Smaller spatial weights are useful to map more localized and specific pattern of urban LST change, whereas larger spatial weights produce a somewhat generalized pattern, useful for studying the coarse scale phenomenon. Integrating LISA clusters to the temperature-vegetation (TVX) feature space validates the hot spots as areas with significant land use transformations in the last decade. Further, the spatial sector-wise concentration of hot spots throughout the time series determines the direction and magnitude of urban expansion. The study provides innovative insights on how the integrated application of local Moran's I on LST change and TVX can be used to delineate the regions of acute land transformation and, in turn, act as a decision-making tool for urban planning.";"Das Majumdar, Dipanjan

It creates unique opportunities and a potential for enhancing the management and use of land in the future to increase the output of agricultural products. Using expert forecasts and a specially developed methodology, calculations on the potential for crop yields and total crop output in Latvia for 2020 were performed based on the utilized agricultural area, composition of sown area, and type of farming in 2012. In the calculations the following indicators were taken into account: increases in crop yields in the current area and, the production of crops in the area that was not exploited in 2012. It was determined that in Latvia in 2020 compared with 2012, there would be good opportunities for enhancing the efficiency of use of land for all groups of agricultural crops. Yet, to ensure the exploitation of an additional area, long-term investments of 120-156 million lats are required, of which half is investment in machinery and equipment. The source of long-term investments will be support measures of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, yet, provisionally at least a fourth of the public funding intended for investment in agriculture has to be allocated to these measures.";"Pilvere, I., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia)

In these steps, the area works were the first one. In the areas by using GPS of the roads, parcels, and pond co-ordinate points were red. To prepare detailed geological maps, lithological formation borders were determined and to analyse soil structure of working areas, at 42 different points and depths soil samples were taken. After area works, soil, geological, percolation and roads maps  prepared and these parameters were linked to each other to make query.At the end of the project, first existing land use position of area was fixed by determination of parcel areas and crop design. The total area of whole parcels was defined with crop design from past to future. The characteristic features of soil like slope, drainage, erosion, stones etc. were connected with each others and then distribution of CaCO3 , pH, Salt etc. elements in the area were determined. According to type of crop, the suitable area was fixed. In this manner, land use planning could be done.The digital elevation model of the area prepared and the air photographs which belong to 1980 and 1999 were compared to determine the changes of the pond.

Annual alienation of agricultural lands and arable fields under housing construction and industrial buildings, roads and other economic object leads to implacable decline of agricultural areas. Absence of new lands, suitable for agricultural use, promotes increase of agricultural productivity by means of intensification of producing process. Effective use of every acre of agricultural lands allows getting more and more production without expansion. The main problem of the research is a development of scientific foundations of intensive systems of land utilization for specialized agriculture upon perfection of soil-and-ecological crop rotations, cropping pattern systems and their rational combinations with fertilizing systems and crop-protection measures. The article demonstrates the results of 50-year research in long-term stationary experiments on sod-podzolic light loamy soil on the study of land use systems on the basis of the improvement of various types and kinds of crop rotations, cropping patterns and their combination with fertilizer systems. In course of the study there were realized the following seminal works which have important scientific and practical importance for arable farming in Belarus. 1. Possibility of specialization of crop rotations in the conditions of intensification of arable farming. Intensive resource-saving crop rotations for farms specializing in dairy and meat production. 2. Complex influence of different types and kinds of crop rotations and fertilizer systems on productivity of arable lands. 3.Evaluation of crops as preceding crops in crop rotations. Growing of grain, cereal, leguminous and perennial legume grasses and row crops in various types of crop rotations. 4. Structure of arable lands for farms which specialize in dairy and meat production, as well as the modernization of sowing areas for agricultural organizations in the Republic. 5. Agronomic and economic evaluation of application of intermediate crops in crop rotations. 6.

Because increasing tree cover can outcompete herbaceous vegetation (e.g., forbs and grasses), woodland expansion resulted in reduced herbaceous cover and increased soil exposure, leading to increased runoff and erosion. To improve hydrologic function in these degraded woodlands, an overstory thinning and slash-mulch treatment was applied to more than 1 000 hectares within Bandelier National Monument (New Mexico, United States) between 2007 and 2010. Our objective was to develop a remote sensing strategy to quantify land-cover changes following mechanical treatment of piÃ±on-juniper woodlands. In this study, we 1) established a simple and repeatable method for assessing treatment effectiveness using high-resolution satellite imagery, 2) quantified vegetation response at six times since treatment (from 0.5 to 3.5 years), and 3) delineated areas of degraded woodland before and after treatment. We classified a 2006 QuickBird satellite image (before treatment) and a 2011 WorldView image (after treatment) to map tree cover, herbaceous cover, bare soil, and shadow with average overall accuracies of 95.0% and 94.7% for the 2006 and 2011 images, respectively. Following treatment, average tree cover, bare soil, and bare soil patch size decreased 9%, 4%, and 18%, respectively, while herbaceous cover increased 14%. Overall, the total amount of woodland area classified as degraded decreased by 34% post treatment. By comparison, control areas remained relatively unchanged across the same time period. Our results demonstrate the utility and promise of high-resolution satellite imagery to inform rapid and objective assessments of landscape-scale restoration treatments.";"Meddens, A.J.H.

L’approche d’estimation du taux d’adoption utilisée dans ce papier se fonde sur les théories modernes  d’évaluation au niveau micro-économique des impacts d’interventions politiques.  Nos résultats montrent que 39% de la population guinéenne connaissaient au moins une variété NERICA en 2001 avec 23% pour le taux d’adoption observé au sein de la population de riziculteurs. Plusieurs facteurs socio-économiques déterminent les taux de diffusion et d’adoption. Par ailleurs bien que le taux d’adoption ait connu une croissance de 1996 à 2001, il est resté inférieur au taux d’adoption potentiel (53%) si tous les paysans avaient accès aux semences de NERICA en 2001.

"AGRIS:FR2016207339";"Assessing community-level and single-species models predictions of species distributions and assemblage composition after 25 years of land cover change";"";"To predict the impact of environmental change on species distributions, it has been hypothesized that community-level models could give some benefits compared to species-level models. In this study we have assessed the performance of these two approaches. We surveyed 256 bird communities in an agricultural landscape in southwest France at the same locations in 1982 and 2007. We compared the ability of CQO (canonical quadratic ordination; a method of community-level GLM) and GLMs (generalized linear models) to i) explain species distributions in 1982 and ii) predict species distributions, community composition and species richness in 2007, after land cover change. Our results show that models accounting for shared patterns between species (CQO) slightly better explain the distribution of rare species than models that ignore them (GLMs). Conversely, the predictive performances were better for GLMs than for CQO. At the assemblage level, both CQO and GLMs overestimated species richness, compared with that actually observed in 2007, and projected community composition was only moderately similar to that observed in 2007. Species richness projections tended to be more accurate in sites where land cover change was more marked. In contrast, the composition projections tended to be less accurate in those sites. Both modelling approaches showed a similar but limited ability to predict species distribution and assemblage composition under conditions of land cover change. Our study supports the idea that our community-level model can improve understanding of rare species patterns but that species-level models can provide slightly more accurate predictions of species distributions. At the community level, the similar performance of both approaches for predicting patterns of assemblage variation suggests that species tend to respond individualistically or, alternatively, that our community model was unable to effectively account for the emergent community patterns.";"Baselga, Andrés

"AGRIS:US201600059998";"Identification of environmental anomaly hot spots in West Africa from time series of NDVI and rainfall";"";"Studies of the impact of human activity on vegetation dynamics of the Sahelian belt of Africa have been recently re-invigorated by new scientific findings that highlighted the primary role of climate in the drought crises of the 1970s–1980s. Time series of satellite observations revealed a re-greening of the Sahelian belt that indicates no noteworthy human effect on vegetation dynamics at sub continental scale from the 1980s to late 1990s. However, several regional/local crises related to natural resources occurred in the last decades despite the re-greening thus underlying that more detailed studies are needed. In this study we used time-series (1998–2010) of SPOT–VGT NDVI and FEWS–RFE rainfall estimates to analyse vegetation – rainfall correlation and to map areas of local environmental anomalies where significant vegetation variations (increase/decrease) are not fully explained by seasonal changes of rainfall. Some of these anomalous zones (hot spots) were further analysed with higher resolution images Landsat TM/ETM+ to evaluate the reliability of the identified anomalous behaviour and to provide an interpretation of some example hot spots. The frequency distribution of the hot spots among the land cover classes of the GlobCover map shows that increase in vegetation greenness is mainly located in the more humid southern part and close to inland water bodies where it is likely to be related to the expansion/intensification of irrigated agricultural activities. On the contrary, a decrease in vegetation greenness occurs mainly in the northern part (12°–15°N) in correspondence with herbaceous vegetation covers where pastoral and cropping practices are often critical due to low and very unpredictable rainfall. The results of this study show that even if a general positive re-greening due to increased rainfall is evident for the entire Sahel, some local anomalous hot spots exist and can be explained by human factors such as population growth whose level reaches the ecosystem carrying capacity as well as population displacement leading to vegetation recovery.";"Boschetti, Mirco

Development would be at a crossroads: either institutional structure needs changing or it risks a full-fledged collapse. Yet, instead of focusing on the enigma between economic growth versus ‘perverse’ institutions, this contribution posits a functionalist argument that the persistence of institutions points to their credibility. In other words, once institutions persist they fulfill a function for actors. Chinese institutions have been frequently criticized for lack of security, formality and transparency, yet paradoxically, these apparently ‘perverse’, inefficient institutions have sustained since the late 1970s throughout the entire economic boom.

Motivated by our fieldwork, and using a spatial-temporal model, we focus on the paths of forest degradation and regeneration and villagers' utility before and after an access restriction is introduced. Our paper illustrates a number of key points for policy makers. First, the benefits of forest conservation tend to be greatest in the first few periods after an access restriction is introduced, after which the overall forest quality often declines. Second, villagers may displace their NTFP collection into more distant forests that may have been completely protected by distance alone before access to a closer forest was restricted. Third, permitting villagers to collect limited amounts of NTFPs for a fee, or alternatively fining villagers caught collecting illegally from the protected forest, and returning the fee or fine revenue to the villagers, can improve both forest quality and villagers' livelihoods.";"Robinson, Elizabeth J.Z.

"AGRIS:US201600059994";"Assessing reference dataset representativeness through confidence metrics based on information density";"";"Land cover maps obtained from classification of remotely sensed imagery provide valuable information in numerous environmental monitoring and modeling tasks. However, many uncertainties and errors can directly or indirectly affect the quality of derived maps. This work focuses on one key aspect of the supervised classification process of remotely sensed imagery: the quality of the reference dataset used to develop a classifier. More specifically, the representative power of the reference dataset is assessed by contrasting it with the full dataset (e.g. entire image) needing classification. Our method is applicable in several ways: training or testing datasets (extracted from the reference dataset) can be compared with the full dataset. The proposed method moves beyond spatial sampling schemes (e.g. grid, cluster) and operates in the multidimensional feature space (e.g. spectral bands) and uses spatial statistics to compare information density of data to be classified with data used in the reference process. The working hypothesis is that higher information density, not in general but with respect to the entire classified image, expresses higher confidence in obtained results. Presented experiments establish a close link between confidence metrics and classification accuracy for a variety of image classifiers namely maximum likelihood, decision tree, Backpropagation Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that spatially-continuous reference datasets (e.g. a square window) have the potential to provide similar classification confidence as typically-used spatially-random datasets. This is an important finding considering the higher acquisition costs for randomly distributed datasets. Furthermore, the method produces confidence maps that allow spatially-explicit comparison of confidence metrics within a given image for identification of over- and under-represented image portions. The current method is presented for individual image classification but, with sufficient evaluation from the remote sensing community it has the potential to become a standard for reference dataset reporting and thus allowing users to assess representativeness of reference datasets in a consistent manner across different classification tasks.";"Mountrakis, Giorgos

Then, a statistical redundancy analysis (RDA) is carried out to identify certain ultimate socioeconomic and political drivers of these environmental impacts.

This study tested four commonly used spectral data treatment strategies for endmember derivation, including original spectra, image fusion via principal component analysis, spectral normalization, and the minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation. Land cover endmembers derived using each strategy were used to build a linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) model in order to unmix treated image pixels into fraction maps, and an urban imperviousness map was generated by combining the fraction maps representing imperviousness endmembers. A cross-map comparative analysis was then performed to rank the four data treatment types based on such common evaluation indices as the coefficient of determination (R²) and root mean square error (RMSE). A Landsat 7 ETM+ multispectral image covering the metropolitan region of Shanghai, China was used as the primary dataset, and the model results were evaluated using high-resolution colorinfrared aerial photographs of roughly the same time period. The test results indicated that, with the highest R²(0.812) and the lowest RMSE (0.097) among all four preprocessing treatments, the endmembers in the form of MNF-transformed spectra produced the best model output for characterizing urban impervious surfaces. The outcome of this study may provide useful guidance for future impervious surface mapping using medium-resolution remote sensing data.";"Wang, Wei

The tools feature spatial multicriteria analysis as the means to make spatially explicit trade-offs between stakeholder objectives in three different ways: as colors on multiple printed maps, qualitatively on a single digital map and quantitatively on a single digital map. An interactive mapping device is used as the interface between spatial information and participants. A series of controlled experiments was conducted with 30 participants, who were asked to use the tools and perform specific individual and group allocation tasks. Data on the responses of the participants were collected through questionnaires, observer notes, video film and multicriteria scores. The analysis focused on three aspects of effectiveness: usefulness of the tools; clarity of tool information; and impact on decisions. The findings of this analysis are discussed within the context of the information offered by the tools, individual and collaborative work of participants and the spatial and numerical quality of the resulting land use plans. From the experiments, it is clear that the cognitive effort related to the volume and format of information is a critical issue in spatial decision support. This holds true for both the level of detail per item of information and the amount of information to be supplied to the participants. Although the quantitative tool provided the most information, the participants did not consider this tool the most useful and it did not produce the best results.";"Arciniegas, Gustavo

Based on the land demand prediction of grain demand, the land demand prediction of economic crop production, and the land requirement goal, factors affecting the requirement goals of cultivated land resources are discussed. Linear Prediction Model and Polynomial Forecasting Model are used to discuss the goal forecast of cultivated land resources based on time series, which provides basis for decision making of land use in Anqiu City within planning period. Result shows that total area of cultivated land increases year by year and the per capita cultivated land is relatively stable. Proportion of irrigated cultivated land in cultivated land is decreasing gradually and that of dry land is increasing. Dynamic change of cultivated among township streets shows no significant regional differences. Due to the increase of population, per capita cultivated land will be under great pressure and the situation of cultivated land is still not optimistic.";"Wu, Jun

"AGRIS:US201500217572";"conceptual framework and its software implementation to generate spatial decision support systems for land use planning";"";"In a context where several sectors of society compete for space, land use types must be carefully designed and spatially allocated to guarantee a sufficient level of relevant ecosystem services (ES) in a territory of interest. In this respect, contemporary land use planning involves multiple, often conflicting objectives and criteria. Consequently, major benefits can be expected from spatial decision support systems (sDSS) designed to deal with complex spatial allocation problems. This paper presents the generic conceptual framework ‘OSMOSE’ and its free and open source software implementation, for the generation of specific sDSSs for spatial land use planning. The specific sDSSs generated with OSMOSE are meant to (i) identify land units which meet multiple predefined ES-attribute values for a specific land use type (LUT) and (ii) rank land units for a given LUT according to these multiple ES-attributes. A complementary purpose is to (i) identify and (ii) rank LUTs for a given land unit. Whereas ‘identification’ is done by means of a threshold query, ‘ranking’ is based on the Iterative Ideal Point Thresholding (IIPT) method. The proposed framework is extremely flexible as it can accommodate differentially weighted, continuous and/or ordinal attributes with, for the latter, equal or unequal number of classes, alternative land unit definitions and land use types. Moreover, assessments cannot only be made using ES-levels for the land unit/LUT combinations but also in terms of changes in ES-levels after a particular change of LUT. The OSMOSE framework is illustrated by means of the specific sDSS BoLa which is generated to support land use planning in the region of Flanders (Belgium) with focus on soil protection. Four cases are presented in which the decision support varies between the available approaches (threshold – selection, threshold – ranking, IIPT – selection, IIPT – ranking).";"De Meyer, Annelies

Protections are built into the method to preclude royalties that would be unfair to either the licensee or licensor. Unlike the cost- or income-based methods used in current practice, the described method does not require any assumptions about the future and is therefore immune to the uncertainties and possible inaccuracies that are inherent to prospective valuations. Although forecasting is needed for some purposes, such as for certain tax purposes or for the overall valuation of a company by stock analysts, the described retrospective valuations can be usefully applied for setting royalty rates that closely track and reflect changes in market conditions, patent protection, and product design.";"Wilson, Blake S.";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400055518";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-010-9172-9";"";"";"";"124-133"

Therefore, before designing any instruments for the regulation of both RES and land-use, the most essential step is to explore investment possibilities in different contexts. This paper intends to locate and quantify the potentials of biomass, wind and solar as well as to explore some of the potential planning issues associated with their development.

One of the main aims of the political ecology concerns the understanding of the environmental conditions that can underlies the social conflict among people. Such understanding needs to be based on a detailed investigation of the natural resources of the landscape, mainly the soils. Few years ago the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs financed a soil survey with a humanitarian purpose: the development of a peace plan between Peru and Ecuador by improving the socio-economic conditions of the rural populations living in the areas close to the border. To achieve such goal, the construction of an irrigation canal was planned to irrigate few hundred hectares in the province of Ayabaca, on the border between Peru and Ecuador. To be soundly planned and designed, the canal project was obviously based on a preliminary soil survey that is essential to assess the irrigation suitability of the land. In this work, the authors illustrate the soil characteristics within the study area, their suitability for irrigation and the key aspects for future land uses, highlighting the philosophy followed in applying the land evaluation system which took into consideration the social, cultural and humanitarian purposes of the soil survey.

This paper uses an ecosystem services framework to explore alternative management scenarios with different objectives (production, biodiversity, floodwater storage, agri-environment and income) for two rural floodplains in England. Each scenario featured different types of land cover and hydrological management. The results revealed the key role of the hydrological regime in shaping ecosystem service provision in floodplains. Both conflicts and synergies were apparent. Scenarios with deep water tables and low flood frequencies had high scores for agricultural production and flood storage capacity, but low scores for environmental outcomes. Scenarios with shallow water tables and frequent flooding showed high scores for environmental and cultural outcomes, but at the cost of a reduced flood storage capacity and increased flood risk. The scope for multiple benefits has implications for the realignment of policies to realize extra value from floodplain ecosystems.Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Guest editor M.C.

Understanding the local politics surrounding the mapping and protection of transhumance corridors is important for policy formulation. This study reports the findings of group meetings in nine local districts (communautés rurales) in eastern Senegal about recently mapped corridors. The focus of our observations include local perceptions of 1) the benefits and costs of corridors, 2) the effect of the recognition of corridors on competing land uses (particularly farming), 3) the need for and means to recognize and protect corridors, and 4) the appropriate level of authority to recognize and protect corridors. Our findings show significant geographical variation within the study area as to the perceived benefits and costs of corridors, with a major distinction between groups who view the function of corridors as protecting local farms from livestock passing through and those that understand corridors as critical for facilitating access to pastures. Given the significant overlap among multiple formal and informal poles of authority, the politics surrounding corridor delineation and protection are shaped less by the perceived costs to competing land uses than by contestation over the authority that designation and protection would require.

Ten factors such as slope, aspect, elevation, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land cover, precipitation, distance to fault, distance to drainage, and distance to road were considered. Landsat ETM⁺images were used for NDVI and land cover maps. A landslide inventory map of the study area was identified by a SPOT 5 satellite after which fuzzy algebraic operators were applied to the fuzzy membership values of landslide susceptibility mapping. In addition, FR and LR models were applied to determine the landslide susceptibility. The three models are validated using the receiver operating characteristic and the area under which curve values were calculated. The validation results showed that the LR model (accuracy is 96 %) has better prediction than fuzzy logic (accuracy is 95 %) and FR (accuracy is 94 %) models. Also, among the fuzzy operators, the gamma operator (λ = 0.975) showed the best accuracy (94.64 %) while the fuzzy OR operator when applied showed the worst accuracy (85.11 %).";"Shahabi, Himan

"AGRIS:DJ2012064641";"Links between stream reach hydromorphology and land cover on  different spatial scales in the Adour-Garonne Basin (SW France) Relations entre l’hydromorphologie de section de cours d’eau et l’occupation  du sol à différentes échelles spatiales dans le bassin Adour-Garonne (S-O  France)";"";"We report an investigation aimed at improving the understanding of the relationships  between hydromorphology and land cover, and in particular aimed at identifying the spatial  scale on which land cover patterns best account for the hydromorphology at a stream reach.  This investigation was carried out in the Adour-Garonne basin. Several key findings  emerged from the use of a new modeling procedure called “Random Forests”. Firstly, we  established a typology of sites showing an upstream/downstream gradient structured by  geographical descriptors and catchment hydromorphological features. Secondly, we found  that the relationships between hydromorphology and the different spatial scales of land  cover responded to a longitudinal gradient. Upstream, no noticeable difference was  observed whatever the land cover pattern considered, whereas downstream, larger scales  were strongly related to the hydromorphology. Thirdly, a specific land cover effect on  each hydromorphological type was seen. Along the gradient, the contribution of the land  cover variables structuring the hydromorphological types decreased and become homogeneous.  Fourthly, stronger correlations were established with individual hydromorphological  variables using the larger scales of land cover. This paper contributes to a better  understanding of landscape ecology and fits well with the European Water Framework  Directive that requires long-term sustainable management. In the context of natural  conditions, we advise that the catchment scale should be given high priority when  connected with land cover/uses; local and riparian environments being more valuable and  complementary in the case of impacted sites.  <br>  Nous présentons les résultats d’une étude destinée à accroître la compréhension des  relations entre l’hydromorphologie d’une portion de cours d’eau et l’occupation du sol, et  particulièrement à identifier l’échelle spatiale pour laquelle l’emprise de l’occupation  du sol est la plus déterminante. Cette étude a été conduite dans le bassin Adour-Garonne.  Plusieurs résultats majeurs ont émergé suite à l’utilisation d’une technique récente de  modélisation appelée «Ramdom Forests». Premièrement, nous avons mis en évidence une  typologie des sites d’étude, montrant un gradient amont/aval, structurée à la fois par les  descripteurs géographiques et les caractéristiques hydromorphologiques des bassins.  Deuxièmement, nous avons trouvés que les relations entre l’hydromorphologie et les  différentes échelles spatiales répondaient également à un gradient longitudinal. Dans les  zones amont, aucune différence notables n’a été observée quelque soit le type d’occupation  du sol considéré, alors qu’en aval, les larges échelles spatiales étaient plus étroitement  reliées à l’hydromorphologie. Troisièmement, il a été observé un effet spécifique de  l’occupation du sol sur chaque type d’hydromorphologie. Le long du gradient, la  contribution des variables d’occupation du sol structurant les types d’hydromorphologie  décroissait pour ensuite devenir homogène. Quatrièmement, les relations les plus fortes  ont été établies entre les variables hydromorphologiques et les variables d’occupation du  sol pour les échelles les plus larges. Cet article, contribuant à une meilleure  compréhension de l’écologie du paysage, est en accord avec la Directive Cadre Européenne  prônant une gestion durable de l’environnement. Dans le contexte de conditions naturelles,  nous recommandons de prendre en compte prioritairement l’échelle du bassin versant lorsque  des connexions sont établies avec l’occupation du sol; l’environnement local ou rivulaire  étant complémentaire et plus pertinent dans le cadre de sites impactés.";"Tudesque L.

"AGRIS:US201300738321";"Use of Felled Junipers to Protect Streamside Willows From Browsing";"";"Willow (Salix) communities are important components of riparian ecosystems. However, browsing by livestock and wildlife species can negatively impact willow size and abundance, and make restoration efforts difficult. A common solution has been fencing of affected willows to exclude ungulates, but fencing is expensive and may not complement desirable land management strategies. An alternative to fencing is the use of structures that limit access to streamside willows, without excluding ungulate access to the entire riparian zone. We examined the use of felled western juniper trees (Juniperus occidentalis Hook) placed over streamside willow shrubs. Four replicates of felled western juniper treatments (covered) and noncovered treatments were applied to a 1.2-km length of stream in southeastern Oregon. Willows (< 2 m) within treatment areas were censused, tagged, examined for evidence of browse-use, and measured for maximum height during August 2002, before treatment. Posttreatment measurements were made in August and October 2003. Results indicate that by August 2003 (posttreatment) the average growth of willows in covered treatments was 25 cm (480%) greater than in noncovered treatments. By October 2003 (posttreatment), more shrubs were browsed in noncovered (84%) than covered (39%) treatments. Our data suggest that covering small willow shrubs (< 2 m tall) with felled western juniper is an effective deterrent to browsing.";"Matney, C.A.

"AGRIS:US201600191233";"Using social marketing concepts to promote the integration of systematic conservation plans in land-use planning in South Africa";"";"Local land-use planning procedures are increasingly recognized as potentially crucial to ensure off-reserve biodiversity protection. Mainstreaming systematic conservation planning maps in these decision-making procedures has been proposed as a mechanism to achieve this. However, research is lacking on how to convince officials and politicians to change their behaviour and include the maps in their decision-making. Social marketing is a tool commonly used to effect behaviour change in many sectors but its application in conservation is limited. In the formative research phase of a social marketing study we interviewed locally elected politicians in four coastal municipalities in South Africa. We found that conservation and environmental issues play virtually no role in their work; however, they do attribute value to the natural environment. Land-use planning procedures are considered important but dysfunctional and the role of conservation is perceived negatively in their municipalities. Their information-seeking behaviour is clearly localized. We present a marketing analysis of these results and argue for improving the attractiveness of the product: the maps should be more option- than veto-based and should identify locally relevant ecosystem services. Locally significant information should be provided at a time and location convenient for politicians. We conclude that engagement with councillors should be proactive, refer to land-use planning and services from ânatureâ rather than âbiodiversityâ and use terminology and information that is locally oriented and meaningful from the politician's perspective. The analysis highlights the usefulness of the marketing approach for conservation.";"Wilhelm-Rechmann, Angelika

Oil palm development can create societal benefits, but doubt has been raised about whether the SABL developers intend establishing plantations. Here, we examine the development objectives of these proposals through an assessment of their land suitability, developer experience and capacity, and sociolegal constraints. Our review reveals 36 oil palm proposals with plantings planned for 948,000 ha, a sevenfold increase over the existing planted area in PNG. Based on our criteria, however, we estimate that only five plantations covering 181,700 ha might eventuate within the foreseeable future. We conclude that most of the developers are clearing forest with no intention of cultivating oil palm, and that a large‐scale land grab is therefore occurring in PNG under the guise of oil palm development.";"Nelson, Paul N.

"AGRIS:US201400150047";"Mining and the African Environment";"";"Africa is on the verge of a mining boom. We review the environmental threats from African mining development, including habitat alteration, infrastructure expansion, human migration, bushmeat hunting, corruption, and weak governance. We illustrate these threats in Central Africa, which contains the vast Congo rainforest, and show that more than a quarter of 4,151 recorded mineral occurrences are concentrated in three regions of biological endemism—the Cameroon‐Gabon Lowlands, Eastern DRC Lowlands, and Albertine Rift Mountains—and that most of these sites are currently unprotected. Threats are not uniform spatially, and much of the Congo Basin is devoid of mineral occurrences and may be spared from direct mining impacts. Some of the environmental impacts of African mining development could potentially be offset: mining set‐asides could protect some wildlife habitats, whereas improving transportation networks could increase crop yields and spare land for conservation. Research and policy measures are needed to (1) understand the synergies between mining and other development activities, (2) improve environmental impact assessments, (3) devise mitigation and offsetting mechanisms, and (4) identify market choke points where lobbying can improve environmental practice. Without careful management, rapid mining expansion and its associated secondary effects will have severe impacts on African environments and biodiversity.";"Edwards, David P.

The study took place in the Guánica Commonwealth Forest. Our objective was to assess the long-term effects of previous land use on this forest--i.e., its species composition, structure, and functioning. Previous land-use types included houses, farmlands, and charcoal pits. Stands with these land uses were compared with a nearby mature forest stand. The speed and path of forest recovery after deforestation and land-use abandonment depended on the conditions of the land. Study areas where land uses had removed the forest canopy and altered soil conditions (houses and farmlands) required a longer time to recover and had a different species composition than study areas where land uses retained a forest canopy (charcoal pits). Different forest attributes recovered at different rates. Crown area index, stem density, and litterfall rate recovered faster than stemwood and root, biomass, tree height, and basal area. Where previous land uses removed the canopy, Leucaena leucocephala, a naturalized alien pioneer species, dominated the regrowth. Native species dominated abandoned charcoal pits and mature forest. The change in species composition, including the invasion of alien species, appears to be the most significant long-term effect of human use and modification of the landscape.";"Colón, Sandra Molina

"AGRIS:US201400003114";"Hunting management in relation to profitability aims: red-legged partridge hunting in central Spain";"";"Game management is widely implemented in Spain, affecting more than 70 % of land cover. Management intensity may be linked to the financial aims of hunting estates, but no study of these aspects has been developed in Spain, where commercial hunting is common. Through interviews with game managers and field surveys, we quantified physical and economic traits, management techniques, and hunting methods in a sample of 59 small-game hunting estates located in south-central Spain (where red-legged partridge hunting has the highest socioeconomic importance in the country). We compared non-commercial estates (aimed for leisure, managed mainly by local hunting societies) and commercial estates (aimed at financial benefit); among the latter, we also assessed “intensive” estates (a special category of commercial estates licensed to release farm-reared partridges without temporal or numerical limits throughout the hunting season). Commercial estates had more intensive management, including more and larger partridge releases, higher density of supplementary feeders and more intensive predator control. Thus, any positive or negative effects on biodiversity of these management techniques would be higher in commercial than in non-commercial estates. Commercial estates also retained more natural vegetation, which may help to enhance the landscape and biodiversity value of farmland in central Spain. On the other hand, differences in management and hunting styles were most marked between intensive and other type of estates (both commercial and non-commercial); this indicates that intensive estates are qualitatively different from other small-game estates, both ecologically (hunting based on releases and driven shooting) and economically (higher inputs and outputs). It would be desirable to find ways to quantify the environmental or social costs and benefits of different management techniques, and integrate them in the economics of hunting estates.";"Arroyo, Beatriz

We hypothesized that controls over spatial variation in DOM quantity and composition (measured with DOM optical properties) differ based on the source of DOM to aquatic ecosystems. DOM quantity and composition should be better predicted by land cover in aquatic habitats with allochthonous DOM and related more strongly to nutrients in aquatic habitats with autochthonous DOM. Three habitat types [rivers (R), rivermouths (RM), and the nearshore zone (L)] associated with 23 tributaries of the Laurentian Great Lakes were sampled to test this prediction. Evidence from optical indices suggests that DOM in these habitats generally ranged from allochthonous (R sites) to a mix of allochthonous-like and autochthonous-like (L sites). Contrary to expectations, DOM properties such as the fluorescence index, humification index, and spectral slope ratio were only weakly related to land cover or nutrient data (Bayesian R ² values were indistinguishable from zero). Strongly supported models in all habitat types linked DOM quantity (that is, dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC]) to both land cover and nutrients (Bayesian R ² values ranging from 0.55 to 0.72). Strongly supported models predicting DOC changed with habitat type: The most important predictor in R sites was wetlands whereas the most important predictor at L sites was croplands. These results suggest that as the DOM pool becomes more autochthonous-like, croplands become a more important driver of spatial variation in DOC and wetlands become less important.";"Larson, James H.

The 415km² watershed in the northern Central Valley, California is covered by 31% of native vegetation and the remaining 69% of agricultural fields (primarily alfalfa, tomatoes, and rice). Stream discharge and weekly DOC concentrations were measured at eight nested subwatersheds to estimate the DOC loads and yields (loads/area) using the USGS developed stream load estimation model, LOADEST. Stream DOC concentrations peaked at 18.9mgL⁻¹ during summer irrigation in the subwatershed with the highest percentage of agricultural land use, demonstrating the strong influence of agricultural activities on summer DOC dynamics. These high concentrations contributed to DOC yields increasing up to 1.29gm⁻² during the 6 month period of intensive agricultural activity. The high DOC yields from the most agricultural subwatershed during the summer irrigation period was similar throughout the study, suggesting that summer DOC loads from irrigation runoff would not change significantly in the absence of major changes in crops or irrigation practices. In contrast, annual DOC yields varied from 0.89 to 1.68gm⁻²yr⁻¹ for the most agricultural watershed due to differences in winter precipitation. This suggests that variability in the annual DOC yields will be largely determined by the winter precipitation, which can vary significantly from year to year. Changes in precipitation patterns and intensities as well as agricultural practices have potential to considerably alter the DOC dynamics.";"Oh, Neung-Hwan

Nevertheless, different algorithms may exhibit different performances for the same optimization problem. Comparison of some classic optimization approaches in this article aims to select the best method for retrieving aerosol opacity, or even for other parameters, from remotely sensed data. Eight frequently used optimization algorithms were evaluated using both simulated data and actual AATSR (advanced along track scanning radiometer) data. Several typical land cover types and aerosol opacity levels were also considered in the simulations to make the tests more representative. It was observed that the absolute error in retrieval would rise after a certain number of iterations due to the round-off error, and the algorithms showed different performances in the inversions without any a priori knowledge. When combined with reasonable a priori knowledge, the selection of various algorithms only slightly affected the retrieval accuracy. Given a summary of all the comparison tests, a special class named ‘trust-region methods’ (TR) was demonstrated to be the optimal choice in general cases. In contrast, some widely used optimization methods in aerosol research, for example, the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm, seemed not to display a persuasive performance.";"Mu, Xihan

FC counts varied spatially in relation to land use and human population and resulting trophic status. These were highest in catchments with a high cover of improved pasture (which was assumed to be a proxy for cattle and sheep grazing densities) and significant human populations. FC counts were lowest in oligotrophic upland areas, where domesticated animal populations were low. In both lowland and upland catchments, peak FC counts occurred under periods of elevated flows during summer. However, in lowland agricultural catchments of higher trophic status, contamination appears to be chronic and occurs all year round. In contrast, upland headwater catchments exhibit more episodic peaks in relation to high flow events. Larger scale catchments integrate the inputs from contrasting head water streams. Spatial variations in stream FC concentrations can be predicted to a first approximation using multiple regression based on catchment characteristics. Land cover was the most important factor, with percentage improved pasture being the primary control and human population being of secondary importance. These two factors could explain 78% of the variation in mean annual FC concentrations and 65% of the 95th percentile. This simple linear model provides a screening tool for rapid assessment of pollution risk in unmonitored catchments. However, improved prediction of short-term dynamics and peak values requires higher resolution sampling and process-based models of FC production, survival and transport. A particularly important need is an improved characterisation of the hydrological connectivity which controls the flux from pollutant reservoirs on the landscape into river channel networks.";"Tetzlaff, D.

The soils were sampled in a dry-to-wet seasonal transition. Values of the red-green-blue (RGB), cyan-magenta-yellow-key black (CMYK), L*a*b*, and hue-intensity-saturation (HIS) color models were determined using the digital software Adobe PhotoshopTM. Land degradation produced significant variations (p < 0.05) in R, C, Y, L*, a*, b*, S, and I values (p < 0.05). The seasonal transition produced significant variations (p < 0.05) in R, G, B, C, M, K, L*, b*, and I values. In discriminating the soils, the color models did not differ in discriminatory power, while discriminatory power was affected by seasonal changes. Most color variation patterns had nonlinear relationships with the intensity of the land degradation gradient, due to effects of fire that darkened the deciduous forest soil, masking the nature of the soil as the intermediate between the evergreen forest and the bare ground soils. Taking these findings into account, the utilization of color profiling of soils in land conservation and rehabilitation is discussed.";"Doi, Ryoichi

"AGRIS:US201400185274";"Reprint of: When peer-reviewed publications are not enough! Delivering science for natural resource management";"";"Over the last century, natural resource management on forest lands has shifted from a singular focus on resource extraction to many foci, such as recreation, tourism, conservation, view-scapes, cultural and spiritual values, sustainability, and other values. As a result, the information needs of land managers must now include social and cultural values. In addition, the public's interest in having greater participation in land management decisions and in generating scientific knowledge has never been greater. The generation of scientific knowledge which is expressed primarily through conventional means – such as peer-reviewed publications targeting academics and technology transfer (e.g., patents, licenses, agreements) primarily for government and industry – does not always satisfy the needs of resource managers and public. In recent decades, there has been rapid growth of methods to help bridge this gap by better connecting new knowledge and knowledge generation with public needs. The U.S. Forest Service is making science delivery as important goal as science creation, including structural institutional changes at the interface among researchers, resource managers, and the public, allocating an appropriate portion of project funding specifically for delivery. The Forest Service is considering increasing its use of citizen science and participatory research – which brings resource managers, decision makers, and the public into the research process to varying extents – as part of the agency's science delivery efforts. Here we explore citizen science and participatory research as possible vehicles to augment existing science delivery efforts from the perspective of a federal land management agency. We found that these mechanisms facilitate public involvement in fundamentally different ways. Depending on the type of research and desired use of research outcomes, either citizen science or participatory research could enhance the use of science in some natural resource management discussions, possibly leading to supportable solutions.";"McKinley, Duncan C.

"AGRIS:US201400155125";"proximity of a field plot and land-use choice: implications for land consolidation";"";"Traditional methods in agricultural economics and agricultural engineering have yielded mixed results when specifying the costs of an unfavourable parcel structure. Concepts related to travel costs and the production function are frequently applied when the costs of farming distant parcels are examined. However, farmers’ perspective regarding preferences for land use is ignored or partly overlapped by predictions made by researchers. Based on applied econometric models fitted to stated preference data, we revealed that the proximity of a field plot is a relevant factor affecting land-use decisions. One-fourth of landowners would change the use of a field plot if the condition of distance was changed. Landowners would continue farming a field plot if its distance from the farm compound was reduced, being willing to accept on average €79.60 less in net income per ha per year. The effect of a greater proximity of field plots to the farm compound following land consolidation was heterogeneous, particularly depending on the farm size and its location.";"Grammatikopoulou, Ioanna

This paper reviews a diversity of experiences and identifies issues that have important implications for governments, forest planners, and First Nations: a forestry regime that reflects the interests of governments and industry rather than those of First Nations; variable implementation of aboriginal rights in forestry practice; benefits and problems of economic partnerships; limitations on consultation, traditional knowledge, and comanagement in forestry; and finally, different forestry paradigms. Among these experiences and issues, we recognise different visions for the participation of First Nations peoples in Canadian forestry. At one end of the spectrum, “forestry excluding First Nations” is no longer accepted. The most common form may be “forestry by First Nations,” representing a role for First Nations within existing forestry regimes. Other options include “forestry for First Nations,” in which forest managers seek to incorporate aboriginal values and knowledge in management activities and “forestry with First Nations,” in which aboriginal peoples are equal partners in forest management. However, aboriginal forestry is better understood as a potential new form of forestry that uses knowledge and techniques drawn from both traditions and conventional forestry and is based on aboriginal rights, values, and institutions.";"Wyatt, S.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"forestry;property rights";"Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"CAN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300882272";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-214";"";"";"";"171-180"

The agricultural managements were: (i) the local practice of fallow regrowth of native elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) followed by biomass burning before planting maize in the spring, (ii) the same practice but without burning and the maize receiving mineral nitrogen fertilizer, (iii) a winter crop of a legume, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), followed by maize, (iv) vegetation free winter period (bare fallow) followed by maize, and (v) unmanaged elephant grass-shrub vegetation. The mean soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of the soils after 4 years were: 1.29, 1.67, 1.54, 0.80 and 1.34%, respectively, differences that should affect resources for the microbial community. From about 290,000 sequences obtained by pyrosequencing the SSU rRNA gene, canonical correspondence analysis showed that SOC was the most important factor that explained differences in microbial community structure among treatments. This analysis as well as phylogenetic ecological network construction indicated that members of the Acidobacteria GP4 and GP6 were more abundant in soils with relatively high SOC whereas Acidobacteria GP1, GP7, and Actinobacteria were more prevalent in soil with lower SOC. Burning of winter fallow vegetation led to an increase in Bacillales, especially those belonging to spore-forming genera. Of the managements, pigeon-pea cultivation during the winter period promoted a higher microbial diversity and also sequestered more SOC, presumably improving soil structure, fertility, and resiliency.";"Sul, Woo Jun

Our country, having the favorable climatic conditions for viticulture, has an important role among the viticulture farming countries of the World. The objective of this study is to determine potential growing areas of grape in Turkey by using Geographic Information Systems techniques based on topographic and climatic factors. It is important to efficiently use of our limited arable lands from the agricultural point of view. GIS tools provides an ability to process spatial data for the purpose of land use planning. As a result of the study, temperature, altitude, sunshine duration, vegetation period, total annual precipitation were found significant parameters for viticulture. Surface maps of these parameters were obtained by interpolation techniques and threshold values were determined for ecological requirements of viticulture. Potential vineyard areas map of Turkey with two classes was determined as a result of this study. According to suitability map obtained with this study; 57.86% of Turkey is suitable for grape growing, 40.46% is not appropriate and 1.68% of the area is water surfaces.

"AGRIS:US201600112071";"Strategies to mitigate nitrous oxide emissions from herbivore production systems";"";"Herbivores are a significant source of nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions. They account for a large share of manure-related N₂O emissions, as well as soil-related N₂O emissions through the use of grazing land, and land for feed and forage production. It is widely acknowledged that mitigation measures are necessary to avoid an increase in N₂O emissions while meeting the growing global food demand. The production and emissions of N₂O are closely linked to the efficiency of nitrogen (N) transfer between the major components of a livestock system, that is, animal, manure, soil and crop. Therefore, mitigation options in this paper have been structured along these N pathways. Mitigation technologies involving diet-based intervention include lowering the CP content or increasing the condensed tannin content of the diet. Animal-related mitigation options also include breeding for improved N conversion and high animal productivity. The main soil-based mitigation measures include efficient use of fertilizer and manure, including the use of nitrification inhibitors. In pasture-based systems with animal housing facilities, reducing grazing time is an effective option to reduce N₂O losses. Crop-based options comprise breeding efforts for increased N-use efficiency and the use of pastures with N₂-fixing clover. It is important to recognize that all N₂O mitigation options affect the N and carbon cycles of livestock systems. Therefore, care should be taken that reductions in N₂O emissions are not offset by unwanted increases in ammonia, methane or carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the abundant availability of mitigation options, implementation in practice is still lagging. Actual implementation will only follow after increased awareness among farmers and greenhouse gases targeted policies. So far, reductions in N₂O emissions that have been achieved are mostly a positive side effect of other N-targeted policies.";"Schils, R. L. M.

The reform gives multiple possibilities of adaptation at a national or regional level. Two standard strategies are foreseen: that of the States which mobilized to the maximum the innovations that the reform allowed, and that of the States which have chosen the option of a minimal application, to limit the effects of reorientation of the productions (maximum sectors remain coupled) or of the redistribution of the payments (historical references). The great diversity of the conditions of agricultural production is one of the main explanations of the differences of enforcement of the reform. We analyse the first impacts of the reform. One can generally expect that the market of entitlements will be a priori limited, because of the links of the entitlements to land. The regionalisation of the calculation of the entitlements is incontestably the mechanism which introduces the most redistributive effects, compared to the individual historical references. We examine also the consequences of the Single Payment System (SPS) on land rent and land market.";"Boinon, J.P.,ENESAD, Dijon (France)

Both tools have been widely used, but little is known regarding how they compare and if they provide similar results when the same agricultural management practices are compared. This SCi and SmaF soil quality index (SQi) comparison was conducted on the Fort Cobb Reservoir experimental Watershed (FCReW) in Oklahoma. Forty-one loamy and sandy surface soil sites were sampled on the FCReW under (i) annual cropping with conventional tillage (conventional), (ii) annual cropping with either conservation tillage or no-till (conservation), (iii) cropland that had been converted to perennial grass (managed grass), and (iv) native grass. The SCi and SmaF SQi gave similar assessments, indicating that soil quality within conventional and conservation systems was similar but lower than in either managed or native grassland systems. Simple comparisons of soil properties by textural class showed no significant effects on most soil quality indicator values, and although texture by management subgroups was examined, no clear relationships were detected because of the limited number of sampling sites. The SmaF and SCi indicators and scores were correlated in tilled systems with limited vegetative cover but not for no-till or forage-based pasture or grassland systems that were in place for at least 10 yr. The SmaF provided more resolution when evaluating agroecosystem management effects on soil quality, including soil organic C enrichment, especially within forage-based systems. Recognizing that the SmaF currently does not account for soil loss, we conclude with recommendations for improving the tool, particularly for tilled systems.";"Zobeck, Ted M.

The report was motivated by the National Biodiesel Board’s interest in better understanding how the California Air Resources Board (CARB) estimated an indirect land-use factor for soybean-based biodiesel of 66 gCO2e/MJ, which is more than three times greater than the direct emissions from the fuel. Four aspects of CARB’s modeling approach were examined: (1) why CARB estimates that more U.S. forest than pasture will be converted to cropland; (2) whether CARB’s predicted land-use changes are consistent with observed U.S. land-use changes in the past decade; (3) how CARB could account for double cropping; and (4) whether CARB’s assumption that land brought into production has lower yields than land that was already in production. Results indicate that (1) much of the predicted U.S. forestland conversion is likely due to restrictions on cross-price elasticities imposed by use of the Constant Elasticity of Transformation supply function; (2) a stock of idled cropland could have accommodated the increase in U.S. cropland in 2007 and 2008; (3) the soybean yield elasticity with respect to price can be adjusted to account for double-cropped acres; and (4) there is no empirical support for the assumption that yields in Brazil on new land are lower than yields on old land. The analysis shows how much work needs to be done in this area if the models used to estimate indirect land use are to become widely accepted.";"Babcock, Bruce A.

"AGRIS:FR2016201999";"Fate of airborne metal pollution in soils as related to agricultural management: 2. Assessing the role of biological activity in micro-scale Zn and Pb distributions in A, B and C horizons";"";"This work assesses relationships between characteristic aggregate microstructures related to biological activity in soils under different long-term land use and the distribution and extractability of metal pollutants. We selected two neighbouring soils contaminated with comparable metal loads by past atmospheric deposition. Currently, these soils contain similar stocks, but different distributions of zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) concentrations with depth. One century of continuous land use as permanent pasture (PP) and conventional arable (CA) land, has led to the development of two soils with different macro- and micro-morphological characteristics. We studied distributions of organic matter, characteristic micro-structures and earthworm-worked soil by optical microscopy in thin sections from A, B and C horizons. Concentrations and amounts of total and EDTA-extractable Zn and Pb were determined on bulk samples from soil horizons and on size-fractions obtained by physical fractionation in water. Large amounts of Zn and Pb were found in 2–20-µm fractions, ascribed to stable organo-mineral micro-aggregates influenced by root and microbial activity, present in both soils. Unimodal distribution patterns of Zn, Pb and organic C in size-fractions were found in horizons of the CA soil. In contrast, bimodal patterns were observed in the PP soil, because large amounts of Zn and Pb were also demonstrated in stable larger micro-aggregates (50–100-µm fractions). Such differing distribution patterns characterized all those horizons markedly influenced by earthworm activity. Larger earthworm activity coincided with larger metal EDTA-extractability, particularly of Pb. Hence, land use-related biological activity leads to specific soil microstructures affecting metal distribution and extractability, both in surface and subsurface horizons.";"Fernandez, Christelle

"AGRIS:US201600195990";"comparison of the means and ends of rural construction land consolidation: Case studies of villagers' attitudes and behaviours in Changchun City, Jilin province, China";"";"Rural construction land consolidation (RCLC) is an innovative approach to coordinating the outmigration of a rural population and the increase in rural housing land, thereby protecting farmland and ensuring food security, adding to urban construction land quotas, and improving the rural habitat environment in China. Since 2005, several different models or approaches to RCLC have been practiced by local governments. Regardless of public interest in the specific projects of RCLC, its implementation is not successful without the cooperation of relevant villagers whose attitudes and behaviours in response to RCLC have thus far been given only minimal academic attention. Focusing on one of the approaches of RCLC, viz. the homestead exchange apartment approach (HEA), this paper analyses the means and ends of its practices and villagers' attitudes and behaviours in response to them based on a comparison of a failed case (Village A) and a successful case (Village B) in Changchun City, which is located in the northeast of China. The results show that the geographical location and associated socio-economic background of villages endow them with different potentials, strengths, and weaknesses in implementing HEA, the higher adaptability to urban living usually accompany with lower consolidation potential of rural construction land, and vice versa; The different means of HEA result in different ends, both absolute private property-based means and absolute population-based means are dogmatic and impractical; Under constrained socio-economic, biophysical, and institutional situations, the main factors influencing villagers' attitudes and behaviours in response to the various means of HEA include household population size, original housing conditions, livelihood, life course, and Guanxi. Critically, RCLC should follow a trial and error approach and villagers must have real opportunities to take part in the decision-making that will influence their futures.";"Fang, Yan-gang

"AGRIS:US201500009970";"Assessment of uncertainties in the response of the African monsoon precipitation to land use change simulated by a regional model";"";"Land use and land cover (LULC) over Africa have changed substantially over the last 60 years and this change has been proposed to affect monsoon circulation and precipitation. This study examines the uncertainties of model simulated response in the African monsoon system and Sahel precipitation due to LULC change using a set of regional model simulations with different combinations of land surface and cumulus parameterization schemes. Although the magnitude of the response covers a broad range of values, most of the simulations show a decline in Sahel precipitation due to the expansion of pasture and croplands at the expense of trees and shrubs and an increase in surface air temperature. The relationship between the model responses to LULC change and the climatologists of the control simulations is also examined. Simulations that are climatologically too dry or too wet compared to observations and reanalyses have weak response to land use change because they are in moisture or energy limited regimes respectively. The ones that lie in between have stronger response to the LULC changes, showing a more significant role in land–atmosphere interactions. Much of the change in precipitation is related to changes in circulation, particularly to the response of the intensity and latitudinal position of the African Easterly Jet, which varies with the changes in meridional surface temperature gradients. The study highlights the need for measurements of the surface fluxes across the meridional cross-section of the Sahel to evaluate models and thereby allowing human impacts such as land use change on the monsoon to be projected more realistically.";"Hagos, Samson

"AGRIS:US2016209001";"PRIVATE SECTOR AGRICULTURAL TENANCY ARRANGEMENTS IN EUROPE: THEMES AND DIMENSIONS; A CRITICAL REVIEW OF CURRENT LITERATURE";"";"Although there is widespread support for the ""ideal model"" of agricultural production being based around the owner-occupier farmer, it is recognized that, for a variety of reasons, this ideal is neither always attainable nor desirable. There is also a need to ensure that farming becomes competitive when exposed fully to world markets. This means that farmers are likely to require the flexibility to expand their businesses in circumstances where they may not have the capital to purchase the additional assets. The need to find suitable systems for agricultural tenancy reform remains paramount as a means both for sustaining rural communities generally and for establishing mechanisms suitable for matching the demand for and supply of private land for rent. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recently commissioned a study of agricultural land tenure systems in order to identify elements of good practice in existing arrangements for the leasing of private sector agricultural land. This report is confined to a consideration of and commentary on the existing literature on tenure and tenancy arrangements as a basis for identifying examples of good practice. For the purposes of establishing good practice, this report concentrates on the market economies of northern and western Europe, predominantly the fifteen current member states of the European Union, while being aware of the principal dimensions of land reform in central and eastern European and former Soviet Union countries.";"Ravenscroft, Neil

Our results show that, in addition to the conventional determinants of farmland values, an increase in swine production intensity has a negative relationship with farmland values while an increase in swine operation scale had a positive association with farmland values at the county level in Illinois. We also estimate the impact of changes in the Illinois swine industry over the period 1980-1999 on farmland values at the state level and find that changes in swine inventory and scale of swine operations have led to changes in farmland prices from $-10.56 to $62.96 per acre.

Each accession was classified into one of three types (types A, B and C) based on two large deletions in the hypervariable regions between the accD–psaI and rps16–trnQ genes. Thirty haplotypes were identified by 32 mutations including 17 gaps (in/dels) and 15 base changes. Haplotype network analysis revealed that wild Chinese Ussurian pears could be grouped into subgroup I of type A. A haplotype, Hcp3, in subgroup I detected in Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces was considered to be a divergent centre in Chinese Ussurian pears. However, the genetic diversity of wild accessions revealed by the two hypervariable regions was quite low. In particular, 98 % of wild Ussurian accessions in Inner Mongolia shared an identical haplotype Hcp1 and are, therefore, monomorphic. In comparison, Chinese pear cultivars were more divergent. These results suggest that the cpDNAs from wild Ussurian pears in Inner Mongolia have specifically differentiated compared to those from pears of other areas. The number of wild Ussurian pears has been decreasing because of desertification and land development, therefore conservation is needed.";"Wuyun, Tana

"AGRIS:US201400138378";"Environmental change in Garry oak (Quercus garryana) ecosystems: the evolution of an eco-cultural landscape";"";"Globally, colonialism resulted in the suppression of aboriginal land management practices, abetted by the concept of terra nullius, “belonging to no one”; the belief that aboriginal people had little influence on or ownership of the land. Until recently, this ideology was entrenched in resource management and policy. Traditional ecological knowledge, historical ecology, archaeology, and palaeoecological research have shown these assumptions to be wrong. In this paper we take a multidisciplinary approach (biogeography, paleoecology, dendrochronology, and bioclimatic envelope modeling) to better understand the role of climate and fire in the formation of eco-cultural landscapes. We synthesize results from pollen and charcoal analysis in Garry oak ecosystems that indicate there were continuous and frequent prescribed burning events, with more severe fires occurring every 26–41� years in southwest British Columbia throughout the Anthropocene (~last 250� years) that substantially altered forest structure and composition. These results are consistent with stand age reconstructions in BC and Washington with Garry oak establishment beginning ~1850 AD, corresponding with modern fire exclusion, aboriginal population decline, and end of the Little Ice Age. Douglas-fir recruitment has been continuous since ~1900, with succession of oak woodland to closed conifer forest at most sites. These findings indicate that the structure of many Garry oak ecosystems have been profoundly influenced by eco-cultural practices. Overwhelming evidence indicates that in many cases these ecosystems are dependent on prescribed fire for their open structure. In the absence of aboriginal land-management practices, active management will be necessary to maintain Garry oak woodland.";"Pellatt, Marlow G.

Efforts to reverse land degradation require an understanding of why it takes place and what factors govern farmers' willingness to invest in land conservation. These factors differ importantly between private and public lands.  This study synthesizes results from analyses of the technological and institutional factors determining the adoption of natural resource conservation at both the household and the community levels in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray.  Using 1995-96 data from 250 Tigray farm household interviews, it first examines private land management, focusing on 1) What factors determine farmer perceptions of the severity and yield impact of soil erosion?  2) Is soil conservation profitable, and if so, then under what conditions? 3) What determines farmers' illingness to invest in soil conservation?  Using 1998-99 data from a survey of 100 Tigray villages, it proceeds to examine the management of communal lands (grazing lands and woodlots), focusing on 4) What makes communities engage in collective NRM activities?  5) What determines the ffectiveness of collective NRM?

At the household level, results highlight the importance of (1) the physical characteristics of plots and villages in shaping farmer perceptions, (2) the land tenure horizon and access to capital in determining willingness to invest in soil conservation.  At the community level, they highlight the importance of population density, agricultural potential, as well as access to markets and external rganizations in determining community collective action and its effectiveness in establishing and managing protected grazing areas and woodlots.";"Gebremedhin, Berhanu

"AGRIS:US201400182673";"national level forest resource assessment for Burkina Faso – A field based forest inventory in a semiarid environment combining small sample size with large observation plots";"";"Even though considerable parts of the global tropical forests are located in Africa, reliable data on African forest resources is limited. While this is widely recognized for tropical moist forests, it also holds for tropical dry forests. To partially fill the gap a forest inventory was carried out in Burkina Faso, West Africa. In this paper we present a methodological approach and sample based estimates of the tree and forest resources including estimates of (1) land cover classes, (2) species composition, and (3) above ground tree carbon stocks. Following the land classification of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the forest cover of Burkina Faso was estimated as 42.6% (116,847km²). For the classes “other wooded land”, “other land” and “other land with tree cover” the estimates were 1.6%, 53.6%, and 9.1%, respectively. We found notable differences to the estimates published by FAO, in particular when considering the classes “forest” and “other wooded land” separately, but lesser so when the two classes are combined. That points to a major issue in applying these class definitions in semiarid environments. Given the relatively small sample size (n=46 field observed plots), relative standard errors (SE%) of area estimates are high (around 9% for the larger area classes). Aboveground tree carbon stocks were estimated to be 6.640, 5.580 and 7.222Mgha⁻¹ for “forest”, “other wooded land” and “other land with tree cover”, respectively (SE% around 18% for all three estimates). Availability of biomass models is very limited for all classes, in particular when it comes to shrubs. Furthermore, it was estimated that the most abundant tree species in Burkina Faso is Vittelaria paradoxa, the “shea butter tree” which is a multi-use tree species of high relevance for rural livelihoods. To our knowledge this study is the first field-based forest inventory on national level in Burkina Faso where the estimation of errors was possible on statistical grounds, and done. The results of this study revealed major issues that should be taken into account when doing similar studies, including carbon monitoring and accounting: increasing the sample size will lead to smaller standard errors (at a higher costs, of course), but will not solve the crucial points (1) of non-availability of suitable biomass models, in particular for shrub lands and (2) of implementation issues regarding the definition of land cover types.";"Fischer, Christoph

The implications of such changes in land use for soil communities, and the ecosystem services they provide (e.g., nutrient and C cycling), are relatively little understood. Results of a detailed study of vegetation, soil physicochemical properties and soil communities (primarily microbial) to reforestation of a pasture (15 years post reforestation), and its immediately adjacent un-restored pasture, are presented. Whereas the reforested portion of the site had significantly higher levels of tree canopy cover and a well-developed litter layer than the immediately adjacent pasture, the reverse was true for grass biomass. Although there were no differences in total root biomass between the sampling zones, the pasture zone was dominated by fine roots and the reforested zone by coarse roots. Reforestation had a significant impact on soil physicochemical properties, with soil C, C:N and mineral N being higher than in the pasture. The reforestation also supported a greater microbial PLFA, a higher Fungal:Bacterial PLFA ratio and a different microbial community (based on PLFA profiles) from that of the adjacent pasture. There were also differences in earthworm abundance, with earthworms present and absent in soils from the pasture and reforested zones, respectively. All of the changes in vegetation, soil physicochemical properties and biotic communities occurred abruptly at the interface between the land-use types, with no evidence of an interaction between side of fence (reforested versus pasture zones) and distance from the fence.

"AGRIS:US201500163147";"Addressing the complexity in non-linear evolution of vegetation phenological change with time-series of remote sensing images";"";"Earth observation based monitoring of change in vegetation phenology and productivity is an important and widely used approach to quantify degradation of ecosystems due to climatic or human influences. Most satellite based studies apply linear or polynomial regression methods for trend detections. In this paper it is argued that natural systems hardly react to human or natural influences in a linear or a polynomial manner. At shorter time-scales of few decades natural systems fluctuate to a certain extent in a non-systematic manner without necessarily changing equilibrium. Finding a systematic model that describes this behavior on large spatial scales is certainly a difficult challenge. Furthermore, the manner vegetation phenology reacts to climate and to socio-economic changes is also dependent on the land cover type and on the bioclimatic region. In addition to this, traditional parametric methods require the fulfillment of several statistical criteria. In case these criteria are violated confidence intervals and significance tests of the models may be biased, even misleading. This paper proposes an alternative approach termed the Steadiness to traditional trend analysis methods. Steadiness combines the direction or tendency of the change and the net change of the time-series over a selected time period. It is a non-parametric approach which can be used without violation of statistical criteria, it can be applied on short time-series as well and results are not dependent on the significance test or on thresholds. To demonstrate differences, a time-series of satellite derived Season Length images for 24 years is analyzed for the entire European continent using linear regression and the Steadiness approach. Spatial and temporal change patterns and sensitivity to pre-processing algorithms are compared between the two methods. We show that linear regression limits the possibilities of assessing fluctuating ecosystem changes whereas the non-parametric Steadiness index more consistently confirms the fluctuating phenological change patterns.";"Ivits, E.

This is nearly six times the average area of one-person farms with land over 50 hectares (114 ha). In the 650 farms, the difference is twenty-fold – these farms cultivate a total of 1.4 million hectares, each having 2,100 hectares of land on average.According to the list of direct area payments, the 70 largest farms in Hungary currently cultivate a total of 350 hectares – 20% more than what once belonged to the Eszterházy family. Most of them have 3,000-5,000 hectares (corresponding to the land of the magnates), twenty large farms cultivate 5,000-10,000 hectares (the lower limit of the lands of old aristocrats). There are also three ‘super farms’ with 10,000-15,000 hectares – on a global scale, this size is equivalent to a portion of a latifundium only.Developing countries and countries with a transitional market economy have gradually become the target of foreign investors due to their obsolete agricultural system and chronic lack of capital. These countries assist the entry of multinational companies or have been forced to open up their market of production assets.Global capital enters agriculture primarily through vertical integration and production contracts. The presence of multinational companies hiders the survival of traditional forms of sustenance farming.

"AGRIS:US201301850428";"Risk preferences, risk perceptions and timber harvest decisions — An empirical study of nonindustrial private forest owners in northern Sweden";"";"A mail survey of nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners in two counties in northern Sweden was conducted to investigate the risk preferences of NIPF owners and their perceptions of the return and risk of timber investment relative to investment alternatives outside forestry. We also used the data collected from the survey to examine the relationship between the stated preferences, subjective judgements, and the observed and planned timber fellings. Our aim was to determine as to what extent the NIPF owners' harvesting behaviour was consistent with their preferences and subjective judgments. The result shows that a majority of the NIPF owners who responded to the survey were risk-neutral or risk-prone. There were no statistically significant correlations between a forest owner's attitudes toward risk and the size of forest property. However, risk preferences have significant impacts on the decision to fell: the more a forest owner likes to take risks, the more likely it is that he/she conducts final felling. The result also shows large variations among NIPF owners with respect to the subjective judgements of the return and risk of the alternative investments. For each respondent we elicited the most preferred investment alternative based on the stated risk preferences and the subjective judgements of the return and risk of the alternative investments. Owners whose preferred investment alternative is the mature forest are on average significantly less active in harvesting than owners with other preferred investment alternatives. However, there are no significant differences in the felling intensity and the growing stock of timber among the different groups of NIPF owners. The examination of NIPF owners' harvesting behaviour, risk preferences and subjective judgments reveals strong indications of the difficulties for NIPF owners to make rational decisions when faced with uncertainties.";"Andersson, Mats

Given the resolution of each technique both methods yield broadly similar results of 4-90 mm/yr (up to 14% of modern rainfall) that reflect the recharge rates following land clearing over the last 200 years. Deeper bores show mixing of modern recharge with older water flowing laterally through the aquifers. Recharge estimates based on Cl concentrations are up to two orders of magnitude lower (<1 mm/yr), implying that they largely reflect pre-land clearing recharge rates, as is the case elsewhere in the Murray Basin. Recharge rates are similar across the areas from upper slopes to plains, indicating that recharge occurs across substantial areas of each catchment. This is also implied by bore hydrographs in all parts of the flow systems being in phase, the presence of ³H in groundwater from across the area, and seasonal variations in salinity and delta¹⁸O values in groundwater from water table bores. Since recharge occurs across broad areas, any attempts to slow the rate of water table rise requires management of the landscape as a whole, not just the uplands. That the increased recharge since land clearing has not lowered groundwater salinity is due to the system having dual porosity, where older saline water trapped in clays within the unsaturated zone is slowly incorporated into the groundwater as the water table rises.";"Cartwright, I.

In this paper we propose a novel way of classification and modeling land-use using a classification based on land-use systems (LUSs) that represent specific combinations of human-environment interactions. A cluster analysis was used to identify and map these LUSs. The analysis accounted for population density, accessibility to market places, land-use/cover types and livestock densities. A conceptual framework was developed to model dynamics in LUSs accounting for both land cover and land management changes. LUSs changes were simulated based on changes in both local socio-economic and biophysical conditions and regional-scale changes in demand for agricultural products.

We then examine several environmental ""grand challenges"" and discuss how urban land teleconnections could help research communities frame scientific inquiries. Finally, we point to existing analytical approaches that can be used to advance development and application of the concept.";"Seto, Karen C.

"AGRIS:US201400036687";"Dairying in the Antipodes: recent past, near prospects";"";"The majority of dairy farmers and processors in Australia and New Zealand are considered world class due to their ability to produce dairy products at a cost that is competitive on the world market without requirement for subsidy. International and domestic forces beyond the farm influence the international competitiveness of Antipodean dairy systems, as much or more than, the within-farm characteristics of the systems. Critical external forces include: world population growth, protein demand from increasingly wealthy developing countries, dairy supply from domestic and international producers, international dairy prices and exchange rate volatility. Within farm, the keys to persistent profitability, business survival, and growth will continue to be management ability and labour skill as well as the relationship between milksolids (milk fat + milk protein) produced per system and total production costs. Domestic forces will include competition for resources such as land, water, quality labour and capital, and public expectation that farms will meet the costs of community environmental and welfare objectives. Public and industry investment in research, development and extension in innovations that increase productivity is essential if dairying is to remain competitive. The operation of the comparative advantage principle determines which industries thrive, or decline, in an economy. New Zealand dairying has a strong comparative advantage over alternative pastoral industries which will continue. In Australia, the comparative advantage of dairy farming over alternative activities is less clear-cut. History shows that the best farmers and processors handle risks such as market and climate volatility and other challenges better than others, and their prospects are positive. However, world class performers in the future dairy industry will certainly not be all, or even the majority, of the current population of dairy farmers.";"Clark, Dave

Using data collected from a survey of randomly selected pastoral households from two districts of Ghanzi and Kgalagadi South, Botswana, this paper outlines the major constraints affecting contemporary extensive pastoral systems. Because of the prevailing semi-arid climate, recurrent drought outbreaks were cited as a common challenge in both study areas together with lack of fenced grazing areas. Stock theft was also highlighted as a challenge, even though it was more pronounced in Kgalagadi South. In Ghanzi area, the other important challenges included loss of livestock due to predation, while stray animals, stock theft and loss of livestock due to road accidents were equally important. Kgalagadi South pastoral households experienced serious shortage of drinking water for their livestock, followed by inadequate grazing land and limited access to distant markets. The preceding, together with several other less prominent challenges revealed in this study, exert pressure on pastoral livelihoods. There is need, therefore, to address these perceived challenges and strengthen resilience through effective policy reviews to secure rural livelihoods.";"Mosalagae, Diphetogo

However, little attention has been devoted to the potential longer-term impacts of the measures used to implement such reforms, despite evidence that, the restrictions on land rental in rural areas they imply can have potentially far-reaching consequences. Use of state level data on rental restrictions, in conjunction with a nationally representative survey from India suggests that, contrary to their original intention, rental restrictions significantly reduce supply of land to the rental market, prevent land access by the landless, and by more productive producers. Ways to counter these effects by liberalizing land rental markets are discussed.";"Jin, Songqing

However, because of the increasing pressure brought by the public opinion, the attempts to assign an economic, yet volatile, valuation to ecosystems assets has multiplied in recent years, and policy communities are increasingly compelled to incorporate them into land use planning initiatives. Based on contributions to this special issue, we discuss how the perspective of ecosystem services can contribute to develop sound land-use policies and planning actions. Beyond valuation, several practical implications emerge from the contributions. A myriad of potential tradeoffs must be analyzed because since the provision of some services can be accompanied by the emergence of unexpected dis-services. For example, carbon accumulation based on increasing net primary production rates may simultaneously cut water yields and, hence, water provision. Various existing mechanisms ranging from state-controlled to market-controlled for rewarding the provision of ecosystem services are analyzed and discussed in terms of their capacity to connect nature to land-use planning.";"Viglizzo, E.F.

To secure sustainable land management in the region, a comprehensive understanding of bracken spatial-distribution patterns and life cycle dynamics is crucial. We investigated the possibility of detecting bracken-infested areas and frond status (live, fungi-infected, and dead) by means of a high-resolution QuickBird scene from October 2010 and spectral signatures based on field spectroscopy. After image pre-processing, a two-step classification procedure first delineates the bracken-infested area by means of a maximum-likelihood hard classification. The probability-guided unmixing classifier with field-derived end-members is applied in the second step to obtain the fractional cover of the different frond statuses per pixel. The results showed that the areas infested by bracken could be distinguished from the other land-cover classes with high accuracy (overall accuracy of 0.9973). Also, the three frond statuses could be accurately classified at the sub-pixel level. The ‘dead’ class was the dominant frond status at the time of image acquisition (October 2010). We conclude that the extreme dry spell in October 2010 was particularly responsible for this dominance.";"Curatola Fernández, G.F.

Here we present a novel evaluation framework of ecosystem services (ES) and pose different response models to landscape complexity. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that complementarities among different ES types increase and the strength of their apparent tradeoffs diminishes with the spatial complexity of the rural landscapes, using a one million has basin of the Argentine pampas as study case. According to correlation and principal component analysis, main ES tradeoffs among ES availability observed at two spatial scales were represented by crop production vs. the other evaluated ES types (OES), and in contrast with our prediction, their strength was not higher for the fine- than for the coarse-scale (relatively large and internally complex observation units). Landscape composition and configuration indices showed a complementary capacity to explain spatial variation in OES, but combinations of configuration indices showed a higher explanatory value than composition ones. Widely accepted tradeoffs among ecosystem services at local levels, not only were able to explain their antagonistic but also their synergistic availability at intermediate levels of conversion of managed grasslands to croplands, depending on the evaluation scale. Despite intermediate complexity hypothesis was only partly supported by our results, these offer novel evidences about emergent responses in the form of nonlinearities and thresholds of total ES in relation to landscape complexity, which deserve further attention because of their relevance for land use planning.";"Laterra, Pedro

"AGRIS:US201400162082";"Ecosystem functional changes associated with land clearing in NW Argentina";"";"We assessed the extension of natural habitat conversion into croplands and grazing lands in subtropical NW Argentina and its impact on two key ecosystem functional attributes. We quantified changes in remotely sensed surrogates of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and seasonality of carbon gains. Both functional attributes are associated with intermediate ecosystem services sensuFisher et al. (2009). Deforestation was estimated based on photointerpretation of Landsat imagery. The seasonal dynamics of the MODIS satellite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was used to calculate the EVI annual mean as a surrogate of ANPP, and the EVI seasonal coefficient of variation as an indicator of seasonal variability of carbon gains. The 2000–2007 period showed a high rate of land clearing: 5.9% of NW Argentina (1,757,600ha) was cleared for agriculture and ranching, corresponding to an annual rate of 1.15%. Dry forests experienced the highest rate and humid forests the lowest. Though land clearing for agriculture and ranching had relatively small impacts on total annual ANPP, once deforested, parcels significantly became more seasonal than the natural vegetation replaced. Such increase in seasonality is associated with a reduction of photosynthetic activity during a portion of the year (fallow). Direct consequences of this reduction can be expected on several ecosystem services such as erosion control and water regulation, due to greater exposure of bare soil, and biodiversity, due to the loss or decline in habitat quality and the decrease of green biomass availability for primary consumers during fallow. Land clearing also increased the magnitude of inter-annual differences in C gains, suggesting a greater buffer capacity against climate fluctuations of natural vegetation compared to croplands.";"Volante, J.N.

To do so, we carried out a statistical examination of the interrelationships among residential property sales prices and nearby feedlots in a southwestern Minnesota study area.  Structure and location data for 292 residential property sales in Redwood and Renville Counties, excluding the cities of Olivia and Redwood Falls, were linked to the location and physical characteristics of every larger feedlot within three miles of each sale. The basic approach was to ask, ""Does the addition of information about feedlot proximity help us explain observed house prices beyond the explanatory power of statistical models that use only the house's structure and other location characteristics?""  We examined this overall question with respect to a series of constructed proximity indicators that capture the effects of feedlot size, direction, distance, and types of animals, among others. We found statistically significant evidence of a link between feedlot location and house prices in the study area.  That relationship was positive in sign, not negative as initially expected. Houses closer to feedlots appear to have sold for more than expected from knowledge of the characteristics of the houses alone.  The effect was most pronounced for houses that are older, relatively lower in price, or located in small towns.";"Taff, Steven J.

"AGRIS:US201400169063";"effect of land-cover change on vegetation greenness-based satellite agricultural drought indicators: a case study in the southwest climate division of Indiana, USA";"";"During the last decade, the use of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for drought monitoring applications has drawn many criticisms, mainly because a number of drivers such as land-cover/land-use change, pest infestation, and flooding may depress the NDVI, further causing false drought identification. In this study, the impacts of land-cover change on the NDVI-derived satellite drought indicator, the vegetation condition index (VCI), are presented. It was found that the VCI is sensitive to changes in land cover, especially deforestation, the land cover changes from evergreen and deciduous forests to other land-cover classes. However, because the scale of land-cover changes was very small across the study area, only trivial drought alerts were observed in the VCI-based drought maps during non-drought years. Because drought is a large-scale climate event, it is reasonable to neglect these alerts. Besides, when the VCI was averaged to climate division scale, the results obtained through the VCI method were in good agreement with those acquired by the meteorological data-based drought indices such as the Palmer drought severity index and standardized precipitation index.";"Yagci, Ali Levent

"AGRIS:US201600200092";"Examining the effect of diverse management strategies on landscape scale patterns of forest structure in Pennsylvania using novel remote sensing techniques";"";"We used novel remote sensing techniques to compare the landscape-scale patterns of forest structure in Pennsylvania, USA under the management of four different agencies with varying primary objectives, including production forestry, wildlife habitat, recreation, and private ownership. We (i) developed a forest structure classification scheme using publicly available LiDAR and orthographic aerial imagery data, (ii) mapped the forest structure across twenty forested landscapes, and (iii) compared the landscape-scale forest structure patterns among the four forest management types. Our results indicate that different management philosophies and their associated forest management approaches have resulted in contrasting landscape-scale patterns of forest structure. Privately managed forests had shorter forests, higher densities of distinct patches, higher interspersion of patch types, and higher forest structure diversity at fine-scales (1.5 ha grain size) compared to forests lightly managed for recreation. Production forests under ecosystem management and forests managed for wildlife habitat exhibited intermediate patterns of forest structure. This variation in forest structure patterns among the forest managers is likely to have implications for wildlife habitat and other ecosystem services. Furthermore, greater emphasis is needed on encouraging private landowners to manage across property boundaries and providing the resources and tools to manage forests at the landscape scale.";"Dickinson, Yvette

"AGRIS:US201600185332";"Using financial incentives to motivate conservation of an at-risk species on private lands";"";"Financial incentives have become a core component of private lands conservation programmes because of their ability to motivate stewardship behaviour. Concern exists about the durability of stewardship behaviours after payments end. Payments for performance may impact farmers' current and future engagement with an incentive programme to protect an at-risk ground-nesting grassland bird. Farmer motivations for participating in the programme, as well as their intention to continue the programme if the financial incentive no longer existed, were quantified. Although farmers did not report a high level of current involvement in the programme, most reported they would continue at a similar or higher level of engagement if the payments ended. These outcomes were related to their perception that their participation was driven by their internal motivation to help rather than the desire to obtain the financial reward. The perception that their behaviour was self-directed was positively influenced by the flexibility surrounding landownersâ engagement with the programme, a feeling of competence and achievement, and a feeling of connectedness to the organization implementing the programme. The success of conservation incentive programmes over the long term can be enhanced by explicitly accounting for the needs of landowners in programme design and administration.";"RAMSDELL, C. PAXTON

Feedback about the implementation of this new policy suggests that agriculture continues to drive deforestation. This article explores farmers' household livelihood strategies and land use changes in response to changing forest access rules arising from community-based land management. Based on studying in-depth surveys and participatory mapping in the eastern rain forest highlands, we outline patterns in farmers' responses, exploring the relationship between sociodemographic factors, livelihood strategies, and patterns of land use. Our findings suggest that heterogeneity in farmers' adaptation capacities is closely related to different land use patterns. Furthermore, both conservation and agricultural sustainability have suffered from unintended impacts: an increase of forest clearing, intensification in cultivated area, and an impoverishment of the poorest households. These detailed reviews of household adaptation processes suggest that the zoning-based management scheme would benefit from incorporating a more detailed farm level land use approach. Land use patterns have the potential to inform the design of improved conservation-development initiatives by revealing strategic indicators that could allow practitioners to target households for conservation measures according to their adaption capacities";"Toillier , Aurélie

A priori defined nine land cover classes in the classification scheme were urban and built-up, forest, sparsely vegetated areas, grassland, vegetated stream beds, unvegetated stream beds, bare areas, crop fields, and water bodies. Individual classifications were employed using the combination of both unsupervised and supervised classification methods. Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis (ISODATA) was used to reduce spectral variation in the scenes arising from complex pattern of crop fields. Maximum Likelihood classifier was used in the LC classification of the individual images. Image pairs of consecutive dates were compared by overlaying the thematic LC maps and cross-tabulating the LC statistics. Urbanization and expansion of agriculture were the major reasons for the dramatic LC conversions. The amount of conversion from crop fields to water occurred as large as 927.67 ha, accounting for 73% of the total land-to-water conversion. Conversions to agriculture have mainly been occurred from grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas as large as 1,314.95 and 1,325.84 ha, respectively. Urban coverage doubled in this period as a result of 1,443.45 ha of increase. Urban area increased in the second period from 2,920 to 3,526 ha. Conversions to agriculture occurred at high amounts. A total of 1,075.79 ha area changed from sparsely vegetated areas to crop fields. A landscape-level environmental monitoring scheme based on satellite remote sensing was proposed for effective environmental resource management.";"Alphan, Hakan

"AGRIS:US201400132444";"Relationship between the weathering of clay minerals and the nitrification rate: a rapid tree species effect";"";"We compared the properties of the clay mineral fraction and the composition of soil solutions in a Fagus sylvatica coppice (native forest) and four adjacent plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus nigra, Picea abies and Quercus sessiliflora planted in 1976. The results revealed changes of clay fraction properties due to tree species effect. Clay samples from Douglas fir and pine stands differ when compared to other species. Twenty-eight years after planting, we observed the following changes: a more pronounced swelling after citrate extraction and ethylene glycol solvation, a higher CEC and a smaller poorly crystallised aluminium content. All these changes affecting the clay fraction agreed well with soil solution analyses which revealed high NO₃ ⁻, H⁺ and Al concentrations under Douglas fir and pine. These changes were explained by a strong net nitrification under Douglas fir and pine stands when compared with other tree species. The higher NO₃ ⁻ concentrations in soil solutions should be linked to the presence, type and activity of ammonia-oxiding bacteria which are likely influenced by tree species. The production of NO₃ ⁻ in excess of biological demand leads to a net production of hydrogen ion and enhances the dissolution of poorly crystallised Al-minerals. Secondary Al-bearing minerals constituted the principal acid-consuming system in these soils. As a consequence, the depletion of interlayer spaces of hydroxyinterlayered minerals increases the number of sites for exchangeable cation fixation and increases CEC of the clay fraction. The dissolution of Al oxy-hydroxides explain the increase in Al concentrations of soil solutions under Douglas fir and pine stands when compared to other species. Nitrate and dissolved aluminium were conjointly leached in the soil solutions. A change in environmental conditions, like an introduction of tree species, enough modifies soil processes to induce significant changes in the soil mineralogical composition even over a period of time as short as some tens of years. Generally, mineral weathering has been considered to be very slow and unlikely to change over tens of years, resulting in few studies capable of detecting changes in mineralogy. This study appears to have detected changes in clay mineralogy during a period of 28 years after the planting of forest species. Our study represents a single location with a limited block design, but causes us to conclude that the observed changes could be widely representative. Where available, archived samples should be utilized and long-term experiments set up so that similar changes can be tested for and detected using more robust designs. The plausible hypothesis we present to explain apparent changes in clay mineralogy has strong relevance to the sustainable management of land.";"Mareschal, Louis

"AGRIS:US201500162964";"Mapping ecosystem service supply, demand and budgets";"";"Among the main effects of human activities on the environment are land use and resulting land cover changes. Such changes impact the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services to the human society. This supply of multiple goods and services by nature should match the demands of the society, if self-sustaining human–environmental systems and a sustainable utilization of natural capital are to be achieved. To describe respective states and dynamics, appropriate indicators and data for their quantification, including quantitative and qualitative assessments, are needed. By linking land cover information from, e.g. remote sensing, land survey and GIS with data from monitoring, statistics, modeling or interviews, ecosystem service supply and demand can be assessed and transferred to different spatial and temporal scales. The results reveal patterns of human activities over time and space as well as the capacities of different ecosystems to provide ecosystem services under changing land use. Also the locations of respective demands for these services can be determined. As maps are powerful tools, they hold high potentials for visualization of complex phenomena. We present an easy-to-apply concept based on a matrix linking spatially explicit biophysical landscape units to ecological integrity, ecosystem service supply and demand. An exemplary application for energy supply and demand in a central German case study region and respective maps for the years 1990 and 2007 are presented. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service supply and demand is elaborated and discussed.";"Burkhard, Benjamin

"AGRIS:US201500162966";"Indicators of ecosystem service potential at European scales: Mapping marginal changes and trade-offs";"";"This study develops an approach to mapping indicators of the potential of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services, and the impact of changes in land cover and use upon them. The study focuses on the EU-25 plus Switzerland and Norway, and develops the methodology proposed by Kienast et al. (2009), which uses expert-and literature-driven modelling methods. The methods are explored in relation to mapping and assessing four of the ecosystem services: “Crop-based production”; “Wildlife products”; “Habitat diversity”; and “Recreation”. The potential to deliver services is assumed to be influenced by (a) land-use, (b) net primary production, and (c) bioclimatic and landscape properties such as mountainous terrain, adjacency to coastal and wetland ecosystems, as well as adjacency to landscape and nature protection zones. The novel aspect of this work is an analysis of whether the historical and the projected land use changes for the periods 1990–2000, 2000–2006, and 2000–2030 are likely to be supportive or degenerative in the capacity of ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services; we refer to these as ‘marginal’ or incremental changes. The latter are assessed by using land account data for 1990–2000 and 2000–2006 (LEAC, EEA, 2006) and EURURALIS 2.0 land use scenarios for 2000–2030. The results are reported at three spatial reporting units, i.e. (1) the NUTS-X regions, (2) the bioclimatic regions, and (3) the dominant landscape types. All mapped output has been compared with independently generated continent-wide assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental parameters/indicators), which revealed that the straightforward binary links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns. This conclusion mainly holds for provisioning services. At the continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies which can be used to assess the medium-term potential of landscapes to provide ecosystem services. For a subset of NUTS-x regions for which change trajectories for 1990–2000, 2000–2006 and 2000–2030 are available, trade-offs between the four services have been analyzed using cluster analyses. The latter allowed us to simultaneously analyze the state of the four services in year 2000 and the individual trajectories of each service over three time periods. As a result we obtained seven regions with distinct trade-off patterns. To our knowledge this is one of the first continental-wide analyses where land use trajectories are taken into account to construct an indicator to estimate the balance between a set or bundle of ecosystem services. The relationship between the outputs of this work and the development of rapid assessment and accounting frameworks is discussed.";"Haines-Young, Roy

However, interactions between land management, ecological processes and ecosystem service provision are still not fully understood. Indicators can help to better understand these interactions and provide information for policy-makers to prioritise land management interventions. In this paper, we develop a framework for the systematic selection of indicators, to assess the link between land management and ecosystem services provision in a spatially explicit manner. Our framework distinguishes between ecosystem properties, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services. We tested the framework in a case study in The Netherlands. For the case study, we identified 12 property indicators, 9 function indicators and 9 service indicators. The indicators were used to examine the effect of land management on food provision, air quality regulation and recreation opportunities. Land management was found to not only affect ecosystem properties, but also ecosystem functions and services directly. Several criteria were used to evaluate the usefulness of the selected indicators, including scalability, sensitivity to land management change, spatial explicitness, and portability. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to determine quantitative links between indicators, so that land management effects on ecosystem services provision can be modelled in a spatially explicit manner.";"van Oudenhoven, Alexander P.E.

"AGRIS:US201500162962";"Delphi-based change assessment in ecosystem service values to support strategic spatial planning in Italian landscapes";"";"Most impacts on providing ecosystem services (ESs) are related to land use changes that may cause ecosystem fragmentation and loss of ecosystem functions. Spatial planning, focusing on sustainable landscape development, should consider the local potential for providing ESs as well possible impacts due to land use changes. The results of a large number of recent studies on ES assessment are difficult to replicate and integrate into landscape planning or definition of land use policies. The time and resource constraints, needed in data gathering and analysis, limit local administrations in the concern about ES. Extending the approach of spatially explicit benefit transfer, we present an expert-based estimation of land use potential in providing ES. We enhanced ES estimations related to different land use classes (in terms of €/ha year) by considering “local conditions” such as elevation and distance from urban areas, assuming these spatial characteristics can affect ES provisioning. The adaptation for “local conditions” was performed through expert consultation, using Delphi survey and focus groups, involving 46 experts from 10 Italian research institutions. In detail, we used land cover maps for 1990 and 2000, and aggregated the results on the province scale. The results show spatial pattern of gains and losses in ES values for Italian provinces. The province level of aggregation seems to be effective for dealing with strategic phase of spatial planning. By eliciting possible consequences of land use changes, this knowledge framework may foster strategies for sustainable landscape planning and management.";"Scolozzi, Rocco

"AGRIS:US201500015376";"Understanding transportation-caused rangeland damage in Mongolia";"";"Mongolia, a vast and sparsely populated semi-arid country, has very little formal road infrastructure. Since the 1990s, private ownership and usage of vehicles has been increasing, which has created a web of dirt track corridors due to the communal land tenure and unobstructed terrain, with some of these corridors reaching over 4 km in width. This practice aids wind- and water-aided erosion and desertification, causing enormous negative environmental effects. Little is being done to counter the phenomenon, mainly because the logic of the driving behaviour that causes this dirt road widening is not fully understood. The research in this article postulates that this driving behaviour has rational foundations and is linked to various geographical factors (natural and man-made geographical features). We analysed 11,000 km of arterial routes in the country using spatial statistics and determined that geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis offers a good explanation for whether, and by how much, the selected geographical factors affect the creation of corridor widths and how their effect varies across the landscape. We determined that corridor widths are correlated to factors such as proximity to river crossings, traffic intensity, and vegetation abundance. Knowing these factors can help local planners and engineers design counter-measures that could help to control and reduce the widths of these corridors, until paved roads can replace the dirt track corridors.";"Keshkamat, S.S.

"AGRIS:US201600132535";"Land Cover Transition in Northern Tanzania";"";"Land conversion in sub‐Saharan Africa has profound biophysical, ecological, political and social consequences for human well‐being and ecosystem services. Understanding the process of land cover changes and transitions is essential for good ecosystem management policy that would lead to improved agricultural production, human well‐being and ecosystems health. This study aimed to assess land cover transitions in a typical semi‐arid degraded agro‐ecosystems environment within the Pangani river basin in northern Tanzania. Three Landsat images spanning over 30 years were used to detect random and systematic patterns of land cover transition in a landscape dominated by crop and livestock farming. Results revealed that current land cover transition is driven by a systematic process of change dominated by the following: (i) transition from degraded land to sparse bushland (10·8%); (ii) conversion from sparse bushland to dense bushland in lowland areas (6·0%); (iii) conversion from bushland to forest (4·8%); and (iv) conversion from dense bushland to cropland in the highlands (4·5%). Agricultural lands under water harvesting technology adoption show a high degree of persistence (60–80%) between time slices. This suggests that there is a trend in land‐use change towards vegetation improvement in the catchment with a continuous increase in the adoption of water harvesting technologies for crop and livestock farming. This can be interpreted as a sign of agricultural intensification and vegetation regrowth in the catchment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Ouedraogo, Issa

"AGRIS:US201600132536";"Large‐scale Modeling of Soil Erosion with RUSLE for Conservationist Planning of Degraded Cultivated Brazilian Pastures";"";"Pasture degradation is one of the major environmental and economic problems of Brazilian livestock production. Based on the estimates of soil loss in 140,297 km² pasturelands of Goiás State and the Federal District, the effects of land use and management and conservation practices on soil erosion by water were evaluated. Soil loss was estimated with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation model under four scenarios of land use and management of pastures and the implementation of terraces. The effects of converting hilly areas into permanently preserved areas were also evaluated. Well‐managed pastures planted in terraces and highly sloped areas with native vegetation featured a reduction of 709% in the rate of soil erosion by water in comparison with poorly managed pastures without soil conservation practices. The environmental consequences of pasture degradation become particularly important when they are associated with land use in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes because farmers in these regions are forced to open new natural areas. In addition, the high indices of bare soil in degraded pastures contribute significantly to sediment deposition in rivers and dams. The modeling of soil loss is demonstrated to be an important tool for land use planning and supporting public policies focused on the sustainable use of natural resources. The results of these simulations demonstrate the importance of actions to recover degraded pastures, such as the Federal Government's program known as ABC (Low Carbon Agriculture).

"AGRIS:US201600132531";"Microbial and Enzyme Activities of Saline and Sodic Soils";"";"Salinization and sodication are abiotic soil factors, important hazards to soil fertility and consequently affect the crop production. Soil salinization is of great concern for irrigated agriculture in arid and semi‐arid regions of the world; sodicity is characterized by an excessively high concentration of sodium (Na) in their cation exchange system. In recent times, attention has been turned to study the impacts of these factors (salinity and sodicity) on soil microbial activities. Microbial activities play central role in degradation and decomposition of soil organic matter, mineralization of nutrients and stabilization of soil aggregates. To understand the ecology of soil system, therefore, it is important to be conversant with the soil microbial activities, which show quick response to little change in the soil environment. Microbial activities (generally measured as C–N dynamics, soil respiration–basal respiration, or CO₂ emission), microbial abundance, microbial biomass, quotients (microbial and metabolic) and microbial community structure, and soil enzymes have been considered as potential indicators to assess the severity of the land degradation and the effectiveness of land use management. Therefore, it is important to synthesize the available information regarding microbial activities in use and management of salt‐affected soils. The reclamation and management of such soils and their physico‐chemical properties have been reviewed well in the literature. In this review, an attempt has been made to compile the current knowledge about the effects of soil salinization and sodication on microbial and enzyme activities and identify research gaps for future research.

"AGRIS:US201600132532";"Land Use and Cover Dynamics Since 1964 in the Afro‐Alpine Vegetation Belt: Lib Amba Mountain in North Ethiopia";"";"Human‐induced land use and land cover (LUC) changes threaten the ecosystem services of the vulnerable tropical afro‐alpine vegetation. Several LUC change studies are available for the Ethiopian highlands, but relatively little is known about LUC change in the afro‐alpine zones. In this study, LUC changes between 1964 and 2012 were mapped for the afro‐alpine zone of Lib Amba Mountain, part of the Abune Yosef Mountains in North Ethiopia. Historical LUC was derived from georeferenced aerial photographs of 1964 and 1982, and the present LUC (2012) from Bing Map satellite imagery. Based on these successive LUC maps a time‐depth map, LUC proportions, LUC transition matrices and LUC change trajectories were calculated. Two main phases of LUC change could be distinguished linked to the neo‐Boserupian perspective. (i) Between 1964 and 1982, there were large‐scale deforestation and general degradation of the vegetation above 3500 m, in a period of low population pressure; (ii) Between 1982 and 2012, an intensification of land use prevailed accompanied with a slight regeneration of the vegetation and the Erica arborea L. forest, under increased population pressure. Depth interviews indicated that local and governmental land management measures are very important for the protection against vegetation depletion and soil degradation. Quick recovery of the forest on Lib Amba provides confidence that degraded afro‐alpine areas would benefit in a short time from complete protection, given the vicinity of remaining patches of afro‐alpine vegetation. Management interventions are thus vital to restore the important ecosystem services of the afro‐alpine vegetation belt. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Jacob, Miro

Two case studies, each at a different scale, are presented. First, the N’hambita Community Carbon Project in Mozambique, a REDD+ project, promoted agro-forestry and reforestation activities along with alternative livelihoods. Second, the Sloping Lands Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China is a national-level reforestation scheme to supply watershed services. Impacts on the poor are addressed through the ‘lens’ of a rural household allocating its labour supply to different income sources. Four aspects of REDD+ policy are discussed: the incentives necessary for ensuring the cost-effective, long-run sustainability of both carbon sinks and incomes; the implications for forest conservation, in particular biodiversity; the need for scaling up carbon sequestration activities in order to minimise carbon leakage; and, the possibilities to maximise the participation of the poor and alleviate poverty. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of using appropriate methodologies for correct evaluation of policy impacts on incomes.";"Groom, Ben

Two grassland sites, two farmland sites (tilled and untilled) and one site located in a deciduous forest were investigated. At each site, the same sprinkling experiment was carried out with a Brilliant Blue FCF solution of 4gL⁻¹ to visualize flow paths. To explore the effects of different rainfall amounts (20, 40 and 60mm), each 1.2x1.5m experimental plot was subdivided into three smaller subplots, which were irrigated with an intensity of 15mmh⁻¹ for 80, 160 and 240min, respectively. During the tracer application, water content changes were continuously measured with 16 time domain reflectometry probes horizontally installed into the profile at different depths. After the experiments vertical and horizontal soil sections were excavated and photographed. The pictures were processed using digital image analysis and the resulting dye patterns analyzed for volume and surface density, maximum infiltration depth and macropore structure. Additionally, flow processes were classified into distinct flow type categories. The tracer experiments revealed that preferential flow processes significantly differed among sites of differing LULC yet similar soil texture. As primary controlling factors soil structure, surface micro-topography, surface cover and topsoil matrix characteristics were identified. The effects of different rainfall application amounts were complex and strongly varied among sites, stressing the strong control LULC exerts on water flow in soils. Overall this suggests that land use effects on soil properties need to be considered in hydrological models to obtain realistic predictions concerning water quality and quantity.";"Bachmair, Sophie

"AGRIS:US201500212795";"Analysis of deforestation patterns in the Baekdudaegan preservation area using land cover classification and change detection techniques; the feasibility of restoration";"";"The Baekdudaegan Mountain Range is a backbone of the Korean Peninsula which has special spiritual and sentimental significance for Koreans and significant ecological value to diverse organisms. Despite the importance of this region, however, the natural environment of Baekdudaegan has been severely threatened by a variety of human activity and tremendous forest fires. To make management and restoration plans for the deforested areas, it is necessary to investigate quantitatively such natural and human-induced physical changes. This study has thus attempted to quantitatively analyze land-use purposes and deforestation patterns in the Baekdudaegan preservation area by taking advantage of on-screen land cover classification and normalized difference vegetation index image-differencing techniques. The study has also attempted to review the feasibility of forest restoration by analyzing the most representative deforestation patterns in the Baekdudaegan preservation area. The land-cover classification results indicated that forests in the Baekdudaegan preservation area occupy an area of 4,794 km², approximately 90% of the total area, and nonforest is approximately 523 km². Agricultural land is the largest portion of nonforest area and occupies an area of 428 km² (82% of the nonforest area); urbanized built-up land accounts for 10% of nonforest areas (50 km²). According to results from change-detection analysis between 1987 and 2000, deforestation occurred in an area of over 240 ha and the dominant causes of deforestation were revealed as expansion of barren land (43% of the deforested area), conversion for agricultural use (34%), expansion of pasture (10%), and urban sprawl (8%). The most devastating deforestation in the Baekdudaegan area was found in “agricultural field” where the altitude is more than 600 m with a gentle slope of 10–20°. To restore this highland agricultural field, which has expanded along the ridgeline back to healthy forest, it seems the slope faces can be restored without slope stabilization, because the soil is rich and the slope is less than 20°; a landscape ecological approach is, however, suggested to maintain the connectivity of fragmented forest patches.";"Jung, Hui-Cheul

Urban SRT increases as green-space area is converted into non-green-space area. Also, well preserved green space and newly connected green space contribute to a decrease of the SRT. Seoul Metropolitan area is rapidly expanding. Existing urban SRT studies have, however, mainly been conducted for Seoul City. The most rapidly expanding area in Korea is now the Seoul suburban area, for example the Mt Gwanggyo area. Although changes of SRT and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a result of land-use change have been measured in many other studies, the results in these studies were derived from data from different seasons. Also, these studies did not examine a newly expanding area. Considering these problems, the same seasonal multitemporal data were used in this study to derive the SRT change for the same season in different years. This study confirmed the importance of effective management and location of urban green space for urban SRT mitigation. Ultimately, the impact on urban SRT of urban green-space change should be regarded as an important factor in urban planning.";"Shin, Dong-hoon

"AGRIS:US201600126101";"Integration of land use and land cover inventories for landscape management and planning in Italy";"";"There are both semantic and technical differences between land use (LU) and land cover (LC) measurements. In cartographic approaches, these differences are often neglected, giving rise to a hybrid classification. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding and characterization of the two classification schemes using a comparison that allows maximization of the informative power of both. The analysis was carried out in the Molise region (Central Italy) using sample information from the Italian Land Use Inventory (IUTI). The sampling points were classified with a visual interpretation of aerial photographs for both LU and LC in order to estimate surfaces and assess the changes that occurred between 2000 and 2012. The results underscore the polarization of land use and land cover changes resulting from the following: (a) recolonization of natural surfaces, (b) strong dynamisms between the LC classes in the natural and semi-natural domain and (c) urban sprawl on the lower hills and plains. Most of the observed transitions are attributable to decreases in croplands, natural grasslands and pastures, owing to agricultural abandonment. The results demonstrate that a comparison between LU and LC estimates and their changes provides an understanding of the causes of misalignment between the two criteria. Such information may be useful for planning policies in both natural and semi-natural contexts as well as in urban areas.";"Sallustio, Lorenzo

"AGRIS:US201500078304";"Effects of precipitation on grassland ecosystem restoration under grazing exclusion in Inner Mongolia, China";"";"China launched the “Returning Grazing Lands to Grasslands” project about a decade ago to restore severely degraded grasslands. Grassland grazing exclusion was one of the experimental approaches for achieving the grand goal. Here, we evaluate the long-term regional ecological effects of grassland grazing exclusion in the Xilingol region of Inner Mongolia, China. The dynamics of grassland communities over 8 years (2004–2011) were continuously monitored at 11 research sites dominated by temperate steppe ecosystems. These sites represent the diverse landscapes of the Mongolian Plateau in the Arid, Semi-Arid, and Humid Climatic Zones that have varying precipitation levels. The community structure of degraded grasslands was found to recover quickly toward a benign state after grazing exclusion. The exclusion promoted an increase in mean plant community height, coverage, aboveground fresh biomass, and quality. The grasslands recovered fastest and most favorably in the Humid Zone followed by the Semi-Arid Zone and the Arid Zone. The increase in the aboveground biomass and vegetation height correlated significantly with the amount of total growing season precipitation. Precipitation therefore amplified the grazing exclusion effects on grassland restoration. Grazing exclusion was most effective in the relatively moist part of the study region. However, other factors such as global climate change and variability might have interacted with grazing management practices, thereby influencing the outcomes of grassland restoration efforts in Inner Mongolia. Future implementations of grassland ecosystem management should consider the regional climatic heterogeneity to maximize costs/benefits for achieving long-term ecosystem sustainability.";"Hao, Lu

"AGRIS:US201600126107";"Monitoring urban expansion and its effects on land use and land cover changes in Guangzhou city, China";"";"There are widespread concerns about urban sprawl in China. In response, modeling and assessing urban expansion and subsequent land use and land cover (LULC) changes have become important approaches to support decisions about appropriate development and land resource use. Guangzhou, a major metropolitan city in South China, has experienced rapid urbanization and great economic growth in the past few decades. This study applied a series of Landsat images to assess the urban expansion and subsequent LULC changes over 35 years, from 1979 to 2013. From start to end, urban expansion increased by 1512.24 km² with an annual growth rate of 11.25 %. There were four stages of urban growth: low rates from 1979 to 1990, increased rates from 1990 to 2001, high rates from 2001 to 2009, and steady increased rates from 2009 to 2013. There were also three different urban growth types in these different stages: edge-expansion growth, infilling growth, and spontaneous growth. Other land cover, such as cropland, forest, and mosaics of cropland and natural vegetation, were severely impacted as a result. To analyze these changes, we used landscape metrics to characterize the changes in the spatial patterns across the Guangzhou landscape and the impacts of urban growth on other types of land cover. The significant changes in LULC and urban expansion were highly correlated with economic development, population growth, technical progress, policy elements, and other similar indexes.";"Wu, Yanyan

Global climate change consequence is a priority to predict global environmental change impacts on these degradation risks. This agro-ecological approach can be especially useful when formulating soil specific agricultural practices based on the spatial variability of soils and related resources to reverse environmental degradation. Raizal and Pantanal models within the new MicroLEIS framework, the Ero&Con package, are database/expert system evaluation approach for assessing limitations to land use, or vulnerability of the land to specified agricultural degradation risks. This study was performed in Souma area with approximately 4100 ha extension in the North-West of Iran (west Azarbaijan). Based on 35 sampling soils, Typic Xerofluvents, Typic Calcixerepts, Fluventic Haploxerepts and Fluventic Endaquepts were classified as main subgroups. Climatological data, referred to temperature and precipitation of more than 36 consecutive years were collected from Urmieh station reports and stored in monthly Climate Database CDBm, as a major component of MicroLEIS DSS (CDBm) program. Climate data for a hypothetical future scenario were collected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports for the 2080s period. The evaluation approach predicts that attainable water erosion vulnerability classes were none (V1) very low (V2) and moderately low (V4) in the total of 72%, 13% and 15% of the Souma area, respectively and they will not affected by climate change. On contrary, attainable wind erosion vulnerability classes will increase. Also, phosphorous and heavy metal contamination vulnerability risks will not differ in two compared scenarios while nitrogen and pesticides vulnerability classes will be improved.";"Shahbazi, Farzin

"AGRIS:US2016222648";"Fiscal and trade distorting effects of capital gains tax on land sales - empirical evidence from agricultural land market in Finland";"";"Capital gains taxes are important sources of government income in particular in high tax Scandinavian countries. These taxes, nevertheless, likely distort the market and resource allocations through so called “lock-in” effect by discouraging trade transactions that would trigger the tax payments. When it comes to agricultural land, the lock-in effect implies that, along the structural development, the land ownership and active farming gradually deviate from each other and land tenancy increases. Increasing land tenancy and land tenure insecurity have shown to incur a significant social cost, because they discourage and delay irreversible land improvements that would be necessary for maintaining land productivity. Therefore, the knowledge about the trade-off between the level of capital gains taxes, land sales and, thus, the resulting fiscal revenues is valuable in designing optimal tax policies. This study estimates the fiscal effects of reduction in capital gains taxes imposed on land sales and provides grounds for optimizing the tax scheme. The results suggest that certain temporary tax waiver programs could maintain the current tax revenues with less trade distorting effects on the land market. By simulating the land trade quantities conditional on alternative tax rates, the study gives information on how much a particular tax waiver program would trigger land sales. The results signal that tax waiver programs could shift the current structural development pattern of gradually increasing tenancy and land tenure insecurity to a pattern, in which the share of land ownership would be increased.

Within homogeneous soil regions, land use and management practices are further important controls for soil OC contents and turnover. Here, we studied the impact of study region, land use (forest, grassland), forest management (spruce and beech forest under age-class management, unmanaged beech forest), and grassland management (meadow, mown pasture, unmown pasture) on stocks and turnover (based on Δ¹⁴C values) of soil OC in density frations of topsoil horizons. Samples were taken from 36 plots in the regions Hainich–Dün (HAI) and the Schwäbische Alb (ALB) in Germany. They were separated into two light fractions (free light fraction (LF1), occluded light fraction (LF2)) and the mineral-associated organic matter (MOM) fraction using sodium polytungstate with a density of 1.6 g cm⁻³. Overall most soil OC was stored in the MOM fraction (73%). Soil OC concentrations and stocks in the MOM fraction differed between study regions, probably due to larger amounts of pedogenic Al- and Fe-oxides in the ALB than in the HAI region. Within each region, forest soils stored significantly higher proportions of total OC in the two LF (33±1.9 %) than grassland soils (20±2.3 %). Different management of forests and grasslands affected the C:N ratio of density fractions, but not OC storage. While modelled soil OC turnover in the MOM was longest of all fractions, all fractions had average Δ¹⁴C values above atmospheric values, suggesting a significant fast-cycling component in all of them. Different from stocks, turnover of OC in the MOM fraction were not affected by study region or contents of pedogenic oxides. Radiocarbon contents in the LF were higher for forest than for grassland sites, indicating faster turnover of OC at grassland sites. However, some of the observed difference could originate from different average lifetimes of roots in forests and grasslands. Applying different lag-times for OC input for forests and grasslands significantly reduced the differences in modelled turnover times. Lower Δ¹⁴C values of mown pastures than pasture soils in both regions suggest a management effect on soil C turnover in grasslands.We conclude that OC storage in the MOM of topsoil layers is more affected by regional differences in soil texture and mineralogy than by land use and management, while its turnover could not be explained with the studied soil properties. Soil OC storage and turnover in the two LFs is influenced by land use (forest or grassland) and management, but ecosystem specific lag-times have to be considered for modelling OC turnover in these fractions.";"Herold, Nadine

Two variables predominantly influenced interviewees' answers: First, their land use interests, and second, their regional affiliation, the latter resulting in differences in the relationship between interviewees and park administration. We conclude that traditional concepts of grouping people based on land use interests may neglect case-specific, actual group structures. Attitudes toward wildlife-related issues might be superimposed by attitudes toward issues other than those originally addressed.";"Gerner, Jutta

"AGRIS:US201500204191";"Geospatial comparison of four models to predict soil erodibility in a semi-arid region of Central India";"";"The soil erodibility factor of RUSLE is one of the important indicators of land degradation. It can be measured either directly under natural or simulated rainfall condition or indirectly estimated by empirical models. A geospatial variation of this factor is essential for prioritization of reclamation measures. However, geospatial upscaling of soil erodibility factor is very uncertain because of its dynamic nature and dependent on the parameters used in the model. This paper studies the geospatial comparison of the effectiveness of four different models to predict the soil erodibility factor by means of the independent role of each model parameter. 669 soil samples were collected from different land uses of Central India on grid basis and analyzed for physicochemical properties. The soil erodibility factor was estimated using four different models. Geostatistical analysis was performed on the point erodibility data of each model to obtain the spatial pattern. Analysis of variance showed that soil properties and erodibility factor varied significantly with various land uses. Croplands showed higher susceptibility to erosion than woodlands and grasslands. The erodibility equation that used particle size with soil organic matter showed better agreement with the variation of land use than the equation used only particle size. Therefore, the models that dynamically integrate soil intrinsic properties with land use can successfully be used for geospatial upscaling of soil erodibility factor.";"Adhikary, Partha Pratim

Although long recognized scientifically as being important, these so‐called biogeophysical forcings are rarely included in climate policies for forestry and other land management projects due to the many challenges associated with their quantification. Here, we review the scientific literature in the fields of atmospheric science and terrestrial ecology in light of three main objectives: (i) to elucidate the challenges associated with quantifying biogeophysical climate forcings connected to land use and land management, with a focus on the forestry sector; (ii) to identify and describe scientific approaches and/or metrics facilitating the quantification and interpretation of direct biogeophysical climate forcings; and (iii) to identify and recommend research priorities that can help overcome the challenges of their attribution to specific land‐use activities, bridging the knowledge gap between the climate modeling, forest ecology, and resource management communities. We find that ignoring surface biogeophysics may mislead climate mitigation policies, yet existing metrics are unlikely to be sufficient. Successful metrics ought to (i) include both radiative and nonradiative climate forcings; (ii) reconcile disparities between biogeophysical and biogeochemical forcings, and (iii) acknowledge trade‐offs between global and local climate benefits. We call for more coordinated research among terrestrial ecologists, resource managers, and coupled climate modelers to harmonize datasets, refine analytical techniques, and corroborate and validate metrics that are more amenable to analyses at the scale of an individual site or region.";"Bright, Ryan M.

In this paper we demonstrate such an assessment using the PESERA–DESMICE modeling framework with various scenarios for 13 global land degradation hotspots. Starting with an initial assessment representing land degradation and productivity under current conditions, options to combat instances of land degradation are explored by determining: (1) Which technologies are most biophysically appropriate and most financially viable in which locations; we term these the “technology scenarios”; (2) how policy instruments such as subsidies influence upfront investment requirements and financial viability and how they lead to reduced levels of land degradation; we term these the “policy scenarios”; and (3) how technology adoption affects development issues such as food production and livelihoods; we term these the “global scenarios”. Technology scenarios help choose the best technology for a given area in biophysical and financial terms, thereby outlining where policy support may be needed to promote adoption; policy scenarios assess whether a policy alternative leads to a greater extent of technology adoption; while global scenarios demonstrate how implementing technologies may serve wider sustainable development goals. Scenarios are applied to assess spatial variation within study sites as well as to compare across different sites. Our results show significant scope to combat land degradation and raise agricultural productivity at moderate cost. We conclude that scenario assessment can provide informative input to multi-level land management decision-making processes.";"Fleskens, L.

"AGRIS:US201500016396";"Participatory Evaluation of Monitoring and Modeling of Sustainable Land Management Technologies in Areas Prone to Land Degradation";"";"Examples of sustainable land management (SLM) exist throughout the world. In many cases, SLM has largely evolved through local traditional practices and incremental experimentation rather than being adopted on the basis of scientific evidence. This means that SLM technologies are often only adopted across small areas. The DESIRE (DESertIfication mitigation and REmediation of degraded land) project combined local traditional knowledge on SLM with empirical evaluation of SLM technologies. The purpose of this was to evaluate and select options for dissemination in 16 sites across 12 countries. It involved (i) an initial workshop to evaluate stakeholder priorities (reported elsewhere), (ii) field trials/empirical modeling, and then, (iii) further stakeholder evaluation workshops. This paper focuses on workshops in which stakeholders evaluated the performance of SLM technologies based on the scientific monitoring and modeling results from 15 study sites. It analyses workshop outcomes to evaluate how scientific results affected stakeholders’ perceptions of local SLM technologies. It also assessed the potential of this participatory approach in facilitating wider acceptance and implementation of SLM. In several sites, stakeholder preferences for SLM technologies changed as a consequence of empirical measurements and modeling assessments of each technology. Two workshop examples are presented in depth to: (a) explore the scientific results that triggered stakeholders to change their views; and (b) discuss stakeholders’ suggestions on how the adoption of SLM technologies could be up-scaled. The overall multi-stakeholder participatory approach taken is then evaluated. It is concluded that to facilitate broad-scale adoption of SLM technologies, de-contextualized, scientific generalisations must be given local context; scientific findings must be viewed alongside traditional beliefs and both scrutinized with equal rigor; and the knowledge of all kinds of experts must be recognised and considered in decision-making about SLM, whether it has been formally codified or not. The approach presented in this paper provided this opportunity and received positive feedback from stakeholders.";"Stringer, L. C.

However, there is still little agreement on which indicators may best reflect both status and trends of these phenomena. In this study, various processes of land degradation and desertification have been analyzed in 17 study sites around the world using a wide set of biophysical and socioeconomic indicators. The database described earlier in this issue by Kosmas and others (Environ Manage, 2013) for defining desertification risk was further analyzed to define the most important indicators related to the following degradation processes: water erosion in various land uses, tillage erosion, soil salinization, water stress, forest fires, and overgrazing. A correlation analysis was applied to the selected indicators in order to identify the most important variables contributing to each land degradation process. The analysis indicates that the most important indicators are: (i) rain seasonality affecting water erosion, water stress, and forest fires, (ii) slope gradient affecting water erosion, tillage erosion and water stress, and (iii) water scarcity soil salinization, water stress, and forest fires. Implementation of existing regulations or policies concerned with resources development and environmental sustainability was identified as the most important indicator of land protection.";"Kairis, Or.

"AGRIS:US201301959230";"Why are there so few cooperative agreements between farmers and water services in france? water policies and the problem of land use rights";"";"One of the recurrent shortcomings of water policy in France is the control of diffuse agricultural pollution. Numerous lacunae and incoherencies in the French Rural, Public Health, and Environmental Codes have hindered the effective implementation of efficient protection measures. In this paper, we underline the extent to which these incoherencies have hampered the emergence of cooperative agreements (CAs) between farmers and drinking water service providers. The theoretical framework of institutional resource regimes (IRRs) provides a key to understanding the failure of public policy to impose restrictions on agricultural land use rights and to encourage voluntary arrangements concerning agricultural practices. The IRR framework was applied before 2005 to 12 cases of public attempts to negotiate a reduction in polluting practices. Our study enabled us to characterise the lack of extent and coherence of the water sector's IRR in France. Since 2005, regulatory changes have extended the scope of this IRR with a view to making water, agriculture and health policies more coherent. We discuss the complexity of the new approach, and question its capacity to mobilise the actors concerned around the territorial reorganisation of agriculture aimed at reducing diffuse pollution.";"Garin, Patrice

The socio-economic situation can also pose challenges, as dryland regions are often characterized by remoteness, marginality, low-productive farming, weak institutions, and even conflict. With threats from climate change, disputes over water, competing claims on land, and migration increasing worldwide, the demands for sustainable land management (SLM) measures will only increase in the future. Within the EU-funded DESIRE project, researchers and stakeholders jointly identified existing SLM technologies and approaches in 17 dryland study sites located in the Mediterranean and around the world. In order to evaluate and share this valuable SLM experience, local researchers documented the SLM technologies and approaches in collaboration with land users, utilizing the internationally recognized WOCAT questionnaires. This article provides an analysis of 30 technologies and 8 approaches, enabling an initial evaluation of how SLM addresses prevalent dryland threats, such as water scarcity, soil degradation, vegetation degradation and low production, climate change, resource use conflicts, and migration. Among the impacts attributed to the documented technologies, those mentioned most were diversified and enhanced production and better management of water and soil degradation, whether through water harvesting, improving soil moisture, or reducing runoff. Favorable local-scale cost–benefit relationships were mainly found when considered over the long term. Nevertheless, SLM was found to improve people’s livelihoods and prevent further outmigration. More field research is needed to reinforce expert assessments of SLM impacts and provide the necessary evidence-based rationale for investing in SLM.";"Schwilch, G.

Then it began to be clear that the Internet could become the main medium to publish and share new information with a much wider audience. The DESIRE Project (desertification mitigation and remediation of land—a global approach for local solutions) has built on expertise gained in previous projects to develop an innovative online ‘Harmonized Information System’ (HIS). This documents the context, delivery and evaluation of all tasks in the DESIRE Project using non-scientific terminology, with much of it also available in the local languages of the study sites. The DESIRE-HIS makes use of new possibilities for communication, including video clips, interactive tools, and links to social media networks such as Twitter. Dissemination of research results using this approach has required careful planning and design. This paper sets out the steps that have culminated in a complete online Information System about local solutions to global land management problems in desertification-affected areas, including many practical guidelines for responsible land management. As many of those who are affected by desertification do not have Internet access, printable dissemination materials are also available on the DESIRE-HIS.";"Geeson, Nichola

The authors focus on the effects of the structural adjustment programs in the 1980's and 1990's. The analysis begins by reviewing the economic context in which maize production occurs in the region and the main economic policy instruments affecting the maize economy. Next, trends in maize consumption and production are analyzed, along with the main factors influencing maize production, including trends in the public financing of maize research and extension. The authors find that several factors related to structural adjustment have defined -- and are still defining -- the course of agriculture, including maize production, in the countries of the region. The impact of these factors on maize production, consumption, and import trends has been different in Central America and in Mexico. In particular, the reduction or complete elimination of production incentives, the reduction of trade barriers, the liberalization of input and product prices, the deregulation of the currency exchange rate, the control of inflation, and the restructuring of agricultural research systems between the public and the private sectors have determined how basic grains are produced in the region and how they will be produced in the future. Furthermore, the visible and increasing deterioration of the natural resource base has raised great concern about the need to promote more sustainable, environmentally friendly uses of production systems and natural resources.";"Sain, G.

Soil characteristics and agroclimatic conditions greatly influence the cultivar choice, agronomic husbandry practices and the economics of production. Using the latest (UKCP09) scenarios of climate change for the UK, the present paper describes a methodology using pedo-climatic functions and a geographical information system (GIS) to model and map current and future land suitability for potato production in England and Wales. The outputs identify regions where rainfed production is likely to become limiting and where future irrigated production would be constrained due to shortages in water availability. The results suggest that by the 2050s, the area of land that is currently well or moderately suited for rainfed production would decline by 88 and 74%, respectively, under the âmost likelyâ climate projections for the low emissions scenario and by 95 and 86%, respectively, for the high emissions scenario, owing to increased likelihood of dry conditions. In many areas, rainfed production would become increasingly risky. However, with supplementary irrigation, c. 0Â·85 of the total arable land in central and eastern England would remain suitable for production, although most of this is in catchments where water resources are already over-licensed and/or over-abstracted; the expansion of irrigated cropping is thus likely to be constrained by water availability. The increase in the volume of water required due to the switch from rainfed- to irrigated-potato cropping is likely to be much greater than the incremental increase in water demand solely on irrigated potatoes. The implications of climate change on the potato industry, the adaptation options and responses available, and the uncertainty associated with the land suitability projections, are discussed.";"DACCACHE, A.

Cost utility analysis of multiple-species projects.";"";"Conservation of species is challenging, and there is continuing interest in finding moreeffective means to achieve conservation goals. State provision of conservation occurs in many countries, alongside a growing range of alternative providers including Not For Profit organisations and the private sector. Few studies have compared the effectiveness and efficiency of State provision against Not For Profit or private sector provision. This researchassesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiple-species projects in regard to the conservation of threatened and endangered species using a cost-utility analysis. Three State managed projects, three Not For Profit managed projects and one project managed by the State yet funded privately, were evaluated. All of the Not For Profit managed projects were enclosed by predator-proof fences, while the other projects relied on natural barriers and/orintensive predator control methods. Results indicate that State managed multiple-speciesprojects are both more effective and cost-effective than those projects managed by Not For Profits. While the Not For Profit managed projects are not so effective in improving national population totals, they are essential for ensuring regional biodiversity of threatened and endangered species. The objectives set by the projects appear to have a significant impact ontheir outputs. A number of recommendations are made for improving conservation efforts in the future. Most importantly, the development of a threatened and endangered species database to be contributed to by all conservation project providers. The importance of standardised reporting techniques is highlighted to allow comparisons both over time and between projects.";"Vesey, S.E.

The characterization included microbial biomass, available organic carbon, basal respiration, metabolic quotient, biomass-specific available organic carbon, arylsulfatase activity, soil organic matter carbon and total nitrogen. Mulching of pure cultures of grasses and legumes contributed to a high soil organic matter accumulation. Repeated Roundup desiccation caused a strong (highly significant) decrease of arylsulfatase activity (-28%), however, highly significant increase of microbial biomass (+69%) and nitrate-nitrogen (+86%) were determined. The subsequent regrassing compensated for the changes described. The soil biological properties were best preserved on mulched fallow with Lotus corniculatus and Festuca pratensis, also in regard to contamination with weeds.";"Ruzkova, M.,Ustredni Kontrolni a Zkusebni Ustav Zemedelsky, Brno (Czech Republic)

Forecasts of the harvest activity have traditionally relied on the assumption that harvest is carried out according to forest management guidelines or to maximize forest value. However, these rules are, in practice, seldom applied systematically, which may result in large discrepancies between predicted and actual harvest in short-term forecasts. We present empirical harvest models that predict final felling and thinning based on forest attributes such as site index, stand age, volume, slope, and distance to road. The logistic regression models were developed and fit to Norwegian national forest inventory data and predict harvest with high discriminating power. The models were consistent with expected landowners behavior, that is, areas with high timber value and low harvest cost were more likely to be harvested.

"AGRIS:US201400070919";"role of prescribed burn associations in the application of prescribed fires in rangeland ecosystems";"";"Although the ecological thresholds for restoring fire-adapted ecosystems back to their original state are better understood than in the past, the key hurdle to reintroducing historical fire regimes at landscape scales is a social one. The objectives of this study were to assess the human dimensions of prescribed fire and evaluate the role of Prescribed Burn Associations (PBAs) in promoting the adoption of prescribed fire at the landscape scale. The study was conducted in 12 counties in Texas, consisting of clusters of four counties in each of three ecoregions. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 1187 landowners to gather information regarding landowner attitudes and perceptions towards the use of prescribed fire as a rangeland management and restoration tool. We received 585 useable responses (129 PBA-members and 456 non-members), representing an overall response rate of 49%. Most (86%) survey respondents slightly agreed to strongly agreed with the use of prescribed fire and most (89%) slightly agreed to strongly agreed that prescribed fire is beneficial land management tool that they would use. There are, however, significant differences between PBA member and non-member attitudes and perceptions regarding fire and actual application of prescribed fire. PBA membership was a significant explanatory variable for the application of prescribed fire at all sites. Our research suggests that PBAs can significantly reduce landowners’ risks of an intentionally ignited fire burning out of control by sharing experience, labor and equipment, which ultimately increases the potential capacity for using prescribed fire as a rangeland improvement tool at landscape, watershed and even regional scales.";"Toledo, David

Data were obtained by means of GIS technology and disclosed a new, original model for analysing the viticultural ecoclimate. The evaluation presented in this scientific paper was the result of processing and interpreting data concerning spatial distribution, individual influence and total influence of four ecological factors that determine the quality of grapes: slope, aspect, solar radiation and real insolation. Investigations were carried out in three stages: I. Determination of the spatial distribution of ecological factors in the wine growing region; II. Determination of the ecological factors suitability and their distribution in the wine growing region; III. Determination of the oenoclimatic potential of the wine growing region and the graphical representation of its spatial distribution. The distribution of ecological factors is represented by digital maps. The ecological factor suitability for grape growing was assessed according to a new evaluation system, and its distribution was represented graphically on the region map. The oenoclimatic potential was expressed by the sum and the average of evaluation points given to the ecological factors. We found that the sum of evaluation points has generated a detailed representation of the oenoclimatic potential, while the average of evaluation points gave a much clearer synthetic representation, allowing the identification and delimitation of highly favourable terroirs. The evaluation of the Averesti wine-growing centre _ Husi vineyard (Vaslui County) has shown that 94.37% of its area was favourable for producing high quality white wines, 4.40% for producing quality white and red wines, while 1.19% was less favourable for wine growing.

Using the value-belief-norm theory, this study identifies the extent to which landowners differ regarding the psychological variables antecedent of a moral obligation to protect local biodiversity after participation in conservation programmes. A survey was carried out among 280 landowners who had to varying degrees participated in either voluntary forest preservation or wetland restoration. The results showed that the landowner groups did not differ in fundamental value structure and ecological worldview. Landowner groups that had participated in the projects tended to be more aware of consequences, ascribing more responsibility to themselves and expressing personal norms obligating them to participate in local biodiversity conservation more than landowners who did not participate.

The complex and contentious processes involved in decisions concerning the zoning of these deer ranges revealed conflicts between deer migration routes, private property rights, the public good and cultural values attached to open space. These issues raised by the movement of deer and the seasonal variability of their habitat provided an opportunity to reshape the process of environmental governance on the urban fringe that was attentive to the cultural value of open space and challenged rigid property boundaries and property rights.

"AGRIS:ES2006002289";"European framework for surveillance and monitoring of habitats: a methodological approach for Spain";"Estructura europea para la supervisión y el seguimiento de hábitats: aproximación metodológica para España";"There is a well defined policy requirement for a practical and reproducible procedure for surveillance and monitoring of habitats in Spain that can subsequently be fitted into a European framework. Any such procedure also needs to incorporate records of the Spanish habitat classification. A procedure is described that will satisfy those requirements and has been field tested both in Spain and in Europe. Rigorous rules and training are required; otherwise changes from baseline records cannot reliably be separated from background noise. The procedure uses the classical plant life forms long used in biogeography and is based on their statistical relationship with the environment. This relationship has been validated statistically and the procedure has also been tested in the field in all European environmental zones and widely in Spain. 130 General Habitat Categories are defined and these are enhanced in the field by recording environmental, site and management qualities to produce a flexible database that can then be interrogated. The rules for mapping the habitats mean that they can be used for descriptive purposes or for monitoring. In conjunction with stratification and subsequent sampling, national estimates of stock and change can then be produced. Finally, based on the previous experience of SISPARES, a methodological scheme is proposed for adapting the approach to Spain. The proposal will allow links to be made between European scale surveillance and monitoring to those already obtained for Spain.

Existen en España políticas bien definidas que demandan procedimientos prácticos y reproducibles para llevar a cabo la supervisión y seguimiento de los hábitats, de modo que subsecuentemente puedan ajustarse al marco Europeo.

Aquí se describe un procedimiento que satisface dichos requisitos y que ha sido probado tanto en España como en el resto de Europa. El método exige reglas rigurosas y entrenamiento de campo; si no los cambios en los registros básicos no se podrán separar de manera fiable de los errores subjetivos cometidos durante la toma de datos. El procedimiento utiliza las clásicas formas de vida, ampliamente utilizadas en estudios biogeográficos y está basado en sus relaciones con el medio ambiente. Esta relación ha sido validada estadísticamente y el procedimiento ha sido probado en el campo en todas las zonas ambientales de Europa. En España, se han definido 130 Categorías Generales de Hábitats y se han verificado en el campo mediante el registro de atributos ambientales, estacionales y de manejo, de forma que puedan ser incluidas en una base de datos suficientemente flexible. Las directrices para la cartografía de hábitats posibilitan su uso descriptivo y permiten su seguimiento.

This adverse agro-biodiversity impact of technology adoption might be partially counteracted by an expanding seed sector, supplying a large number of transgenic varieties. The case of Bt cotton in India is taken for empirical illustration. The production function analyses show that both Bt technology and on-farm varietal diversity enhance yield, while reducing the production risk. With few Bt varieties available in the first years, technology adoption entailed a reduction in on-farm varietal diversity. This effect, however, was partially offset by more Bt varieties becoming available over time.";"Krishna, Vijesh V.

"AGRIS:US201500003050";"legacy of social conflicts over property rights in rural Brazil and Mexico: Current land struggles in historical perspective";"";"This article proposes an approach to the agrarian question that focuses on the establishment of absolute private property rights over land in Brazil and Mexico. The author argues that current land struggles are conditioned by the property regimes inherited from past struggles. The author examines the liberal reforms of the nineteenth century and argues that the balance of class forces led to the slow establishment of absolute private property in Brazil, while in Mexico they triggered the Revolution of 1910–1917, which limited agrarian capitalism. The author then turns to the consequences of these different property regimes in the twentieth century and argues that capitalist social relations have been more dominant in the Brazilian than in the Mexican countryside. The conservative modernization of the 1960s and 1970s is identified as a turning point in the fully capitalist development of agriculture in Brazil. The shift toward food imports, the elimination of subsidies, and the reform of Article 27 of the Constitution signal the re-establishment of the conditions for capitalist development of agriculture in Mexico. The article ends with an assessment of the MST and EZLN's strategies to protect peasants’ access to land and to influence the institutional setting determining access to land.";"Vergara-Camus, Leandro";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"MEX;BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500003050";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2011.653345";"";"";"";"1133-1158"

A politikának – kompromisszumokkal és megegyezéssel – mielőbb lépnie kell, mert a rendezett birtokviszonyok növelik a földárat, élénkítik a termőföld iránti keresletet. Az emelkedő árak ugyanakkor bővítik a földkínálatot, végeredményben élénkül az egész földpiac. Ez a leghatékonyabb eszköz a termőfölddel kapcsolatos spekulációk visszaszorítására.Van-e azonban esély a megegyezésre? Politikai síkon aligha! Sőt az agrárközgazdász szakma is meglehetősen megosztott a birtok, a föld kérdésében, hisz körein¬ken belül is hatnak az érdekek, a megcsontosodott előítéletek. Mégis szükség van egy szakmai vitára, egy őszinte véleménycserére, amely körvonalazhat egy – kompromisszumokkal gazdagon körülágyazott – megegyezést. Valamennyiünknek tudomásul kell vennie, hogy a magyar agrárgazdaságnak rendelkeznie kell egy világos jövőképpel, ha úgy tetszik stratégiával. Ennek pedig alfája és ómegája a hosszú távon sta¬bilnak remélt birtokpolitika.E cikk azért íródott, hogy felvessen kérdéseket, leírjon – még ha nem is minden tekintetben kiérlelt – megállapításokat, ezzel lehetőséget adjon a hozzászólásra, a vitára. Hasznos lenne, ha az agrárközgazdász szakma kifejtené véleményét olyan fontos birtokpolitikai kérdésekkel kapcsolatban, mint például a földtulajdon, földbérlet, földpiac, a föld öröklésének szabályozása, az állami szerepvállalás és ennek eszközrendszere. -------------------------------------------- The questions of land ownership and the relevant policy have been highly topical issues for the agricultural professionals ever since Hungary’s accession to the European Union. Articles and presentations repeatedly state that we should prepare for the challenges to be brought about by the liberalisation of land sale. What will happen when the derogation barring foreigners from acquiring land expires?  What will happen if business partnerships are no longer prohibited from purchasing land? We have seven years to answer these challenges, and six have already passed. During this time, the problems were raised multiple times but nothing else was done! Political players have come to a stalemate. This is the 24th hour. Early in the autumn, the new government will need to propose a land bill to the Parliament – preferably based on consensus(!) – which offers protection from the undesired effects of making land sale and purchase arrangements conform to Community standards. Is there a chance that an agreement can be reached, though? Hardly likely among politicians! What is more, the community of agricultural economists is also rather divided on the issue of land, as our community is also affected by interests and ingrained prejudices. Still, a professional debate and an honest exchange of opinions is necessary, and may outline a potential agreement supported by a wide range of compromises. We all must realize that Hungarian agriculture needs to have a clear vision, or strategy, if you like. This essentially requires a land ownership policy which is intended to be stable for a long time to come.This article is intended to raise questions and offer observations – even though they might not all be perfectly polished – which prompt responses and engender a debate.";"Kapronczai, Istvan";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"land use;land ownership";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016220996";"http://purl.umn.edu/99087";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201500082788";"Impact of quarrying on genetic diversity: an approach across landscapes and over time";"";"Land conversion is one of the major global changes that threaten population viability. As with many industrial activities, quarrying highly modifies land cover, destroying previous habitats but also creating new conditions potentially supporting functioning and connectivity of pioneer species. Using a multi-landscape and -temporal approach, we assessed the impact of quarrying on the genetic diversity of two amphibians with contrasted ecological constraints: the common toad (Bufo bufo) and the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), favouring vegetated and pioneer environments, respectively. The study was conducted across six areas of ca. 250 km²each. Mixed effect models were used to determine which landscape features affect the genetic diversity of the two species. These analyses were performed at three time points (1940s, 1970s and 2000s). Genetic diversity of B. bufo was found to increase with the area of semi-wooded and herbaceous vegetation, and decrease with the area of roads and urbanized areas. Genetic diversity of B. calamita increased with the area of bare ground and of quarries, and decreased with the area of dense woods. We found no effect of quarrying on B. bufo, unlike for B. calamita in which genetic diversity was favoured by quarrying at all three time-points. Despite having similar generation times, B. bufo’s diversity was best explained by 1940s landscape and that of B. calamita by 2000s landscape. This study enlightens the genetic conservation value of quarries for pioneer species and the possible delays between landscape changes and their effects on the populations of some, but not all, species.";"Flavenot, Théo

"AGRIS:US201500003058";"meat of the global food crisis";"";"The global food crisis has been widely described in terms of the volatility of grain and oilseed markets and the associated worsening conditions of food security facing many poor people. Various explanations have been given for this volatility, including increasingly meat-centered diets and rising demand for animal feed, especially in China. This is a very partial reading, as the food crisis runs much deeper than recent market turbulence; when it is understood in terms of the biophysical contradictions of the industrial grain–oilseed–livestock complex and how they are now accelerating, meat moves to the center of the story. Industrial livestock production is the driving force behind rising meat consumption on a world scale, and the process of cycling great volumes of industrial grains and oilseeds through soaring populations of concentrated animals serves to magnify the land and resource budgets, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. These dynamics not only reflect disparities but are exacerbating them, foremost through climate change. Thus, this paper suggests that rising meat consumption and industrial livestock production should be understood together to comprise a powerful long-term vector of global inequality.";"Weis, Tony";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"climate change;food security";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";"";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500003058";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2012.752357";"";"";"";"65-85"

This study sort to identify and assess the patterns of land degradation indicators in selected districts of western Kenya. The study employed the use of Land Degradation Sampling Framework (LDSF) to characterize the sites. LDSF a spatially stratified, random sampling design framework consisting of 10km×10km blocks and clusters of plots. The study broadly identified and classified the indicators and attributes of land degradation into soil and site stability, hydrologic function and biotic integrity. Assessment of general vegetation structure showed that over 70% of the land was under cropland with forests accounting for 8% of the area. Sheet erosion was the major form of soil loss. High variability was observed for the soil properties and this can be due to both inherent soil characteristics as well as land management practices. There was distinct variation in the soil properties between the topsoil (0–20cm) and the subsoil (20–30cm) with the topsoil having higher values for most of the parameters compared to the subsoil. Using coefficient of variation (CV) as criteria for expressing variability, Ca, TON, Mg, SOC and silt were most variable soil properties for the 0–20cm depth. Moderate variability (CV 0.15–0.35) was observed for CEC, P, K and clay while Na, Sand and pH had the least variability (CV<0.15). For the subsoil (20–30cm), Ca, Mg and silt were the most variable. About 94% of the farms sampled were recorded to have very strongly acidic soil levels (pH4.5–5.5) while 6% of the farms had moderately acidic soil levels (pH5.6–6.0). Over 55% of the farms had low (<2%) total organic carbon levels and this varied with land use. Soils with SOM below this ‘critical level’ are at a threat of degradation if not well managed. The principal component analysis (PCA) identified three main explanatory factors for soil variability: ‘soil fertility potential’, ‘soil physical properties’ and ‘available P’. Improving productivity of land therefore calls for the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) options as a strategy to ensuring nutrient availability while at the same time building the natural nutrient reserve through soil organic matter build up.";"Waswa, Boaz S.

Second, PYL supports an integration of information on environmental and landscape conditions into impact assessment. Third, PYL supports the integration of impacts of planning measures on ecosystem services. PYL is a modified 2-D cellular automaton with GIS features. The cells have the major attribute “land-use type” and can be supplemented with additional information, such as specifics regarding geology, topography and climate. The GIS features support the delineation of non-cellular infrastructural elements, such as roads or water bodies. An evaluation matrix represents the core element of the system. In this matrix, values in a relative scale from 0 (lowest value) to 100 (highest value) are assigned to the land-use types and infrastructural elements depending on their effect on ecosystem services. The option to configure rules for describing the impact of environmental attributes and proximity effects on cell values and land-use transition probabilities is of particular importance. User interface and usage of the platform are demonstrated by an application case. Constraints and limits of the recent version are discussed, including the need to consider in the evaluation, landscape-structure aspects such as patch size, fragmentation and spatial connectivity. Regarding the further development, it is planned to include the impact of land management practices to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in regional planning.";"Fürst, Christine

These swamp forest breeding territories are often embedded in a mosaic of wetland cover types. An accurate map of wetlands in the Hudson Highlands would be a useful input to a GWW habitat suitability model and could help conservation managers better allocate limited resources towards GWW monitoring and habitat management. This study tests the effectiveness of single and dual-season dual-polarization L-band ALOS PALSAR data and National Wetlands Inventory ground reference data for classifying wetlands at high resolution in a mountainous landscape using a maximum likelihood decision rule. PALSAR imagery was chosen over Landsat for its ability to detect surface conditions beneath a vegetation canopy and for its higher spatial resolution, necessary for capturing land cover characteristics at a scale that would be meaningful for characterizing GWW territories. Dual-season dual-polarization imagery produced the highest overall accuracy (72 %, kappa = 0.5669) and the highest producer’s accuracy for forested wetlands (~58 %). Errors in classifying forested wetlands were dominated by misclassification to the Urban class, most likely due to the similarity of SAR double bounce trunk-ground and building-ground interactions. Emergent and scrub-shrub wetlands proved difficult to segregate and were classified with maximum accuracies of 49 and 14 %, respectively. These results are comparable to those of similar studies and could be improved with more current ground reference data. In addition, the classification captured the mosaic of wetland cover types present in GWW study sites and territories in Sterling Forest State Park indicating PALSAR imagery could be used for GWW habitat analyses.";"Pistolesi, Linda I.

"AGRIS:US201300796748";"Assessing causes of recent organic carbon losses from cropland soils by means of regional-scaled input balances for the case of Flanders (Belgium)";"";"Several recent reports on cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes throughout Europe indicate a general continuing loss of SOC from these soils. As most arable soils in Europe are not in an equilibrium situation because of past changes in land-use and management practices, shifts in both have been suggested to drive this decline of SOC stocks. A lack of data has prevented the unambiguous verification of the contribution of these factors to SOC loss. First, this study focused on recent evolutions in management options for SOC sequestration in Flanders and showed that despite such practices have increased since 1990, their current contribution is still limited. Strikingly, their expansion is at odds with the reported general losses of SOC (-0.48 t OC ha-¹ year-¹ on average). We used very detailed datasets of livestock numbers, N-application rates and cropping surfaces to calculate regional shifts in input of effective OC from animal manure application, cereal straw incorporation and crop residue incorporation which amounted to -0.094, -0.045 and -0.017 t OC ha-¹ year-¹, respectively. Shifts in management were identified to have potentially brought about but a third of the recent loss of SOC in the study area, although for central West-Flanders and the Eastern border of Flanders larger impacts of management were observed. This study suggests other influences such as land-use change and climate change to be involved as well. We estimated that another 10%-45% of the loss of SOC could potentially be attributed to land-use changes from grassland to cropland during the 1970-1990 period and about 10% to the observed temperature increase. While being a regional-scaled case study, these findings may be relevant to other European regions in particular (Denmark, The Netherlands, North-West Germany, Brittany and the North-West of France, the Po-valley in Italy and parts of England), with similar climate and intensity of agriculture, and where comparable trends in farming management may well have taken place.";"Sleutel, Steven

Theprogram has existed for eight years and annually benefits nearly 40,000 farms, totaling US$ 30 million per year. This study evaluatestwo specific sub-programs of incentives using a year 2001 survey of 402 small farm households participating in INDAP (small-farmsubsidized credit program) and living in the VII to X Regions. Based on a microeconomic decision model, participation in PhosphateFertilization and Pasture Recuperation were estimated, along with impact functions. Results show that farmers with larger animal herdsand better-linked to markets have a higher probability of program participation. Treatment-effects econometric models were appliedand selection-effects bias was tested and rejected. The results show direct statistically-significant positive impacts of the two programson income.There is only partial evidence that the programs act on income through yield increases for potatoes and milk. These yield increasesdo not necessarily lead to higher incomes. Participation in the programs does not appear to improve value of farm sales.

"AGRIS:US201500217217";"Changes in land use, land tenure, and landscape fragmentation in the Tijuana River Watershed following reform of the ejido sector";"";"Changes in land use and land tenure can influence both physical fragmentation and ownership fragmentation of landscapes, with implications for biodiversity. In this study, we evaluated changes in land use and land tenure in the Tijuana River Watershed, a region of high biodiversity and endemism, following the implementation of a new Agrarian Law which allowed for privatization and sales of communal land (ejidos) beginning in 1992. In order to understand changes in land use and cover, we constructed maps from aerial photographs and Aster images and measured changes between 1994 and 2005. In order to understand changes in land tenure, we collected data from Mexican government sources on ejido land size, ownership, and sales, and we conducted 55 structured interviews with ejidatarios in the watershed. Our results demonstrate that land-use/cover change between 1994 and 2005 was dominated by an increase in urban area and grasslands, and a decrease in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and, to a lesser degree, agriculture. In particular, the conversion of coastal sage scrub has left a far more fragmented landscape than existed in 1994. In addition, most of the ejidos in the watershed, as well as individuals interviewed, had participated in some stage of the land certification and titling process allowed by the new Agrarian Law, resulting in substantial changes in land tenure. However, land tenure security appeared to play a larger role than a desire to sell land and, contrary to studies from other regions, full title to the land was obtained in a range of urban and rural settings, rather than primarily on land closest to urban zones. Our results suggest that past predictions regarding future urban growth and fragmentation of native vegetation in the region have proven accurate and highlights regions of change that merit further study.";"Farley, Kathleen A.

"AGRIS:US2016221710";"The Effect of Climate Change on Transportation Flows and Inland Waterways Due to Climate-Induced Shifts in Crop Production Patterns";"";"This study aims to investigate the effect of climate change on transportation flows and inland waterways in the Mississippi River Basin due to climate-induced shifts in crop production patterns in 2050 using two large scale modeling systems, an Agricultural Sector Model (ASM) and an International Grain Transportation Model (IGTM), with technical approach developed to link the two models. Simulated results from ASM show that 1) US and total social welfare rises; 2) crop producer welfare varies across US regions; 3) production and prices of all crops including corn and soybeans also varies; 4) National total cropland use increases with the expansion of irrigated land and contraction of dryland. After breaking down crop acreage results of ASM to the county level and reaggregating to the crop reporting district (CRD) level, which is the spatial scale employed in IGTM. Our study finds that overall supply of corn and soybeans likely increases in the Northern part, while it tends to decline in some areas from Central to Southern parts of the US. By subtracting demand for grains assumed to constant overtime with simulated supply of grains, we obtain the amount of excess supply and demand for grains, which are used as inputs in IGTM. Various interested findings from IGTM are revealed. For example, Corn Belt, the largest producer of corn in the US, is anticipated to ship less corn supply to Pacific, Northeast, Rocky Mountains, Southeast, and Mississippi Lower ports, while the Great Lakes ports, Lake States, and the Great Plains are expected to receive higher corn shipments from Corn Belt. For the aspect of export, the importance of Lower Mississippi ports, the largest destination for grain export from the US to the rest of the world, is going to diminish, where as the role of Pacific Northwest ports are simulated to increase. Considering overall demand for modes of transportation for total grain shipments, demand for rail and truck is expected to rise, while demand for barge mode is projected to drop.

"AGRIS:CH2013101600";"Can REDD+ Save the Forest? The Role of Payments and Tenure";"";"A recent policy response to halting global forest deforestation and degradation, and any resulting greenhouse gas emissions is REDD+, which also includes the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Although still in its infancy, the success of REDD+ will depend significantly on whether it can be economically viable and if any resulting payments are sufficient to cover the opportunity cost plus any transaction cost. Where tenure security over forest is weak, REDD+ can pose a risk for forest communities, who could be dispossessed, excluded and marginalized. This review of existing studies explores how payment for avoided deforestation, and forest tenure impact the success of REDD+ projects in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and equity. Effectiveness refers to the difference between deforestation with and without REDD+, efficiency refers to avoiding deforestation at minimal cost, and equity refers to the implication of REDD+ on benefit sharing. We conclude that the potential success or failure of REDD+ as a means to reduce deforestation and carbon emission on forest commons depends critically on designing projects that work within existing informal tenure institutions to ensure that carbon storage benefits align with livelihood benefits.";"Edward B.

City governments are increasingly recognising the need to strengthen legal rights for the urban poor as a means to bring them more effectively into the urban economy and ensure better provision of water, sanitation and other primary services. The research focuses on Tanzania and in particular two case studies within Dar es Salaam. The findings of the work suggest that the introduction of residential licenses whilst potentially assisting in creating legal certainty has not resulted in the financial sector accepting them as full security against loans. Accessing credit by the poor however has not yet been fully realised resulting in some further hurdles for the financial sector to overcome. Finally, and of some significance is the registration of property in the informal settlements has provided the opportunity of formal property transactions within these settlements.";"Parsa, Ali

"AGRIS:US201400159398";"Projections of climate change impacts on potential C4 crop productivity over tropical regions";"";"Climate change impacts on agriculture could arguably be most critical for developing countries in tropical regions: their populations rely importantly on agriculture and climate-dependant resources, poverty limits their capacity to anticipate and adapt to climate change, and population increase already poses a serious challenge to food security in those regions. Current projections of climate change impacts on tropical crop yields, even though on average negative, remain largely uncertain: there is need for more consistent, large-scale, quantitative assessments. In this study we use a newly developed agro-DGVM (Dynamical Global Vegetation Model including an explicit representation of croplands) driven by projections from several climate models and two SRES scenarios to evaluate climate change impacts on potential C4 crop productivity over Africa and India from 1960 to 2100. We specifically separate the effect of increasing atmospheric CO₂ levels. We perform transient simulations directly forced by climate model outputs: to preserve consistency in the analysis despite regional biases in climate models, we analyze yield change on a bioclimatic basis (using the Köppen classification) rather than on a geographical basis. We find that the potential productivity of one of the most important staple crops in those regions, millet, will overall decrease, on average over all models and scenarios, by −6% (individual model projections ranging from −29% to +11%). The bioclimatic analysis allows us to highlight the main climate drivers of these changes. The main impact is a moderate but robust temperature-driven yield decrease over Equatorial and Temperate Köppen zones; larger but much more inconsistent yield changes occur in Arid Köppen zones, reflecting the uncertainty in precipitation projections from climate models. The uncertainty in aggregated impacts reflects the uncertainty over these areas, underlining the need to narrow the uncertainty in precipitation projections over dry areas if more reliable agricultural impact assessments over tropical regions are to be provided. Our results are also consistent with the limited magnitude of the impact of increased atmospheric CO₂ levels on C4 crop yields described in the literature. While such climatic impacts further increase the challenge of achieving future food security in developing countries in the Tropics, most of these impacts can arguably be mitigated through adaptation measures and improved agricultural practices.";"Berg, A.

The empirical evidence, of astochastic frontier estimate, shows that productivity is low and most farms are inefficiently utilized. The average levelof agriculture efficiency among rural household is very less than 30% but household that rent in land are more efficient.However, results from a probit regression on rental market participation shows that rental market helps to transfer landto more efficient producers. However, several constraints in credit market, input, labor, and the lack of irrigation areoutweighing the productivity advantage of the tenants. In addition to that, land market development is delayed byremaining restrictions and high transaction cost.

Evidence from Fishers’ Experimental Responses";"";"Economic Experimental Games (EEGs), focused to analyze dilemmas associated with the use of common pool resources, have shown that individuals make extraction decisions that deviate from the suboptimal Nash equilibrium. However, few studies have analyzed whether these deviations towards the social optimum are affected as the stock of resource changes. Performing EEG with local fishermen, we test the hypothesis that the behavior of participants differs under a situation of abundance versus one of scarcity. Our findings show that under a situation of scarcity, players over-extract a given resource, and thus make decisions above the Nash equilibrium; in doing so, they obtain less profit, mine the others-regarding interest, and exacerbate the tragedy of the commons. This result challenges previous findings from the EEG literature. When individuals face abundance of a given resource, however, they deviate downward from the prediction of individualistic behavior.

The research was carried out in the Flumen district (33,000 ha), which is located in the Ebro Valley (Northeast Spain). Land evaluation was based on a 1:100,000 soil survey according to the FAO framework for the main crops in the study area (alfalfa, winter cereals, maize, rice and sunflower). Three crop frequency maps and a crop rotation map, derived from a time-series of Landsat TM and ETM+ images of the period 1993-2000 were used for comparison with land suitability maps. The relationships between the two types of variables were analyzed by means of statistical tests (Pearson chi-square (chi2), Cramers V, Gamma and Somers D). The results show the existence of a significant (P=0.001) relationship between crops location and land suitability, except for opportunist crops as sunflower, which is very much influenced by subsidies in the study period. The alfalfa-based rotations show the highest distribution percentages (52%) on the land most suitable for agriculture in the area. The present multitemporal analysis approach offers a more realistic insight than the comparison between a land evaluation map and static year crop map in assessing the degree of agreement of land evaluation recommendations with crops actually cultivated by farmers.

El objetivo de la presente investigación fue analizar la correspondencia entre los resultados de una evaluación de tierras con la distribución real de los cultivos. Para ello la aptitud biofísica de las tierras se comparó con diferentes tipologías de frecuencia de ocurrencia de los cultivos y rotaciones derivadas de mapas de cultivos multitemporales. La investigación fue llevada a cabo en el distrito de riego de Flumen (33.000 ha), localizado en el valle del Ebro (NE España). La evaluación de tierras se basó en una cartografía de suelos 1:100.000, según el esquema FAO, para los principales cultivos presentes en el área de estudio (alfalfa, cereales de invierno, maíz, arroz y girasol). Se utilizaron tres mapas de frecuencia de cultivos y un mapa de rotaciones, derivado de una serie temporal de imágenes Landsat TM y ETM+ del periodo 1993-2000, y se compararon con los mapas de aptitud de tierras para los diferentes cultivos. Se analizó estadísticamente (Pearson chi al cuadrado, Cramer V, Gamma y Somers D) la relación entre los dos tipos de variables. Los resultados muestran la existencia de una relación significativa (P=0,001) entre la localización de los cultivos y la idoneidad de las tierras, excepto de cultivos oportunistas como el girasol, muy influenciado por las subvenciones en el periodo estudiado. Las rotaciones basadas en la alfalfa muestran los mayores porcentajes (52%) de ocupación en las tierras más aptas para la agricultura en el área de estudio. El presente enfoque multitemporal de análisis de la información ofrece una visión más real que la comparación entre un mapa de evaluación de tierras y un mapa de cultivos de una fecha determinada, cuando se valora el grado de acuerdo entre las recomendaciones sobre la aptitud de las tierras y los cultivos realmente cultivados por los agricultores.";"Martínez Casasnovas, J.A.

However, range management focuses on livestock production and associated practices and structural items (fences, water developments) that are applied to improve livestock distribution. This article assesses the occurrence of livestock distribution-oriented grazing management in the spending and applied practices of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the federal agency charged with assisting private landowners with implementation of US Department of Agriculture conservation programs. NRCS applied practices and spending both suggest an emphasis on livestock distribution and associated structures, with almost 20 million ha of prescribed grazing systems, 10000 km of fence, and 127000 water facilities implemented in 17 western states with assistance from NRCS programs between 2004 and 2007. Ninety percent of funding for 2005 Conservation Security Program grazing enhancements supported investments or management related to livestock distribution. We suggest that increasing the emphasis of NRCS conservation programs and financial assistance on maintaining or increasing compositional and structural heterogeneity of vegetation, rather than on livestock distribution, could be an approach that unifies livestock production and wildlife habitat objectives. In particular, including vegetation heterogeneity as a central goal for upland wildlife habitat management could be a key opportunity to increase incentives for heterogeneity-promoting management on privately owned rangeland.";"Toombs, Theodore P.

"AGRIS:US201301639749";"Constraints to farmers managing dryland salinity in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia";"";"There is an increasingly well-founded understanding of the chief drivers and constraints to widespread adoption by Australian landholders to practices to manage dryland salinity. However, each specific situation depends on a range of biophysical, social and economic factors. Such is the case in this study that examines farmers' salinity management in the Wallatin-O'Brien catchments in the low-medium rainfall zone of the Western Australian wheatbelt. The study involved interviews with landholders and economic modelling of representative farms and salinity management options to gain an understanding of the farmers' adoption behaviour regarding salinity management.Most landholders interviewed saw dryland salinity as a second order farm management issue, due first to the relatively slow rate of expansion of saline land within the catchments and second, because the changes in land use required to prevent further loss of land to salinity were viewed as being uneconomic. The exception to this was the minority (<15 per cent) of farmers in the catchment that have most of the saline land and have experienced most of the recent increase, and for these farmers (primarily located in the valley floor) salinity is a pressing issue. The scale and pattern of isolated outbreaks on adjacent slopes means that salinity is merely a nuisance problem for farmers who only have this type of salinity. For all farmers, a disincentive to invest in salinity management was the landholders' lack of knowledge about the proper placement, needed scale of adoption and economic viability of salinity management options.Saltland pastures, surface water management and lucerne were viewed positively, with several desirable characteristics such as ease of trialling and complementarity to existing farm practices. By contrast, engineering options such as deep drainage, where considerable investment is involved and disposal of groundwater is problematic, were rated less favourably. Bioeconomic modelling of these salinity management options generated results that largely confirmed the merits of what landholders in the catchments currently do. The findings showed that there was little economic merit in wide-scale adoption of these salinity management options in these catchments. However, the findings did highlight the need to match salinity management options to a farm's particular circumstance, if best use of the options is to be made by the different farms in the catchments.

This spread is due to its own competitive abilities, land management practices, and unintended transport by the public as the plant's spikelets often lodge in clothing. Many assume that washing in a laundry machine makes the seeds nonviable: we decided to test this assumption. We hypothesized that seeds would exhibit lower rates of germination and emergence after being laundered, and the effect would be stronger if bleach was used. We found that washing with detergent, followed by drying, had no effect on germination when seeds were allowed to sprout 20 days later. We also found that a 6.0% solution of sodium hypochlorite bleach reduced germination and growth if planting occurred 180 days after laundering.";"Lefcort, Hugh

Successful conservation will need to embrace multiple climate adaptation approaches, but to date they have not been conveyed in an integrated way to help support immediate conservation planning and action in the face of inherent spatial uncertainty about future conditions. Instead, these multiple approaches are often conveyed as competing or contradictory alternatives, when in fact, they are complementary. We present a framework that synthesizes six promising spatially explicit adaptation approaches for conserving biodiversity. We provide guidance on implementing these adaptation approaches and include case studies that highlight how biodiversity conservation can be used in planning. We conclude with general guidance on choosing appropriate climate adaptation approaches to amend for conservation planning.";"Schmitz, Oswald J.

To investigate the spatial distribution of E. multilocularis and the factors influencing this distribution in the recently identified endemic area of Hungary, 1612 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) carcasses were randomly collected from the whole Hungarian territory from November 2008 to February 2009 and from November 2012 to February 2013. The topographic positions of foxes were recorded in geographic information system database. The digitized home ranges and the vector data were used to calculate the altitude, mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil water retention, soil permeability, areas of land cover types and the presence and buffer zone of permanent water bodies within the fox territories. The intestinal mucosa from all the foxes was tested by sedimentation and counting technique. Multiple regression analysis was performed with environmental parameter values and E. multilocularis counts. The spatial distribution of the parasite was clumped. Based on statistical analysis, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation were the major determinants of the spatial distribution of E. multilocularis in Hungary. It can be attributed to the sensitivity of E. multilocularis eggs to high temperatures and desiccation. Although spreading and emergence of the parasite was observed in Hungary before 2009, the prevalence and intensity of infection did not change significantly between the two collection periods. It can be explained by the considerably lower annual precipitation before the second collection period.";"Tolnai, Z.

"AGRIS:US201400106568";"Mapping the vegetation changes in giant panda habitat using Landsat remotely sensed data";"";"Since the 1950s, with national policy changes and socio-economic development, the habitat of the giant pandas has altered accordingly. This can also be inferred from the population changes of the giant pandas as reported in three national surveys. Thus, monitoring the changes in giant panda habitat and then taking appropriate action would be a valuable contribution to giant panda protection. In this paper, using existing habitats and potential habitats of the giant pandas as the study area, multitemporal remotely sensed data from the three national surveys are used as the data source. The land cover of the study area is mapped by the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) method. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics for the resulting classification are 0.8 and 90%, respectively. The results reveal that the current status of the giant panda habitat is very good. Between 1974 and 1989, because of deforestation in the area, the giant panda habitat deteriorated considerably; the total area of broadleaved forests, coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrubs decreased from 62.03% to 57.40% in the study area. However, from 1989 to 2002, due to the conservation policies put into action, the giant panda habitat recovered to some extent; the total area of broadleaved forests, coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrubs increased from 57.40% to 60.68% in the study area. However, conditions are different among the mountain systems. Taking into account only the total of broadleaved forests, coniferous forests, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaved forests and shrubs, in the Minshan mountain system, the forest cover changed from 57.70% in 1974 to 56.74% in 1989 and to 56.30% in 2002, which can be regarded as stable. In the Qinling mountain system, forested areas changed from 70.05% in 1974 to 66.93% in 1989 and to 67.17% in 2002, which reveals little change in this area. In the Qionglai mountain system, forested areas changed from 72.84% in 1974 to 71.53% in 1989 and to 73.22% in 2002; therefore, an increase can be noted in this area. In the Xiangling mountain system, forested areas also increased from 50.81% in 1974 to 50.20% in 1989 and to 53.15% in 2002. In the Liangshan mountain system, forested areas changed from 68.43% in 1974 to 55.81% in 1989 and to 60.07% in 2002. These results are in accordance with the giant panda population changes in different mountain systems. Thus, the best way to improve the threatened status of the panda population is to protect the current habitat and the potential habitat.";"Jian, Ji

Although both pursue related questions, information exchange is often hampered by particularities of the palaeoecological data and a communication gap has been perceived between the disciplines. Based on selected topics and developments mainly in Quaternary palaeoecology, we show that both disciplines have converged somewhat during recent years, while we still see untapped potential for closer interactions. Macroecology is probably the discipline that most easily combines different time scales and where co‐operations between palaeoecologists, geneticists and vegetation modellers have been inspiring. Quantitative vegetation reconstructions provide robust estimates of tree composition and land cover at different spatial scales, suitable for testing hypotheses about long‐term vegetation changes or as quantitative background data in studies on contemporary vegetation patterns. Palaeo data also hold yet unexplored potential to study the drivers of long‐term diversity, and aspects of functional diversity may facilitate comparisons between continents and over glacial–interglacial cycles.";"Reitalu, Triin

"AGRIS:US2016215185";"Economics of Controlling Invasive Species: A Stochastic Optimisation Model for a Spatial-Dynamic Process";"";"Invasive species are significant threats to biodiversity, natural ecosystems andagriculture leading to large worldwide economic and environmental damage. Spreadand control of invasive species are stochastic processes with important spatialdimensions. Most economic studies of invasive species control ignore spatial andstochastic aspects. This paper covers this gap in the previous studies by analysing aspatially explicit dynamic process of controlling invasive species in a stochasticsetting. We show how stochasticity, spatial location of infestation and control caninfluence the spread, control efficiency and optimal control strategies. The main aimof this paper is to analyse the relationship between economic parameters andstochastic spatial characteristics of infestation and control. In the model used, thereare two ways to control infestation: border control, under which the spread ofinvasive species from any of its infested neighbouring cell is prevented, and cellcontrol, which removes the infestation from the existing cell. An integer optimisationmodel is applied to find the optimal strategies to deal with invasive species. Resultsshow that it is optimal to eradicate or contain for a larger range of border control andcell control costs when the invasion is in the corner or on the edge as compared to thecase where the initial infestation is in the middle of the landscape. Decrease in theprobability of successful border control makes containment an unfavourable controloption even for low border control costs. We show that decrease in the rate of spreadcan result in switching optimal strategies from containment to abandonment ofcontrol, or from eradication to containment. We also showed when the probability ofsuccessful cell control decreases, a lower eradication cost is required for eradicationto remain the optimal strategy. In summary, this paper shows that in order to avoidproviding misleading recommendations to environmental managers, it is important toinclude uncertainty in the spatial dynamic analysis of invasive species control.";"Chalak, Morteza

For this, it is imperative to consider not only quantitative production issues, but also environmental issues such as water pollution, biodiversity loss, and land degradation as well as social and economic issues such as organization of supply chains and communication and coordination among stakeholders. However, the development of sustainable agricultural and food systems is so far almost exclusively proposed either at the scale of specific agricultural systems or for selected supply chains. Still strongly neglected is the development of sustainable systems at a territorial scale. We, therefore, present here the concept of agroecology territories. We define agroecology territories as places where a transition process toward sustainable agriculture and food systems is engaged. Three major domains must to be considered for the transition to take place: adaptation of agricultural practices; conservation of biodiversity and natural resources; and development of embedded food systems. Stakeholder group strategies, developed by those who actively engage in these three domains and are themselves actors in the transition, are integral to agroecology territories.";"Wezel, A.

In Hungary, the annual amount of forest and crop by-products and waste is between 4.9 and 5.7 million tons, which is 40 – 50 % more than the amount of firewood produced a year. Replacing natural gas heating with locally grown and/or produced green energy resources is economical nowadays, especially in cases where heat generation from green energy resources is carried out with the help of local and/or regional logistic centres. The environmental impact of heating based on green energy resources under controlled circumstances is only a fraction of the impact of using fossil energy resources. Energy wood plantations even have beneficial effects on soil, water and air, while their impact on biodiversity is not so obvious.

"AGRIS:US201500193004";"Impact of season, fuel load and vegetation cover on fire mediated nutrient losses across savanna agro-ecosystems: the case of northern Ghana";"";"In the subsistence-based, nutrient-poor soils, and fertilizer-limited agriculture of northern Ghana, 45–65 % of land cover is annually burned for purposes of hunting and agricultural land preparation. The effects of burn-season, fractional nutrient losses, combusted plant parts and vegetation type on the fire-mediated nutrient cycling are unclear. We estimate and compare the plant nutrient losses associated with different savanna covers in the early and late burn-seasons and fractionate the losses into actual losses, which should be the cause for concern and the losses due to particulate redistribution. The tissue-moisture and fuel-load elemental concentrations are predominant factors that determine the quantity of fire-induced nutrient losses. About 50 % of total combusted phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium load; and ~99 % of the carbon and nitrogen loads are directly lost from burned sites during burns. Generally, calcium and magnesium are redistributed in particulate forms (~100 and ~90 % respectively) and not lost from the region, phosphorus and potassium are lost in both particulate (~50 and ~75 % respectfully) and non-particulate forms (~50 and ~25 % respectively), whereas the carbon and nitrogen are mostly lost in gaseous forms (~95 %). In the early-burn season high tissue-nitrogen concentration and low phosphorus-concentration renders burn vulnerable to high nitrogen-losses/emissions and low phosphorus-losses per unit burnt biomass. A comparatively high tissue moisture, however, impedes the early burns, resulting in patches of burned and unburned vegetation that reduce the occurrence of late burns and the total losses of plant-nutrients. Early burns reduce the quantity of nutrient losses towards a more secured food production.";"Kugbe, Joseph

We quantify expropriation risk using a hazard analysis of individual plot tenures and incorporate the predicted hazards of expropriation into an empirical analysis of plot-level investment. Our focus is on organic
fertilizer use, which has long lasting benefits for soil quality. Although we find that higher expropriation risk significantly reduces application of organic fertilizer, a welfare analysis shows that guaranteeing land tenure in this part of China would yield only minimal efficiency gains.";"Jacoby, Hanan G.

"AGRIS:US201500008417";"Morphometry and land cover based multi-criteria analysis for assessing the soil erosion susceptibility of the western Himalayan watershed";"";"Complex mountainous environments such as Himalayas are highly susceptibility to natural hazards particular those that are triggered by the action of water such as floods, soil erosion, mass movements and siltation of the hydro-electric power dams. Among all the natural hazards, soil erosion is the most implicit and the devastating hazard affecting the life and property of the millions of people living in these regions. Hence to review and devise strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of soil erosion is of utmost importance to the planners of watershed management programs in these regions. This paper demonstrates the use of satellite based remote sensing data coupled with the observational field data in a multi-criteria analytical (MCA) framework to estimate the soil erosion susceptibility of the sub-watersheds of the Rembiara basin falling in the western Himalaya, using geographical information system (GIS). In this paper, watershed morphometry and land cover are used as an inputs to the MCA framework to prioritize the sub-watersheds of this basin on the basis of their different susceptibilities to soil erosion. Methodology included the derivation of a set of drainage and land cover parameters that act as the indicators of erosion susceptibility. Further the output from the MCA resulted in the categorization of the sub-watersheds into low, medium, high and very high erosion susceptibility classes. A detailed prioritization map for the susceptible sub-watersheds based on the combined role of land cover and morphometry is finally presented. Besides, maps identifying the susceptible sub-watersheds based on morphometry and land cover only are also presented. The results of this study are part of the watershed management program in the study area and are directed to instigate appropriate measures to alleviate the soil erosion in the study area.";"Altaf, Sadaff

"AGRIS:US201400106705";"effects of combining classifiers with the same training statistics using Bayesian decision rules";"";"Multiple classifier systems (MCS) are attracting increasing interest in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning. Recently, MCS are also being introduced in the remote sensing field where the importance of classifier diversity for image classification problems has not been examined. In this article, Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) IV panchromatic and multispectral satellite images are classified into six land cover classes using five base classifiers: contextual classifier, k-nearest neighbour classifier, Mahalanobis classifier, maximum likelihood classifier and minimum distance classifier. The five base classifiers are trained with the same feature sets throughout the experiments and a posteriori probability, derived from the confusion matrix of these base classifiers, is applied to five Bayesian decision rules (product rule, sum rule, maximum rule, minimum rule and median rule) for constructing different combinations of classifier ensembles. The performance of these classifier ensembles is evaluated for overall accuracy and kappa statistics. Three statistical tests, the McNemar's test, the Cochran's Q test and the Looney's F-test, are used to examine the diversity of the classification results of the base classifiers compared to the results of the classifier ensembles. The experimental comparison reveals that (a) significant diversity amongst the base classifiers cannot enhance the performance of classifier ensembles; (b) accuracy improvement of classifier ensembles can only be found by using base classifiers with similar and low accuracy; (c) increasing the number of base classifiers cannot improve the overall accuracy of the MCS and (d) none of the Bayesian decision rules outperforms the others.";"Yan, Wai Yeung

"AGRIS:US201301584450";"importance of conservancies for enhancing the value of game ranch land for large mammal conservation in southern Africa";"";"Legislative changes during recent decades resulted in a massive shift away from livestock towards game ranching in southern Africa, resulting in significant increases in the abundance and distribution of many wildlife species. However, there are problems associated with game ranching from a conservation perspective, including persecution of predators, overstocking, introductions of exotic species and genetic manipulation of 'huntable' species. We suggest here that most of these problems could be overcome through promoting the formation of conservancies, where adjacent ranches remove internal fencing to form larger collaborative wildlife areas. Larger areas permit the reintroduction of the full range of indigenous mammals, tending to result in a land-use shift from high-offtake, low-value consumptive utilization towards higher value forms of hunting and ecotourism. Under these land-use conditions, ranchers tend to be more tolerant of predators and often actively reintroduce them. Freedom of movement for wildlife populations increases resilience to environmental shocks. The collaborative management agreements typical of conservancies tend to align more closely with conservation objectives than on single ranches. Fortuitously, there are financial advantages associated with conservancies: land-use options in conservancies are more profitable and there are economies of scale associated with cooperative management. Land within conservancies is likely to appreciate in value and attract external investment. In addition, conservancies are more conducive to developing partnerships with indigenous communities and investors and may thus increase the political and social sustainability of game ranching. However, ranchers are fiercely independent and may be resistant to removing fences due to the perception that they may relinquish control over their land and wildlife. Strategies are required to overcome such reluctance and promote the formation of conservancies to enhance the conservation value of game ranch land.";"Lindsey, P.A.

The performed investigations, employing two soil tillage systems: classical (ploughing) and simplified (no-tillage), were carried out on lessives soils (Luvisols) and rusty soils (Arenosols) differing typologically, with regard to their kind and species. The activity of the following five enzymes was determined in soil samples: dehydrogenases, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, urease and protease. The applied enzymatic tests turned out to be good indicators differentiating the examined soil objects depending on the employed tillage system. The employment of the simplified tillage system stimulated significantly the activity of the analysed enzymes irrespective of the soil type. This effect was particularly apparent in the top layer (0-10 cm) of the soil. An exceptionally wide range of activity was obtained for dehydrogenases indicating the usefulness of this group of enzymes for the evaluation of changes in the soil environment under the influence of the soil tillage system.

"AGRIS:US2016215762";"Is there a gender gap in housing? Marital property rights in Ecuador";"";"This study conducts a gender analysis of homeownership in Ecuador, drawing upon data collected through the nationally-representative 2010 Ecuador Household Asset Survey carried out by the authors.  The survey collected data on asset ownership both at the household and individual levels.   This allows us to overcome a typical problem faced by gender analyses, that of only having the sex of the household head and not the sex of the owner(s).  The study explores gender differences in homeownership and housing wealth.  There is fairly equal distribution of homeownership and housing wealth, which is not all that surprising given the partial community property marital regime.  Any property purchased during marriage or while in a consensual union is considered joint property, unless it is inherited, in which case it is considered individually-owned property.  This plus the fact that housing is an asset typically acquired during marriage/consensual union may help explain the relatively egalitarian distribution pattern of housing ownership and housing wealth. There are, however, gender differences in the determinants of homeownership and housing wealth.  Past migration is associated with women owning homes and owning more housing wealth but does not seem to impact men’s homeownership or housing wealth.  An extra year of schooling increases men’s housing wealth more than women’s housing wealth and women living in the coastal region own less housing wealth than men in the region.";"Twyman, Jennifer

"AGRIS:US2016218466";"Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Ethanol from Iowa Corn: Life Cycle Analysis versus System-wide Accounting";"";"Life cycle analysis (LCA) is the standard approach used to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of biofuels. However, it is increasingly recognized that LCA results do not account for some impacts—including land use changes—that have important implications on GHGs. Thus, an alternative accounting system that goes beyond LCA is needed. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by laying out the basics of a system-wide accounting (SWA) method that takes into account all potential changes in GHGs resulting from biofuel expansion. We applied both LCA and SWA to assess the GHG impacts of ethanol based on Iowa corn.Growing corn in rotation with soybeans generated 35% less GHG emissions than growing corn after corn. Based on average corn production, ethanol’s GHG benefits were lower in 2007 than in 2006 because of an increase in continuous corn in 2007. When only additional corn was considered, ethanol emitted about 22% less GHGs than gasoline. Results from SWA varied with the choice of baseline and the definition of geographical boundaries. Using 2006 as a baseline and 2007 as a scenario, corn ethanol’s benefits were about 20% of the emissions of gasoline. If we expand geographical limits beyond Iowa, but assume the same emission rates for soybean production and land use changes as those in Iowa, then corn ethanol generated more GHG emissions than gasoline. These results highlight the importance of boundary definition for both LCA and SWA.Keywords: biofuels, corn ethanol, greenhouse gas, life cycle analysis, system-wide accounting.";"Feng, Hongli

"AGRIS:US201300836241";"Observed and modelled soil carbon and nitrogen changes after planting a Pinus radiata stand onto former pasture";"";"After reforesting pasture land, it is often observed that soil carbon stocks decrease. The present work reports findings from a site near Canberra, Australia, where a pine forest (Pinus radiata) was planted onto a former unimproved pasture site. We report a number of detailed observations seeking to understand the basis of the decline in soil C stocks. This is supported by simulations using the whole-ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling model CenW 3.1. The model indicated that over the first 18 years after forest establishment, the site lost about 5.5 t C ha-1 and 588 kgN ha-1 from the soil. The C:N ratio of soil organic matter did not change in a systematic manner over the observational period. Carbon and nitrogen stocks contained in the biomass of the 18-year old pine stand exceeded that of the pasture by 88 t C ha-1 and 393 kgN ha-1. An additional 6.1 t C ha-1 and 110 kgN ha-1 accumulated in above-ground litter. These changes, together with the vertical distribution of carbon and nitrogen in the soil, agreed well with the observation at the site. It was assumed that over 18 years, there was also a loss of 86 kgN ha-1 from the ecosystem because of normal gaseous losses during nitrogen turn-over and a small amount of nitrogen leaching. Those losses could not be replenished in the pine system without symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation, and there were no fertiliser additions. A simple mass balance approach indicated that the amount of nitrogen accumulating in plant biomass and the litter layer plus the assumed nitrogen loss from the site matched the amount of nitrogen lost from the soil organic nitrogen pool. This reduction in soil nitrogen, together with an unchanged C:N ratio, provided a simple and internally consistent explanation for the observed reduction of soil carbon after reforestation. It supports the general notion that trends in soil carbon upon land-use change can often be controlled by the possible fates of available soil nitrogen.";"Kirschbaum, M.U.F.

There is an urgent need for appropriate methodology to assist planners for site selection in aquaculture development. Site selection can be viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a proven, effective method used to solve problem of site selection. This paper applied geographic information systems (GIS), the AHP method, and MCDM to identify areas that are suitable for shrimp aquaculture development in coastal area of Hormozgan, Iran. To create models, combination of layers was carried out through Boolean operators and weighted linear combination (WLC) method. After performing the combination models, the results are presented and compared. Evaluation of the results shows that the most of the areas classified suitable in WLC model coincide with the existing shrimp farms and this indicates the validity of the GIS-based WLC model. The areas with the highest priorities are situated in eastern part of the study area. Since existing shrimp farms cover a small extent in the study area, further expansion of shrimp farming to other areas is possible.";"Hadipour, Abouzar

This study used in‐depth interviews with diverse stakeholders to examine perceptions of restoration success on the Clark Fork River Superfund project in Western Montana. Trust emerged as critical to restoration success and was influenced by public engagement, and by spatial and temporal scale. At this large scale, multiple relationships between agencies, NGOs, businesses, landowners, and other stakeholders meant that building trust was a complicated endeavor. The large spatial scale and long time frame made public engagement challenging, and landowners in particular were critical of the project, expressing mistrust in both agencies and the project as a whole. However, projects focused on smaller spatial scales, such as particular stream reaches, appeared to inspire more effective collaboration. Relationships between organizations were important at this large scale, but inter‐organizational conflict affected trust across the project. Further, because trust requires accepting vulnerability, recognizing the differential vulnerability that particular groups and communities experience, based on the risks and benefits they accrue relative to the project, is important.";"Metcalf, Elizabeth Covelli

As the experiment showed, the automatized methods should be made more accurate by visual camera deciphering and further elaboration in field conditions for the precision improvement.";"Kutsaeva, O.A., Belarus State Academy of Agriculture, Gorki (Belarus)";"";"";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"ru";"land policies;land information systems;geographical information systems;land economics";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA;BLR";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=BY2012001108";"http://elc.baa.by/vestnik2012-1/vestnik_bgsha_1_2012%20.zip";"";"";"";"101-105"
"AGRIS:US2016214581";"Strategies to Promote Market-Oriented Smallholder Agriculture in Developing Countries: A Case of Kenya";"";"Smallholder Agriculture is key to livelihoods of many rural households in developing and transition economies. In Kenya, small farms account for over 75% of total agricultural production and nearly 50% of the marketed output. Despite favourable trends in global development drivers such as rising population, per capita incomes and emerging urban dietary preferences, most smallholder farmers remain poor. This study sought to characterize agricultural commercialization trends, identify and prioritize constraints to participation in markets, analyse determinants of percentage of output sold, and explore strategies to promote market-oriented production. A participatory Rapid Rural Appraisal approach, household survey and a Truncated Regression model were used. A sample of 224 farmers: 76 of them growing maize, 77 involved in horticulture (kales and tomatoes) and 71 practising dairy, were interviewed in one peri-urban and one rural district (Kiambu and Kisii, respectively). Results show that in rural areas, lower levels of output are sold and fewer farmers participate in markets compared to the peri-urban areas. Opportunities for profitable commercial agriculture are observed in growing demand, emerging food preferences and intensive farming. At village-level, market participation is hampered by poor quality and high cost of inputs, high transportation costs, high market charges and unreliable market information. At the household-level, the determinants of percentage of output sold are producer prices, market information arrangement, output, distance to the market, share of non-farm income and gender. Strategies are suggested to improve rural input supply, institutional and regulatory framework, enhance value addition and strengthen market information provision.";"Omiti, John M.

"AGRIS:US201500083816";"Assessment of the historical environmental changes from a survey of local residents in an urban–rural catchment";"";"When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space–time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.";"Mouri, Goro

"AGRIS:US201600063600";"Mapping erosion susceptibility by a multivariate statistical method: A case study from the Ayvalık region, NW Turkey";"";"Erosion is one of the most important natural hazard phenomena in the world, and it poses a significant threat to Turkey in terms of land degredation and desertification. To cope with this problem, we must determine which areas are erosion-prone. Many studies have been carried out and different models and methods have been used to this end. In this study, we used a logistic regression to prepare an erosion susceptibility map for the Ayvalık region in Balıkesir (NW Turkey). The following were our assessment parameters: weathering grades of rocks, slope gradient, structural lineament density, drainage density, land cover, stream power index (SPI) and profile curvature. These were processed by Idrisi Kilimanjaro GIS software. We used logistic regression analysis to relate predictor variables to the occurrence or non-occurrence of gully erosion sites within geographic cells, and then we used this relationship to produce a probability map for future erosion sites. The results indicate that lineament density, weathering grades of rocks and drainage density are the most important variables governing erosion susceptibility. Other variables, such as land cover and slope gradient, were revealed as secondary important variables. Highly weathered basalt, andesite, basaltic andesite and lacustrine sediments were the units most susceptible to erosion. In order to calculate the prediction accuracy of the erosion susceptibility map generated, we compared it with the map showing the gully erosion areas. On the basis of this comparison, the area under curvature (AUC) value was found to be 0.81. This result suggests that the erosion susceptibility map we generated is accurate.";"Akgün, Aykut

"AGRIS:US201500083815";"Interactions between landcover pattern and geospatial processing methods: Effects on landscape metrics and classification accuracy";"";"Remote sensing data is routinely used in ecology to investigate the relationship between landscape pattern as characterised by land use and land cover maps, and ecological processes. Multiple factors related to the representation of geographic phenomenon have been shown to affect characterisation of landscape pattern resulting in spatial uncertainty. This study investigated the effect of the interaction between landscape spatial pattern and geospatial processing methods statistically; unlike most papers which consider the effect of each factor in isolation only. This is important since data used to calculate landscape metrics typically undergo a series of data abstraction processing tasks and are rarely performed in isolation. The geospatial processing methods tested were the aggregation method and the choice of pixel size used to aggregate data. These were compared to two components of landscape pattern, spatial heterogeneity and the proportion of landcover class area. The interactions and their effect on the final landcover map were described using landscape metrics to measure landscape pattern and classification accuracy (response variables). All landscape metrics and classification accuracy were shown to be affected by both landscape pattern and by processing methods. Large variability in the response of those variables and interactions between the explanatory variables were observed. However, even though interactions occurred, this only affected the magnitude of the difference in landscape metric values. Thus, provided that the same processing methods are used, landscapes should retain their ranking when their landscape metrics are compared. For example, highly fragmented landscapes will always have larger values for the landscape metric “number of patches” than less fragmented landscapes. But the magnitude of difference between the landscapes may change and therefore absolute values of landscape metrics may need to be interpreted with caution. The explanatory variables which had the largest effects were spatial heterogeneity and pixel size. These explanatory variables tended to result in large main effects and large interactions. The high variability in the response variables and the interaction of the explanatory variables indicate it would be difficult to make generalisations about the impact of processing on landscape pattern as only two processing methods were tested and it is likely that untested processing methods will potentially result in even greater spatial uncertainty.";"Lechner, Alex M.

We assess the extent to which impacts are related to a) the source of income affected – whether only from agricultural or total business income; b) the channel of the impact – through land use and/or labour input; and c) the level of impacts through time. In addition, we assess the appropriateness of the level of the ELS payment. We find that: a) entering the ELS scheme could negatively affect cereal farm incomes – in particular, the total business income; b) that negative impacts arise primarily in relation to the use of land resources; c) that impacts may diminish over a relatively short period of time; and d) that the ELS payment broadly compensates for losses without providing over compensation. Given the diminishing negative impact over time, the level of ELS payment might need to be reviewed in the longer term, although policy evaluation should consider the wider implications for efficiency of alternative payment levels. We also discuss some limitations of the approach and potential extensions.";"Udagawa, Chihiro

"AGRIS:US201301559605";"Did the Invisible Hand Need a Regulatory Glove to Develop a Green Thumb? Some Historical Perspective on Market Incentives, Win-Win Innovations and the Porter Hypothesis";"";"The idea that properly designed environmental regulations can improve a firm's competitiveness while simultaneously contributing to a cleaner environment through the development of so-called 'win-win' innovations (i.e., that reduce environmental damage while simultaneously increasing profits) is usually credited to Porter (1991). Numerous studies have since attempted to assess the validity of the concept, with mixed results. This paper contributes to this debate by surveying a nearly forgotten body of literature written in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century that discussed the impact of market incentives on the development of valuable by-products out of industrial waste. Based on the opinions held by several industrial chemists, engineers, technical journalists and economists, the development of 'win-win' manufacturing practices seems to have been primarily the result of the profit motive, although actual or potential legal actions based on private property rights and/or government regulations occasionally triggered this process. After reviewing some important historical writings on the latter issue, a suggestion is made that perhaps the best way to craft 'well-designed' environmental regulations is to return to a private property rights approach to mitigating pollution problems whenever possible.";"Desrochers, Pierre";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"common law";"";"Land Policy & Legislation";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301559605";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-008-9208-x";"";"";"";"519-539"
"AGRIS:US201301559606";"Factors Determining Citizen's Attitudes Towards Agri-Environmental Property Rights";"";"The purpose of this paper is to contribute further insights into individuals' agri-environmental attitudes. In particular, the empirical analysis focuses on how citizens think agri-environmental property rights should be assigned. This has been done by surveying how individuals consider the environmental policy should promote the implementation of a group of agri-environmental measures, allowing us to examine the determinants of individuals' opinions about this matter. Results indicate that higher level of income and education support the implementation of obligatory agri-environmental measures with no financial support (property rights should rest on society) except for measures to improve public access to land for leisure activities and ecological farming which are seen more of the voluntary kind (property rights should rest on farmers). Additionally, rural residency has strong significant effect on agri-environmental attitudes as rural residents are more likely to support the implementation of voluntary (with/without financial support) agri-environmental measures. On the whole, this research proves to be a valuable tool to identify factors determining individuals' attitudes towards agri-environmental property rights which can certainly help policymakers to provide customized, better response to social demands on this matter.";"Vera-Toscano, Esperanza

"AGRIS:US201301551586";"roles of roads and agricultural land use in altering hydrological processes in Nam Mae Rim watershed, northern Thailand";"";"The distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (DHSVM) is applied in the 107 km² Nam Mae Rim watershed (NMRW) in northern Thailand. Simulations using land cover scenarios for 1989 and 2002, extreme deforestation, and forest, each run with and without roads, show that roads have very small effects on the mean water fluxes, but significantly increase peak flows for all land cover scenarios. The magnitude of the road effect on peak flow depends on the land cover context in which the roads are placed. Roads have the smallest effect on peaks within the extreme deforestation scenario, and affect mainly the smallest peaks in the two homogeneous land cover scenarios (forest and extreme deforestation). Roads have the largest effect on peaks within the heterogeneous landscapes of the two historical land cover scenarios (1989 and 2002). This result indicates that, by conveying surface flow quickly to the stream, roads within a fragmented landscape are especially important in converting greater amounts of overland flow into higher peak flows. Without roads, the patchy land cover pattern buffers the impacts of the scattered overland flow source areas and limits increases in peak flows.The combined effects of land cover and roads are examined in comparison with forest. The 1989 and 2002 land cover patterns result in relatively small changes in the mean annual water balance, but with some significant changes in the seasonal distribution of fluxes. Streamflow is lower in the late wet season and higher in the dry season for the 1989 and 2002 scenarios compared with forest. Conversion from forest to any of the other land cover scenarios results in higher dry season evapotranspiration (ET) and lower wet season ET. The extreme deforestation scenario results in much lower wet season ET and much higher annual streamflow, but little change in dry season streamflow, in comparison with forest.

The analysis pays particular attention to local level negotiations which occur when local actors make use of concrete resources and engage in discussions about their appropriate use. In both Albania and Romania, national parks are the object of intense negotiations, as local people contest the associated restrictions on their property rights to agricultural land and forest. The outcomes of the negotiations are varied, reflecting the influence of locally specific contexts. These results indicate that legal acts alone do not institutionalise property rights, as those are negotiated simultaneously among various kinds of actors at multiple, interrelated levels. Institutionalisation works through local negotiations about concrete resource practices and their associated justifications.";"Stahl, Johannes

"AGRIS:US201500205618";"Correlating concentrations of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition with respective accumulation in moss and natural surface soil for ecological land classes in Norway between 1990 and 2010";"";"This study investigated whether statistical correlation of modeled atmospheric heavy metal deposition and respective accumulation in moss and natural surface soil varies across natural landscapes in Norway. Target metals were cadmium, lead, and mercury, and analyses were run between 1990 and 2010 on a 5-year interval. The landscape information was derived from the Ecological Land Classification of Europe. Correlations between concentration and respective deposition data were computed for each land class. The strongest correlations between heavy metal concentrations in atmospheric deposition and corresponding levels in moss and natural surface soil were observed for lead. Correlations for mercury were weaker compared to those calculated for cadmium and lead, indicating that atmospheric transport of mercury occurs at a larger spatial scale, while accumulation additionally seems to be influenced by factors operating on smaller scales. The correlation between concentrations in atmospheric deposition and moss is landscape-specific and metal-specific. The same holds true for the relations between heavy metal concentration in modeled atmospheric deposition and natural surface soil. The results of this investigation are in line with similar calculations from across Europe. They further confirm previous studies indicating that for Norway atmospheric transport is a main source of lead and cadmium accumulation in moss as well as in natural surface soil.";"Nickel, Stefan

"AGRIS:US201600183511";"Gopher Tortoise Ecology in Coastal Upland and Beach Dune Habitats in Northeast Florida";"";"Considered a keystone species in the southeastern US coastal plain, gopher tortoises occupy a variety of upland habitat types. Although upland pine-dominated habitats have received much attention, few studies have examined tortoises in nearby coastal beach dune habitats. To examine the distribution and abundance of gopher tortoises in northeast Florida coastal habitats, comprehensive burrow surveys were conducted 3 times during the last 8 yrs on 2 separate gopher tortoise populations near St. Augustine, Florida. The objectives for these surveys were to 1) examine changes in population size and structure in representative upland and coastal dune habitats and 2) describe the response of gopher tortoises to land management practices (i.e., prescribed fire). Total burrow density within the upland population remained stable over the 3 surveys (0.68 burrows/ha in 2005, 0.66 burrows/ha in 2007, and 0.64 burrows/ha in 2011). Burrow densities in the burned areas of the upland habitat increased in areas that were burned at least once since the time of the first survey in 2005 but decreased in areas that were infrequently burned or remained unburned. Burrow density on the beach dunes, however, greatly increased between the most recent 2 surveys (3.63 burrows/ha in 2007 and 8.95 burrows/ha in 2011), possibly attributable to an increased use of a relatively confined habitat, or sampling biases by surveyors. Three different correction factor methods were used to determine gopher tortoise population estimates for each of the surveys, providing a range of estimates. The results of this study and the few others focused on coastal beach dunes suggest that this vulnerable, yet important, habitat should receive more attention because some of the highest gopher tortoise burrow densities have been observed there.";"Pawelek, Jaime C.

"AGRIS:US201600186749";"Pathogen exposure varies widely among sympatric populations of wild and domestic felids across the United States";"";"Understanding how landscape, host, and pathogen traits contribute to disease exposure requires systematic evaluations of pathogens within and among host species and geographic regions. The relative importance of these attributes is critical for management of wildlife and mitigating domestic animal and human disease, particularly given rapid ecological changes, such as urbanization. We screened >1000 samples from sympatric populations of puma (Puma concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and domestic cat (Felis catus) across urban gradients in six sites, representing three regions, in North America for exposure to a representative suite of bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens (Bartonella sp., Toxoplasma gondii, feline herpesvirusâ1, feline panleukopenea virus, feline calicivirus, and feline immunodeficiency virus). We evaluated prevalence within each species, and examined host trait and land cover determinants of exposure; providing an unprecedented analysis of factors relating to potential for infections in domesticated and wild felids. Prevalence differed among host species (highest for puma and lowest for domestic cat) and was greater for indirectly transmitted pathogens. Sex was inconsistently predictive of exposure to directly transmitted pathogens only, and age infrequently predictive of both direct and indirectly transmitted pathogens. Determinants of pathogen exposure were widely divergent between the wild felid species. For puma, suburban land use predicted increased exposure to Bartonella sp. in southern California, and FHVâ1 exposure increased near urban edges in Florida. This may suggest interspecific transmission with domestic cats via flea vectors (California) and direct contact (Florida) around urban boundaries. Bobcats captured near urban areas had increased exposure to T.Â gondii in Florida, suggesting an urban source of prey. Bobcats captured near urban areas in Colorado and Florida had higher FIV exposure, possibly suggesting increased intraspecific interactions through pileâup of home ranges. Beyond these regional and pathogen specific relationships, proximity to the wildlandâurban interface did not generally increase the probability of disease exposure in wild or domestic felids, emphasizing the importance of local ecological determinants. Indeed, pathogen exposure was often negatively associated with the wildlandâurban interface for all felids. Our analyses suggest crossâspecies pathogen transmission events around this interface may be infrequent, but followed by selfâsustaining propagation within the new host species.";"Carver, Scott

"AGRIS:US201500057335";"role of grasslands in food security and climate change";"";"BackgroundGrasslands are a major part of the global ecosystem, covering 37 % of the earth's terrestrial area. For a variety of reasons, mostly related to overgrazing and the resulting problems of soil erosion and weed encroachment, many of the world's natural grasslands are in poor condition and showing signs of degradation. This review examines their contribution to global food supply and to combating climate change.ScopeGrasslands make a significant contribution to food security through providing part of the feed requirements of ruminants used for meat and milk production. Globally, this is more important in food energy terms than pig meat and poultry meat. Grasslands are considered to have the potential to play a key role in greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in terms of global carbon storage and further carbon sequestration. It is estimated that grazing land management and pasture improvement (e.g. through managing grazing intensity, improved productivity, etc) have a global technical mitigation potential of almost 1·5 Gt CO2 equivalent in 2030, with additional mitigation possible from restoration of degraded lands. Milk and meat production from grassland systems in temperate regions has similar emissions of carbon dioxide per kilogram of product as mixed farming systems in temperate regions, and, if carbon sinks in grasslands are taken into account, grassland-based production systems can be as efficient as high-input systems from a greenhouse gas perspective.ConclusionsGrasslands are important for global food supply, contributing to ruminant milk and meat production. Extra food will need to come from the world's existing agricultural land base (including grasslands) as the total area of agricultural land has remained static since 1991. Ruminants are efficient converters of grass into humanly edible energy and protein and grassland-based food production can produce food with a comparable carbon footprint as mixed systems. Grasslands are a very important store of carbon, and they are continuing to sequester carbon with considerable potential to increase this further. Grassland adaptation to climate change will be variable, with possible increases or decreases in productivity and increases or decreases in soil carbon stores.";"O'Mara, F.

The runoff event simulated a 1 h, 1.27 cm rainfall event from a 16 ha agricultural field. Water (1 L) was collected every 30 min within the first 4 h, every 4 h until 48 h, and on days 5, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-amendment at distances of 0, 10, 40, 300 and 500 m from the amendment point for chlorophyll a, suspended sediment, nutrient, and pesticide analyses.

Greatest sediment, nutrient, and pesticide concentrations occurred within 3 h of amendment at 0 m, 10 m, 40 m, and 300 m downstream. Sediments and nutrients showed little variation at 500 m whereas pesticides peaked within 48 h but at <15% of upstream peak concentrations.

H. azteca survival significantly decreased within 48 h of amendment up to 300 m in association with permethrin concentrations. Chlorophyll a decreased within the first 24 h of amendment up to 40 m primarily in conjunction with herbicide concentrations. Variations in chlorophyll a at 300 and 500 m were associated with nutrients. Managed floodplain wetlands can rapidly and effectively trap and process agricultural runoff during moderate rainfall events, mitigating impacts to aquatic invertebrates and algae in receiving aquatic systems.";"Lizotte, Richard E.

By employing the cumulative energy demand (CED) method and the cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment (CEENE) method the following resources have been included in the assessment: fossil resources, nuclear resources, renewable resources, land resources, atmospheric resources, metal resources, mineral resources and water resources. The CED has been determined as 216MJ and the CEENE has been determined as 258MJₑₓ. In addition partial energy and exergy payback times have been calculated for the base case, which entails the installation of the high concentration photovoltaics (HCPVs) in the Southwestern USA, resulting in payback times of around 4 days for the germanium wafer production. Due to applying concentration technology the germanium wafer accounts for only 3% of the overall resource consumption of an HCPV system. A scenario analysis on the electricity input to the wafer production and on the country of installation of the HCPV has been performed, showing the importance of these factors on the cumulative resource consumption of the wafer production and the partial payback times.";"Swart, Pilar

To achieve this purpose, ground water levels were monitored at 62 different points. The maps of problematic areas for drainage were developed using the highest and lowest ground water levels to determine the problems caused by high ground water level. When the map of the highest ground water level was examined, it was revealed that the ground water level was in the range of 0-1.0 meter depth in the study area covering 1513 hectares (ha). This result indicates that it is compulsory to construct deep drainage system in such areas where high ground water problems persist during the whole year.

"AGRIS:US201400173141";"Evaluating on-farm irrigation efficiency across the watershed: A case study of New Mexico's Lower Rio Grande Basin";"";"Irrigation efficiency is a critical factor in irrigation water management. Irrigation efficiency is used in economic analysis when selecting an irrigation system design, and in irrigation management. It is also used in water rights adjudication and administration. On-farm irrigation efficiency is spatially and temporally variable and measuring irrigation efficiency is time consuming and costly. This paper describes a process to evaluate on-farm irrigation efficiency across the watershed using a combination of remote sensing and ground level measurements. On-farm irrigation efficiency was evaluated for three major crops in New Mexico's Lower Rio Grande Basin (LRG). The results of on-farm irrigation efficiency evaluation of 152 alfalfa fields, 189 pecan fields and 38 cotton fields showed that the average on-farm irrigation efficiency was 64%. However, on-farm irrigation efficiency values ranged from 11% to 95%. Accounting for delivery efficiency of 54%, the overall district efficiency was calculated as 35%. The study shows significant potential for improving irrigation efficiency in the LRG watershed; however, the inefficiency of the system is a major factor in recharging and sustaining the local aquifer. Significant improvement in on-farm and delivery efficiency can potentially change the hydrologic balance and result in depletion of the historically stable groundwater of the Mesilla Bolson.";"Ahadi, Rasool

However, each soil group determined by morphometric system in agricultural lands have its own land use and management practices. Description and determination of soil properties are not sufficiently made by considering old soil classification system. Nowadays, Soil Taxonomy preferred by many countries in the world has been used for soil classification. After determining and mapping soils based on series level according to this soil taxonomy, the relavent data can be used in land evaluation, land use planning, and land consolidation and valuation studies. In addition, the basic principle of sustainable agricultural production and natural resources is to utilize lands based on their current potentials. Therefore, the present soil sources should be determined firstly. To determine distribution of potential agricultural areas of Samsun province, land use capability and classification of soil erosion information which is derived from soil database prepared by the Rural Affairs General Directory and digital topographic maps scaled 1:25.000 to generate digital elevation model were used. According to results, 72.4% of total area has low potential agricultural areas whereas only small part of the total area (14.2%) has high potential agricultural areas in Samsun Province.

Bu çalısmanın amacı Samsun ili potansiyel tarım alanlarının genel dağılımlarının belirlenmesi ve toprak etüd ve haritalama çalısmalarının öneminin ortaya konulmasıdır. Son yıllarda ülkemizde AB entegrasyonu faaliyetleri ve toprak koruma kanunun çıkmasıyla (2005, 5403 sayılı) tarım alanlarında arazi toplulastırma ve arazi değer-takdir belirleme çalısmaları daha da önem kazanmıstır. Tarım arazilerinde morfometrik olarak belirlenen toprak gruplarının her birinin kendine özgü kullanım ve yönetim isteği bulunmaktadır. Toprak özelliklerinin eski toprak sınıflama sistemine göre belirlenmesi ve tanımlanması yetersiz kalmaktadır. Günümüzde toprak sınıflandırılmasında dünyada birçok ülkenin de tercih ettiği Toprak Taksonomisi kullanılmaktadır. Bu sisteme göre özellikle tarım arazilerinin seri düzeyinde belirlenen ve haritalanan topraklar, daha sonraki yapılacak olan arazi değerlendirme ve arazi kullanım planlama çalısması, arazi toplulastırması ve kıymet takdiri belirleme çalısmalarında kullanılabilecektir. Ayrıca, tarım arazilerin mevcut potansiyellerinde değerlendirilmesi tarımsal üretim ve doğal kaynaklarının sürdürülebilirliğinde temel esastır. Bu nedenle öncelikle mevcut toprak kaynaklarının tespiti yapılmalıdır.

"AGRIS:US201400156702";"Addressing global change challenges for Central Asian socio-ecosystems";"";"Central Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions on the planet earth to global climate change, depending on very fragile natural resources. The Soviet legacy has left the five countries (Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) with a highly integrated system but they are facing great challenges with tensions that hinder regional coordination of food and water resources. With increasing climate variability and warming trend in the region, food and water security issues become even more crucial now and, if not addressed properly, could affect the regional stability. The long-term drivers of these two most critical elements, food and water, are climate change; the immediate and probably more drastic factors affecting the food and water security are land uses driven by institutional change and economic incentives. As a feedback, changes in land use and land cover have directly implications on water uses, food production, and lifestyles of the rural community in the region. Regional and international efforts have been made to holistically understand the cause, extent, rate and societal implications of land use changes in the region. Much of these have been understood, or under investigation by various projects, but solutions or research effort to develop solutions, to these urgent regional issues are lacking. This article, serves as an introduction to the special issue, provides a brief overview of the challenges facing the Central Asian countries and various international efforts in place that resulted in the publications of this special issue.";"Qi, Jiaguo

"AGRIS:US2016219848";"Ecosystem Services on New Zealand Arable Farms";"";"Researchers have estimated the total economic value of global ecosystem goods and services showing that a significant portion of humanity's economic well being is unaccounted for in conventional GNP accounting (Constanza et al., 1997). To demonstrate this point, authors have conventionally used highly aggregated landscape units for analysis (e.g., biomes), and average, not marginal values, of each ecosystem good or service are estimated for each unit using value transfer methodologies (Wilson et al., 2004). For example, Patterson and Cole (1999a, b) replicated the Constanza et al., (1997) approach by estimating economic values for Waikato and New Zealand ecosystem goods and services associated with standard land cover classes including horticulture, agriculture and cropping. As a result, Patterson and Cole (1999b) argue that only five ecosystem services associated with cropping have non-zero value. One of the reasons for this low number of non-zero values assorted with arable lands is that the original economic studies used by Patterson and Cole, are heavily weighted towards natural and undisturbed ecosystems rather than disturbed systems like agricultural or urban landscapes. To address this issue, more recently researchers have noted that many landscapes are actively modified by humans who seek to realise economic gain and this topic is thus an important one because in the 21st century, many of our homes, workplaces and recreational spaces are embedded within, or adjacent to, landscape mosaics that are to a greater or lesser degree affected by the conscious efforts of people to harness goods and services provided by ecological systems (Palmer et al., 2004). An engineered or designed ecosystem is one that has been extensively modified by humans to explicitly provide a set of ecosystem goods and services including more fresh water, trees, and food products and fewer floods and pollutants. These modified landscapes provide a range of ecosystem goods and services, particularly food production as farmers seek to maximize commercial gain from land use. The current paper examines issues in valuation of ecosystem goods and services derived from land used for arable farming in New Zealand and proposes ways to provide more detailed estimates of the flow and value of the flow of ecosystem services provided.";"Cullen, Ross

In this study, Eurasia was selected as the study area. The relationship between FPAR and simple infrared/red ratio relationship (SR FPAR), and that between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FPAR and a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) look-up table (LUT FPAR) were employed to estimate FPAR from 1982 to 2006 by different land cover types, focusing on the comparisons of spatiotemporal FPAR patterns between the two FPAR datasets. The results showed high agreement between MODIS standard FPAR and estimated FPAR in seasonal dynamics with peak values in July. The LUT FPAR was close to MODIS standard FPAR and larger than SR FPAR. The SR and LUT FPAR showed the same spatial distribution and inter-annual variation patterns and were primarily determined by land cover types. An overall increasing trend in FPAR was observed from 1982 to 2006, with reductions from 1991 to 1994 and 2000 to 2002. The inter-annual dynamics in evergreen broadleaf forests showed a decreasing trend over 25 years, while non-forest vegetation FPAR values had slow, stable growth in inter-annual variation.";"Peng, Dailiang

In this article, we describe the methods to create global products of forest cover and cover change at Landsat resolutions. Nevertheless, there are many challenges in ensuring the creation of high-quality products. And we propose various ways in which the challenges can be overcome. Among the challenges are the need for atmospheric correction, incorrect calibration coefficients in some of the data-sets, the different phenologies between compilations, the need for terrain correction, the lack of consistent reference data for training and accuracy assessment, and the need for highly automated characterization and change detection. We propose and evaluate the creation and use of surface reflectance products, improved selection of scenes to reduce phenological differences, terrain illumination correction, automated training selection, and the use of information extraction procedures robust to errors in training data along with several other issues. At several stages we use Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer data and products to assist our analysis. A global working prototype product of forest cover and forest cover change is included.";"Townshend, John R.

However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km ², nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr ⁻¹), equal to ∼5% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.";"Seto, Karen C.

Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies.

"AGRIS:US2016200878";"Managing Conflict Over Natural Resources in Greater Kordofan, Sudan: Some Recurrent Patterns and Governance Implications";"";"Despite the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which brought to an end 20 years of civil warin the Sudan, this country continues to experience smaller-scale conflicts, particularly aroundaccess to and control of natural resources. Some observers lay the blame for this onethnopolitical or tribal divisions. However, this paper argues that there are a variety of factors atplay behind these conflicts, notably the combination of resource scarcity with a crisis ofgovernance that is particularly evident in transitional areas like the Kordofan region.To gain a sense of the range of conflicts around natural resources in Kordofan, theauthors reviewed existing records such as government archives; conducted interviews withpoliticians, federal and state government officials, farmers, pastoralists, and NativeAdministration leaders; and investigated findings in the field. Interviews also served to examinepeople’s knowledge about government natural resource policies and their perceptions of the rolesplayed by government and the Native Administration in conflict management and resolution.The paper presents 20 cases of stalemate competition or open conflict over naturalresources in Kordofan. The cases center on (1) conflicts between farmers and herders over stockroutes, gum arabic forests, gardens, watering points, and the use of dars (tribal homelands); (2)conflicts between herders and small farmers and government agents or large private investorsover mechanized farming areas, oil infrastructure, and other private investments.In their analysis of natural resource governance in Sudan, the authors find that naturalresources policies have often been weak foundations for sustainable resource use, and in somecases they have actually contributed to conflict. In addition, the volatile path of governmentdevolution efforts concerning natural resources has undermined governance of these resources.While conflicts between farmers and herders were managed relatively successful in thepast through customary land tenure systems, this is less and less the case today as a result oflarger herds, reduced water and pasture, instability and prejudices stirred up by the war, and aproliferation of arms among herders. In addition, patron–client politics, weak natural resourcemanagement and development policies, and top-down government institutions have encouragedethnic polarization and social divisions. The authors find that measures are needed to reform theprocess of natural resource management, making land use planning more comprehensive,building on local livelihood systems, and increasing public spending on infrastructure. Inaddition, sustainable property rights on farmland and on mobile resources should be redefined,and informal conflict management mechanisms restored to the extent that this is possible.";"Siddig, El Fatih Ali

The land-use and land-cover statistics, obtained from GIS data base and satellite images from 1952, 1977, 1989 and 2000 revealed rapid increased in urbanization during these periods. To understand the underlying causes of land-use and land-cover dynamics, remote sensing, GIS and modeling techniques were applied. The SLEUTH model contains a characteristic that offers advantages in integrating with raster-based remote sensing data and in increasing the capability of GIS in modeling the spatial dynamics. The objectives of this research are (1) to systematically analyze remotely-sensed images of Chiang Mai area from available time series into major land-use-land -cover types and to identify the significant land-use/land-cover changes, (2) to apply a GIS for capturing the information on the temporal transportation layers, zones excluded from urbanization, and topographic layers such as slope and terrain hillshading in Chiang Mai, and (3) to test if the SLEUTH cellular automata model can be applied for simulating urban growth and land-use change in Chiang Mai. The study reveals that: (1) land-use/land-cover types in Chiang Mai can be classified based on the satellite images into Urban land, Agriculture, Forest, Water, and Miscellaneous, and the urban area increased from 13 square km in 2000, with the tendency to increase over time, (2) the temporal transportation layers and slope developed by GIS served as the important variables for modeling urban growth by SLEUTH model, and (3) the urban development in Chiang Mai was best captured by Xmean and edge growth regression scores.

"AGRIS:US201400189431";"Valuing the benefits of an afforestation project in a peri-urban area with choice experiments";"";"Woodlands on the Veneto region plain have progressively disappeared since the 19th century. This has led to a decrease in environmental and landscape quality with fewer social benefits accruing from the rural land. The demand for environmental conservation and recreational areas has increased in recent years, especially in the urban context. In order to meet these needs the Venice City Council decided to establish an extensive woodland on the Venice hinterland. Due to the high costs of the project it was important to evaluate its benefits in monetary terms and whether a mixed landscape might produce a higher benefits flow than a dense woodland. The objectives of our study are to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) for different surface allocations of the future Wood of Mestre and to better understand the influence on WTP of the delay in the benefits due to the time needed for tree growth. Our first finding was that people prefer a mixed solution in terms of surface allocation: the wood–meadow mix (75% woodland, 25% meadow) is at the top of the sample preferences. Second, the WTP of the preferred afforestation programme is €51year/family. The social benefits derived on a 10-year basis considering the presence of animals and lakes in the preferred scenario are €62,755/ha. The research highlighted how WTP has an inverse correlation with age. Nonetheless the WTP of older people is not negligible and this appears to support the hypothesis that the woodland will also have a bequest value. The WTP also tends to decline with the distance of the district where the interviewees live. Finally, CE proves to be a consistent and robust methodology for forest benefit evaluation that can provide both land management and quantitative information to policymakers.";"Vecchiato, D.

"AGRIS:US2016200875";"Linking Farmers to Markets through Modern Information and Communication Technologies in Kenya";"";"This paper highlights a market information and linkage system (MILS) developed and tested by the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange Limited (KACE) that increases the efficiency of agricultural markets to work better for smallholder farmers and other small and medium sized agro-enterprises (SMEs). The MILS involves harnessing modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) to empower farmers with low-cost reliable and timely market information to enhance the bargaining power of the farmer for a better price in the market place, and to link the farmer to markets more efficiently and profitably. The components of the KACE MILS are (www.kacekenya.com): Rural based Market Information Points (MIPs) which are information kiosks located in rural markets, District-level Market Information Centres (MICs), Mobile Phone Short Messaging Service (SMS), Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Internet based database system, rural FM radio and the Central Coordinating Hub in Nairobi. KACE has adopted a business approach to the provision of its services: users pay for the services. For instance it charges: placement fees per initial offer or bid (US$ 1.5-15), commissions on concluded deals (0.5%-5%), subscriptions to price information recipients (US$ 65 for 6 months or US$ 125 for 12 months), fees to visiting foreign groups (US$ 2,000-5,000/visit) and revenue sharing agreements with SMS and IVR service providers. When the KACE MILS services are scaled out and widely used by many farmers and SMEs across Kenya, the system will generate sufficient revenue to sustain its services without reliance on development partner funding. To enhance the financial sustainability of the MILS services further, KACE has recently initiated two innovations: franchising MIPs and MICs to local entrepreneurs, and establishing a virtual trading floor to improve the matching of offers and bids through a rural-based FM Radio program. A recent study of the impact of the KACE MILS concluded that the proportion of farmers and traders that say their incomes has increased and their bargaining positions have improved is very high (75% farmers and 60% commodity traders). Furthermore, the study concluded that it was clear that during the years in which the KACE MILS has been operational, market integration improved for two commodities studied (i.e. maize and beans). This study also highlights the challenges faced by the KACE MILS, including poor infrastructure that imposes high transport costs to markets, high costs of mobile phone calls and SMS and small quantities of produce of varying quality offered.

In 2004, the U.S. Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act mandated the creation of a new annual pass to cover all federal recreation sites that charge an entrance or access fee.  Our task was to assist federal policymakers in determining an appropriate price for this new pass.  Toward that end, we administered a contingent valuation phone survey to over 3700 households to estimate households willingness to pay (WTP) for the new pass at a variety of different prices.  Our innovative experimental design allows us to estimate the degree of hypothetical bias in the sample and calibrate our WTP estimates to reflect actual purchasing decisions.  In a sample of the general U.S. population  most of whom have little experience with similar federal passes  respondents tend to greatly exaggerate their WTP for the pass when contrasted with previous pass sales.  A sample of recent pass purchasers, however, exhibits little bias.  This confirms recent research showing that market experience can be an effective means to mitigate hypothetical bias.";"Aadland, David

While rapid strides have been made, progress across the suite of disciplines required to understand NOx emission, transport, chemistry, and deposition has been uneven and has resulted in gaps in knowledge and, indeed, somewhat conflicting ideas about the regional and global importance of NOx from soils. This paper summarizes some of the findings of the papers presented at the 1996 Tsukuba NOx workshop and suggests gaps in knowledge that may limit estimation and management of NOx emissions from soils. I discuss the causes and consequences of uncertainties in global estimates of soil NOx emissions and argue for use of process simulation models for NOx estimates. I also suggest three other missing pieces that limit our understanding of and ability to predict or manage NOx fluxes: 1) information on canopy uptake of NOx emitted from soils; 2) information on NOx response to agricultural management practices and approaches for simulating those high resolution effects; and 3) information on the consequences of atmospheric transport and deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen on NOx emissions from soils.";"Matson, P.";"";"";"AGRIS";"1997-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"001";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201302876390";"http://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-1314";"";"";"";"1-6"

The objective was to determine different land suitability classes for saffron cultivation using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information System (GIS). A decision tree was developed encompassing the physical, economic and social criteria. We used the secondary data (meteorological, remote sensing) from available sources and also substantial primary data generated from soil survey, interviews and expertsâ opinion. A total of 30 physical and socio-economic factors were included in the analysis. The final land suitability result showed that out of the total land area of Khost Province, 1.5, 4.5, 8.6 and 85.4% areas were highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable and not suitable, respectively. This modelling approach can be applied to determine the suitability of land for other crops covering a wider geographical region of Afghanistan.";"Wali, Emal

We used landscape metrics to analyze a chronosequence of aerial imagery to examine these “stringers” of mature trees within historical wildfires in northern Lower Michigan. Our major objective was to describe the natural range of variability of stringer patterns and their persistence and change during the fire-free interval. Field studies were then used to examine stringer composition and structural variability. Stringers were found to occur in all fires >1000ha, in about one-third of wildfires >80ha, but never in fires <80ha, likely because of the lack of fire intensity on smaller fires that is necessary for stringers to be formed. Stringers were typically composed of many small, well-aggregated patches that represented 3–14% of the area within the burn perimeter, and stringer formation was relatively independent of pre-fire forest structure or composition. Stringer patterns changed mostly in the first decade after the fire that created them and then stabilized. Major changes that occurred in stringer patterns after this period were most often due to human activities, highlighting their natural persistence through the fire-free interval. The historical persistence and importance of these features also highlights their importance on modern fire-prone landscapes, particularly in northern Lower Michigan where a high proportion of land management is focused on jack pine plantations for breeding habitat for Kirtland’s warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii Baird), an endangered species.";"Kashian, Daniel M.

"AGRIS:US201400185040";"Rental markets for cultivated land and agricultural investments in China";"";"The purpose of this paper is to empirically track the progress and consequences of the emergence of cultivated land markets in China since 2000. We draw on a set of nationwide, household‐level panel data (for 2000 and 2008) and find that the markets for cultivated land rental have emerged robustly. According to our data, 19 of China's cultivated land was rented in farm operators in 2008. We also find that the nature of China's cultivated land rental contracts has become more formal and lengthened the period of time that the tenant is able to cultivate the rented‐in plots. While there may be benefits for lessors and tenants, our data show that there are falling rates of investment in organic manure. The farmers in our sample have reduced organic manure use from 13 tons/ha in 2000 to 5 tons/ha in 2008. Part of this fall is due to the rise of cultivated land rental markets. The analysis, however, does not find that improved property rights in cultivated land rental affect investment largely because property rights have largely been established by 2000, the first year of our sample. Our results, however, also show that there are forces that appear to be mitigating the negative consequences of rising cultivated land rental. After holding constant initial rental rates and other factors, we find that the gap between investment in organic manure in own land and rented‐in land is narrowing. One interpretation of our findings is that if policymakers can find ways to even further strengthen the rights of lessors and tenants as well as lengthen contract periods, farmers—even those that rent—will invest more in their land, because they will be able to capture the returns to their investments.";"Gao, Liangliang

"AGRIS:US201400057426";"Quantifying Outdoor Water Consumption of Urban Land Use/Land Cover: Sensitivity to Drought";"";"Outdoor water use is a key component in arid city water systems for achieving sustainable water use and ensuring water security. Using evapotranspiration (ET) calculations as a proxy for outdoor water consumption, the objectives of this research are to quantify outdoor water consumption of different land use and land cover types, and compare the spatio-temporal variation in water consumption between drought and wet years. An energy balance model was applied to Landsat 5 TM time series images to estimate daily and seasonal ET for the Central Arizona Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research region (CAP-LTER). Modeled ET estimations were correlated with water use data in 49 parks within CAP-LTER and showed good agreement (r ²� =� 0.77), indicating model effectiveness to capture the variations across park water consumption. Seasonally, active agriculture shows high ET (>500� mm) for both wet and dry conditions, while the desert and urban land cover types experienced lower ET during drought (<300� mm). Within urban locales of CAP-LTER, xeric neighborhoods show significant differences from year to year, while mesic neighborhoods retain their ET values (400–500� mm) during drought, implying considerable use of irrigation to sustain their greenness. Considering the potentially limiting water availability of this region in the future due to large population increases and the threat of a warming and drying climate, maintaining large water-consuming, irrigated landscapes challenges sustainable practices of water conservation and the need to provide amenities of this desert area for enhancing quality of life.";"Kaplan, Shai

"AGRIS:US201400057424";"Assessing Restoration Potential of Semi-natural Grasslands by Landscape Change Trajectories";"";"Species-rich semi-natural grasslands have rapidly declined and become fragmented in Northern Europe due to ceased traditional agricultural practices and animal husbandry. Restoration actions have been introduced in many places to improve the habitat conditions and increase the area to prevent any further losses of their ecological values. However, given the limited resources and long time span needed for successful restoration, it is essential to target activities on sites having a suitable initial state and where the effects of restoration are most beneficial for the habitat network. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for evaluating the restoration potential of partially overgrown and selectively managed semi-natural grasslands in a moderately transformed agricultural environment in south-western Finland. On the basis of the spatio-temporal landscape trajectory analysis, we construct potential restoration scenarios based on expected semi-natural grassland characteristics that are derived from land productivity, detected grassland continuum, and date of overgrowth. These scenarios are evaluated using landscape metrics, their feasibility is discussed and the effects of potential restoration are compared to the present extent of open semi-natural grasslands. Our results show that landscape trajectory analysis and scenario construction can be valuable tools for the restoration planning of semi-natural grasslands with limited resources. The approach should therefore be considered as an essential tool to find the most optimal restoration sites and to pre-evaluate the effects.";"Pitkänen, Timo P.

"AGRIS:US201300888810";"Factors affecting the reproductive success of dominant male meerkats";"";"Identifying traits that affect the reproductive success of individuals is fundamental for our understanding of evolutionary processes. In cooperative breeders, a dominant male typically restricts mating access to the dominant female for extended periods, resulting in pronounced variation in reproductive success among males. This may result in strong selection for traits that increase the likelihood of dominance acquisition, dominance retention and reproductive rates while dominant. However, despite considerable research on reproductive skew, few studies have explored the factors that influence these three processes among males in cooperative species. Here we use genetic, behavioural and demographic data to investigate the factors affecting reproductive success in dominant male meerkats (Suricata suricatta). Our data show that dominant males sire the majority of all offspring surviving to 1 year. A male's likelihood of becoming dominant is strongly influenced by age, but not by weight. Tenure length and reproductive rate, both important components of dominant male reproductive success, are largely affected by group size and composition, rather than individual traits. Dominant males in large groups have longer tenures, but after this effect is controlled, male tenure length also correlates negatively to the number of adult females in the group. Male reproductive rate also declines as the number of intra- and extra-group competitors increases. As the time spent in the dominant position and reproductive rate while dominant explain > 80% of the total variance in reproductive success, group composition thus has major implications for male reproductive success.";"SPONG, GÖRAN F.

Samples were analysed for 31 inorganic elements including heavy metals. Analysis of results indicates that the concentrations of lead, copper, zinc and mercury are strongly influenced by human activities, with elevated concentrations in the city docklands, inner city and heavy industry areas. Sources of heavy metals in these areas may include historical industry, coal burning, re-use of contaminated soil, modern traffic and leaded paint and petrol. Concentrations of other inorganic elements in topsoil show patterns which are strongly related to regional bedrock parent material. The spatial distributions of heavy metals, in particular Pb and As, are explored in detail with respect to regional geology and the influence of historical industry on soil quality. Exploratory data, geostatistical and correlation analyses suggest that the concentrations of heavy metals tend to increase as the intensity of historical industrial activity increases. In particular, drinks production, power generation, oil/gas/coal, metals and textile historical industries appear to be the contamination source for several heavy metals. The data provide a geochemical baseline relevant to the protection of human health, compliance with environmental legislation, land use planning and urban regeneration.";"Glennon, M. M.

Characterizing soil erosion in this region is the key to understanding the escalating KRD problem and finding solution to it. The authors applied leveling method to study soil erosion process in the Huajiang Karst Canyon area between 1999 and 2003, and tried to relate it to KRD expansion. The monitoring data indicate that soil in the study area was losing at an alarming rate, which is much higher than soil formation rate and has already resulted in severe KRD problem. Soil loss under different land-use conditions varied greatly during the monitoring period. The highest soil erosion rate occurred in bare and newly abandoned cropland, followed by sparse grass land, forest land, and dense grass land. In addition, soil erosion could be significantly different under different micro-topographic conditions. Because soil erosion rate in the studied karst mountain areas is surprisingly high, it is urgent to take quick actions to fight against the ongoing KRD problems in Southwest China before an irreversible situation occurs. However, the traditional way to combat KRD by abandoning current cropland needs to be carefully reconsidered, since a bare newly abandoned cropland may suffer more from rapid soil loss than before.";"Peng, Jian

This study investigated fuelwood availability in accessed forests, amount of fuelwood collected, preferred tree species for fuelwood, contribution of public and private sources to total fuelwood consumption, and investment in tree planting on agricultural land. Fuelwood availability declined in the decades prior to 1990, but stabilized by 1990. Fuelwood from fifty-three species was collected from forests. Median annual per capita collection was 683 kg and predicted only by family size. Occupational castes (‘low castes’) did not show different harvesting rates than non-occupational castes and non-caste ethnic groups. Wealth was not associated with total fuelwood collection, probably because there was no fuelwood market. Most households collected fuelwood from a private source, namely trees planted on sloping, rain-fed agricultural land (bari), but this accounted for only a small portion of most households’ requirement. Bari landholding area and livestock holdings–typical measures of wealth–drove the decision to plant trees on bari land, and the number of trees that were planted. Bari-poor and landless households were consequently the most vulnerable to forest degradation, so the promotion of private fuelwood planting by large bari landholders could reduce pressure on forests and promote greater fuelwood availability for landless households.

With multidate Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) hyperspectral data sets, two types of hyperspectral CASI input data and two classifiers have been examined and compared for mapping and monitoring the salt cedar change. The two types of input data are all two-date original CASI bands and 12 principal component images (PCs) derived from the two-date CASI images. The two classifiers are an artificial neural network (ANN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results indicate that (1) the direct multitemporal image classification method applied in land cover change detection is feasible either with original CASI bands or PCs, but a better accuracy was obtained from the CASI PCA transformed data; (2) with the same inputs of 12 PCs, the ANN outperforms the LDA due to the ANN's non-linear property and ability of handling data without a prerequisite of a certain distribution of the analysis data.";"Pu, Ruiliang

These soil maps are widely used in land resources assessment studies in Turkey. They were digitized and then the map layers were compared by using GIS technology in order to assess soil properties and land characteristics. The reconnaissance soil map at the scale of 1:200 000 has the highest accuracy for the slope. The accuracy of other properties in descending order was as follows: slope more than depth more than salinity more than texture more than drainage more than top soil texture. In addition, physiographic and topographic patterns of soils also affected the accuracy. The reconnaissance soil map was found to be less accurate in flood plains where the slope does not affect other soil properties.";"Basayigit, L.,Suleyman Demirel Univ., Isparta (Turkey).

"AGRIS:US201400186586";"Committed carbon emissions, deforestation, and community land conversion from oil palm plantation expansion in West Kalimantan, Indonesia";"";"Industrial agricultural plantations are a rapidly increasing yet largely unmeasured source of tropical land cover change. Here, we evaluate impacts of oil palm plantation development on land cover, carbon flux, and agrarian community lands in West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. With a spatially explicit land change/carbon bookkeeping model, parameterized using high-resolution satellite time series and informed by socioeconomic surveys, we assess previous and project future plantation expansion under five scenarios. Although fire was the primary proximate cause of 1989–2008 deforestation (93%) and net carbon emissions (69%), by 2007–2008, oil palm directly caused 27% of total and 40% of peatland deforestation. Plantation land sources exhibited distinctive temporal dynamics, comprising 81% forests on mineral soils (1994–2001), shifting to 69% peatlands (2008–2011). Plantation leases reveal vast development potential. In 2008, leases spanned ∼65% of the region, including 62% on peatlands and 59% of community-managed lands, yet <10% of lease area was planted. Projecting business as usual (BAU), by 2020 ∼40% of regional and 35% of community lands are cleared for oil palm, generating 26% of net carbon emissions. Intact forest cover declines to 4%, and the proportion of emissions sourced from peatlands increases 38%. Prohibiting intact and logged forest and peatland conversion to oil palm reduces emissions only 4% below BAU, because of continued uncontrolled fire. Protecting logged forests achieves greater carbon emissions reductions (21%) than protecting intact forests alone (9%) and is critical for mitigating carbon emissions. Extensive allocated leases constrain land management options, requiring trade-offs among oil palm production, carbon emissions mitigation, and maintaining community landholdings.";"Carlson, Kimberly M.

"AGRIS:US201301851439";"resource ratio model of the effects of changes in CO₂ on woody plant invasion";"";"It is expected that elevated CO₂ levels may have an important positive effect on the dominance of woody plants over grasses in savannas and grasslands. I propose that these changes in the relative abundance of trees and shrubs over grasses may be explained by Tilman's resource ratio models. This change will occur because C₃ trees will have higher net photosynthetic rates than C₄ grasses which predominate in savannas. This will cause trees to have higher growth rates than grasses. An additional factor in trees and shrubs with carbon-based defences (such as tannins or other polyphenols) is that they may be better defended and, thus, lose less material to herbivory. Consequently, trees and shrubs should invade savannas and grasslands because their R* values will be lower. I compare this model to another less parsimonious model based on fire and carbon storage and allocation. Although these models are not necessarily mutually exclusive, the resource ratio model may be differentiated from the fire-carbon model on the basis of the presence of fire and/or the sensitivity to elevations in global CO₂ levels.";"Ward, David";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301851439";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-010-9731-z";"";"";"";"147-152"

This approach calls for management based on stakeholder collaboration; interagency cooperation; integration of scientific, social, and economic information; preservation of ecological processes; and adaptive management. Results of previous studies indicate differences in the extent to which particular components of ecosystem management would be implemented within the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management and suggest a number of barriers thought to impede implementation. Drawing on survey and interview data from agency personnel and stakeholders, we compared levels of ecosystem-management implementation in the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management and identified the most important barriers to implementation. Agency personnel perceived similarly high levels of implementation on many ecosystem-management components, whereas stakeholders perceived lower levels. Agencies were most challenged by implementation of preservation of ecological processes, adaptive management, and integration of social and economic information, whereas the most significant barriers to implementation were political, cultural, and legal.";"KOONTZ, TOMAS M.

"AGRIS:US201500210863";"Assessing the Utility of Satellite Imagery with Differing Spatial Resolutions for Deriving Proxy Measures of Slum Presence in Accra, Ghana";"";"Little research has been conducted on how differing spatial resolutions or classification techniques affect image-driven identification and categorization of slum neighborhoods in developing nations. This study assesses the correlation between satellite-derived land cover and census-derived socioeconomic variables in Accra, Ghana to determine whether the relationship between these variables is altered with a change in spatial resolution or scale. ASTER and Landsat TM satellite images are each used to classify land cover using spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and land cover proportions are summarized across Enumeration Areas in Accra and compared to socioeconomic data for the same areas. Correlation and regression analyses compare the SMA results with a Slum Index created from various socioeconomic data taken from the Census of Ghana, as well as to data derived from a ""hard"" per-pixel classification of a 2.4 m Quickbird image. Results show that the vegetation fraction is significantly correlated with the Slum Index (Pearson's r ranges from -0.33 to -0.51, depending on which image-derived product is compared), and the use of a spatial error model improves results (multivariate model pseudo- R ² ranges from 0.37 to 0.40 by image product). We also find that SMA products derived from ASTER are a sufficient substitute for classification products derived from higher spatial resolution QB data when using land cover fractions as a proxy for slum presence, suggesting that SMA might be more cost-effective for deriving land cover fractions than the use of high-resolution imagery for this type of demographic analysis.";"Stoler, Justin

"AGRIS:US201400147562";"Farm typologies, soil fertility variability and nutrient management in smallholder farming in Sub-Saharan Africa";"";"Farm typologies are a useful tool to assist in unpacking and understanding the wide diversity among smallholder farms to improve targeting of crop production intensification strategies. Sustainable crop production intensification will require the development of an array of nutrient management strategies tailored to farm-specific conditions, rather than blanket recommendations across diverse farms. This study reviewed key literature on smallholder farm typologies focusing on three countries (Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe), to gain insights on opportunities for crop production intensification, and the importance of developing farm-specific nutrient management practices. Investigations on farm typologies have done well in highlighting the fundamental differences between farm categories, with 3–5 typologies often adequate to represent the wide differences in resource endowment. Resource-endowed farmers have ready access to large quantities of manure and mineral fertilizers, which contribute to higher soil fertility and crop productivity on their farms. Resource-constrained households use little or no manure and mineral fertilizers, and have limited capacity to invest in labour-demanding soil fertility management technologies. These farmers often have to rely on off-farm opportunities for income that are largely limited to selling unskilled labour to their resource-endowed neighbors. The variability in management practices by farmers has resulted in three main soil fertility classes that can be used for targeting soil fertility management technologies, characterized by potential response to fertilizer application as: (1) low-responsive fertile fields that receive large additions of manure and fertilizer; (2) high-responsive infertile fields that receive moderate nutrient applications; (3) poorly responsive degraded soils cultivated for many years with little or no nutrient additions. The main conclusions drawn from the review are: (1) resource constrained farmers constitute the widest band across the three countries, with many of the farmers far below the threshold for sustainable maize production intensification and lacking capacity to invest in improved seed and fertilizer, (2) farm sizes and livestock ownership were key determinants for both farmer wealth status and farm productivity, and (3) soil organic carbon and available P were good indicators for predicting previous land management, that is also invariably linked to farmer resource endowment.";"Chikowo, Regis

"AGRIS:US201500199401";"Soil water repellency in rangelands of Extremadura (Spain) and its relationship with land management";"";"Soil water repellency reduces infiltration capacity, enhancing overland flow and even runoff production, and may produce patchiness in water infiltration at the hillslope scale. Knowledge about hydrophobicity in rangelands of Mediterranean type climate and its relation with vegetation cover and land management is sparse. The objectives of the present work are to determine the degree and spatial occurrence of soil water repellency and to define its relationship with site characteristics, such as soil, vegetation and land management in rangelands of SW Spain. Field work was conducted in September 2009 in 22 environmental units belonging to 10 farms, distributed throughout the region of Extremadura. The Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) method was used for measuring water repellency of the soil surface. A total of 725 points were sampled and the study was combined with a detailed vegetation survey, the determination of soil properties and of land use and management characteristics. More than 70% of the measurement points were hydrophilic, however differences between farm units were found. The highest values of hydrophobicity were observed on soil surfaces below the canopy of holm oaks, as compared to the low values found below shrub canopies (Retama sphaerocarpa) and in open areas. With respect to ground cover, water repellency was highest at sites covered by holm oak litter. At soil surfaces covered by cork oak litter, dry grass and mosses the degree of repellency was lower. Almost all sites with a bare soil surface were hydrophilic, independent of whether these were located below a tree canopy or in open areas. A significant positive relationship between livestock density and the degree of bare soil existed, and consequently, areas with high animal numbers were dominantly hydrophilic. No significant relationships were encountered between the degree of soil water repellency and soil properties.";"Schnabel, S.

Recent developments in remote sensing technology have greatly enriched the availability of geospatial data that can be used in hydrological modeling to assess the potential hydrological response of conservation practices over larger areas. A methodology was developed using the object-based image analysis approach with Landsat-5 TM imagery of the year 2005 and thematic layers of streams to quantify conservation buffers and grasslands (OBIA-2005). The OBIA-2005 land cover data was used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model to assess the impacts of vegetative conservation practices on total phosphorus (TP) loads. The model was calibrated and validated for discharge and TP loads in the Cedar Creek Watershed (CCW) in northeast Indiana. In general model efficiency for streamflow values was within acceptable statistical ranges. While calibration of TP loads was satisfactory for the total contributing area of two nested catchments within the upper CCW. Vegetative buffers of 30.5m and 61m combined with conservation grasslands generated from the OBIA-2005 resulted in a large reduction of TP loads as compared to no practices. The results also showed that including conservation grassland alone reduced TP loads by less than 2%. However, the combination of these practices with the width of edge-of-field buffer strips module of the SWAT model achieved the largest TP loads reduction. These findings demonstrate that improved representation of vegetative conservation practices in geospatial land cover data sets are more effective in assessing the impacts of conservation buffers and grasslands on water quality through hydrologic modeling.";"Larose, Myriam

The study took place in Jotunheimen, Norway. We evaluated occurrence, density and sexual reproduction variables (number of fertile individuals and number of seed capsules). Habitats were registered as land-cover categories (historical and current; broad habitat types) and habitat patch classes (semi-natural and natural; fine-grained habitat types). Spatial overlay analyses and maximum likelihood tests of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were performed to assess the habitat quality of the land-cover categories and the habitat patch classes. In most (96%) of the observed occurrences the species was located at a site that had open vegetation 40 years ago but is now becoming forested or covered by shrubs. The highest densities of P. scandinavica were found in “heathland” and “grassland in transition into woodland”, while the potential for sexual reproduction was highest in “grassland” and lowest in “grassland in transition into woodland”. The results indicate that many of the populations in the study area are remnants and that the habitats of highest quality are semi-natural habitat patches. The changed land use practices in mountain areas have resulted and will result in fewer and smaller populations. However, as also climatic conditions will change it is not straightforward to predict the future performance of P. scandinavica.";"Wehn, Sølvi

Although habitat contiguity is thought to be conducive to the persistence of many sensitive species, availability of funding and suitable land may restrict the extent to which this spatial attribute can be pursued in land management or conservation. Using optimization modeling, we explore the economic and spatial tradeoffs of retaining or restoring grassland habitat in contiguous patches of various sizes near the Chicago metropolitan area. The underlying mathematical construct is the first exact, generalized formulation that directly models spatial contiguity in optimal reserve selection. The construct allows conservation planners to analyze and weigh different minimum contiguous habitat size requirements that are to be used in specific land acquisition or retention projects.";"Tóth, Sándor F.
