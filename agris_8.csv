We empirically investigate resource taxation issues by focusing on aggregate extraction policy in two large northern Italian regions, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. The evidence shows that environmental planning, in addition to economic instruments, is needed to shape and monitor environmental policies. We highlight that the complementarity of land use planning and economic instruments can be a key driver of sustainability performances. The unintended effects of economic instruments are also crucial.";"Mazzanti, Massimiliano

By adopting a “carbocentric approach,” we show that mangrove forests are strong candidates for PES projects. They are particularly well suited to the generation of carbon credits because of their unrivaled potential as carbon sinks, their resistance and resilience to natural hazards, and their extensive provision of Ecosystem Services other than carbon sequestration, primarily nursery areas for fish, water purification and coastal protection, to the benefit of local communities as well as to the global population. The voluntary carbon market provides opportunities for the development of appropriate protocols and good practice case studies for mangroves at a small scale, and these may influence larger compliance schemes in the future. Mangrove habitats are mostly located in developing countries on communally or state-owned land. This means that issues of national and local governance, land ownership and management, and environmental justice are the main challenges that require careful planning at the early stages of mangrove PES projects to ensure successful outcomes and equitable benefit sharing within local communities.";"Locatelli, Tommaso

"AGRIS:US201500058259";"impact of significant earthquakes on Christchurch, New Zealand's urban forest";"";"The resilience of Christchurch, New Zealand's urban forest has been tested during a year of major earthquakes and aftershocks. Tree loss has resulted from mass soil movement, soil liquefaction, rockfalls, and land slips. At the time of writing, only 384 trees have been documented as removed, however, thousands more are scheduled for removal. Additionally, the changes to the soil environment resulting from liquefaction will require existing trees to adapt quickly to their new soil environment. Their fate will not be known for years. Though the total number of trees removed is unlikely to reduce city-wide canopy cover appreciably, it is important to recognize that spatial patterns of tree loss were highly localized and thus local canopy cover has been drastically reduced in some areas. Short-term management of the urban forest in the aftermath of the earthquake focused on removal of trees deemed unstable or unsafe. In the medium-term, attempts have been made to monitor the health and stability of remaining trees using an asset management system, though some difficulties related to consistency and ubiquity of its use have been identified. Though short and medium-term management have been largely effective, long-term management of Christchurch's urban forests will largely be dictated by government policy, which will be informed by public consultation and land ownership. Many of the benefits provided by urban forests are well understood. However, trees and greenspaces provided additional benefits during earthquakes and in the aftermath. Planted trees in the hills surrounding the city prevented rockfall from damaging infrastructure and human life downslope, while greenspaces were used as a base for search and rescue staff during rescue and recovery operations, and as temporary living spaces for residents who lost their homes.";"Morgenroth, Justin

"AGRIS:US201500196692";"Crop yield response to climate change varies with cropping intensity";"";"Projections of the response of crop yield to climate change at different spatial scales are known to vary. However, understanding of the causes of systematic differences across scale is limited. Here, we hypothesize that heterogeneous cropping intensity is one source of scale dependency. Analysis of observed global data and regional crop modelling demonstrate that areas of high vs. low cropping intensity can have systematically different yields, in both observations and simulations. Analysis of global crop data suggests that heterogeneity in cropping intensity is a likely source of scale dependency for a number of crops across the globe. Further crop modelling and a meta‐analysis of projected tropical maize yields are used to assess the implications for climate change assessments. The results show that scale dependency is a potential source of systematic bias. We conclude that spatially comprehensive assessments of climate impacts based on yield alone, without accounting for cropping intensity, are prone to systematic overestimation of climate impacts. The findings therefore suggest a need for greater attention to crop suitability and land use change when assessing the impacts of climate change.";"Challinor, Andrew J.

"AGRIS:US201600057739";"Assessing the impact of land cover map resolution and geolocation accuracy on evapotranspiration simulations by a land surface model";"";"The land surface models used in numerical weather forecasts and hydrological applications rely on the accuracy of land cover maps available from satellite remote sensing to simulate the energy and water balance at the surface of the Earth. While the impact of classification accuracy on land surface simulations has already been reported, little attention has been paid on the consequences of land cover map uncertainty driven by geolocation accuracy. This impact on the estimated evapotranspiration (ET) from the land surface model H-TESSEL at spatial resolutions ranging from 1 to 30 km is evaluated here, making use of land cover maps at two different initial spatial resolutions, 300 and 1200 m, derived from the GlobCover global product. Geolocation uncertainty affects the land cover maps aggregated at different resolution (from 1.2 to 30 km). However, the effect decreases towards the coarsest resolutions. In addition, aggregated land cover maps are less affected by geolocation errors when the finest original resolution (300 m) is used. The maximum possible effect on ET is quantified over a heterogeneous/transition area in Europe. The result shows an impact up to 10% at 1.2-km resolution to less than 1% at 10-km resolution, at daily timescale, stressing the importance of such issues for kilometre scale applications of land surface models. The use of the highest initial land cover resolution (300 m) reduces by a factor 3 the impact of geolocation on estimated ET at 1.2- to 3-km scale. This study, therefore, stresses on the importance of a careful choice of the land cover map before carrying on land surface model simulations at the kilometre scale.";"Ghilain, N.

"AGRIS:US201400106592";"Comparison of methods for LUCC monitoring over 50 years from aerial photographs and satellite images in a Sahelian catchment";"";"Land use/cover change (LUCC) is a major indicator of the impact of climate change and human activity, particularly in the Sahel, where the land cover has changed greatly over the past 50 years. Aerial and satellite sensors have been taking images of the Earth's surface for several decades. These data have been widely used to monitor LUCC, but many questions remain concerning what type of pre-processing should be carried out on image resolutions and which methods are most appropriate for successfully mapping patterns and dynamics in both croplands and natural vegetation. This study considers these methodological questions. It uses multi-source imagery from 1952 to 2003 (aerial photographs, Corona, Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) 5 images) and pursues two objectives: (i) to implement and compare a number of processing chains on the basis of multi-sensor data, in order (ii) to accurately track and quantify LUCC in a 100 km² Sahelian catchment over 50 years. The heterogeneity of the spatial and spectral resolution of the images led us to compare post-classification methods aimed at producing coherent diachronic maps based on a common land-cover nomenclature. Three main approaches were tested: pixel-based classification, vector grid-based on-screen interpretation and object-oriented classification. Within the automated approaches, we also examined the influence of spectral synthesis and spatial homogenization of the data through the use of composite bands (principal component analysis (PCA) and indices) and by resampling images at a common resolution. Classification accuracy was estimated by computing confusion matrices, by analysing overall change in the relative areas of land use/cover types and by studying the geographical coherence of the changes. These analyses indicate that on-screen interpretation is the most suitable approach for providing coherent, valid results from the multi-source images available over the study period. However, satisfactory classifications are obtained with the pixel-based and object-oriented approaches. The results also show significant sensitivity, depending on the method considered, to the combinations of bands used and to resampling. Lastly, the 50-year trends in LUCC point out a large increase in croplands and erosional surfaces with sparse vegetation and a drastic reduction in woody covers.";"Ruelland, Denis

"AGRIS:US201600189193";"Using a new PDP modelling approach for land-use and land-cover change predictions: A case study in the Stubai Valley (Central Alps)";"";"Due to the progressive forest expansion in European mountain areas triggered by agricultural abandonment, semi-natural meadows and pastures of great ecological and aesthetic value are disappearing. The aim of this study is to predict and analyse the future evolution of land use and land cover (LULC) in the Stubai Valley, Central Alps. We propose a computational Population Dynamics P system (PDP) model that incorporates the main LULC change processes like plant production, grazing, abandonment and reforestation. The advantages of our LULC-PDP model are: (1) the possibility to consider a large number of wild and domestic animals of different species and LULC, (2) the parallel and interdependent evolution of processes, animals and LULC, (3) the easy introduction of new processes and, hence, (4) the straightforward application of the model in other study areas. We simulate LULC changes from 2003 to 2033 in three different scenarios: (1) continuation of current land use, (2) slight reduction in land-use intensity and (3) strong reduction in land-use intensity. Furthermore, we use response-surface models that relate the response variable area and livestock annual variation, allowing better interpretation of LULC changes. The results show the accurate functioning of our model as a prediction tool. We see how agriculturally used grasslands progressively decrease, whereas the forest area increases in all simulated scenarios. The most likely zones to be abandoned are found in the intermediate altitudinal range between 1500 and 2150m, mostly on steep slopes (>30Â°). The reduction in the number of cattle is closely linked to the decrease in grazing land. As this tendency questions the conservation of traditional agricultural land, it is important to apply new strategies to preserve these cultural landscapes and the multiple ecosystem services for future generations before they disappear definitively.";"Fondevilla, Cristian

Use of logging residues and non-marketable small diameter trees available in these forests, are thought to create economic opportunities for NIPF owners and contribute in maintaining healthy forest systems. However, in the absence of a well-defined market, it is difficult to predict the willingness of landowners for supplying biomass from their forests. This study uses multinomial logit models to understand landowners' willingness/unwillingness to supply biomass at hypothetical price levels and examines landowner, forest, and demographic characteristics underlying these decisions. The results indicate significant association between landowners' bid acceptance decisions and factors such as, forest tract size, size of trees in the forest, distance of landowners' residence from the forest, landowners' age, previous harvesting experience, price of timber, and forest management objectives.";"G.C., Shivan

"AGRIS:US201500212173";"Carbon storage capacity of semi‐arid grassland soils and sequestration potentials in northern China";"";"Organic carbon (OC) sequestration in degraded semi‐arid environments by improved soil management is assumed to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation. However, information about the soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential in steppe soils and their current saturation status remains unknown. In this study, we estimated the OC storage capacity of semi‐arid grassland soils on the basis of remote, natural steppe fragments in northern China. Based on the maximum OC saturation of silt and clay particles <20 μm, OC sequestration potentials of degraded steppe soils (grazing land, arable land, eroded areas) were estimated. The analysis of natural grassland soils revealed a strong linear regression between the proportion of the fine fraction and its OC content, confirming the importance of silt and clay particles for OC stabilization in steppe soils. This relationship was similar to derived regressions in temperate and tropical soils but on a lower level, probably due to a lower C input and different clay mineralogy. In relation to the estimated OC storage capacity, degraded steppe soils showed a high OC saturation of 78–85% despite massive SOC losses due to unsustainable land use. As a result, the potential of degraded grassland soils to sequester additional OC was generally low. This can be related to a relatively high contribution of labile SOC, which is preferentially lost in the course of soil degradation. Moreover, wind erosion leads to substantial loss of silt and clay particles and consequently results in a direct loss of the ability to stabilize additional OC. Our findings indicate that the SOC loss in semi‐arid environments induced by intensive land use is largely irreversible. Observed SOC increases after improved land management mainly result in an accumulation of labile SOC prone to land use/climate changes and therefore cannot be regarded as contribution to long‐term OC sequestration.";"Wiesmeier, Martin

"AGRIS:US201500212172";"Quantifying landscape‐level methane fluxes in subarctic Finland using a multiscale approach";"";"Quantifying landscape‐scale methane (CH₄) fluxes from boreal and arctic regions, and determining how they are controlled, is critical for predicting the magnitude of any CH₄ emission feedback to climate change. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of small areas of strong methanogenic activity, vs. larger areas with net CH₄ uptake, in controlling landscape‐level fluxes. We measured CH₄ fluxes from multiple microtopographical subunits (sedge‐dominated lawns, interhummocks and hummocks) within an aapa mire in subarctic Finland, as well as in drier ecosystems present in the wider landscape, lichen heath and mountain birch forest. An intercomparison was carried out between fluxes measured using static chambers, up‐scaled using a high‐resolution landcover map derived from aerial photography and eddy covariance. Strong agreement was observed between the two methodologies, with emission rates greatest in lawns. CH₄ fluxes from lawns were strongly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature, but their floating nature meant that water‐table depth was not a key factor in controlling CH₄ release. In contrast, chamber measurements identified net CH₄ uptake in birch forest soils. An intercomparison between the aerial photography and satellite remote sensing demonstrated that quantifying the distribution of the key CH₄ emitting and consuming plant communities was possible from satellite, allowing fluxes to be scaled up to a 100 km² area. For the full growing season (May to October), ~ 1.1–1.4 g CH₄ m⁻² was released across the 100 km² area. This was based on up‐scaled lawn emissions of 1.2–1.5 g CH₄ m⁻², vs. an up‐scaled uptake of 0.07–0.15 g CH₄ m⁻² by the wider landscape. Given the strong temperature sensitivity of the dominant lawn fluxes, and the fact that lawns are unlikely to dry out, climate warming may substantially increase CH₄ emissions in northern Finland, and in aapa mire regions in general.";"Hartley, Iain.

"AGRIS:US201301547071";"Exploring options for farm-level strategic and tactical decision-making in fruit production systems of South Patagonia, Argentina";"";"In South Patagonia, Argentina, sweet cherry is the main fruit-tree crop grown for export, resulting in a highly seasonal labour demand. Managers of deciduous perennial fruit orchards must consider both biological and economic relationships in selecting crop species and orchard design. This makes decisions at the farm-level extremely complex, as especially in such perennial crops, strategic ('what to plant', 'with which technology' and 'how much area of each activity', i.e. the final design) and tactical ('when, what and how to plant in time', the pathway to the planned farm) decisions have a long-term effect. The objective of this study was to explore the consequences of different strategic and tactical decisions at farm scale in fruit production systems of South Patagonia, considering the variation in interests and aims of different stakeholders, and using a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the consequences of possible changes in external conditions. A dynamic farm-scale optimization model called OPTIFROP was developed to generate alternative farm development plans, by allocating, in the course of the time horizon of the run, production activities to different land units, while optimising different objective functions, subject to several constraints. Although time-dependent, dynamic, mathematical programming models for analysing farming systems have been described in literature, the dynamic aspects of long-term decision-making in orchard design and their impact on the sequential (annual) nature of orchards in different growth phases (i.e. medium-term decision-making), need a higher time-staged dynamic approach with a staircase matrix structure. The model includes two objective functions at farm level: (1) maximization of the present value of cumulative financial result, which is the main objective for growers, and (2) maximization of cumulative farm labour, which is an objective often mentioned by policy makers. The inter-months deviation for labour demand (during the period of high labour demand, November-April) was included as an upper-bound. Input and output coefficients for the land use options considered in OPTIFROP were quantified using the Technical Coefficient Generator FRUPAT. Model results indicated that the present value of cumulative financial result and the cumulative farm labour are conflicting to a very limited extent. Timing and feasibility of implementing certain combinations of production technologies are affected by resource endowments and initial conditions, but these factors do not influence land use selection in the long term. Land use selection is driven by the objectives of the stakeholders. OPTIFROP showed that, through introduction of alternative crops, substantial reductions in labour peaks in the period November-April could be achieved with a relatively small reduction in farm income. The sensitivity of the model solution to the cherry price suggests that the fruit production sector of South Patagonia should pay more attention to the robustness of their land use plans and take preventive measures to avoid being caught by a possible crisis due to changes in the context.";"Cittadini, E.D.

"AGRIS:US201301547073";"Spatial distribution of grassland productivity and land use in Europe";"";"Grasslands are an important land use in Europe with essential functions for feed and ecosystem service supply. Impact assessment modelling of European agriculture and the environment needs to consider grasslands and requires spatially explicit information on grassland distribution and productivity, which is not available. This paper presents and analyses spatially explicit data of grassland productivity and land use across regions in Europe. Data are extracted from various regional, national and international census statistics for Europe, extending eastwards to the Ural Mountains. Regional differences in grassland productivity are analysed considering selected climatic and agronomic parameters and are compared with the remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simulations from two impact assessment models. Temporal productivity changes are investigated for selected regions. As grassland is mainly used for animal feed stuff, the spatial distribution of milk productivity is also analyzed. Results show large regional differences in grassland productivity and land use in Europe. Grassland productivity is highly correlated with annual precipitation and less with annual temperature sum and growing season length. The correlation with NDVI is low. Comparison with large-scale simulations from two different models reveal that simulated spatial patterns of grassland productivity differ from the data obtained in this study, which may be attributable to the under-representation of management effects in these models. Grassland productivity has increased in recent decades, but the average annual genetic gain is different between temporary (0.5%) and permanent grassland (0.25%). The spatial pattern of milk productivity across Europe is similar to the productivity of grassland, suggesting that grassland productivity plays a major role in the distribution of milk productivity. The dataset described in this paper extends the present understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal changes in grassland productivity and land use in Europe. The dataset forms a suitable basis for evaluating large-scale (grassland) productivity models, for which observed data are scarce. However, the definition of grasslands and the collection of data across European countries need to be more consistent and standardised to improve the quality of European grassland productivity and land use data.";"Smit, H.J.

"AGRIS:US201300896067";"Forest transition in Vietnam and its environmental impacts";"";"This study assesses the presence of a forest transition - that is, a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation - in Vietnam during the 1990s, and describes its key attributes relevant for global environmental change issues. Using Fuzzy Kappa and other indicators, we compared forest cover estimates and spatial patterns from global and national land cover maps from the early and late 1990s, and compiled other available statistics for years before and after that period. This showed that a forest transition indeed occurred in Vietnam: the forest cover dropped to 25-31% of the country area in 1991-1993, and then increased to 32-37% in 1999-2001. The reforestation occurred at a higher rate than deforestation in the previous decades, and was due in similar proportions, to natural forest regeneration and to planted forests. The carbon stock in forests followed a similar transition, decreasing to 903 (770-1307) Tg C in 1991-1993, and then increasing to 1374 (1058-1744) Tg C in 2005. However, forest density declined during the same period, with an increasing proportion of young and degraded forests. The effects on habitats measured with landscape pattern indices were contrasted: in several regions, the reforestation decreased forest fragmentation, while in others, clearing of old-growth forests continued and/or forest fragmentation increased. This shows that a transition in forest area is not sufficient to rehabilitate the different ecosystem functions and services of forests.

A city grows not only by population but also by changes in spatial dimensions. Urban population growth and urban sprawl induced land use changes and land transformation. The land transformation is a natural process and cannot be stopped but it can be regulated. Many geographical changes at the urban periphery are associated with the transfer of land from rural to urban purpose. There is an urgent need for fast growing areas like Delhi, which can be easily done by high-resolution remote sensing data. Land use/land cover of North West of Delhi has been analyzed for the time period of 1972–2003. The remote sensing data used in study is Aster image of 2003 with a spatial resolution of 15 m and other data of 1972 Survey of India (SOI) toposheet at the scale of 1:50,000. Supervised digital classification using maximum likelihood classifier was applied for preparing land use/land cover. A change detection model was applied in ERDAS Imagine to find out the land use/land cover during 1972 to 2003. Eight land use classes was identified but main dominated classes were built up and agricultural land. A drastic change has been recorded during 30 years of time i. e. (1972-2003). In 1972, 92.06% of the land was under agricultural practice, which reduced to 64.71% in 2003. This shows 27.35% decrease in agricultural land in three decades. On the other hand built up area was 6.31% in 1972, which increased to 34% in 2003. One of the main cause of this land use change is the population growth due to the migration in the district from small cities and rural areas of Delhi.";"Rahman, Atiqur

We compared nesting habitat of Barred Owls to that of Red-shouldered Hawks nesting in suburban and urban areas, in and near the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, to determine whether any features distinguished owl nest sites from hawk nest sites. We characterized habitat and land-cover metrics in circular plots of 100Â ha and 15Â ha, centered on the owl and hawk nests, using ATtiILa software operating within a GIS environment. For the 100-ha plots, the primary cover type in the plots surrounding nests of both species was forest, 41.4 Â± 3.4% for Barred Owl plots and 45.9 Â± 3.4% for Red-shouldered Hawk plots, followed by low-density residential land: 29.8 Â± 4.8% of the Barred Owl plots and 29.3 Â± 3.7% of the Red-shouldered Hawk plots. Pasture composed <15% of the plot area for both species and the remainder of the cover types contributed even less. Values of land-cover percentages and metrics did not differ between the species (P > 0.05), for either the large plots or the small (15-ha) plots. Using stepwise binary logit regression analysis, we found that no variables discriminated owl plots from hawk plots. We concluded, based on our methodology, that habitat of suburban Barred Owls differed little from habitat of suburban Red-shouldered Hawks in southwestern Ohio.";"Dykstra, Cheryl R.

The goal of the paper is essentially a comparative one. By placing the examples of Bolivia and Norway side by side, the authors hope to shed light on common strategies while recognizing the diversity to be found in the ways that people relate to land. It is hoped that readers will be able to compare the material here with examples from other regions. By using data based on field research and related methods from two regions starkly distinguished from each other by language, socioeconomic levels, political histories, and extent of integration into world markets, the authors present a picture of how people interact with their bounded environments and the various meanings that they construct through such environments. Norway has one of the highest standards of living in the world and is in many ways a model of economic and social efficiency; Bolivia, by contrast, is characterized by extreme ecological zones and has struggled for most of its 170 years of independence to both maintain its population at the most basic of levels and to achieve social stability. Yet, despite these significant historical and contemporary differences, the ways in which people relate to land in both countries are often remarkably similar, particularly in rural areas.";"Goodale, Mark R.G.

"AGRIS:US201600010506";"Wintering Distribution of Great Grey Shrike Lantus excubitor in Poland: Predictions from a Large-Scale Historical Survey";"";"The wintering Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor was censused in Poland more than two decades ago (during the winters of 1988/89 and 1989/90). Single censuses were made during each winter on sample plots varying from 4.1 to 35.1 km² (mean: 16.4 km²). Altogether, data from 404 plots, covering in total more than 6.6 thousands km² were used for the analysis. Based on this data and environmental information gathered in GIS databases (Corine land cover ““CLC1990”” database, digital elevation model ““GTOPO30”” dataset) we modelled habitat- and spatial-related variation in shrike distribution. Birds were recorded on 45% of study plots. The mean density was 4.8 individuals/100 km². In both seasons density in meadows was roughly two times higher than in arable fields. We modelled spatial distribution of wintering birds using combination of GLM and three-dimensional local regression. Models were cross-validated to check their temporal consistency. Repeatable spatial pattern of population distribution allowed to make predictive distribution maps. As a general rule, wintering shrikes avoid regions with severe, continental climate and prefer lowlands dominated by agriculture. On the basis of our models, population of the Great Grey Shrike wintering in Poland during late 1980s can be roughly estimated at about 7.7 thousands of individuals.";"Kuczyńński, Lechosłław

"AGRIS:US201600198032";"Rearranging agricultural landscapes towards habitat quality optimisation: In silico application to pest regulation";"";"Modern agriculture suffers from its dependence on chemical inputs and subsequent impacts on health and environment. Alternatively, protecting crops against pests can be achieved through the reinforcement of regulation ecological services. Our work propounds a data-driven methodological framework to derive relevant agricultural landscape rearrangements enhancing populations of beneficial organisms regulating pests.Building on spatialised entomological and geographic data, we developed a parsimonious reactionâdiffusion model describing the population dynamics of beneficial organisms. Parameter estimation was carried out in a Bayesian framework accounting for uncertainty in the measurement.Thousands of agricultural landscapes were generated under agronomic specifications dealt with as constraint satisfaction problems. Population dynamics was simulated on each landscape with the fitted reaction-diffusion model mentioned above, and two metrics of abundances allowed the assessment of the regulation performance of the landscape spatial arrangements. One metric is a mean field performance criterion assessing the regulation performance from the landscape composition only, the other is a spatial performance metric assessing the performance resulting from the whole landscape spatial configuration. The former is computed with a non-spatialised form of the population dynamics model, the latter results from the reaction-diffusion model of the population dynamics. Comparing these metrics enabled to quantify the impact of spatial arrangements, hence allowing arrangements proposals.This framework was applied to the case study of a ground beetle species involved in the biological regulation of weeds. The arrangement proposals abides by the productive agronomic constraint that is the landscape composition, while they allow for significant habitat quality enhancement (or deterioration) for the beneficial organism (or a pest). Minor adaptations of our integrated data-driven approach would suit numerous situations ranging from the provision of enhanced ecosystem services to land management for conservation.";"Parisey, Nicolas

In this paper, participatory vulnerability analysis was used within a sustainable rural livelihoods framework to assess the sustainability of livelihoods in the agroecosystem of Abesard, Iran. In addition, this paper explored vulnerability contexts that affect livelihood assets. Findings revealed that land use change, climate variability, market fluctuations and higher mechanisation were the main reasons of vulnerability. To overcome these problems and to adapt to changes, households have followed livelihood strategies such as agricultural intensification, livelihood diversification, and agricultural biodiversity. The government has also provided some services such as extension programmes, fertilizers, and subsidies to compensate for asset limitations. Overall, implementation of the following development policies are recommended: (1) support of agricultural production by government institutions; (2) moving towards the development of sustainable agricultural practises that integrate a variety of methods in a sustainable manner; (3) development of agricultural intensification in a sustainable way that compensates for any inadequacy of assets; and (4) providing adult vocational training programmes for both men and women related to on-farm and off-farm activities. In the end, results highlighted the need for more emphasis on overcoming the challenges of sustainable agriculture using a participatory approach in assessment of the vulnerability of community livelihoods.";"Veisi, Hadi

"AGRIS:LV2011000790";"Problems of real property taxation in Lithuania";"Проблемы налогооблажения недвижимости в Литве";"There are three main real property taxes in Lithuania and all of them are applied to different persons and are calculated using different methodology. The revenue from real property taxes in different countries varies from 0.1% to 3% of GDP but in Lithuania it is even less than 0.1%. This revenue is allocated to municipal budget. Improvement of real property taxation system, changes in taxable value or introduction of new real property tax can increase revenue from taxation and encourage municipalities to improve living surrounding and infrastructure. Recent discussions in Lithuania about changes in real property taxation system show that new property tax for natural persons and changes of land taxable value can be introduced. The aim of this article is to analyze real property taxation trends in Lithuania and accuracy of mass appraisal. Comparison of mass valuation and real market prices in two municipalities was accomplished. Real market price and average market price of agricultural land were compared in Rokiskis municipality, apartments’ market prices and average market prices were compared in Kaunas city. The results of comparison in Rokiskis municipality show, that average market price calculated by mass appraisal is much less than real market value, therefore shifting to average market price as a taxable value will not harm land owners. Analysis of apartments average market price by mass appraisal and real market price in Kaunas city showed, that difference of values fluctuates from 7% to 98%. In all cases average market value was lower than real market value, so if the new real property tax was introduced, owners would not feel unjust because of wrong evaluation of their property.

В Литве есть три главные налоги на недвижимость, которые применяются к разным лицам, а методика их вычисления тоже разная. Доходы от налогов на недвижимость в разных странах варьирует от 0.1% до 3% от ВВП, но в Литве доход даже меньше 0.1%. Этот доход распределяется в муниципальный бюджет. Улучшение системы налогообложения недвижимости, изменения в налоговой стоимости или внедрение нового налога на недвижимость может увеличить доходы от налогообложения и поощрять муниципалитеты для улучшения жизни окружающих и инфраструктуры. Недавние дискуссии в Литве об изменениях в налогообложения собственности показывает, что может быть введен новый налог на недвижимость для физических лиц и изменения налогооблагаемой стоимости земли. Целью данной статьи является анализ тенденции налогообложения недвижимости в Литве и точность массовой оценки. Для этого были сравнены результаты массовой оценки и реальных рыночных цен в двух муниципалитетах. Реальная рыночная цена и средняя рыночная цена на сельскохозяйственные земли были сопоставлены в Рокишкис муниципалитете, рыночные цены на квартиры и средние рыночные цены были сопоставлены в Каунасе. Результаты сравнения показывают, что средняя рыночная цена сельскохозяйственные земли рассчитана путем массовой оценки значительно меньше реальной рыночной стоимости, поэтому переход к средней рыночной цене, как налогооблагаемой стоимости не будет вредить землевладельцев. Анализ средней рыночной цены рассчитанной путем массовой оценки и реальной рыночной цены квартир в городе Каунас показали, что разница значений колеблется от 7% до 98%. Во всех случаях средняя рыночная стоимость была ниже, чем реальная рыночная стоимость, так что, если новый налог на имущество был бы введен, владельцы не будут чувствовать себя несправедливо из-за неправильной оценки их имущества.";"Aleknavicius, A., Lithuanian Univ. of Agriculture, Akademija, Kauno reg.

Land should be used when coordinating private and public interests as well as environment protection requirements. At present this question is especially topical for land management specialists, land users and institutions coordinating use of land and land management works, because after the finishing of the land reform in rural areas it is very important to properly use farming lands according to their principal specific purpose. The article aims to analyse if such factors, as the land productivity point, processes of erosion, natural and climatic conditions as well as the suitability of land to form large and competitive farmers‟ farms, influence the change of farming lands. In order to develop agricultural activity it is necessary to find measures able to stop the decrease of the number of rural inhabitants and the loss of traditional farming ways.

Новизна проделанной исследовательской работы состоит в том, что проанализированы изменения сельскохозяйственных угодий агрохозяйственной зоны Средней Литвы, которые произошли за последние девять лет. Выбранная темы актуальна, так как данные об использовании земли необходимы при подготовке стратегии развития страны, чтобы наметить меры поддержки, осуществить планирование территорий, а для фермеров – выбрать наиболее эффективный способ использования земли. Данные статистики 2001-2010 гг. отражают общую тенденцию увеличения лесных массивов и уменьшения площадей неиспользуемых земель. Проведенный статистический анализ данных исследуемых районов показал, что сокращение сельскохозяйственных угодий происходит неравномерно, а увеличение лесных площадей идет за счет уменьшения других земель. Факторы агрохозяйственной зоны Средней Литвы на эти изменения в значительной степени не влияют.";"Аtkoceviciene, V., Lithuanian Univ. of Agriculture, Akademija, Kauno reg. (Lithuania)

As part of a broader effort to develop a sediment budget for the Le Sueur River, this study implemented a process-based watershed hydrology and upland erosion model, Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), to simulate hydrology and sediment dynamics in several land-use/land-cover scenarios. The Geo-spatial interface for WEPP (GeoWEPP) was used to characterize upland overland flow elements based on their land use/land cover, soil, and slope profiles. These characteristics were used as inputs for the WEPP model to estimate runoff fluxes, soil loss rates, and sediment delivery ratio (SDR) for three environmental scenarios: current land-use/land-cover with agricultural lands under fall mulch till management (scenario 1), current land-use/land-cover with agricultural lands under no till management (scenario 2), and pre-settlement land-use/land-cover (scenario 3). Over a simulated 30-year period (1979–2008), the runoff depth, soil loss rate and SDR were estimated to be 86mm, 2.6T/ha, and 0.84 for scenario 1; 73.8mm, 0.5T/ha, and 0.9 for scenario 2; and 70.9mm, 0.2T/ha, and 0.73 for scenario 3.";"Maalim, Fukhrudin K.

While water erosion is recognized as being a main mechanism of SOC losses, little research has yet been done to investigate the role which soil surface crusting might have on SOC losses. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of soil surface crusting on SOC losses. This study was conducted in Tougou Catchment (37km²), northwest of Burkina Faso, which receives a cumulative mean annual rainfall of 500mmy⁻¹. The area is characterized by sandy soils with varying types of surface crusts. The four different crust types studied were: structural crusts (STRU), which were found under cultivated soils, which were plowed annually; perennial desiccation crusts (DES), gravel (GRAV) and erosion (ERO) crusts, generally found in the degraded semi-arid savannas. Three micro-scale runoff plot (1×1m²) replicates were installed on each of the different types of surface crusts observed in the catchment. Water and sediment samples were collected from the runoff plots after every rainfall event (n=10) of the 2011 rainy season. The sediment samples were analyzed for organic carbon (OCsed), while the water samples were examined for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The average of organic carbon losses with sediment (OCLsed), was 0.37gCm⁻²y⁻¹ for ERO, 0.36gCm⁻²y⁻¹ for DES, 0.24gCm⁻²y⁻¹ for STRU and 0.15gCm⁻²y⁻¹ for GRAV. DOC accounted for a minute contribution to SOC losses i.e. less than 0.05%. STRU with 10.42mgCl⁻¹ showed the highest DOC content, followed by GRAV (6.13mgCl⁻¹), DES (5.06mgCl⁻¹) and ERO (4.92mgCl⁻¹). The OC enrichment ratio (ER) of sediments to that of the 0–0.1m bulk soil was less than one for DES, GRAV and ERO (0.39, 0.69 and 0.75, respectively) and reached 1.14 for STRU. This pointed to a greater SOC protection from erosion by the perennial crusts of the degraded savannas (DES, GRAV and ERO), as compared to crusts of cultivated fields. Thick, sand-enriched crusts, DES and GRAV, seemed to provide the greatest OC protection. This study pointed out a significant relationship between soils crusting on SOC erosion. It showed that the formation of loose and sandy crusts provides greater SOC protection from water erosion, which in turn may improve SOC stabilization and associated soil functions, such as soil fertility, water-holding capacity and sequestration of atmospheric carbon.";"Maïga-Yaleu, S.

The acquirers of the floating houses are raising questions if ownership of such houses will be able to enter in the Land Register, what kind of waters will be possible to place floating houses and what requirements are met to accommodate the floating houses on the water, the issues related to environmental protection and conservation, water treatment and waste management. There is an absence of floating houses construction, formation and registering regulation in Latvia, therefore the paper is a theoretical overview and analysis of the existing legal framework. The results of the research indicates the necessity of developing specific rules for the construction of floating houses, its formation process and determining the legal status of floating houses.

На сегодняший день нормативные акты в Латвии непозволяет плавучих жилых домов определять как недвижимое имущество, что обусловленно тем что токое имущество возможно перемещать с одного место в другое без разборки и без повреждений. Исключением является случий когда плавающии жилой дом привязан к земельному участку принадлежащего собственнику земли, и тогда оно становится частью данного недвижимого имущества, данное условие позволяет такой объект заносить Земельную книгу. Плавучий жилой дом является строением в процессе создания которого необходимо решать ряд вопросов: необходимо создать на берегу инфраструктуру обеспечивающую подключение к комуникациям, очистным сооружениям. Создание плавающих жилых домов, их строительство должно соотвествовать строительным нормативам и отвечать требованием безопастности.

The chronosequences reflect a history of pre-settlement deforestation, exploitive pioneer agriculture and ensuing land abandonment that led to soil fallowing and/or wind erosion in the 1920s followed by soil stabilization after extensive planting with red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.). Key pedogenic processes were identified and rates and magnitude of soil recovery were quantified in terms of morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of soil profiles. Soil degradation generally involved reduced fertility with profile simplification (haploidization) on non-eroded fallowed fields, and topsoil loss by wind erosion (deflation) on more exposed eroded fields. After reforestation, soil restoration was characterized by cessation of erosion, accelerated horizon development and differentiation, reduced soil bulk density, and increased fertility and acidification of the soil. Chronofunctions revealed substantial recovery in soil organic C, total N, available P, and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg status within 75 yr of initial reforestation on non-deflated, fallowed sites. In contrast, estimated recovery of these parameters on severely deflated sites was delayed far beyond plantation maturity.";"McPherson, T.S.

"AGRIS:US201400149895";"distance dependent contagion function for vector-based data";"";"Landscape pattern is of primary interest to landscape ecologists and landscape metrics are used to quantify landscape pattern. Metrics are commonly defined and calculated on raster-based land cover maps. One metric is the contagion, existing in several versions, e.g., unconditional and conditional, used as a measure of fragmentation. However, mapped data is sometimes in vector-based format or there may be no mapped data but only a point sample. In this study a definition of contagion for such cases is investigated. The metric is an extension of the usual contagion, based on pairs of points at varying distances and gives a function of the distance. In this study the extended contagion is calculated for vector-based delineated real landscapes and for simulated ones. Both unconditional and conditional contagions are studied using two classification systems. The unconditional contagion function was decreasing and convex, with upper and lower limits highly correlated to the Shannon diversity index, thus carrying only area proportion information. The spatial information lies in the speed by which the function converges to the lower limit; using a proxy function this can be expressed by a single parameter b, with high values for fragmented landscapes. No proxy function was found for the conditional contagion, for which only qualitative information was found. The extended contagion is applicable both in patch mosaic models of landscapes and in gradient-based models, where landscape characteristics change continuously without distinct borders between patches. The extended contagion can be useful in sample based surveys where there no map of the entire landscape is available.";"Ramezani, Habib

"AGRIS:US201500184045";"prediction of interregional land use differences in Beijing: a Markov model";"";"This study combines statistical methods and a Markov model to analyze interregional differences in land use in Beijing since 2003 and to predict land use changes for 2015 and 2019. First, the paper proposes a new concept, land use flow, which counts the change in area from the beginning to the end of the period of interest, to analyze changing land use patterns using statistical records from 2003 to 2011. Second, based on land use data between 2003, 2007 and 2011, this paper applied a Markov model to the prediction of Beijing land use in 2015 and 2019. The results show that: (1) the area of arable land decreased significantly across all of Beijing, with the greatest decrease, 6,953 ha, occurring in Tongzhou. The amount of urban land increased significantly, particularly in eastern and southern Beijing, in areas such as Chaoyang, Tongzhou and Daxing. The amount of land use for orchards fluctuated depending on the distance from the city center; (2) Haidian experienced the greatest change in its ratio of land use flow to urban land (100 %), while Tongzhou had the greatest reduction in arable land (−67.6 %); (3) the annual rate of land use change for Beijing as a whole was 0.89 %. Fangshan had the highest rate of annual conversion to grassland (13.2 %), while the Daxing District had the highest rate of change to urban land (5.1 %). Shijingshan experienced the greatest rate of annual change to other uses due to its small base (135.38 %); and (4) the predictions suggest that urban land is increasing and arable land is decreasing in the 14 districts and counties of Beijing. Several conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the concept of land use flow is useful for analyzing land use change and simplifies previous methods that were based on descriptions of the change orientation. Moreover, an understanding of the sub-flow of land use is improved by the linkage between land use change and the Markov model. Second, the predictions of land use in 2015 and 2019 suggest problems of urban sprawl and diminishing arable land in the patterns of land use that exist in Beijing and that will continue in the future. In terms of sustainability and Beijing’s goal of being a world city, the findings can help local authorities better understand and address a complex urban master plan, and develop improved land use management strategies that can better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation.";"Huang, Yingchun

"AGRIS:US201400145511";"Understanding global change: Lessons learnt from the European landscape";"";"Europe is characterized not only by large geomorphological variability but also by a long history of land use. This resulted in a highly variegated landscape. Based on the IGBP‐transect initiative, a north south transect was established across Europe ranging from north Sweden to central Italy in order to study effects of global change. Mainly process oriented studies were established on plots along the transect, and these were used to establish functional relationships as basis for landscape integration. However, it became apparent that the transect approach was not sufficient to mirror the European environment. From early on, the assessment of land cover was not constrained to this transect but complemented with measurements focused on Europe at a continental scale. Also, continental networks of flux measurements and ecosystem experiments were established, because these were able to encompass a larger inherent variability of climate, geology and land use. Resulting from the Kyoto protocol emphasis moved stronger from observations along transects towards a continental scale quantification of fluxes given the reporting needs. In this process the transect and the networks merged into research clusters, which provided a scaling and verification mechanism. Thus, the European situation may serve as an example of how the initial idea of transects has further evolved and broadened to continental scale studies in a region where anthropogenic land use dominates over climate change.";"Schulze, E.‐D.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"land cover;climate change;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"150;SWE;ITA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400145511";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2002.tb02064.x";"";"";"";"403-412"
"AGRIS:US201600032639";"Analysis of chain saw selective felling operations on damage rate of residual trees during winter time in a mixed conifer-broad-leaved forest in China";"";"Decreasing the damage rate of residual trees during selective cutting operations is quite important for forest landowners to reduce wood production waste and to use forest resources sustainably. In this article we analyze the impacts of chain saw selective felling operations on the damage rate of residual trees during winter in a mixed conifer-road-leaved forest. A case study was conducted in Dongfanghong Forest Farm located in northeast China. After theoretical analysis, the influencing factors were identified, and a mathematical model that considers the relationships among damage rate of residual trees, harvesting intensity, initial stand density, and single stem volume to be harvested was established. The theoretical model was verified using the data collected from harvesting sites. Results show that the residual trees' damage rate increases linearly with an increase in stand density and in the volume per stem of felled trees. The damage rate of residual trees increases initially then decreases as the selective cutting intensity increases. In theory, the damage rate is at its highest value when the selective cutting intensity reaches 50 percent. The damage rate is significantly reduced by controlling the falling direction of felled trees, which shifts the maximum damage rate such that the highest rate occurs when the selective cutting intensity is 39 percent. The following recommendations for loggers are proposed to reduce damage rate: (1) effectively control the falling direction of trees being felled, (2) conduct cutting operation in nonfrozen seasons, and (3) design the cutting intensity (E) to be either E < 20 percent or E > 60 percent.";"Wang, Lihai

In this paper, LUCC data of six periods were generated to explore the process of LUCC in NLR; the driving factors were discovered and the regression analysis of these driving factors was realized using the Dyna-CLUE model; and the land use pattern of 2020 in NLR Basin was projected under six scenarios. The results showed that the area ratio of wetland decreased from 45.84 % in 1954 to 9.76 % in 2010, and meanwhile, the area ratio of cultivated land (including paddy field and dry land) increased from 8.20 to 57.97 %, and areas of other land use types also changed dramatically. Demographic factors, especially large-scale farm construction, were the key driving factors of LUCC. The projection results presented a general trend of LUCC, with a constant increase of paddy field, a slow decline of dry land, and a gradual decrease of wetland, and wetlands in the downstream area of NLR were identified as the most sensitive to be affected, and badly in need of protection.";"Dan, Wu

"AGRIS:US2016213268";"Deforestation and Shade Coffee in Oaxaca, Mexico: Key Research Findings";"";"More than three-quarters of Mexico's coffee is grown on small plots shaded by the existing forest. Because they preserve forest cover, shade coffee farms provide vital ecological services including harboring biodiversity and preventing soil erosion. Unfortunately, tree cover in Mexico's shade coffee areas is increasingly being cleared to make way for subsistence agriculture, a direct result of the unprecedented decline of international coffee prices over the past decade. This paper summarizes the key findings of a three-year study of deforestation in Oaxaca, one of Mexico's prime regions for growing shade coffee. First, we find that deforestation during the 1990s was significant. Second, the loss of tree cover can likely be slowed by promoting coffee-marketing cooperatives and ""green"" certification, providing coffee price supports, and specifically targeting areas populated by small, indigenous farmers for assistance. Finally, to be effective, such policies must be implemented quickly after price shocks occur.";"Blackman, Allen

The transformation of the forestry sector has required major changes in the legal, regulatory and management framework. The World Bank financed Albanian National Forest Inventory project provides an analysis of spatially explicit land-cover/use change dynamics in the period 1991-2001 using the FAO/UNEP Land Cover Classification System for codification of classes, satellite remote sensing and field survey for data collection and elements of the object-oriented geo-database approach to handle changes as an evolution of land-cover/use objects, i.e. polygons, over time to facilitate change dynamics analysis. Analysis results at national level show the trend of natural resources depletion in the form of modifications and conversions that lead to a gradual shift from land-cover/use types with a tree cover to less dense tree covers or even a complete removal of trees. Policy failure (e.g., corruption, lack of law enforcement) is seen as the underlying cause. Another major trend is urbanisation of areas near large urban centres that change urban-rural linkages. Furthermore, after privatisation agricultural areas increased in the hills where environmental effects may be detrimental, while prime agricultural land in the plains is lost to urbanisation. At district level, the local variability of spatially explicit land-cover/use changes shows different types of natural resources depletion. The distribution of changes indicates a regional prevalence, thus a decentralised approach to the natural resources management could be advocated.";"Jansen, Louisa J. M.

This study has been conducted on Pichavaram forest, south east coast of India, famous for its unique mangrove bio-diversity. The main objectives of this study were focused on monitoring land cover changes particularly for the mangrove forest in the Pichavaram area using multi-temporal Landsat images captured in the 1991, 2000, and 2009. The land use/land cover (LULC) estimation was done by a unique hybrid classification approach consisting of unsupervised and support vector machine (SVM)-based supervised classification. Once the vegetation and non-vegetation classes were separated, training site-based classification technology i.e., SVM-based supervised classification technique was used. The agricultural area, forest/plantation, degraded mangrove and mangrove forest layers were separated from the vegetation layer. Mud flat, sand/beach, swamp, sea water/sea, aquaculture pond, and fallow land were separated from non-vegetation layer. Water logged areas were delineated from the area initially considered under swamp and sea water-drowned areas. In this study, the object-based post-classification comparison method was employed for detecting changes. In order to evaluate the performance, an accuracy assessment was carried out using the randomly stratified sampling method, assuring distribution in a rational pattern so that a specific number of observations were assigned to each category on the classified image. The Kappa accuracy of SVM classified image was highest (94.53� %) for the 2000 image and about 94.14 and 89.45� % for the 2009 and 1991 images, respectively. The results indicated that the increased anthropogenic activities in Pichavaram have caused an irreversible loss of forest vegetation. These findings can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address the broad-scale mangrove ecosystem conservation projects and also as a tactical guide to help managers in designing effective restoration measures.";"Singh, Sudhir Kumar

A Föld lakosságának gyarapodásával a történelem folyamán együtt növekedett az embernek az erdővel szemben támasztott igénye. Az igények kielégítésekor hamarosan kitűnt, hogy ezek teljesítésének lehetőségei szigorúan behatároltak. Hosszú távon, tartamosan (fenntarthatóan) akkor nyújthatja az erdő a gazdasági, társadalmi élet számára a legtöbbet, ha az adottságainak megfelelően gazdálkodnak. A Föld erdeinek jelenlegi képe több évezredes fejlődés, valamint emberi beavatkozás eredményeként alakult. A jelenlegi felfogás szerinti „korszerű” erdőgazdálkodás az egyes kontinenseken különböző időben, alig egy-két évszázada jött létre. Abban az esetben azonban, ha az ember és az erdő kapcsolatát vesszük alapul, az erdőgazdálkodást célszerű tágabban értelmezni és az emberiség történetével, az igények változásával együtt tárgyalni. Az ember története folyamán min-denkor a legtöbbet kívánta hasznosítani az erdők által nyújtott javakból. Hamarosan rájött arra is, hogy ezen javak mennyiségét és minőségét a faállományba való beavatkozás útján javíthatja. Ezek a beavatkozások nem mindenkor jártak kedvező eredménnyel. Az erdőgazdálkodók feladata mindenkor, hogy az erdők története által nyújtott tanulságokat értékeljék és hasznosítsák. Ez jelenti az erdőgazdálkodás fejlesztésének az egyik tényezőjét, mert ebben az esetben is: „A történelem az élet tanítómestere”. Ilyen és hasonló megfontolások vezettek ezen írásban foglaltak megfogalmazásához.Az erdők valamennyi fája egy olyan történelemkönyv lapját alkotja, amelynek címe: „Erdőtörténet”. A fa évgyűrűi jelentik ezen a lapon a sorokat, az egyes ágörvek közötti részek pedig a sortávolságok meghatározói. Az évgyűrűk átölelik a fa szívét és elmesélik életének történetét. A nagy történelmi távlatokat az egymást követő erdőállományok hordozzák magukban. Nagy idők sokat látott és tapasztalt „tanúi”. Az evolúció évezredeket átölelő folyamatának eredményeként jelentek meg a különböző fafaj-összetételű állományok, a devonkorszaki páfrányerdőktől a mai gyertyános bükkös tölgyesekig. Olyan erdőtársulások (erdei ökoszisztémák) jöttek létre, amelyek összetételébe, szerkezetébe az ember egyre nagyobb mértékben avatkozott be azért, hogy az erdő haszna megfeleljen igényeinek. A baj akkor következett és következik be, ha az ember érdekei feledtetik az igazságot, amely szerint az erdő a fák tár¬sadalma, ahol a társadalmi együttélés íratlan szabályait a természeti törvények fogalmazzák meg, amelynek figyelembevételével az erdővel gazdálkodni kell!       ------------------------------------      The basis of forestry is the sustainability, cultivation and manifold use of the forest. As world population grew over the history so did people’s demands of the forest. In satisfying the demand for forest products it soon transpired that their supply is strictly limited. On long term the forest can provide for society and economy sustainably the most if it is managed according to its needs. The present state of earth’s forests is the outcome of thousands of years of growths and human intervention. The prevailing concept of up-to-date forestry developed on the various continents only over the last one or two hundred years. If we take the relationship between humanity and forest as the basis, it is pertinent to consider forestry in a wider sense together with the history of humanity and changes in people’s demands. Throughout history humanity has always intended to utilise the most the forest can provide. People soon discovered the quality and quantity of forestry products can be improved by intervention into the growing stock. However, such intervention did not always lead to the desired outcome. At all times it is a forester’s job to evaluate and utilise any lessens provided by the forest history. This is a significant factor in successful forestry management as “History is life’s teacher”. Considerations such as this lead to the concepts ideas in this paper.Every tree in a forest constitutes a page out of a history book, whose title is “The history of forest”. The tree rings represent the lines on this page and the width between rings indicates the width between lines. Tree rings embrace the heart of a tree and retail the story of its life. Long historical periods are embodied in stands that follow each other. They are the well experienced “witnesses” of great times. Thousands of years of evolution resulted in stands of various wood species from fern trees of the Devonian age to today’s forests of hornbeam, beach and oak. As time went by people intervened increasingly more frequently into the composition and constitution of the forest (forestry eco-system) to satisfy their demands of forestry products. Trouble begins when people’s interests make them forget about the truth, that the forest is the society of trees, where natural laws dictate the unwritten rules of co-existence to be taken into account when managing the forest!";"Solymos, Rezso";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"hu";"forestry";"Forest Tenure";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016220779";"http://purl.umn.edu/92423";"";"";"";""

Besides the slope, the pre-designated loads of different sizes and log orientation (butt-end or top-end forward) have been main variables. The trial was conducted on two concave shaped test skid trails in the forest. On the lower altitudes, the skid trails had small inclination, which slowly increased to 42% on the track where WOODY 110 was tested, and 27% where AGT 835 was measured. First the loads were skidded uphill with butt-end and then with top-end forward. The purpose was to choose too heavy loads, as we wished to stop tractors due to overload, but on different slopes. The proper load formation (butt-end forward if possible) in uphill skidding is most important on steeper skid trails. The dependency between maximum load and slope is linear. The calculated theoretical maximum load on horizontal surface enables us to make similar assessment for any other tractor weighing between 2 and 7 tons. For this purpose, John Deere 6220 and LIMB 80 LUXS adapted agricultural tractors for forest use were chosen and compared. The ratio between the tractor load on different slopes and tractor weight was calculated for all four tractors included in our comparison. Apart from the weight, tractor's engine torque (power) has the decisive influence on the load size. Maximum loads on different slope categories were calculated according to different engine powers.";"Kosir, B., Ljubljana Univ. (Slovenia). Biotechnical Fac., Forestry Dept.

Further, despite the abundance of small lakes on the landscape, neither emissions of these gases nor their drivers are well described. Dissolved concentrations of CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O greenhouse gases were related to water chemistry, hydrology and catchment characteristics in order to identify factors controlling gas concentrations for 121 small Irish headwater lakes (median area: 2.0ha) in relatively undisturbed catchments; lake–atmosphere gas fluxes were also calculated. The majority of lakes were supersaturated (relative to the atmosphere) with CO₂ and N₂O while CH₄ was above saturation in all lakes. Dissolved gas concentrations were correlated with land cover (rock, forest and grassland), deuterium excess (an indicator of hydrologic character) and lake organic carbon concentrations, although dissolved CO₂ exhibited few significant relationships. Principal components analysis indicated that higher levels of CH₄ and N₂O supersaturation were exhibited under different conditions. Methane supersaturation was highest in low elevation catchments with an evaporative hydrologic character and high organic carbon concentrations. In contrast, lakes characteristic of N₂O supersaturation were low in carbon and located in more rapidly flushed higher elevation catchments. Estimated fluxes of CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O to the atmosphere averaged 14, 0.36 and 1.3×10⁻³mmolm⁻²d⁻¹, respectively.";"Whitfield, Colin J.

However, because semi-arid savannas characteristically have scattered tree cover, the NDVI values at low spatial resolution suffer from the effect of aggregation of near-infrared and red energy from adjacent vegetated and non-vegetated cover types. This effect is seldom taken into consideration or quantified in NDVI analyses of the vegetation of semi-arid lands. This study examined the effect of pixel size on NDVI values of land-cover features for a semi-arid area, using the 1000 m, 250 m and 10 m pixel sizes. A rainy season Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT 5) High Resolution Geometric (HRG) image at 10 m spatial resolution was utilized. Following radiometric and geometric preprocessing, the 10 m pixel size of the image was aggregated to 250 m and 1000 m to simulate imagery at these pixel sizes, and then NDVI images at the spatial resolution scales of 10 m (NDVI₁₀ ₘ), 250 m (NDVI₂₅₀ ₘ), and 1000 m (NDVI₁₀₀₀ ₘ) derived from the respective images. The simulation of the NDVI₂₅₀ ₘ image was validated against a concurrent 16 day MODIS NDVI composite (MOD13Q1) image, and the accuracy derived from the validation was generalized to the NDVI₁₀₀₀ ₘ image. With change from low to high spatial resolution, extreme magnitude NDVI values shifted towards the centre (mode) of the resulting approximately Gaussian NDVI distributions. There was a statistically significant difference in NDVI values at the three pixel sizes. Low spatial magnitude vegetation sites (woodland, cropland) had reductions of up to 28% in NDVI value between the NDVI₁₀ ₘ and NDVI₁₀₀₀ ₘ scales. The results indicate that vegetation monitoring using low spatial resolution imagery in semi-arid savannas may only be indicative and needs to be supplemented by higher spatial resolution imagery.";"Munyati, C.

"AGRIS:US201400168484";"Is cellular automata algorithm able to predict the future dynamical shifts of tree species in Italy under climate change scenarios? A methodological approach";"";"In this paper is presented a methodological approach which integrates statistic modelling and 2-D cellular automata (CA) in order to describe tree species shifts responding to the climate changes foreseen for Italy in the 21st century. Five Italian tree species populations of Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica, Acer campestris and Quercus suber and their actual potential distributions (PDs) – represented by Importance Value (IV), have been considered. Environmental and climatic relationships have been modelled through application of a new statistical methodology called extreme discretization, where the PD of a species was considered as a random field. The IV-based PD has been spatialized through a probability function π(A,S), which represented the spatio-temporal relationships between IV values and climatic (A) and geo-morphological (S) variables. For each tree species π=(A,S) has been estimated and inserted as rule in the 2-D cellular automata. The latter, acting by a Moore neighbouring, took in consideration also the suitability map for tree species, which has been obtained by land cover map. Two time frames (2050 and 2080) and two climatic scenarios (A2 and B1) have been considered. Results described a general reduction of the IV values and their distribution for A. alba, P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica, in both climatic scenarios, whereas an increase of IVs and distribution for Q. suber and only a slight increment of distribution for A. campestris was mainly observed under the B1 scenario, but not for the more limiting A2 scenario. Convergent results have been obtained with respect to other simulation systems concerning the shift of tree species responding to different climatic change scenarios but lacking of the description of dynamical paths. Our approach seems natural and practical to describe such phenomena. The transition rules for the CA and the parameters taken into account for the construction of the probabilistic models can be surely improved to obtain a more realistic pattern of tree species shifts. Future efforts should be made to take in account the inter-specific relationships inside the Italian forest ecosystems, in order to also consider the competiveness for resources that exert some effects on the plant distribution both in time and space.";"Di Traglia, Mario

SW Spain";"";"An assessment of sensitivity to land degradation has been carried out in the Extremadura region, SW Spain, by means of a modelling approach developed by the European Commission funded MEDALUS project (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) which identifies such areas on the basis of an index (Environmentally Sensitive Area index, ESA index) that incorporates data on environmental quality (climate, vegetation, soil) as well as anthropogenic factors (management). Two maps of environmental sensitivity (ES) to degradation with different legend resolution (four and eight classes of sensitivity) have been made and tested by comparing classes of the legends with an extensive number (2690) of true field data gathered from plots distributed all over the study region. Independent variables of validation consisted of nine degradation-related types of data and the method tested the performance of the whole model and the statistical separability among classes of sensitivity, as well as the capability of the variables in delimiting the classes. Results showed a good performance of the whole model to both, the map of four and eighth classes of sensitivity. Separation among classes of sensitivity showed a slightly different behaviour of both maps, identifying transitional classes in the map of eight classes where classification could be improved in terms of the ranges of ESA index values assigned to the different classes.

"AGRIS:US201500063605";"Assessment of sediment connectivity from vegetation cover and topography using remotely sensed data in a dryland catchment in the Spanish Pyrenees";"";"PURPOSE: Many Mediterranean drylands are characterized by strong erosion in headwater catchments, where connectivity processes play an important role in the redistribution of water and sediments. Sediment connectivity describes the ease with which sediment can move through a catchment. The spatial and temporal characterization of connectivity patterns in a catchment enables the estimation of sediment contribution and transfer paths. Apart from topography, vegetation cover is one of the main factors driving sediment connectivity. This is particularly true for the patchy vegetation cover typical of many dryland environments. Several connectivity measures have been developed in the last few years. At the same time, advances in remote sensing have enabled an improved catchment-wide estimation of ground cover at the subpixel level using hyperspectral imagery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The objective of this study was to assess the sediment connectivity for two adjacent subcatchments (~70 km²) of the Isábena River in the Spanish Pyrenees in contrasting seasons using a quantitative connectivity index based on fractional vegetation cover and topography data. The fractional cover of green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, bare soil and rock were derived by applying a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis approach to the hyperspectral image data. Sediment connectivity was mapped using the index of connectivity, in which the effect of land cover on runoff and sediment fluxes is expressed by a spatially distributed weighting factor. In this study, the cover and management factor (C factor) of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was used as a weighting factor. Bi-temporal C factor maps were derived by linking the spatially explicit fractional ground cover and vegetation height obtained from the airborne data to the variables of the RUSLE subfactors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The resulting connectivity maps show that areas behave very differently with regard to connectivity, depending on the land cover and on the spatial distribution of vegetation abundances and topographic barriers. Most parts of the catchment show higher connectivity values in August as compared to April. The two subcatchments show a slightly different connectivity behaviour that reflects the different land cover proportions and their spatial configuration. CONCLUSIONS: The connectivity estimation can support a better understanding of processes controlling the redistribution of water and sediments from the hillslopes to the channel network at a scale appropriate for land management. It allows hot spot areas of erosion to be identified and the effects of erosion control measures, as well as different land management scenarios, to be studied.";"Foerster, Saskia

Perceptions of large, intense fires as being ecologically 'disastrous' are common. These are summarised by four hypotheses characterising large fires as: (i) homogenous in extent and intensity; (ii) causing large-scale extinction due to perceived lack of survival and regeneration capacity among biota; (iii) degrading due to erosion and related edaphic effects; (iv) unnatural, as a consequence of contemporary land management. These hypotheses are examined using available evidence and shown to inadequately account for effects of large fires on biodiversity. Large fires do not burn homogeneously, though they may produce intensely burnt patches and areas. The bulk of biota are resilient through a variety of in situ persistence mechanisms that are reinforced by landscape factors. Severe erosive episodes following fire tend to be local and uncertain rather than global and inevitable. Redistribution of soil and nutrients may reinforce habitat variation in some cases. Signals of fire are highly variable over prehistoric and historic eras, and, in some cases, contemporary and pre-European signal levels are equivalent. The most important effects of large fires in these diverse ecological communities and landscapes stem from their recurrence rate. Adaptive management of fire regimes rather than fire events is required, based on an understanding of risks posed by particular regimes to biota.";"Bradstock, Ross A.";"";"CSIRO Publishing";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301569145";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF07153";"";"";"";"809-822"

"AGRIS:US201500163699";"Bioenergy and African transformation";"";"Among the world’s continents, Africa has the highest incidence of food insecurity and poverty and the highest rates of population growth. Yet Africa also has the most arable land, the lowest crop yields, and by far the most plentiful land resources relative to energy demand. It is thus of interest to examine the potential of expanded modern bioenergy production in Africa. Here we consider bioenergy as an enabler for development, and provide an overview of modern bioenergy technologies with a comment on application in an Africa context. Experience with bioenergy in Africa offers evidence of social benefits and also some important lessons. In Brazil, social development, agricultural development and food security, and bioenergy development have been synergistic rather than antagonistic. Realizing similar success in African countries will require clear vision, good governance, and adaptation of technologies, knowledge, and business models to myriad local circumstances. Strategies for integrated production of food crops, livestock, and bioenergy are potentially attractive and offer an alternative to an agricultural model featuring specialized land use. If done thoughtfully, there is considerable evidence that food security and economic development in Africa can be addressed more effectively with modern bioenergy than without it. Modern bioenergy can be an agent of African transformation, with potential social benefits accruing to multiple sectors and extending well beyond energy supply per se. Potential negative impacts also cut across sectors. Thus, institutionally inclusive multi-sector legislative structures will be more effective at maximizing the social benefits of bioenergy compared to institutionally exclusive, single-sector structures.";"Lynd, Lee R

Relative savings in GHG emissions were higher under intensive forest management compared with nonintensive forest management on a per unit land basis, whereas this situation reverses on a per unit energy basis.

Previous studies revealed the important influences of topography and land use on wind erosion in the Xilingele grassland. Topography influences wind fields at large scale, and land use influences wind fields near the ground. Two steps were designed to implement the CFD wind simulation, and they were respectively to simulate the influence of topography and surface roughness on the wind. Digital elevation model (DEM) and surface roughness length were the key inputs for the CFD simulation. The wind simulation by CFD-WEM was validated by a wind data set which was measured simultaneously at six positions in the field. Three scenarios with different wind velocities were designed based on observed dust storm events, and wind fields were simulated according to these scenarios to predict the sensitive areas to wind erosion. General assumptions that cropland is the most sensitive area to wind erosion and heavily and moderately grazed grasslands are both sensitive etc. can be refined by the modelling of CFD-WEM. Aided by the results of this study, the land use planning and protection measures against wind erosion can be more efficient. Based on the case study in the Xilingele grassland, a method of regional wind erosion assessment aided by CFD wind simulation is summarized. The essence of this method is a combination of CFD wind simulation and determination of threshold wind velocity for wind erosion. Because of the physically-based simulation and the flexibility of the method, it can be generalised to other regions.";"Zhang, Zhuodong

Land tenure conflicts often trigger forest and land fires, which is both a symptom and a cause of increasing conflict over tenure and use rights. If the tenure issue is not appropriately addressed, it will continue to result in unwanted fires and forest degradation, related smoke and gas emissions, and environmental and economic losses. A recent study in Sumatra revealed that, in many cases, (1) tenure conflicts between companies and communities, resulting from past government policies and practices, often trigger forest and land fires because of frustrations by the communities of being unable to have their claims heard in a fair and transparent judicial system; and (2) even with the use of military force, forest policy and management has largely failed to protect forest resources when local communities were not involved.

A total of 102 people participated in the study (64 males; 38 females) comprising 51 members of a community-based land management group and 51 controls matched by age and gender. Mixed methods were employed, including the use of an adapted version of Buckner’s (1988) Community Cohesion Scale. The results indicate that involvement in the management of land for conservation may contribute to both the health and well-being of members, and to the social capital of the local community. The members of the land management groups rated their general health higher, reported visiting the doctor less often, felt safer in the local community, and utilized the skills that they have acquired in their lifetime more frequently than the control participants. Male members reported the highest level of general health, and the greatest satisfaction with daily activities. Members also reported a greater sense of belonging to the local community and a greater willingness to work toward improving their community than their control counterparts. Of equal importance is evidence that involvement in voluntary conservation work constitutes a means of building social capital in rural communities which may help reduce some of the negative aspects of rural life.";"Moore, Megan

"AGRIS:US201300790794";"Fire use: Is it really the cheaper land preparation method for large-scale plantations";"";"During the last two decades Indonesia has experienced immense forest and land fires. Often these fires are associated with extended drought and widespread use of fire to clear previously logged forest and other degraded land in preparation for oil palm, rubber, or pulpwood plantations. There are many reasons for the use of fire in land clearing activities, but probably the most important one is economics. There is still acceptance that fire is the cheapest, fastest, and most effective land clearing method with the added benefit of providing nutrients from ash residues. This paper provides a review of existing information on the financial costs and benefits of using fire for land clearing in agriculture and forestry plantations as compared with zero-burning techniques. The findings indicate that the economic advantage of fire use varies widely and depends on many factors, such as soil fertility, vegetation density, labour cost, equipment and training costs, and the costs of fire management. For large-scale land clearing, the financial analysis of the costs and benefits of fire versus zero-burning shows that when applied to low-volume vegetation, zero-burning methods are not more expensive than burning - and may actually be more cost effective in the long term. This is the case for clearing oil palm or rubber plantations for replanting, low secondary vegetation, and heavily logged-over forest. Under high-volume forest conditions, burning remains less expensive because it is more difficult, time consuming, and costly to dispose of high volumes of piled wood mechanically.";"Simorangkir, Dicky";"";"Kluwer Academic Publishers";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"forestry;agriculture;land clearing";"Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IDN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300790794";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-006-9049-2";"";"";"";"147-164"

We ask to what extent forces external to the watershed and the local economy, and in particular market development and associated economic policies, might influence land use and resource management decisions.

With regards to in situ θ probes, it is sometimes assumed that a single local measurement can represent the larger domain, mostly for practical reasons. But there is a substantial amount of variability in θ at the field scale. As part of the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote Sensing Experiment 2008 (BEAREX08), a high-density sensor network and intensive observational periods were developed to fully describe the θ conditions at the surface on the field scale, in support of the hydro-meteorological measurements being collected. A total of 20 θ stations were distributed over an irrigated and a non-irrigated field (~10 ha each) and high-density (~every 5 cm) transects were measured for a high-detailed record. The network was able to provide large scale estimates of θ with an accuracy (root mean square error, RMSE) of 0.035 m3/m3. The network was temporally stable with the exception being immediately during and after irrigation events. Irrigation caused significant increases in coefficients of variation due to the length of time (8–12 h) necessary to irrigate the entire field. The spatial distribution of surface θ was significantly affected by the row structure of the cotton plants, which was North–South in the field where transect measurements were made with a row spacing of 76 cm. At scales <35 cm (approximately half the row spacing), the distribution was correlated in the East–West direction. For scales larger than 35 cm in the East–West direction the correlation decreased, but was still present. In the North–South direction this discontinuity was not present, and θ followed a power law distribution.";"Cosh, Michael H.

This paper presents an overview of the field experiment data collected using PALS that spans 10 years. Data from the various campaigns were merged to form a single data set. Analyses showed that the data set contains an extensive range of soil moisture values collected under a variety of conditions and that the quality of both the PALS and ground truth data meets the needs of SMAP algorithm development and validation.

Management of freshwaters should aim to maximise as many of these services as possible, but managers are often focused on individual services. To test for the biodiversity value of stormwater management ponds (SMPs) in Ottawa, Canada, 20 SMPs were surveyed for macroinvertebrates using standardised sampling techniques. These were compared against 10 wetlands that were not managed for stormwater control (a combination of ornamental lakes, natural lakes, and nature reserves) in and around the same urban area (a total of 30 ponds). Natural wetlands and SMPs were very different in their water chemistry, which was correlated with the proportion of urban land use within 1 km of the site, with higher conductivity in SMPs with increasing urban land cover (P = 0.046). Despite this, natural wetlands and the richest SMPs contained similar levels of biodiversity and similar macroinvertebrate community structure. This study highlights that stormwater management can occur alongside biodiversity enhancement in urban areas, but correlations between urban land use, water chemistry, and the structure of biological communities suggests that run-off from urban areas is likely a major factor in structuring biological communities in built-up regions.";"Hassall, Christopher

This study applied the ordinary least squares regression model and the geographically weighted regression model to examine the spatially varying relationships between 12 explanatory variables (including three topographical factors, four land use parameters, and five landscape metrics) and 15 water quality indicators in watersheds of Yundang Lake, Maluan Bay, and Xinglin Bay with varying levels of urbanization in Xiamen City, China. A local and global investigation was carried out at the watershed-level, with 50 and 200� m riparian buffer scales. This study found that topographical features and landscape metrics are the dominant factors of water quality, while land uses are too weak to be considered as a strong influential factor on water quality. Such statistical results may be related with the characteristics of land use compositions in our study area. Water quality variations in the 50� m buffer were dominated by topographical variables. The impact of landscape metrics on water quality gradually strengthen with expanding buffer zones. The strongest relationships are obtained in entire watersheds, rather than in 50 and 200� m buffer zones. Spatially varying relationships and effective buffer zones were verified in this study. Spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and water quality parameters are more diversified and complex in less urbanized areas than in highly urbanized areas. This study hypothesizes that all these varying relationships may be attributed to the heterogeneity of landscape patterns in different urban regions. Adjustment of landscape patterns in an entire watershed should be the key measure to successfully improving urban lake water quality.";"Sun, Yanwei

There is a strong link between desertification of the drylands and emission of COâ from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere. The Horqin Sandy Land is a severely desertified area in China's agro-pastoral ecotone due to its fragile ecology, combined with unsustainable land management. We estimated changes of organic carbon content in the bulk soil (0â5 cm), in the light-fraction of soil organic matter (based on density fractionation), and in the various particle-size fractions in areas with mobile sand dunes after implementing grazing exclusion (12 and 27 years) and tree and shrub planting (22 and 24 years). Carbon stocks in the bulk soil and all soil density and particle-size fractions increased significantly in the exclosure and plantation plots. The average rates of carbon accumulation in the bulk soil in the exclosure and plantation plots were 16.0 and 17.8 g mâ»Â² yâ»Â¹, respectively, versus corresponding values of 2.3 and 7.1 g mâ»Â² yâ»Â¹ for the light fraction, 4.3 and 8.0 g mâ»Â² yâ»Â¹ for the coarse fraction, 5.0 and 3.4 g mâ»Â² yâ»Â¹ for the fine sand, 4.5 and 4.2 g mâ»Â² yâ»Â¹ for the very fine sand, and 1.8 and 1.8 g mâ»Â² yâ»Â¹ for the silt+clay fraction. The older the exclosure and plantation, the more carbon accumulated in the bulk soil and in each fraction. The carbon pool exceeded the level in non-desertified grasslands after 27 years of grazing exclosure and 24 years of the shrub plantation. Our results suggest that both grazing exclusion and planting trees and shrubs can restore desertified grassland, creating a high potential for sequestering soil carbon, but that the plantations appeared to accumulate soil carbon faster than the exclosures.";"Li, Yuqiang

Cattle pasture represents the largest single use (about 70%) of this once-forested land in most of the region. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the RothC and Century models at estimating soil organic C (SOC) changes under forest-to-pasture conditions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used data from 11 site-specific 'forest to pasture' chronosequences with the Century Ecosystem Model (Century 4.0) and the Rothamsted C Model (RothC 26.3). The models predicted that forest clearance and conversion to well managed pasture would cause an initial decline in soil C stocks (0-20 cm depth), followed in the majority of cases by a slow rise to levels exceeding those under native forest. One exception to this pattern was a chronosequence in Suia-Missu, which is under degraded pasture. In three other chronosequences the recovery of soil C under pasture appeared to be only to about the same level as under the previous forest. Statistical tests were applied to determine levels of agreement between simulated SOC stocks and observed stocks for all the sites within the 11 chronosequences. The models also provided reasonable estimates (coefficient of correlation = 0.8) of the microbial biomass C in the 0-10 cm soil layer for three chronosequences, when compared with available measured data. The Century model adequately predicted the magnitude and the overall trend in delta¹³C for the six chronosequences where measured delta¹³C data were available. This study gave independent tests of model performance, as no adjustments were made to the models to generate outputs. Our results suggest that modelling techniques can be successfully used for monitoring soil C stocks and changes, allowing both the identification of current patterns in the soil and the projection of future conditions. Results were used and discussed not only to evaluate soil C dynamics but also to indicate soil C sequestration opportunities for the Brazilian Amazon region. Moreover, modelling studies in these 'forest to pasture' systems have important applications, for example, the calculation of CO₂ emissions from land use change in national greenhouse gas inventories.";"Cerri, C.E.P.

Sloping cultivated land is one of the most common land types in the region, and it leads to severe soil erosion. Analyses based on fine resolution satellite imagery can play a key role in the surveying of sloping farmland. In this article, a combination of remote-sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques under the hierarchical classification framework is used to investigate the sloping cultivated land in the Xi–He ecological engineering demonstration region of the Loess Plateau. This article synthetically adopts Système Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) high-resolution images, Thematic Mapper (TM) multi-spectral images, and a terrain map at a scale of 1:10,000 to calculate the spectral, textural, and slope attributes of the sloping land type. A Bayesian classification method is employed to distinguish the crop and non-crop areas with a priori knowledge provided by local experts. The Gabor filter and the grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) method are used in combination under a man–machine interactive interpretation to extract the differences of texture trends and density distributions between sloping cultivated land and terraces, and a window-based method of texture analysis operations is adopted. A classification accuracy assessment by field survey shows that the total interpretation accuracy exceeds 80%.

Such information is important for countries in arid areas with high susceptibility to desertification. SOC stocks, and predicted changes between 2000 and 2030, were determined at the national scale for Jordan using The Global Environment Facility Soil Organic Carbon (GEFSOC) Modelling System. For the purpose of this study, Jordan was divided into three natural regions (The Jordan Valley, the Uplands and the Badia) and three developmental regions (North, Middle and South). Based on this division, Jordan was divided into five zones (based on the dominant land use): the Jordan Valley, the North Uplands, the Middle Uplands, the South Uplands and the Badia. This information was merged using GIS, along with a map of rainfall isohyets, to produce a map with 498 polygons. Each of these was given a unique ID, a land management unit identifier and was characterized in terms of its dominant soil type. Historical land use data, current land use and future land use change scenarios were also assembled, forming major inputs of the modelling system. The GEFSOC Modelling System was then run to produce C stocks in Jordan for the years 1990, 2000 and 2030. The results were compared with conventional methods of estimating carbon stocks, such as the mapping based SOTER method. The results of these comparisons showed that the model runs are acceptable, taking into consideration the limited availability of long-term experimental soil data that can be used to validate them. The main findings of this research show that between 2000 and 2030, SOC may increase in heavily used areas under irrigation and will likely decrease in grazed rangelands that cover most of Jordan giving an overall decrease in total SOC over time if the land is indeed used under the estimated forms of land use.";"Al-Adamat, R.

This study assessed the impact of enclosure age and enclosure management on the vegetation composition in the Njemps Flats range unit, Lake Baringo Basin (Kenya). Six communal enclosures (13-23 years since establishment) and six private enclosures (3-17 years since establishment) were selected. Point-line transect and quadrat-based measurements were made of herbaceous cover, functional group relative abundance and standing crop inside the enclosures and in the adjacent open rangeland. Unpalatable forbs and sedges dominated the herbaceous vegetation of the degraded open rangeland. Informal semi-private land ownership reduced open rangeland degradation as shown by a higher cover of surviving annual grasses. Rangeland enclosure fostered regeneration of annual and perennial grasses, and significantly increased grass cover and standing crop. Private and communal enclosure management were equally successful in rehabilitating grass cover. Standing crop in the communal enclosures was fully recovered, but it was sub-optimal in all private enclosures reflecting recent grazing or grass cutting activities. The variability in rehabilitation success highlights the high potential of individual herders’ incentives to promote rangeland rehabilitation but also stresses the importance of more detailed characterisation and monitoring of the enclosure management decisions.";"Verdoodt, A.

"AGRIS:US201600090105";"Genetically Modified Organisms: Rights To Use Commodity Names and the Lemons Problem";"";"Genetically modified crops have met some consumer opposition domestically and abroad. This opposition has resulted in variety market and policy reactions with a large potential to disrupt trade and to become a focus of international negotiations. In this paper we consider the spillover from adopters to the non-adopters and non-consumers of GM technology. In the absence of any (organizational) transaction costs the assignment of property right to use the name corn will result in Pareto improving decisions with respect to the introduction of GM technology. However, in the presence of transaction costs the ability to use generic crop names such as corn, the adopters of GM technology have the implicit right and will impose costs on participants in the non-GM marketing channel, by creating a lemons problem. This assignment of property rights can result in the commercial introduction of GM despite potential losses in overall social welfare. If the property rights are reassigned such that the innovators are forced to segregate their GM products through labeling laws, this preempts welfare decreasing technology introduction. The relative efficiency of either allocation of property rights depends on the cost savings, rate of adoption, segregation costs, and consumers preference for the GM crop in question. This suggests that assignment of property rights may be more effective if done on a case-by-case basis rather than a one size fits all policy.";"Gray, Richard

"AGRIS:US201600090104";"GMOs: Prospects for Productivity Increases in Developing Countries";"";"There are two mechanisms by which modern genetically modified organism (GMO) products can affect productivity in developing countries. The first is the Genes for Rent mechanism where a recipient country agrees with a GMO company to incorporate a GMO product (e.g., a Bt gene in cotton varieties) and pay a technology fee. The second is the Transgenic Breeding mechanism in which National Agricultural Research System (NARS) breeders use modern biotech methods marker-aided breeding, genetic maps, and genomics research to produce GMO traits of economic value in crop varieties. The first mechanism requires little skill on the part of the recipient country (the GMO supplier will incorporate the gene into a number of varieties). But these GMO products are of little value in traditional crop varieties. Few countries have the Intellectual Property Rights or regulatory regimes at present to support this mechanism. The second mechanism is very demanding of skills by NARS breeders. Only a few NARS programs (notably China, India, Brazil, Argentina, and a few other countries) are investing in these skills. The promise of GMO-based productivity gains in developing countries is thus constrained. Only a few countries are positioned to pursue both mechanisms.";"Evenson, Robert E.";"";"De Gruyter";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"IND;BRA;CHN;ARG";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600090104";"http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1542-0485.1056";"";"";"";""

The case study adds empirical content to basic transaction costs concepts by analyzing the design and implementation of a contractual arrangement between a pollutee a bottler of mineral water Vittel and several polluting farmers. We analyze the bargaining between land and water rights owners and the bottler Vittel to determine how transaction cost issues (valuation disputes, bi-lateral monopoly conditions, and third-party effects) were overcome and how they succeeded in contracting for environmental property rights. We provide several comparisons of the Vittel case with other similar cases, leading to generalizations and testable propositions for environmental rights negotiations.";"Depres, Christophe

Logistic spread is assumed with the maximum area that could be invaded (772,080 ha) determined by constraining a climate niche model for the weed to susceptible farm system types within productive land use capability classes. The current size of the invaded area (80 ha) was determined by field observations in Canterbury in 2008, and the spread rate (201 years to 90% saturation) was derived from observations in the adjacent Marlborough region. With these assumptions, and discounting at 8% per year over 100 years, the net benefit is negative NZ$173,178 ($83,900–$257,078) and containment would not be economically worthwhile. However, the net benefit is positive over a range of lower discount rates and higher spread rates, revealing a need for robust estimates of these parameters. The model presented here provides a generic blueprint for meeting the requirements of the Biosecurity Act with respect to evaluating proposed regional weed management programmes.";"Bourdôt, G

"AGRIS:US201400064687";"Soil degradation in Kabd area, southwestern Kuwait City";"";"Adverse environmental impacts of human activities are the main causes of soil degradation in the desert of Kuwait in general, and in Kabd area in particular. In this study, assessment of soil degradation in open and protected sites has been carried out using field measurements and laboratory investigations. The overall status of vegetation is nearly twice as low in vegetation cover in the open sites than in the protected ones due to overgrazing and off-road transport. Compaction of soil due to pressure exerted on the soil by vehicles led to a significant reduction in its porosity, permeability and infiltration capacity. The average infiltration rate of the compacted soils is 51 per cent lower than that of the non-compacted soils. The bulk density of the non-compacted soils is 3.4 per cent lower than that of compacted soil. The average topsoil resistance of compacted soils has increased by 83 per cent in comparison with non-compacted soil. Using the least squares method a relation between infiltration rate (IR) and penetration resistance (PR) of the topsoil for the study areas is found (i.e. IR=−0.148 PR+1.85 with R(2)=25 per cent). Soil strength within the soil profile shows maximum penetration resistance readings at 11.5 cm depth in average in compacted soils, while it shows maximum readings at 34.6 cm depth in average in non-compacted soils. The adverse changes in the chemical properties due to soil compaction is also investigated. A restoration plan is needed in order to reduce land degradation.";"Misak, R.F.

Information was obtained from a household survey and group discussions conducted during April to September 1999. The severity of soil erosion from farmers' perspectives, density of landslides, soil nutrient balance and change in crop yield have been adopted as indicators of the status of the land. Results of the analysis indicate that land resources in both watersheds are undergoing degradation, though the causes and extent of degradation vary from one type of land to another. Upland crop terraces, locally called bari, are undergoing degradation most seriously under the combined influence of severe soil erosion, landslide and the depletion of soil nutrients. In particular, soil erosion has severely affected nearly half of the upland crop terraces in both watersheds due to a number of natural and anthropogenic factors ranging from weak geological structure to arable agriculture. Landslide and nutrient depletion have affected all types of farmlands except homesteads in both watersheds. Overall, the extent and intensity of land degradation is relatively high in the non-project area, as farmers were not provided with necessary technical and financial support. A broad strategy has been outlined for effective conservation of farmlands.";"Thapa, G.B.

"AGRIS:US201400064680";"Soil carbon sequestration in China through agricultural intensification, and restoration of degraded and desertified ecosystems";"";"The industrial emission of carbon (C) in China in 2000 was about 1 Pg yr 1, which may surpass that of the United States (1.84 Pg C) by 2020. China’s large land area, similar in size to that of the United States, comprises 124 Mha of cropland, 400 Mha of grazing land and 134 Mha of forestland. Terrestrial C pool of China comprises about 35–60 Pg in the forest and 120–186 Pg in soils. Soil degradation is a major issue affecting 145 Mha by different degradative processes, of which 126 Mha are prone to accelerated soil erosion. Total annual loss by erosion is estimated at 5.5 Pg of soil and 15.9 Tg of soil organic carbon (SOC). Erosion-induced emission of C into the atmosphere may be 32–64 Tg yr 1. The SOC pool progressively declined from the 1930s to 1980s in soils of northern China and slightly increased in those of southern China because of change in land use. Management practices that lead to depletion of the SOC stock are cultivation of upland soils, negative nutrient balance in cropland, residue removal, and soil degradation by accelerated soil erosion and salinization and the like. Agricultural practices that enhance the SOC stock include conversion of upland to rice paddies, integrated nutrient management based on liberal use of biosolids and compost, crop rotations that return large quantities of biomass, and conservation-effective systems. Adoption of recommended management practices can increase SOC concentration in puddled soil, red soil, loess soils, and salt-affected soils. In addition, soil restoration has a potential to sequester SOC. Total potential of soil C sequestration in China is 105–198 Tg C yr 1 of SOC and 7–138 TgC yr 1 for soil inorganic carbon (SIC). The accumulative potential of soil C sequestration of 11 Pg at an average rate of 224 Tg yr 1 may be realized by 2050. Soil C sequestration potential can offset about 20 per cent of the annual industrial emissions in China.";"Lal, R.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"grazing lands";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"USA;CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400064680";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.531";"";"";"";"469-478"
"AGRIS:US201400064689";"Microtopography as a factor in the degradation of Vertisols in central India";"";"Earlier studies on soil degradation in Vertisols of the Purna Valley of central India indicated that the semiarid climate characterized by a mean annual rainfall (MAR) of 875mm and a tropustic moisture regime is responsible for the development of calcareous sodic soils. Recent observations, however, indicate that in the adjacent east upland of the Purna Valley, namely in the Pedhi Watershed, Vertisols have drainage problems, although the area receives a higher MAR than the Purna Valley, the total MAR being 975mm. The Pedhi Watershed covers an area of 44321ha, and is characterized by a tropustic moisture regime and a hyperthermic temperature regime. Vertisols of the Pedhi Watershed are deep, calcareous, clayey and very dark greyish-brown to dark yellowish-brown in colour. Vertisols occur on both microhigh (MH) and microlow (ML) positions. The distance between the MH and ML positions is approximately 6 km and the elevation difference is 0.5–5 m. Cracks > 1 cm wide extend down to the slickenside zones in soils of ML whereas they cut these zones in some soils in MH positions. The soils of the MH positions are strongly alkaline and those of ML are mildly alkaline. The present study attempts to relate the distinctly different morphological and chemical properties of Vertisols in the MH and ML positions to pinpoint the prime factor responsible for the impairment of drainage on the basis of physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological data. These data were obtained from 13 Vertisol pedons of methodically selected sites in the Pedhi Watershed. Despite their similar coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE), volumetric shrinkage potential (VSP), clay contents and amounts of fine smectite clay, the plasmic fabric of the slickenside horizons in soils of ML is porostriated, whereas in soils of MH it is stipple speckled to mosaic speckled, indicating weak plasma separation. The soils have both pedogenic and non-pedogenic calcium carbonates (CaCO3). The semiarid climate induces the precipitation of CaCO3 with a concomitant development of subsoil sodicity. The degree of development of sodicity (Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) ≥ 5) is more in soils of MH as evidenced by the higher amount of pedogenic CaCO3 (PC). The lack of water in soils of MH position is the reason for weak swelling of smectite, for larger amounts of PC, for higher alkalinity and sodicity, and for cracks cutting through the slickenside zones. Formation of sodic Vertisols in MH alongside non-sodic Vertisols in ML positions is a unique phenomenon. It develops because of microtopographic differences which modify distribution of water across the landscape and facilitate greater penetration of rainwater in ML positions. The development of sodicity due to microtopographic differences assumes a great importance when a future land resource management programme on Vertisols in the higher MAR zone of overall a semiarid climate is considered.";"Vaidya, P.H.

"AGRIS:US201400155170";"effective approach for land-cover classification from airborne lidar fused with co-registered data";"";"Airborne lidar provides accurate height information of objects on the earth and has been recognized as a reliable and accurate surveying tool in many applications. In particular, lidar data offer vital and significant features for urban land-cover classification, which is an important task in urban land-use studies. In this article, we present an effective approach in which lidar data fused with its co-registered images (i.e. aerial colour images containing red, green and blue (RGB) bands and near-infrared (NIR) images) and other derived features are used effectively for accurate urban land-cover classification. The proposed approach begins with an initial classification performed by the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence with a specifically designed basic probability assignment function. It outputs two results, i.e. the initial classification and pseudo-training samples, which are selected automatically according to the combined probability masses. Second, a support vector machine (SVM)-based probability estimator is adopted to compute the class conditional probability (CCP) for each pixel from the pseudo-training samples. Finally, a Markov random field (MRF) model is established to combine spatial contextual information into the classification. In this stage, the initial classification result and the CCP are exploited. An efficient belief propagation (EBP) algorithm is developed to search for the global minimum-energy solution for the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-MRF framework in which three techniques are developed to speed up the standard belief propagation (BP) algorithm. Lidar and its co-registered data acquired by Toposys Falcon II are used in performance tests. The experimental results prove that fusing the height data and optical images is particularly suited for urban land-cover classification. There is no training sample needed in the proposed approach, and the computational cost is relatively low. An average classification accuracy of 93.63% is achieved.";"Cao, Yang

Differentiation between permeable and impermeable land, for instance, provides data for surface run-off estimates and flood prevention, whereas identification of vegetated areas enables studies of urban micro-climates. In place of maps, high-resolution images, such as those from the satellites IKONOS II, Quickbird, Orbview and WorldView II, can be used after processing. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a well-established method for classifying high-resolution images of urban areas. Despite the large number of previous studies of OBIA in the context of intra-urban analysis, there are many issues in this area that are still open to discussion and resolution. Intra-urban analysis using OBIA can be lengthy and complex because of the processing difficulties related to image segmentation, the large number of object attributes to be resolved and the many different methods needed to classify various image objects. To overcome these issues, we performed an experiment consisting of land-cover mapping based on an OBIA approach using an IKONOS II image of a southern sector of São José dos Campos city (covering an area of 12 km² with 50 neighbourhoods), which is located in São Paulo State in south-eastern Brazil. This area contains various occupation and land-use patterns, and it therefore contains a wide range of intra-urban targets. To generate the land-cover map, we proposed an OBIA-based processing framework that combines multi-resolution segmentation, data mining and hierarchical network techniques. The intra-urban land-cover map was then evaluated through an object-based error matrix, and classification accuracy indices were obtained. The final classification, with 11 classes, achieved a global accuracy of 71.91%.";"de Pinho, Carolina Moutinho Duque

"AGRIS:US201301926340";"Effects of input management and crop diversity on non-renewable energy use efficiency of cropping systems in the Canadian Prairie";"";"Although producers' prime objective may be to increase net returns, many are also interested in conserving and enhancing the quality the soil, water and air resources through adopting more environmentally friendly production practices. This study compared non-renewable energy inputs, energy output, and energy use efficiency of nine dryland cropping systems comprised of a factorial combination of three methods of input management [high (HIGH), i.e., conventional tillage plus full recommended rates of fertilizer and pesticides; reduced (RED), i.e., conservation tillage plus reduced rates of fertilizer and pesticides; and organic (ORG), i.e., conventional tillage plus N-fixing legumes and non-chemical means of weed and pest control]; and three crop rotation systems with varying levels of cropping diversity [a fallow-based rotation with low crop diversity (LOW); a diversified rotation using annual cereal, oilseed and pulse grains (DAG); and a diversified rotation using annual grains and perennial forages (DAP)]. The study was conducted over the 1996-2007 period on a Dark Brown Chernozemic soil (Typic Boroll) in the Canadian Prairies. As expected, total direct plus indirect energy input was the highest for the HIGH and RED input treatments (3773MJha⁻¹ year⁻¹), and 50% less for ORG management. Most of the energy savings came from the non-use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides in the ORG management treatments. Further, total energy use was the highest for the DAG treatments (3572MJha⁻¹ year⁻¹), and similar but about 18% lower for the DAP and LOW crop diversity treatments compared to DAG. Thus, overall, the HIGH/DAG and RED/DAG systems had the highest energy requirements (4409MJha⁻¹ year⁻¹) and ORG/DAP had the lowest (1806MJha⁻¹ year⁻¹). Energy output (calorimetric energy content) was typically the highest for the HIGH input treatments (26,541MJha⁻¹ year⁻¹), was about 4% less with RED, and 37% less with ORG management. The latter reflected the lower crop yields obtained with organic management. Similarly, energy output was the highest for the DAP treatments (25,008MJha⁻¹ year⁻¹), about 5% less for DAG, and 20% less for the LOW crop diversity treatments. The higher energy output with the DAP treatments largely reflected that the entire harvested biomass of the forage crops was included in energy output, while for grain crops only the seed was included. The straw and crop residues from annual crops were returned to the land to protect the soil from erosion and to maintain soil organic matter as this is the recommended practice in this semi-arid region. In contrast to energy output and to net energy produced, energy use efficiency (measured as yield of grain plus forage produced per unit of energy input or as energy output/energy input ratio) was the highest for the ORG input treatments (497kg of harvested production GJ⁻¹ of energy input, and an energy output/energy input ratio of 8.8). We obtained lower, but generally similar energy use efficiency for the HIGH and RED input treatments (392kgGJ⁻¹ and ratio of 7.1). Thus, overall, ORG/DAP was the most energy efficient cropping system, while RED/LOW and RED/DAG generally ranked the lowest in energy use efficiency. Our findings support the current movement of producers toward ORG management as a means of reducing the reliance on non-renewable energy inputs and improving overall energy use efficiency of their cropping systems. Our results also suggest that moving away from traditional monoculture cereal rotations that employ frequent summer fallowing, toward extended and diversified crop rotations that use reduced tillage methods, although resulting in an increase in energy output, will not significantly reduce the overall reliance on non-renewable energy inputs, nor enhance energy use efficiency, unless perennial legume forages and/or legume grain crops are included in the cropping mix.";"Zentner, R.P.

The water quality data described for a given site are generally complete for a given period of record; however, not all sites were monitored continuously and were not necessarily analyzed for the same water quality parameters.

In every site, potted plants of five clones of A. halimus were compared for biomass production as measured by linear growth of plants (central axis and secondary shoots), as well as by dry weight of leaves, shoots and roots per plant. Correlations between sums of hour-degrees under or above the thresholds of critical air temperatures, comprised between 0 and 35 °C, and the plant growth indicators were analysed. Differences among the five clones, with regard to the influence of low temperatures on plant growth and on the biomass production were evaluated. Among five tested clones, GIO1 and SAN3 resulted more sensitive to low temperatures. Clones MAR1, PAL1 and FAN3 resulted less sensitive to low temperatures and in the site characterized by the lowest minimum temperatures also have shown greater adaptability and thus biomass growth in the observed period. The clone PAL1 showed a lower shoot/root biomass ratio as adaptation to cold temperature, and the clone FAN3, the opposite behaviour and a general preference to temperate thermal regimes.";"Dessena, Leonarda

"AGRIS:US201500084514";"Estimating Spatial Variability in Atmospheric Properties over Remotely Sensed Land Surface Conditions";"";"This paper investigates the spatial relationships between surface fluxes and near-surface atmospheric properties (AP), and the potential errors in flux estimation due to homogeneous atmospheric inputs over heterogeneous landscapes. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model is coupled to a surface energy balance scheme with remotely sensed surface temperature Ts as a key boundary condition. Simulations were performed for different agricultural regions having major contrasts in Ts, canopy cover, and surface rough- ness z0 between vegetated/irrigated and bare soil areas. If AP from a single weather station in a nonrep- resentative location within the landscape are applied uniformly over the domain, significant differences in surface flux estimation with respect to the LES output are observed. The spatial correlations of AP with the fluxes, the land cover properties, and surface states were examined and the spatial scaling of these fields is analyzed using a two-dimensional wavelet technique. The results indicate a significant local correlation of the spatial distributions of the air temperature Ta with the sensible heat flux H , the specific humidity q with the latent heat flux LE, and the wind speed U with z0. These relationships can be described by a general linear form, suggesting that a simple regression relation may be applicable for most agricultural landscapes to estimate spatially variable AP fields. A simple yet practical method is proposed using remotely sensed observations and the land surface scheme, based on general linear expressions derived between Ta and H, q and LE, and U and z0. The method is shown to reproduce the main spatial patterns of AP and to reduce potential errors in local and regionally averaged heat flux estimation. This approach is recommended when only local weather station observations are available.";"Bertoldi, Giacomo

"AGRIS:US201500084515";"Evaluating Source Area Contributions from Aircraft Flux Measurements Over Heterogeneous Land Using Large-Eddy Simulation";"";"The estimation of spatial patterns in surface fluxes from aircraft observations poses several challenges in the presence of heterogeneous land cover. In particular, the effects of turbulence on scalar transport and the different behaviour of passive (e.g. water vapour) versus active (e.g. temperature) scalars may lead to large uncertainties in the source area/flux- footprint estimation for sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat-flux fields. This study uses large- eddy simulation (LES) of the land–atmosphere interactions to investigate the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) processes that are likely to create differences in airborne-estimated H and LE footprints. We focus on 32 m altitude aircraft flux observations collected over a study site in central Oklahoma during the Southern Great Plains experiment in 1997 (SGP97). Comparison between the aircraft data and traditional model estimates provide evidence of a difference in source area for turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes. The LES produces reasonable representations of the observed fluxes, and hence provides credible evidence and explanation of the observed differences in the H and LE footprints. Those differences can be quantified by analyzing the change in the sign of the spatial correlation of the H and LE fields provided by the LES model as a function of height. Dry patterns in relatively moist surroundings are able to generate strong, but localized, sensible heating. However, whereas H at the aircraft altitude is still in phase with the surface, LE presents a more complicated connection to the surface as the dry updrafts force a convergence of the surrounding moist air. Both the observational and LES model evidence support the concept that under strongly advective conditions, H and LE measured at the top of the surface layer (≈50 m) can be associated with very different upwind source areas, effectively contradicting surface-layer self-similarity theory for scalars. The results indicate that, under certain environmental con- ditions, footprint models will need to predict differing source area/footprint contributions between active (H) and passive (LE) scalar fluxes by considering land-surface heterogeneity and ABL dynamics.";"Bertoldi, Giacomo

The usual approaches to estimating ET employ remote sensing observations and a surface energy flux model. However, resolution of remote sensing data, needed to observe patterns of biophysical variables, is commonly too coarse (>1 km) to distinguish between land cover types that constrain ET. Accuracy of ET estimates can be improved by using higher- resolution (<100 m) remote sensing data since they can distinguish clusters of vegetation from bare soil fields and water bodies. A demonstration of this potential is shown using aircraft-based remote sensing observations over a study site at El Reno, Oklahoma. Five midday surveys, conducted from 29 June to 2 July 1997, as part of the Southern Great Plains 1997 Experiment (SGP97), collected 12 m resolution images in the visible, near infrared, and thermal infrared. Surface temperature and vegetation density maps, created from these surveys, were combined with surface micrometeorological observations and with a two source energy balance model. Results from El Reno show that flux estimates with respect to ground-based eddy covariance observations can be accurate to within 40 – 80 W/m^2. This means that the high spatial resolution observations can potentially produce ET estimates similar in quality to ground-based point measurements. Additional work, needed to show how high-resolution remote sensing estimates can be related to coarser resolution observations, is underway using the satellite sensors ASTER (15 – 90 m resolution) and MODIS (250 m to 1 km resolution).";"French, Andrew N.

The findings reveal that de-collectivization of pastureland has not necessarily led to direct changes in individual land use strategies. Instead, a wider institutional context influenced by the implementation of a grazing ban has led to more individualized herding and increased short-term considerations of profit maximization in the study area, both of which are seen to undermine the sustainable use of pastureland. Based on our observations of herder responses to privatization, the grazing ban and a short experiment with lifting the grazing ban, we propose that the special characteristics of grassland and pastoralism call for institutions that facilitate locally originated pasture land use practice (e.g., co-operative herding, self-organized management) instead of exclusive reliance on a rigidly defined private property regime focused on fixed property boundaries.";"Yu, Lu

This study investigates the relationship between dynamic common property regimes and deforestation in the wake of policy reform among eight ejidos in southeastern Mexico. Using institutional analyses, land use/land cover change (LULCC) analyses and a Forest Dependency Index, we examine how land tenure arrangements relate to land use and forest cover change patterns. We demonstrate that informally privatized ejidos had larger individual landholdings, more land in use, and higher rates of deforestation. Commonly-held ejidos exhibited lower deforestation rates and, in some cases, forests provided economic benefits via community forest management. However, forest dependency did not correlate with low deforestation rates, suggesting alternative pathways for conservation.";"DiGiano, Maria

In this study we examine how Water User Associations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia perceive water scarcity and the relationship between this perception and observed climate, land use, and demographic changes. Results demonstrate a complex relationship between perceptions and observed changes. On the one hand, observed changes in land cover match perceptions of deforestation as the primary cause of increasing water scarcity. On the other hand, perceptions of climate driven changes in water availability are not reflected in observed precipitation data. Furthermore, water scarcity was perceived in regions where seasonal rainfall variability is higher but not in regions where annual rainfall is lower. We discuss how these results contribute to our understanding of adaptation to climate change and the implications of possible mismatches between environmental changes and local perceptions.";"Murtinho, Felipe

"AGRIS:US201301957563";"Influence of tillage on maize yield in soil with shallow fragipan";"";"A genuine concern for landowners and other stake holders is whether conservation tillage contaminates shallow groundwater even though it greatly reduces erosion. A six-year continuous maize (Zea mays L.) study that compared yields from no-tillage (NT), reduced-tillage (RT), and conventional-tillage (CT) was conducted in the upland hills of northern Mississippi on 4–6% sloping soils overlying a shallow fragipan. The objective was to test the hypothesis that neither no-tillage nor reduced-tillage has the same effect on maize crop as conventional-tillage on soils with a shallow water restricted layer. The study showed conservation tillage had fewer detrimental effects on the water quality in runoff and shallow groundwater and promoted more soil water for crop use during the growing season than conventional tillage. With adequate weed control, NT produced higher yields than CT on these silt loam soils due to soil water conservation. However, inadequate weed control occurred in several years of the study along with above normal rain resulting in lower NT maize yields than CT yields. Significant differences in maize yield were found for type of tillage, year, and tillage-year interaction. These differences were explained by a tillage system's ability to conserve soil water and control weeds. Other results included low sediment amounts lost from NT maize plots and insignificant free water quantities at the fragipan's surface during the cropping season for all tillage systems. Maximum groundwater movement across the surface of the fragipan occurred during the non-cropping season under soil profile saturation. Amount, timing, and distribution of rainfall rather than tillage system primarily influenced agrichemical movement from maize systems in this study. Some form of conservation tillage that decreases or prevents erosion will be required on sloping lands with shallow fragipan to sustain long term continuous corn production.

We deal with urban commons in relation to urban green-space management, referring to them as urban green commons. Applying a property-rights analytic perspective, we synthesize information on urban green commons from three case-study regions in Sweden, Germany, and South Africa, and elaborate on their role for biodiversity conservation in urban settings, with a focus on business sites. Cases cover both formally established types of urban green commons and bottom-up emerged community-managed habitats. As our review demonstrates, the right to actively manage urban green space is a key characteristic of urban green commons whether ownership to land is in the private, public, the club realm domain, or constitutes a hybrid of these. We discuss the important linkages among urban common property systems, social–ecological learning, and management of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Several benefits can be associated with urban green commons, such as a reduction of costs for ecosystem management and as designs for reconnecting city-inhabitants to the biosphere. The emergence of urban green commons appears closely linked to dealing with societal crises and for reorganizing cities; hence, they play a key role in transforming cities toward more socially and ecologically benign environments. While a range of political questions circumscribe the feasibility of urban green commons, we discuss their usefulness in management of different types of urban habitats, their political justification and limitation, their potential for improved biodiversity conservation, and conditions for their emergence. We conclude by postulating some general policy advice.";"Colding, Johan

There is limited evidence that green or natural environments are positive for physical and mental health and wellbeing. We present a new and unique primary research study exploring the relationship between momentary subjective wellbeing (SWB) and individuals’ immediate environment within the UK. We developed and applied an innovative data collection tool: a smartphone app that signals participants at random moments, presenting a brief questionnaire while using satellite positioning (GPS) to determine geographical coordinates. We used this to collect over one million responses from more than 20,000 participants. Associating GPS response locations with objective spatial data, we estimate a model relating land cover to SWB using only the within-individual variation, while controlling for weather, daylight, activity, companionship, location type, time, day, and any response trend. On average, study participants are significantly and substantially happier outdoors in all green or natural habitat types than they are in urban environments. These findings are robust to a number of alternative models and model specifications. This study provides a new line of evidence on links between nature and wellbeing, strengthening existing evidence of a positive relationship between SWB and exposure to green or natural environments in daily life.

"AGRIS:US201400144052";"Using combined AHP–genetic algorithm in artificial groundwater recharge site selection of Gareh Bygone Plain, Iran";"";"Flood spreading is one of the suitable strategies to control and benefit from floods which in turn improve the groundwater recharge, makes soil more fertile, and increases nutrients in soil. It is also a method for reusing sediment, which is usually wasted. Thus, selection of suitable areas for flood spreading and directing the flood water into permeable formations are amongst the most effective strategies in flood spreading projects. Having combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP) of multi-criteria decision analysis and genetic algorithm (GA) of artificial intelligence approaches, this paper addresses the problem of finding the most suitable area location for flood spreading operation in the Gareh Bygone Plain of Iran. To this end, the nine effective geodata layers including slope, alluvium thickness, geology, morphology, electrical conductivity, land use, drainage density, aquifer transmissivity, and elevation were prepared in geographic information system environment. This stage was followed by elimination of the exclusionary areas for flood spreading while determining the potentially suitable ones. Having closely examined the potentially suitable areas using the proposed methodology, the land suitability map for flood spreading was produced. The AHP and GA were used for ranking all the alternatives and weighting the criteria involved, respectively. The results of the study showed that most suitable areas for the artificial groundwater recharge are located in Quaternary Qft ₂ and Qsf geologic units and in morphological units of pediment and Alluvial fans with slopes not exceeding 2� %. Finally, further evidence for the acceptable efficiency of the integrated AHP–GA method in locating most suitable flood spreading areas have been provided by such significant spatial coincidence between the produced map and the control areas located near Kowsar research station, where the earlier flood spreading projects were successfully performed.";"Rahimi, Saeed

The spatial analysis of the real-estate market and, in particular, of the factors which contribute to determining prices, is a very useful instrument in outlining the geography of the economic development of vast areas.The aim of the paper is the construction of a simulation model, on a spatial level, of real-estate values with reference to the housing market in the urban area of the city of Treviso (I). The model was built using a neural network which gives the possibility of analysing the marginal contribution of single real-estate characteristics independently of the a priori choice of the interpolation function; at the same time it works well even in the presence of statistical correlation among the explicative variables, a serious drawback in multiple regression models. The work is divided into several parts.First, a synthetic picture of the real-estate market of the area studied has been drawn up with reference to the main conditioning factors. Then the problem of the selection of a neural network model for the appraisal of property values is presented. Finally, there is the description of the  procedure for the spatialization of obtained results from the neural model for the definition of a values map. The results shows the notable interpretative and predictive capacity of the neural model and it seems very useful in appraisals. Furthermore, the mapping of value fluctuations enables first-hand verification of the ""goodness"" of the assessed model and its capacity to portray the real situation.

The strength of this interaction may however depend on the nutrient status of the mangrove forest. This study related the nutrient status of eight mangrove forests in Phang Nga Bay (Thailand) to the land‐cover distributions in the upstream catchment areas. Nutrient status was assessed using indicators integrating over short (porewater and sediment nutrient composition) and long timespans (mangrove leaves and sesarmid crab tissue characteristics). Using multivariate statistics (PCA analysis), these nutrient status data were then related to the land cover data, which were obtained through the analysis of satellite imagery. Nutrient availability was lowest for mangroves in catchments with large natural vegetation cover and was elevated in catchments with increasing levels of anthropogenic influence. Furthermore, nutrient availability was significantly correlated with several forms of land use, including natural forest, rice paddies, cleared ground and urban areas. While all indicators supported these results, relationships were strongest for long‐term indicators. Information on the relationship between land use in the catchment area and mangrove nutrient status may be important for the effective management of this habitat, as well as adjacent marine systems.

Sandgrouse Pterocles alchata and P. orientalis are threatened in Spain, the stronghold of European populations. Spatial modelling was used to: (1) assess the relative importance of abiotic, anthropogenic and geographical factors in the distribution of both sandgrouse species, (2) determine the most important anthropogenic predictors for each species occurrence, and (3) identify areas where conservation efforts should be prioritized. Abiotic and anthropogenic factors explained most of the variation in sandgrouse distributions. Both species were associated with arid flatlands, arable land cover being the most important anthropogenic variable determining their distribution. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the main driver of agricultural management in Europe, and may thus have a direct effect on sandgrouse distributions. P. orientalis exhibited broader habitat tolerance than P. alchata; the latter species tolerates warmer climates. Consequently, the network of core and marginally suitable areas identified for each species differs, and connectivity between the populations of these areas seems unlikely. Potential future changes in sandgrouse distribution will probably be directed principally by the synergistic effects of climate change and expected land-use transformations resulting from the new CAP and ongoing population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development.";"BENÃTEZ-LÃPEZ, ANA

"AGRIS:US201300852777";"Comparison of Soil Bacterial Communities Under Diverse Agricultural Land Management and Crop Production Practices";"";"The composition and structure of bacterial communities were examined in soil subjected to a range of diverse agricultural land management and crop production practices. Length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) of bacterial DNA extracted from soil was used to generate amplicon profiles that were analyzed with univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Five land management programs were initiated in July 2000: conventional, organic, continuous removal of vegetation (disk fallow), undisturbed (weed fallow), and bahiagrass pasture (Paspalum notatum var Argentine). Similar levels in the diversity of bacterial 16S rDNA amplicons were detected in soil samples collected from organically and conventionally managed plots 3 and 4 years after initiation of land management programs, whereas significantly lower levels of diversity were observed in samples collected from bahiagrass pasture. Differences in diversity were attributed to effects on how the relative abundance of individual amplicons were distributed (evenness) and not on the total numbers of bacterial 16S rDNA amplicons detected (richness). Similar levels of diversity were detected among all land management programs in soil samples collected after successive years of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) cultivation. A different trend was observed after a multivariate examination of the similarities in genetic composition among soil bacterial communities. After 3 years of land management, similarities in genetic composition of soil bacterial communities were observed in plots where disturbance was minimized (bahiagrass and weed fallow). The genetic compositions in plots managed organically were similar to each other and distinct from bacterial communities in other land management programs. After successive years of tomato cultivation and damage from two major hurricanes, only the composition of soil bacterial communities within organically managed plots continued to maintain a high degree of similarity to each other and remain distinct from other bacterial communities. This study reveals the effects of agricultural land management practices on soil bacterial community composition and diversity in a large-scale, long-term replicated study where the effect of soil type on community attributes was removed.";"Wu, Tiehang

"AGRIS:US201500205522";"Meta‐analysis of flow modeling performances—to build a matching system between catchment complexity and model types";"";"Hydrological models play a significant role in modelling river flow for decision making support in water resource management. In the past decades, many researchers have made a great deal of efforts in calibrating and validating various models, with each study being focused on one or two models. As a result, there is a lack of comparative analysis on the performance of those models to guide hydrologists to choose appropriate models for the individual climate and physical conditions. This paper describes a two‐level meta‐analysis to develop a matching system between catchment complexity (based on catchment significant features (CSFs)) and model types. The intention is to use the available CSF information for choosing the most suitable model type for a given catchment. In this study, the CSFs include the elements of climate, soil type, land cover and catchment scale. Specific choices of model types in small and medium catchments are further explored with all CSF information obtained. In particular, it is interesting to find that semi‐distributed models are the most suitable model type for catchments with the area over 3000 km², regardless of other CSFs. The potential methodology for expanding the matching system between catchment complexity and model complexity is discussed. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Zhuo, Lu

Price elasticities are estimated for the size and location of farmland parcels, the amount of road frontage, the existence of panoramic views, and the distance to urban centers.  Estimated elasticities suggest that parcel characteristics have a substantial impact on the cost of preserving farmland.  For example, the per-acre cost of development rights is estimated to be 53 percent higher on farmland parcels that have a panoramic view of water than on parcels that have no water view.  Similarly, the per-acre cost of development rights on a typical 25-acre farm is estimated to be 90 percent higher than on a typical 150-acre farm.  Results suggest that the net social benefits obtained through farmland preservation programs may be enhanced by considering the impact of farmland characteristics on the marginal costs of purchasing development rights, when selecting among a set of candidate farms.";"Wichelns, Dennis

In the last three decades, European Union (EU) agriculture has been characterized by major exit of farming households from agriculture. In some areas the share of exit has been as high as 40%. Similar pattern has also been observed in the United States (US), where the exit rates are about 9-10 percent per year. Understanding the exit behavior is a key to the future farm structure, management of abandoned land, depopulation of rural areas, and agricultural policy, including government program payments. The main objective of this paper is to review the theoretical background and empirically estimate the determinants of exit decisions through a comparative econometric analysis in the US and the EU.

A reliable supply of energy is essential to maintain and to improve human being’s living conditions. The management of energy sources, rational utilization of energy, and renewable energy source usages are vital. Among the renewable energy sources wind energy is currently viewed as one of the most significant, fastest growing, and commercially attractive source to generate electrical energy because of the mature and cost effective energy conversation technology. Developing a utility-scale wind project is a complicated and time-consuming process which involves developers, landowners, utilities, the public and various local authorities. This article discusses the past, the present and the future of wind energy use in Pakistan. The efforts for the utilization of wind energy in the country are presented as well, along with barriers in its development.

A uniform Pan-European land resources database was compiled at the spatial resolution of 1 km2. Suitability and productivity assessments were carried out by matching climate characteristics with plant requirements, calculating annual biomass increments or yields including consideration of soil and terrain characteristics of each grid-cell. Potential biomass productivity and associated energy yields were calculated for each grid-cell. Spatial distributions of suitabilities of biofuel feedstocks in Europe were generated for each individual feedstock as well as for the five biofuel feedstock groups. Estimated agronomical attainable yields, both in terms of biomass (kg ha-1) as well as biofuel energy equivalent (GJ ha-1), were mapped and tabulated by agriculture and pasture land cover classes as derived from the CORINE land cover database.

To facilitate the understanding of the patterns and trends of land-change research, this article uses a content-based text-retrieval approach and self-organizing map to analyse more than 700 peer-reviewed remote-sensing and natural-science papers on land-use/cover change (LUCC) from the past two decades. We present the results in map-like displays and discuss papers within the identified clusters to examine the research activities. A new cluster of research, which has emerged in the last 5 years of analysis, has focused on mixed-pixel issues for land-use/cover mapping, particularly in the context of forest catchments. Studies of LUCC consequences after 2000 have been concerned with the effects of forest conversion on soil-nutrient pools and nitrate cycling. Incorporating information on resolutions and extents into the representations reveals a dominant scale of analysis for some research activities. Analysing time frames of examination in the papers suggests that research on long-term LUCC consequences started to use presettlement land survey records. Few attempts, however, have been made to investigate the uncertainties in the historical sources of information for LUCC research, thereby presenting a future research topic.";"Wang, Yi-Chen

Since the treatment of the topic covers various approaches, areas, and questions, it seems desirable to attempt an overview of the results. This paper devises a way in which to present a complete picture of the land market by drawing together the various contributions. The first step is to establish a method by which a market in its entirety can be defined. It is suggested that the application of Oliver Williamson's ""Four levels of social analysis"" is an appropriate approach to be used in this endeavour. In the second step, the contributions to land market research are reviewed, according to Williamson's scheme, within four broad categories: (1) embeddedness, (2) institutional environment, (3) governance and (4) resource allocation. The topics covered include cropshare tenancy, land titling and registration, communal land ownership, farmland policies, credit access and land reform.

"AGRIS:US201400125782";"role of seed provenance in the early development of Arbutus unedo seedlings under contrasting watering conditions";"";"In the last decades, several studies have reported the increase of land degradation and desertification in the Mediterranean Basin. Depending on degradation severity, ecological restoration might be needed in order to promote ecosystem recovery. The ecology of the selected species and intra specific variability should be considered in order to improve restoration options, especially facing climate change. The present study tested the hypothesis that seedlings from drier provenances would be better adapted to low water content conditions. Seeds were germinated under controlled temperature after which seedlings were grown in a phytotron under two contrasting watering regimes. Seedling performance was analysed using morphological and physiological parameters. Low water content had a clear negative effect on the seedlings’ aboveground biomass (total dry weight, root collar diameter, leaf dry weight and leaf weight ratio) and a positive effect on belowground biomass (root weight and root:shoot ratio). This response was not unequivocal, since provenances differed in morphological adaptations to low water content. Seedlings from the wettest provenance revealed a higher relative growth rate under high water content but a poor adaptation to limited water availability when compared to the other two provenances. This was observed by the absence of a significant belowground investment in this provenance. Seedlings from the wettest provenance also presented a significant reduction of total leaf area that was not observed in the other two provenances. This can however be hardly considered as a successful adaptation to cope with drought since this provenance produced less sclerophyllous leaves, less belowground biomass and also lower sapwood to leaf area ratio independently from the water content conditions. By contrast, seedlings from the dry provenance with the hottest summer had similar root collar diameter, leaf dry weight and physiological performance under both watering regimes. The observed adaptations to water regimes seem to be related with the climate of the seed source and highlighted the importance of seed provenance in ecological restoration actions using Mediterranean species. This knowledge could improve early establishment success predictions for different plant populations, allowing more reliable and cost-effective management decisions under climate change scenarios.";"Vasques, Ana

Herbicides are the main pesticides used in Martinique. A mechanical weed control is therefore necessary, but costly mainly on sloping lands where brush cutter use is the most effective. An alternative method to control weeds with low labour costs is to integrate animals and cover crop plants in the orchard. This integration may be hazardous and has to take into account the damages caused to the trees by the animals. We have chosen an integration of sheep grazing legumes and grass under trees of the Annonaceae family (Annona squamosal, A. reticulate, and A. muricata) because these fruiting trees do not present any appetence to sheep. This is an example of a method to increase the global productivity of land, adding fruit and meat production on a same area. In further studies, we will assess the improvement of durability of this new system, taking into account the reduced labour costs for controlling weeds, the better organic fertilization by sheep dejections, and the flora biodiversity enhancement. However, this system requires a specific skill: the producer must acquire experience on both animal husbandry and orchard management.";"Lacroix, S. de

Recently it has been suggested this means the South (poor countries) are better off suppressing trade with the North, especially trade in natural resource products, since the North has better developed rights to protect its natural resources. Here we show that the suppression of such trade may also impede the development of property rights in the South, but that even taking this into account, trade liberalization need not improve Southern welfare. We find that within a cone of world prices on the boundary of which lies the South's autarky price vector, welfare losses still occur even when local governments in the South make optimal choices to enclose the hinterlands. Corollary to the losses, the South can gain from tariffs or quotas and, within a proper subset of the cone of loss, can suffer when the prices of its exports rise.";"Margolis, Michael

Mississippi forest landowners with over 100 acres (1 acre = 0.404 ha) of forestland were surveyed in 2006 to collect harvest and regeneration data from 1996 to 2006. This study investigated the length of the time interval between harvest and reforestation. Nonparametric duration analysis was used to examine how long nonindustrial private forest landowners waited to reforest after harvesting. Parametric duration analysis was used to examine factors that influenced the length of this period. The mean time elapsed from harvest to regeneration was 11 months for landowners that regenerated their lands. The instantaneous probability of regeneration reached its highest value in the 16th month after harvest and, thereafter, decreased steadily until the 28th month, after which the probability of regeneration was essentially nil. Interest in timber production, employing a consultant, and ownerships that were predominantly pine forest types were factors associated with substantially shorter reforestation times. Lower stumpage prices and higher reforestation costs were associated with substantially longer reforestation times.";"Sun, Xing

"AGRIS:US201300929178";"Revisiting classic water erosion models in drylands: The strong impact of biological soil crusts";"";"Soil erosion and subsequent degradation has been a contributor to societal collapse in the past and is one of the major expressions of desertification in arid regions. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) models soil lost to water erosion as a function of climate erosivity (the degree to which rainfall can result in erosion), topography, soil erodibility, and land use/management. The soil erodibility factor (K) is primarily based upon inherent soil properties (those which change slowly or not at all) such as soil texture and organic matter content, while the cover/management factor (C) is based on several parameters including biological soil crust (BSC) cover. We examined the effect of two more precise indicators of BSC development, chlorophyll a and exopolysaccharides (EPS), upon soil stability, which is closely inversely related to soil loss in an erosion event. To examine the relative influence of these elements of the C factor to the K factor, we conducted our investigation across eight strongly differing soils in the 0.8 million ha Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. We found that within every soil group, chlorophyll a was a moderate to excellent predictor of soil stability (R2 = 0.21-0.75), and consistently better than EPS. Using a simple structural equation model, we explained over half of the variance in soil stability and determined that the direct effect of chlorophyll a was 3x more important than soil group in determining soil stability. Our results suggest that, holding the intensity of erosive forces constant, the acceleration or reduction of soil erosion in arid landscapes will primarily be an outcome of management practices. This is because the factor which is most influential to soil erosion, BSC development, is also among the most manageable, implying that water erosion in drylands has a solution.";"Bowker, Matthew A.

We developed a logical approach based on remote sensing to monitor the conservation status of P. australis beds in response to environmental gradients and orient future management actions in Lake Garda (northern Italy). During the 2010 growing season we collected data on: (i) the structural and functional status of seven P. australis beds and (ii) land cover in a 50-m buffer around each bed, and we tested four different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from a multi-temporal and multisensor dataset. Double hierarchical clustering based on the VI statistics and environmental variables (morphological, functional and land-use) showed a good consistency between the outputs of the vigor-function analysis and the environmental classification of the P. australis beds considered. Overall, the bed’s area was the most influential factor in the data clustering procedures, followed by the descriptors derived from the enhanced vegetation index. Our results confirmed the importance of temporal characteristics of remote sensing data to assess the conservation status of common reed beds and proved the sensitivity of VIs and derived descriptors to local environmental conditions within a homogeneous littoral area. This study supports the utility of remote sensing for monitoring riparian vegetation and analyzing the spatial and temporal response of P. australis populations to human pressure and management actions.";"Villa, Paolo

Legislation and engineering projects in the early twentieth century brought about water impoundment projects and channelization of the Rio Grande which led to the eventual loss of floodplain habitats. In particular, current water management practices in the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) have altered the natural flood regime altering the riparian community and floodplain dynamics which may be causing the demise of many fish species by altering food web processes. The Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus), a federally endangered species, has been classified as an herbivore, detritivore, or carnivore. During low flow conditions H. amarus is primarily an algivore; however, during flood conditions, hydrodynamic scouring reduces or eliminates benthic algal food sources. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize food resources and trophic interactions for H. amarus on a restored floodplain during an extended flood-pulse release from reservoirs using stable isotope analyses (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) and paleolimnology techniques. Results from stable isotope ratios indicate that H. amarus obtained carbon primarily from chironomids while aquatic invertebrates (including chironomids) obtained their carbon from macrophytes. Results from the GLIMMIX procedure indicate that the range of isotopic signatures for prey items was much broader at parallel habitats (i.e. floodplain flow parallel to main stem flow) than perpendicular (i.e. floodplain flow perpendicular to main stem flow) or leeward habitats (i.e. leeward sides of island where flow was near zero) indicating a wider selection of food resources. This study suggests that increased duration of floodplain inundation in the MRG provides vital habitats for spawning, nursery, and recruitment of threatened and endangered fish species.

Delivered cost of biomass was simulated to range from $55.1 to $66.1 per delivered Mg (with freight distance of 48.3 km from plantation to biorefinery) depending on site productivity (without considering land investment) at 6% IRR. When land investment was included in the analysis, delivered biomass cost increased to range from $65.0 to $79.4 per delivered Mg depending on site productivity at 6% IRR. Conversion into cellulosic ethanol might be promising with biomass delivered cost lower than $66 Mg−1.

Chongming Dongtan wetlands, adjacent to Shanghai, the largest city and industrial and trading port in China in rapid urban expansion and socioeconomic development are currently threatened with biodiversity reduction, wetland loss, contamination, and invasion of exotic plant. Sustainable protection and management of Dongtan Nature Reserve necessitate research to develop diagnostic tools and indicators for a comprehensive and objective assessment of wetland ecosystem health condition. Based on the pressure-state-response framework and ecological and environmental surveys at the Dongtan wetlands, an indicator system was established for evaluating the coastal wetlands ecosystem health, using indicators detected from satellite imagery and current field surveys. Through the establishment of health assessment units and spatial quantification of the indicators, the spatial clustering analysis, integrated with remote sensing and geographic information system technique was applied to make an accurate diagnosis of ecosystem health for Chongming Dongtan wetlands and highlight the areas in subhealthy and unhealthy condition and urgent need of conservation and management. The results from this research indicated that the ecosystem health condition at the Dongtan wetlands showed spatial variation, to a certain extent, corresponding to the distributions of elevation and land cover types. More than 75� % of the total study area was at a relatively healthy level, with 34.19� km² for the very healthy zone and 41.08� km² for the healthy zone, while the subhealthy and unhealthy zones covered 18.23 and 4.76� km², respectively. This study demonstrated the potential for this integrated approach to give objective and effective evaluation of ecosystem health for the dynamic coastal and estuarine wetlands and provide up-to-date information to assist with early warning for ecological security and management decisions for Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve.";"Dai, Xiaoyan

"AGRIS:US201500163170";"Ecosystem functional units characterized by satellite observed phenology and productivity gradients: A case study for Europe";"";"The present study demonstrates remote sensing derived phenological and productivity indicators of ecosystem functional dynamism. The indices were derived from SPOT VEGETATION NDVI data on 1km spatial resolution across the pan-European continent using the Phenolo approach. The phenological and productivity indices explained 78% of the variance in the European ecosystem gradient measured by bio-climatic zones. Along this gradient climatic predictors could only explain 57% of the variance in the satellite metrics. Reclassification of the bio-climatic zones into phenology and productivity related ecosystem functional units (EFUs) selected five metrics related to the cyclic and permanent fraction of productivity, to the background, to the growing season start and the timing of the maximum NDVI value. Along the EFU gradient the climatic predictors explained over 90% of the variance of the remote sensing variables, 30% more than along the bio-climatic gradient. The EFUs showed strong correspondence to 14 land-cover types in Europe and the selected remote sensing metrics explained 86% of the variation in the land-cover classes. These results show that remote sensing derived parameters have tremendous potential for the quantification of ecosystem functional dynamism. Phenological and productivity metrics offer an indicator system for ecosystems that climatic indicators alone cannot manifest. Their potential to monitor the spatial pattern, status and inter-annual variability of ecosystems and vegetation cover can deliver reference status information for future assessments of the impacts of human or climate change induced ecosystem changes.";"Ivits, E.

The model is used to evaluate the aggregate economic costs of soilerosion by taking into account economywide linkages between production and consumption,across sectors and agricultural subsectors. To fill a gap in the literature regarding economic costanalysis of soil erosion, this paper also analyzes the poverty implications of land degradation. Themodel predicts that land degradation reduces agricultural income in Ghana by a total of US$4.2billion over the period 2006–2015, which is approximately five percent of total agricultural GDPin these ten years. The effect of soil loss on poverty is also significant at the national level,equivalent to a 5.4 percentage point increase in the poverty rate in 2015 compared to the case ofno soil loss. Moreover, soil loss causes a slowing of poverty reduction over time in the threenorthern regions, which currently have the highest poverty rates in the country.Sustainable land management (SLM) is the key to reducing agricultural soil loss. Thepresent findings indicate that through the adoption of conventional SLM practices, the decliningtrend in land productivity can be reversed, and that use of a combination of conventional andmodern SLM practices would generate an aggregate economic benefit of US$6.4 billion over theperiod 2006–2015. SLM practices would therefore significantly reduce poverty in Ghana,particularly in the three northern regions.";"Diao, Xinshen

"AGRIS:US201301938683";"Impact of Land-Use Change on Ecosystem Services, Biodiversity and Returns to Landowners: A Case Study in the State of Minnesota";"";"Land-use change has a significant impact on the world's ecosystems. Changes in the extent and composition of forests, grasslands, wetlands and other ecosystems have large impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation and returns to landowners. While the change in private returns to landowners due to land-use change can often be measured, changes in the supply and value of ecosystem services and the provision of biodiversity conservation have been harder to quantify. In this paper we use a spatially explicit integrated modeling tool (InVEST) to quantify the changes in ecosystem services, habitat for biodiversity, and returns to landowners from land-use change in Minnesota from 1992 to 2001. We evaluate the impact of actual land-use change and a suite of alternative land-use change scenarios. We find a lack of concordance in the ranking of baseline and alternative land-use scenarios in terms of generation of private returns to landowners and net social benefits (private returns plus ecosystem service value). Returns to landowners are highest in a scenario with large-scale agricultural expansion. This scenario, however, generated the lowest net social benefits across all scenarios considered because of large losses in stored carbon and negative impacts on water quality. Further, this scenario resulted in the largest decline in habitat quality for general terrestrial biodiversity and forest songbirds. Our results illustrate the importance of taking ecosystem services into account in land-use and land-management decision-making and linking such decisions to incentives that accurately reflect social returns.";"Polasky, Stephen

For the majority of surfaces, fluxes were net positive (evasion). Digital land-cover data were combined with representative evasion rates and used to estimate annual Hg⁰ evasion for the GLB (7.7 Mg/yr). This value is less than our estimate of total Hg deposition to the area (15.9 Mg/yr), suggesting the GLB is a net sink for atmospheric Hg. The greatest contributors to annual evasion for the basin are agricultural (∼55%) and forest (∼25%) land cover types, and the open water of the Great Lakes (∼15%). Areal evasion rates were similar across most land cover types (range: 7.0–21.0 μg/m²-yr), with higher rates associated with urban (12.6 μg/m²-yr) and agricultural (21.0 μg/m²-yr) lands.

Programs of monitoring and evaluation must therefore compare restoration progress and effectiveness relative to untreated conditions and to target conditions, particularly with respect to the attributes and functions essential to land use objectives. It is usually not feasible to directly monitor all important forest attributes and functions, so a few indicators must be selected. It is argued that natural recovery (or passive restoration) should always be considered a management option, and that the most appropriate evaluation of restoration techniques is by comparison with untreated areas that have been left for the same period of time as treated areas. Unambiguous evaluation therefore requires all restoration projects to be considered as formal experiments with proper controls, replicates, and the randomized application of treatment options. Adaptation to anticipated levels of climate change can be incorporated by emulating forest compositions and structures currently prevailing elsewhere under analogues of future climates and associated disturbance regimes.

During 2008 and 2009, we investigated the effects of Habitat Improvement Actions (HIAs) and reforestations on populations of common pheasant Phasianus colchicus in order to evaluate the influence of both habitat management strategies on pheasant male density and distribution. We estimated the density of territorial males in four study areas located in the western Po Plain (northern Italy) through the method of crowing cock counts during the breeding season. We analysed the spatial distribution of territorial males in relation to the HIA and reforestation patches comparing points with crowing cocks with random ones. Moreover, we analysed the effects of habitat characteristics including HIAs and reforestations on male pheasant density by multiple regression analyses with theoretic information approach and multimodel inference. Our results showed that both HIAs and reforestations had an important role in determining male distribution. Moreover, HIAs and reforestations were good predictor variables of male pheasant density. We concluded that HIAs and reforestations provide common pheasant with suitable habitats and can represent proper solutions for enhancing habitat diversity and quality in intensive agro-ecosystems.";"Nelli, Luca

Pesticides have been detected in surface waters of rural and urban watersheds raising questions concerning their source, potential environmental effects and a need for strategies to reduce their inputs. Experiments were designed to quantify pesticides transported with runoff from agricultural plots representing fresh market tomato production and turf plots maintained as a golf course fairway to evaluate the efficacy of management practices to mitigate chemical transport from these systems. Reported runoff-to-surface water scenarios were used to extrapolate pesticide loads in runoff to estimated environmental concentrations of pesticides in surface waters receiving the runoff. Surface water concentrations of the pesticides were compared with published toxicity data to assess reductions in the ecological risk associated with implementation of the management practices. Runoff from tomatoes grown on raised beds covered with polyethylene mulch with bare-soil furrows was found to present a greater risk to sensitive aquatic organisms than the vegetative hairy vetch mulch. In the managed turf system, replacing solid tine core cultivation with hollow tine core cultivation reduced surface water concentrations of the pesticides to levels below the median lethal concentration of sensitive aquatic organisms; lessening risk associated with pesticides in runoff from the fairway turf. Our results demonstrate that management practices can enhance the sustainability of intensely managed biotic systems, which provides growers and managers with strategies for improving the retention and efficacy of pesticides at targeted locations while reducing adverse impacts to non-target organisms.";"Rice, Pamela J.

However, our understanding of the hierarchical responses of plant C:N:P stoichiometry at different levels of biological organization to global change factors remains limited. METHODS: we examined the plant C:N:P stoichiometric responses to N deposition and mowing (hay making) at both species- and community-level by carrying out a 4-year field experiment in the temperate steppe of northern China. RESULTS: Our results showed that N addition and mowing resulted in higher plant N concentrations, lower C:N, and higher N:P at both species- and community-level. Mowing had a limited negative influence on the effects of N addition. We observed divergent responses of both plant P concentrations and C:P to N addition at species-level and community-level: N addition led to higher plant P and lower C:P at species-level, but this effect was not observed at the community-level. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that stoichiometric responses at community-level to N addition and mowing diverge from more traditionally examined species-specific responses. Our results suggest that the hierarchical responses of plant stoichiometry to anthropogenic disturbance deserves more attention when we model the interactions of terrestrial ecosystem C, N, and P cycling under scenarios of increasing N availability concomitantly occurring with active land management.";"Han, Xu

"AGRIS:US201400172764";"Piospheres and Pastoralists: Vegetation and Degradation in Steppe Grasslands";"";"The Mongolian plateau in East Asia is part of a new hotspot of land cover change. Recent human activity and natural forces have degraded grasslands in northern China with the southern Mongolia steppe similarly vulnerable. Investigating vegetation patterns at piospheres (the area around water points) can identify herder influence on pasture conditions. Through fieldwork and remote sensing this paper examines plant density and species richness at water sources to establish land cover patterns in two Mongolian provinces where overgrazing is thought to be the major cause of degradation. In contrast to standard piosphere patterns, vegetation was greater near water points and decreased with distance. This suggests that livestock are not concentrated at water points in Mongolia and that piosphere dynamics are more influenced by precipitation, edaphic factors and potential distinctive processes in cold drylands. It implies that pastoralism, with mobile livestock management, is a suitable adaptive strategy to the low forage capacity of steppe grasslands.";"Sternberg, Troy";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"030;CHN;MNG";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400172764";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-012-9539-7";"";"";"";"811-820"

"AGRIS:US201400169051";"Object-based land cover change detection for cross-sensor images";"";"Accurate and timely land cover change detection at regional and global scales is necessary for both natural resource management and global environmental change studies. Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in land cover change detection over the past three decades. The variety of satellites which have been launched for Earth Observation (EO) and the large volume of remotely sensed data archives acquired by different sensors provide a unique opportunity for land cover change detection. This article introduces an object-based land cover change detection approach for cross-sensor images. First, two images acquired by different sensors were stacked together and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the stacked data. Second, based on the Eigen values of the PCA transformation, six principal bands were selected for further image segmentation. Finally, a land cover change detection classification scheme was designed based on the land cover change patterns in the study area. An image–object classification was implemented to generate a land cover change map. The experiment was carried out using images acquired by Landsat 5 TM and IRS-P6 LISS3 over Daqing, China. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the change map were 83.42% and 0.82, respectively. The results indicate that this is a promising approach to produce land cover change maps using cross-sensor images.";"Qin, Y.

Spectral analysis is also used to determine the periodicities of the component loadings. NDVI PCA-1 corresponds to the major vegetation types of Zimbabwe, and we demonstrated that grasslands and dry savannah have the strongest relationship with mean annual precipitation. Furthermore, the March–April loadings showed the highest correlation (r = 0.73) with mean annual precipitation. NDVI PCA-1 sheds some light on the land reform challenge in Zimbabwe. NDVI PCA-2 is highly correlated (r = 0.87) with the mean annual relative variability of the rainfall map indicating a southeast/north mode of anomalies associated with the convectional rainfall-bearing systems over Zimbabwe. NDVI PCA-2 is also highly correlated (r = 0.86) with precipitation PCA-2. NDVI PCA-3 shows a southeast/west mode and is highly correlated (r = 0.87) with precipitation PCA-3. A high correlation (r = 0.66) is also noted between NDVI PCA-4 and the elevation map. Spectral analysis of the PCA loadings revealed several periodicities corresponding to those found in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs).";"Mberego, Seth

Thus, the main goal of this study was to understand: (1) the changes in urban landscape, population, and economic conditions over a 36-year period, and (2) the coupled dynamics of land use policy, landscape structure, major demographic features, and three kinds of industries in one of the most dazzling modern cities of China—the Shenzhen special economic zone (SEZ). The landscape expansion index was used to explore the developed-land expansion under different land use policies while structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationship among three variables (Land Cover Change or LCC, Economy, and Population). We found that the urban expansion during the four periods (1973–1979, 1979–1995, 1995–2003, and 2003–2009) was not always at the expense of urban vegetation cover. The importance of each socioeconomic driver during the four periods was not consistent over time, with policy shifts as the primary driver. Our SEM showed that Economy played a more important role than Population in driving LCC in the Shenzhen SEZ. Meanwhile, the secondary and tertiary industries had a stronger influence than the primary industry; and the floating population had a greater effect than the registered permanent population.";"Tian, Li

"AGRIS:US201400179824";"Impacts of cattle on the South American temperate forests: Challenges for the conservation of the endangered monkey puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana) in Chile";"";"Notwithstanding the increasing cattle activity on the South American temperate forests, its impacts on the forests regeneration are yet poorly understood. We investigated the influence of cattle on the regeneration of monkey puzzle tree (Araucaria), an endangered conifer of the temperate forests of Chile and Argentina, on properties of small landowners and of timber companies. In thirty-six 100×20m plots, we recorded the number of seedlings and saplings from seeds and resprouts, the number of cattle dung pats and the density of parent trees. We used the cattle dung pats as a surrogate of cattle activity (the cattle intensity index, CAI). The regeneration was analyzed as a function of the CAI, land tenure regime, the study site, and the number of parent Araucaria trees. We used likelihood methods and model selection for data analysis. Overall, there was a negative exponential influence of the CAI on all response variables. In small landowner forests, even low cattle intensities caused regeneration to drop rapidly to zero, whereas in plots owned by timber companies regeneration decreased smoothly as the CAI increased. The CAI affected regeneration of Araucaria qualitatively by decreasing the ratio of sexual/asexual regeneration, which may lead to problems of genetic drift in the long-term. Our results suggest that conservation of a single species does not necessarily ensure its long-term persistence. It is necessary to protect the ecosystems in which the species grows and involve local stakeholders in the development of management strategies that reduce the impacts of cattle ranching.";"Zamorano-Elgueta, Carlos

However, the field data available on soil erosion and land degradation processes are limited. Two experimental watersheds were selected within the Kherlen river basin in Mongolia to assess the state and cause of soil erosion; this was done by monitoring the water-sediment discharge in two small catchments with different vegetation covers. The two sites-Kherlenbayan-Ulaan (KBU; 6.9 ha) and Baganuur (BGN; 7.6 ha)-have relative heights of 100 m and 150 m, respectively. In addition, one of the two hillslope plots (50 m x 25 m) established in each area was surrounded by a fence. The overland flow was monitored by Parshall flumes; rainfall, raindrop impact, and soil water suction were also recorded. The amount of sediment yields from the BGN and KBU catchments during the observation period were 0.37 t/ha/years and 0.02 t/ha/years, respectively. The surface runoff percentage and amount of sediment discharge show a good correlation with the raindrop impact energy; however, the peak rainfall shows a poor correlation. These data suggest that raindrop impact plays an important role in water and sediment discharge. The long-term erosion rate estimated by the ¹³⁷Cs inventory is lower in the BGN catchment than the KBU one, suggesting that the high sediment yield in the former might be due to the susceptibility to erosion by recent overgrazing.";"Onda, Y.

This study examined the relationships between landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, and composition of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. Riparian plant diversity, structure, and composition were related to landscape metrics and land use. Species richness was negatively associated with impervious surfaces and landscape diversity, and positively associated with forest cover and largest forest patch index. Shannon species diversity was strongly related to the biomass of non-native species, especially for the regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native and pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense Lour., and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo L. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, unmanaged forest sites had a structurally distinct midstory indicative of reduced disturbance. Urban and agricultural land uses showed decreased native stem densities and signs of overstory tree regeneration failure. Results from this study highlight the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix upon riparian forest plant diversity and structure.";"Burton, Michele L.

"AGRIS:US201400004488";"Photosynthesis and productivity in heterogeneous arctic tundra: consequences for ecosystem function of mixing vegetation types at stand edges";"";"1. Arctic vegetation tends to be spatially heterogeneous and can have large areas of mixed ‘transition zone’ vegetation between stands dominated by a single or few species. If plant photosynthesis and growth within these transition zones differs significantly from main vegetation stands, and if transition zones are not considered when extrapolating stand‐level findings to larger scales in space, then transition zones will provide considerable error to landscape‐level estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP). 2. In a heterogeneous sub‐Arctic tundra landscape, we undertook a detailed assessment of plant and ecosystem photosynthesis and plant growth in stands dominated by the short‐stature evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum, the deciduous dwarf shrub Betula nana, the taller deciduous shrub Salix glauca and also the transition zones between them. 3. Our findings show that plants in transition zones towards taller and more productive vegetation types frequently showed reduced shoot growth, equal or reduced light‐saturated photosynthesis (Pmax) and other typical shade responses (e.g. increased leaf chlorophyll and leaf area per mass) when compared with conspecific plants in main stands where the species is dominant. Critically, whole‐ecosystem GPP per leaf area was 20–40% lower in transition zones than in main vegetation stands as a consequence. A modelling analysis suggests that the under‐productivity of some transition zones results from the lack of a clear ‘winner’ in the competition for light, such that active leaves of some species are shaded by relatively inactive leaves of others. 4. These findings highlight how biotic interactions can considerably influence plant performance to the extent that productivity of mixed vegetation (transition zones) cannot be predicted from their main stands either side. How the consequences of mixing vegetation relate to mechanisms in biodiversity‐function theory is discussed. 5. Synthesis: Our work shows that the productivity of transition zones of arctic vegetation is considerably lower than may be estimated from the main stands on either side. This reduced GPP in transition zones, therefore, must be considered when modelling carbon fluxes at the landscape scale and suggests that the impact of transition zones on ecosystem function needs further investigation in heterogeneous landscapes, where they make up a significant proportion of the land cover.";"Fletcher, Benjamin J.

"AGRIS:US201500200146";"Feedback loops and types of adaptation in the modelling of land-use decisions in an agent-based simulation";"";"A key challenge of land-use modelling for supporting sustainable land management is to understand how environmental feedback that emerges from land-use actions can reshape land-use decisions in the long term. To investigate this issue, we apply the Human–Environment System framework formulated by Scholz (2011) as a conceptual guide to read typical feedback loops in land-use systems. We use an agent-based land-use change model (LUDAS) developed by Le et al. (2008, 2010) to test the sensitivity of long-term land-use dynamics to the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning with respect to different system performance indicators at different levels of aggregation. Simulation experiments were based on a case study that was carried out in the Hong Ha watershed (Vietnam). We specified two model versions that represent two mechanisms of human adaptation in land-use decisions to environmental changes that emerged from land-use actions. The first mechanism includes only primary feedback loop learning, i.e. households adapt to the annual change in socio-ecological conditions and direct environmental response to land-use activities. The second mechanism includes the first one and secondary feedback loop learning, in which households can change their behavioural model in response to changes in socio-ecological conditions at the landscape-community level in the longer term. Spatial-temporal patterns of land-use and interrelated community income changes driven from the two feedback mechanisms are compared in order to evaluate the added value of the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning. The results demonstrate that the effect of the added secondary feedback loop learning on land-use dynamics depends on domain type, time scale, and aggregation level of the impact indicators.";"Le, Quang Bao

A 1.8 m spatial resolution Worldview-2 image was used to perform successive multi-scale segmentations. The pixel standard deviation of an object was used to measure the optimal scale that occurred on the longest, feature unchanged scale range during multi-scale segmentation.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated residential parcel and neighborhood scale variations in urban land surface temperature, land cover, and residents’ perceptions of landscapes and heat illnesses in the subtropical desert city of Phoenix, AZ USA. METHODS: We conducted an airborne imaging campaign that acquired high resolution urban land surface temperature data (7 m/pixel) during the day and night. We performed a geographic overlay of these data with high resolution land cover maps, parcel boundaries, neighborhood boundaries, and a household survey. RESULTS: Land cover composition, including percentages of vegetated, building, and road areas, and values for NDVI, and albedo, was correlated with residential parcel surface temperatures and the effects differed between day and night. Vegetation was more effective at cooling hotter neighborhoods. We found consistencies between heat risk factors in neighborhood environments and residents’ perceptions of these factors. Symptoms of heat-related illness were correlated with parcel scale surface temperature patterns during the daytime but no corresponding relationship was observed with nighttime surface temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Residents’ experiences of heat vulnerability were related to the daytime land surface thermal environment, which is influenced by micro-scale variation in land cover composition. These results provide a first look at parcel-scale causes and consequences of urban surface temperature variation and provide a critically needed perspective on heat vulnerability assessment studies conducted at much coarser scales.";"Jenerette, G.

The studied streams were poor in species; in total, 88 macrophyte taxa were found and the average number of macrophytes per sampling site was 4, ranging from 0 to15. The most frequently occurring macrophytes were filamentous algae (occurrence at 38.6% of sampling sites), followed by Rhynchostegium riparioides (28.4%) and Phalaris arundinacea (19.3%). The strongest environmental gradient in the sampling site detected by factor analysis (factor 1 explains more than 32% variability) is related to the portion of artificial banks, shading by woody vegetation along banks, flexuosity of stream course and the portion of natural land cover in the contact zone of the stream, and can be interpreted as a natural-anthropogenic gradient. The following variables had the highest correlations with species richness of macrophytes: shading by woody vegetation (r=−0.507), portions of artificial bank (r=0.488), flexuosity (r=−0.457) and distance from stream source (r=0.388).";"Hrivnák, Richard

A series of ecological restoration strategies have been implemented to improve grassland service. However, little is known about the effect of these ecological restoration practices on soil carbon and nitrogen storage. In this study, characteristics of vegetation and soil properties under continued grazing and exclusion of livestock for six years due to a nationwide conservation program—‘Returning Grazing Lands to Grasslands (RGLG)’ were examined in semi-arid Hulun Buir grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. The results show that removal of grazing for six years resulted in a significant recovery in vegetation with higher above and below-ground biomass, but a lower soil bulk density and pH value. After six years of grazing exclusion, soil organic C and total N storage increased by 13.9% and 17.1%, respectively, which could be partly explained by decreased loss and increased input of C and N to soil. The effects of grazing exclusion on soil C and N concentration and storage primarily occurred in the upper soil depths. The results indicate that removal of grazing pressure within the RGLG program was an effective restoration approach to control grassland degradation in this region. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the RGLG program and to improve the management strategies for grassland restoration in this area.";"Wu, Xing

This paper provides contextual data and information for the development of PAMs specifically for the buffer zones of protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon, sites where REDD+ has the potential to generate considerable social and ecological co-benefits. The study sites are the buffer zones of two national parks, Yanachaga-Chemillen (YChNP) in central Peru and Manu (MNP) in the south-east. Data were collected through smallholder household surveys (n = 200), covering livelihood strategies, land use practices and preference rankings of five REDD+ criteria. The findings suggest that PAMs in buffer zones could realistically achieve an additional ~10 % conservation of remaining forest and between 25 and 70 % additional reforestation of non-forest areas on private lands. The paper argues that in areas where agricultural co-operatives exist, such as MNP, these should be engaged in national REDD+ PAMs and supported by an international NGO; in areas where smallholders operate individually, such as YChNP, international NGOs may be best placed to gain local trust and thereby raise participation rates. The environmental effectiveness of REDD+ conservation PAMs could be greater in areas of intense agricultural production, yet financial and technical support for reforestation may offer the most effective avenue for carbon mitigation in these areas.";"Scriven, Joel";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"climate change;land use";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"PER";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400168904";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-012-9350-z";"";"";"";"745-765"

"AGRIS:US201500220717";"Associations Between Weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidea) and Plants, and Conservation Values in Two Tussock Grasslands, Otago, New Zealand";"";"Ecosystem level processes and species interactions have become important concepts in conservation and land management. Despite being New Zealand’s greatest contributors to global diversity, native invertebrates have been largely overlooked in the assessment of land values, and their diversity has often been assumed to reflect native plant diversity without justification. Invertebrates can in fact affect plant species composition, and in ecosystems such as New Zealand’s remaining indigenous and semi-modified tussock grasslands can do so in excess of more conspicuous vertebrate grazers. An understanding of the interactions between invertebrates and their plant hosts may be informative in assessing land conservation values, increase the efficiency of rapid inventory analyses and would be applicable across the production-conservation spectrum. This study considers the Curculionoidea, vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen communities of two semi-modified tussock grasslands in the Otago region of southern New Zealand. Quantitative plant and invertebrate sampling were carried out in January 2001. Data were analysed using ANalysis Of SIMilarity (ANOSIM) and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) ordination techniques. Vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species richness was highest in the same site and plots as native weevil species richness, however the proportion of native vegetation in these locations was lower. Associations identified between Curculionoidea and vascular plants were dismissed due to the confounding effect of species frequency across samples. This appeared to have little influence on associations with bryophytes and/or lichens and these were given more weighting. The ecological implications of associations are considered and variability in weevil composition is discussed in reference to the tussock grassland environment. The importance of plant–invertebrate relationships to conservation and the uses and limitations of the PRIMER MDS ordination technique for determining associations are discussed.";"Murray, T. J.

"AGRIS:US201400153756";"Spatial and temporal patterns of range expansion of white‐winged doves in the USA from 1979 to 2007";"";"AIM: The geographical expansion of white‐winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) in North America has attracted the attention of biologists and sportsmen because of their recreational and aesthetic value; however, data on factors driving the spatial spread of this species are lacking. We examined spatial and temporal patterns of range expansion for white‐winged doves along the northern edge of their geographical range from 1979 to 2007 and used a dynamic occupancy model to estimate when and where doves would be found along an expansion gradient. LOCATION: Southern half of the USA. METHODS: We modelled spatial variation in the range expansion of white‐winged doves from 1979 to 2007 using data from the North American Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) and distance from initial population centre, area of urban land cover, and ecoregion. We used a robust design occupancy analysis to estimate species expansion rate based on a model set grounded in broad‐scale conditions likely to drive dove distribution. We evaluated our best fitting model (using Akaike's information criterion adjusted for small sample size) by comparing estimates to actual observations in 1993 and 2007 using area under the curve (AUC) metrics from receiver‐operating characteristic plots. RESULTS: Our spatial distribution model indicated that range expansion of white‐winged doves was primarily influenced by distance from the core population centre, with additive effects of ecoregion and land cover. In 1979, white‐winged doves were present in 12% of survey locations, whereas presence increased to 41% by 2007. Across all ecoregions, urban land cover was positively related to probability of occupancy. We evaluated our model for 1993 and 2007 by comparing derived occupancy estimates to sightings of white‐winged doves within our sample hexagons using BBS survey data. Based on high AUC statistics (>� 0.85), we concluded that our model was useful for accurately predicting range expansion. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Estimating occurrence and range expansion of white‐winged doves and other expanding/invasive avian species at large spatial scales can be effectively conducted using BBS data. Using these nationwide, long‐term survey data to relate expansion to a suite of conditions likely to drive population dynamics is an effective approach to developing predictive models of range expansion.";"Butcher, Jerrod A.

"AGRIS:US201600126136";"Effects of land use and land cover on selected soil quality indicators in the headwater area of the Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia";"";"Understanding changes in soil quality resulting from land use and land management changes is important to design sustainable land management plans or interventions. This study evaluated the influence of land use and land cover (LULC) on key soil quality indicators (SQIs) within a small watershed (Jedeb) in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia. Factor analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine different SQIs. Surface (0–15 cm) soil samples with four replications were collected from five main LULC types in the watershed (i.e., natural woody vegetation, plantation forest, grassland, cultivated land, and barren land) and at two elevation classes (upland and midland), and 13 soil properties were measured for each replicate. A factorial (2 × 5) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed that LULC and altitude together significantly affected organic matter (OM) levels. However, LULC alone significantly affected bulk density and altitude alone significantly affected bulk density, soil acidity, and silt content. Afforestation of barren land with eucalypt trees can significantly increase the soil OM in the midland part but not in the upland part. Soils under grassland had a significantly higher bulk density than did soils under natural woody vegetation indicating that de-vegetation and conversion to grassland could lead to soil compaction. Thus, the historical LULC change in the Jedeb watershed has resulted in the loss of soil OM and increased soil compaction. The study shows that a land use and management system can be monitored if it degrades or maintains or improves the soil using key soil quality indicators.";"Teferi, Ermias

We investigated the processes involved in LULC change (LUCC) in the Dongjiang Watershed, in Southern China, over a 15-year period to gain a better understanding of the causes of the main types of LUCC. Using a depth transition matrix and redundancy analysis (RDA), the major types and causes of LUCC for each LULC type over the past 15 years were identified. LUCC exhibited obvious net change, relatively low persistence, and high swap change. The swap changes in most LULC types were considered as a strong signal of LULC transformations. The driving forces behind swap changes were quantified and identified through RDA. The results showed that all driving forces played important roles in explaining swap changes of LULC, although the relative effects of these drivers varied widely with both LULC type and time period. Swap changes of the LULC types were generally classified into two categories. Some, e.g., built-up land and wetland, were affected mostly by landform and/or distance factors, while others, e.g., grassland and woodland, were modulated mostly by climate and/or socioeconomic factors. Selected spatial driving forces and local land use policies played important roles in explaining the dominant LUCC types, but on different timescales. These findings may improve understanding of the detailed processes involved in LUCC, landscape transformation, and the causes of LUCC in other areas with extensive LUCC and could help managers plan, design, and implement land resource management.";"Gao, Changjun

The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in certain indicators of the physical quality of a dystrophic Red Latosol (Oxisol) under different agricultural uses. The study was conducted in an agricultural area located in northern Paraná State. Dystrophic Red Latosol samples were taken from four sites featuring different types of land use typical of the region: pasture of Brachiaria decumbens (P); sugarcane (CN); annual crops under no-tillage (CAPD); and native forest (permanent conservation area) (control (C)). For each land use, 20 completely randomized, disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm soil layer, to determine soil texture, volume of water-dispersible clay, soil flocculation (FD), particle density, quantity of organic matter (OM), soil bulk density (Ds), soil macroporosity (Ma) and microporosity (Mi), total soil porosity (TSP), mean geometric diameter of soil aggregates (MGD), and penetration resistance (PR). The results showed differences in OM, FD, MGD, Ds, PR, and Ma between the control (soil under forest) and the areas used for agriculture (P, CN and CAPD). The soils of the lowest physical quality were those used for CN and CAPD, although only the former presented a Ma level very close to that representing unfavorable conditions for plant growth. For the purposes of this study, the physical properties studied were found to perform well as indicators of soil quality.

Obter informações sobre os atributos edáficos do solo sob diferentes usos agrícolas é muito importante para o estabelecimento de manejos adequados, visando à sustentabilidade dos diferentes agrossistemas. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a alteração em alguns atributos indicadores da qualidade física de um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico psamíticos, sob diferentes usos agrícolas. O trabalho foi desenvolvido em uma área de produção agrícola localizada na região Norte do Paraná. A amostragem de solo foi realizada em quatro situações de uso do solo utilizadas em propriedades rurais da região: pastagem de Brachiaria decumbens (P); cana-de-açúcar (SC); culturas anuais em plantio direto (ACNT); e mata nativa (área de preservação permanente), sob LVdp (testemunha (C)). Foram coletadas 20 amostras deformadas e indeformadas por uso do solo, de forma inteiramente casualizada, na camada de 0-20 cm, para determinação da textura do solo, argila dispersa em água, grau de floculação do solo (FD), densidade de partículas, matéria orgânica (OM), densidade do solo (Ds), macroporosidade (Ma) e microporosidade (Mi) do solo, volume total de poros (TSP), diâmetro médio geométrico dos agregados de solo (MGD), além da resistência do solo à penetração (PR). Os resultados permitiram concluir que houve diferença de MO, FD, DMG, Ds, RP e Ma entre a testemunha (solo sob mata) e os usos agrícolas do solo estudados (P, SC e ACNT); os solos que apresentaram menor qualidade física foram aqueles sob os usos de SC e ACNT, embora somente o uso do solo com SC tenha apresentado valor de Ma muito próximo ao daqueles que representam condições desfavoráveis ao desenvolvimento das plantas.

This is especially true for Jiantang that is famous for the Napahai, Bitahai and Shudu Lake wetlands. However, continuing development has threatened the wetland ecosystems and the associated biodiversity in these areas. To better document such changes in land use and their effect on the ecosystem, land use was mapped using a time series of satellite images acquired in 1974, 1993, 2000 and 2012. The results of this survey suggest that forest cover first decreased and then increased. The most obvious changes occurred in cultivated and developed land types, each expanding 1.6× and 17.6×, respectively. Population growth, and previous large-scale deforestation, converting cropland to forest and grassland project, and tourism development were the main socio-economic driving forces. It was also apparent that the rapid development of the tourism industry played a key role in the land-use change, especially after 2000. These data suggest that some regulation to the region’s tourism industry and implementation of a sustainable land management policy should be considered to ensure preservation of the Jiantang wetlands.";"Wu, Gang

In addition, a range of approaches to resolving this conflict are being used in different countries with differing levels of success. To study this conflict, an approach based on the Q-method was applied to three European Union Member States, i.e. Ireland, Scotland and Germany to determine the degree to which there are differences in opinion regarding recreational management in coastal conservation areas and to assess whether there are examples of perceived best management practice that could be applied to some or all of these countries. The Q-method involved using semi-structured interviews of stakeholders (conservationists and non-conservationists, i.e. landowners, locals and landusers) to yield a set of statements relating to recreational and management impacts on protected coastal dune systems in each of the selected countries. Selected statements were then submitted to former interviewees for rating on a seven point scale from complete agreement to complete disagreement. Principle components analysis (PCA) of these ratings (Q-sorts) indicated that while there is much agreement overall (particularly relating to the protection of dune systems while still supporting recreation), stakeholder opinion can be separated according to country of origin. In general, this separation is reflected in the intensive recreational management regime (strict zonation and access restrictions) at the German sites compared to the Scottish (less recreational management) and Irish (absence of recreational management) sites. Significant differences in opinion are most apparent in the sections concerned with restricting access for recreation and the provision of facilities (less acceptable in Scotland and Ireland). We suggest that given Irish stakeholder opinions regarding the potential loss of naturalness through strict recreational management, the Scottish rather than the German model would be more suitable in the Irish context.";"Kindermann, Gesche

"AGRIS:US201600191061";"Land abandonment may reduce disturbance and affect the breeding sites of an Endangered amphibian in northern Italy";"";"Although human-related disturbance is usually detrimental for biodiversity, in some instances it can simulate natural processes and benefit certain species. Changes in the disturbance regime, both natural and human-driven, can affect species that rely on it. The Apennine yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata pachypus, an amphibian endemic to peninsular Italy, has declined throughout its range in the last 3 decades. We sought to identify the drivers of the decline in the region of Liguria, at the north-western limit of its distribution. In 2009 and 2010 we surveyed sites where the species occurred until 2005 and related the persistence of breeding activity to the characteristics of sites. Populations had disappeared from 50% of the sites between 2005 and 2009. Current breeding sites have less aquatic and bank vegetation, fewer predators and better insolation. Frequent disturbance events (desiccation and floods) were related to reduced vegetation, which in turn may decrease predator densities and increase insolation. In this region disturbance is provided by natural factors or, in the case of artificial water bodies, by regular maintenance carried out by landowners. The widespread land abandonment in Liguria can disrupt disturbance regimes, interrupting the removal of vegetation, and thus rapidly reduce the suitability of artificial sites. This was confirmed in our study, with most abandoned breeding sites occurring in formerly cultivated areas. Possible short-term conservation actions include creating new ponds, maintaining artificial water bodies and clearing vegetation. However, long-term conservation may be more problematic as the land abandonment process is unlikely to be reversed.";"Canessa, Stefano

Dominant females commonly kill the pups of subordinates and usually evict older female subordinates from the group 1-3 weeks before the birth of the dominant female's litter. The aggression frequency of the dominant female toward subordinates and the submission frequency that each subordinate female showed to the dominant female increased as the age of the subordinate female increased and as the birth of the dominant female's pups approached. Moreover, as birth approached, both of these behaviors intensified more quickly between the dominant female and older subordinates than between the dominant female and younger subordinates. The aggression frequency of the dominant female toward each subordinate female predicted whether that subordinate female was evicted from the group; the submission frequency by each subordinate female predicted the timing of their eviction during the pregnancy period of the dominant female. These results support the idea that conflict between dominant and subordinate females increases with the age of subordinates and, since older subordinate females are most likely to reproduce, suggest that dominant females may less easily control reproductive attempts by older subordinate females.";"Kutsukake, N.

"AGRIS:US201600060074";"spectral gradient difference based approach for land cover change detection";"";"Change detection with remotely sensed imagery plays an important role in land cover mapping, process analysis and dynamic information services. Euclidean distance, correlation and other mathematic metrics between spectral curves have been used to calculate change magnitude in most change detection methods. However, many pseudo changes would also be detected because of inter-class spectral variance, which remains a significant challenge for operational remote sensing applications. In general, different land cover types have their own spectral curves characterized by typical spectral values and shapes. These spectral values are widely used for designing change detection algorithms. However, the shape of spectral curves has not yet been fully considered. This paper proposes to use spectral gradient difference (SGD) to quantitatively describe the spectral shapes and the differences in shape between two spectra. Change magnitude calculated in the new spectral gradient space is used to detect the change/no-change areas. Then, a chain model is employed to represent the SGD pattern both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, the land cover change types are determined by pattern matching with the knowledgebase of reference SGD patterns. The effectiveness of this SGD-based change detection approach was verified by a simulation experiment and a case study of Landsat data. The results indicated that the SGD-based approach was superior to the traditional methods.";"Chen, Jun

There are a range of analytical techniques and data available to estimate these forest parameters, however, not all ‘forest’ is the same and various components of change have been presented. Forest as defined by use and forest as defined by cover are different, although it is common for scientists and policy makers to infer one from the other. We compare and contrast estimates of forest land cover, forest land use, extent and change at policy-relevant scales in the southeastern US. We found that estimates of forest land use extent and forest land cover extent were not significantly correlated.

Competition for quality grazing land by domestic stocks is one of the main factors impacting wild species during this encroachment. In the Kilombero Game Controlled Area (KGCA), extensive livestock husbandry is negatively associated with wildlife populations, especially outside the hunting season. This study assessed the relationship between livestock number and the abundance of three wild species: puku, buffalo and elephant. Spoor transects during the hunting season found the three wild species to be negatively correlated with livestock number. Direct point count surveys, both during and outside the hunting season found cattle and goat to be negatively associated with puku. The results from this study indicate that areas heavily grazed by livestock will be used to a lesser extent by wild populations, and that those areas previously used by wild species will be avoided following livestock encroachment. The protection offered by the KGCA is an ineffective tool for conserving wild large mammal populations, and an alternative conservation status whereby extensive livestock encroachment is prohibited, particularly for the more important grazing sites, is recommended.";"Bonnington, Colin

In Somalia, the risk of soil loss is accelerated by the removal of vegetation, bad land use practices and negative impacts of urbanization. The political upheavals and consequent insecurity in the country are major limitations for detailed database and research in soil loss. This study tested opportunities in pedometrics, remote sensing, limited field data collection and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) to model the risk of soil loss in northwestern Somalia. The approach successfully predicted the risk of soil loss with accuracy of 79 per cent. It also showed that RUSLE is only relatively accurate and stable in identifying areas with low risk of soil loss and therefore is useful in modelling early warning signs of erosion. About 24 per cent of northwestern Somalia was depicted to have no significant human-induced soil loss while 68 per cent of the region is in threat of soil loss if no action is taken against the removal of vegetation, land use practices and policies on land tenure systems. About 8 per cent of the area is at high risk of soil loss due to negative effects of urbanization and lack of proper management of steep slopes. It is anticipated that this approach can be integrated in the assessment of soil erosion in areas with poor database. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Omuto, C.T.

These ecosystems have not been extensively explored in the Tyrrhenian sector of the Italian peninsula, particularly in the Submediterranean climatic region. In order to address this issue and to define the synecology, syndynamics and syntaxonomy of calcareous grasslands in this area, we considered 127 phytosociological relevés. Our sampling was performed in the Lazio region according to a stratified sampling scheme based on homogeneous land units, defined by means of an ecological land classification process. We analyzed the vegetation data using multivariate methods. Two new associations, whose typical aspects occur in the mesotemperate phytoclimatic belt, were identified:Erysimo pseudorhaetici-Dasypyretum villosi (Taenianthero-Aegilopion) and Scorpiuro muricati-Brometum erecti (Phleo-Bromion). Phytoclimatic belts within the Submediterranean region cause a significant degree of differentiation within Scorpiuro-Brometum, which was described at the subassociation and variant levels. The overall relevance of therophytes represents the most important feature distinguishing Scorpiuro-Brometum from the published Bromus erectus associations. At a finer scale, the presence of the two physiognomically different grassland communities is related to different soil types. All these communities are dynamically linked to Quercus virgiliana and Q. pubescens woods, and contribute to the coenological differentiation of the vegetation series related to such woodlands.";"Blasi, C.

We present a new, rule-based method to downscale land-use change scenarios to the landscape level while keeping a large number of land-cover classes (CORINE level 3). The method relies on the interpretation of European scenario storylines, the observation of past land-use changes, high-resolution regional data and expert knowledge. The results give a landscape-level transposition of the scenario storylines which reflects the local conditions. The method has a number of advantages, such as its potential application in dialogues with policy-makers and stakeholders.

Such conditions lead to a reduction in gene flow and genetic diversity, and encourage inbreeding depression. We conducted a study of the reproductive biology and population genetics of Penstemon debilis (Plantaginaceae), a Federally Threatened species endemic to a small region of oil shale extraction in western Colorado, USA. Most of the habitat area is privately owned and undergoing natural gas extraction activities. Penstemon debilis reproduces both vegetatively and as an outcrosser that requires a pollen vector. Moderate levels of inbreeding, but no inbreeding depression, were found within populations of P. debilis. Genetic divergence among the extant populations surveyed was moderate (FST values = 0.069–0.231; Nm = 0.831–3.385) with levels of genetic diversity within populations relatively low compared to congeners with similar modes of pollination and reproductive biology. STRUCTURE analysis revealed three population clusters with some admixture among all extant populations. Genetic diversity within and among P. debilis populations is similar to genetic diversity found for other rare and endemic outcrossing plant species. Our results are consistent with a pattern of recent population fragmentation or low levels of pollen‐mediated gene flow among populations in close proximity to one another. Conservation of P. debilis will require cooperative management strategies between private landowners, government agencies, and concerned NGOs to preserve habitat for this rare species.";"WOLFE, Andrea D.

"AGRIS:US2016202383";"Cooperation, Spatial-Dynamic Externalities, and Invasive Species Management";"";"Most terrestrial biological invasions occur in landscapes comprising numerous, independently managed properties. Thus, control of invasion spread generally depends on the choices of many managers, each deciding the extent to control invasions on their property. Here we develop a spatially-explicit, integrated model of invasion spread and human behavior to examine how people’s control choices under laissez-faire affect patterns of invasion spread and the total costs and damages imposed by an invader. We evaluate how characteristics of the bioeconomic and social system, including the extent of cooperation among managers, affect the divergence between socially optimal and private control efforts. We find that system-wide invasion externalities generally increase with the potential range size of an invader and with marginal damages from invasion and decrease with marginal control costs and with the size of the invasion when it is discovered. As expected, private control decisions tend to under-control the invasion relative to socially optimal control. However, we also find that less extensive cooperation is needed to control invasions whose costs and damages otherwise lead to the largest externalities. This novel finding suggests that even small amounts of cooperation can avoid some of the worst invasion outcomes and coordination of control can provide large social benefits. This research highlights the importance of human behavior for affecting invasion spread and economic outcomes.";"Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca S.

Offsetting is criticized with respect to the amount of gain required to compensate for losses from clearing, the equivalence of losses and gains, the time lag between losses and gains and a poor record of compliance. Despite these criticisms, we conclude that offsetting is a useful policy instrument while governments continue to permit some clearing of native vegetation. However, offsets will only contribute to no net loss if (i) clearing is restricted to vegetation that is simplified enough so that its functions can be restored elsewhere with confidence or clearing is restricted to vegetation that is unlikely to persist and is not practicable to restore irrespective of clearing; (ii) any temporary loss in habitat between clearing and the maturation of an offset, or differences between the habitat lost from clearing and gained through an offset, does not represent significant risk to a species, population or ecosystem process; (iii) there will be gains of sufficient magnitude on the offset site to compensate for losses from clearing; (iv) best practice adaptive management is applied to offsets; (v) offsets are in place for at least the same duration as the impacts from clearing; and (vi) there is adequate compliance.

The forgotten social reformer Ludwig Gall, once known to as the “savoir of the small vintner,” helped to relieve the unreliable dependency of winegrowers on nature by perfecting a deacidification technique which allowed for pleasant wines in any vintage. While Gall's technique became an important part of the road out of impoverishment for many winegrowers in the Mosel River Valley, it had the additional effect of challenging the static nature of the wine trade and the monopolies and economic efficiencies of large landowners. By outlining the initial uses of Gall's technique and the opposition to it, this article reveals the formative debates in the ongoing controversy over the definition of natural wine.

Various ecological landscape variables, such as biological productivity (plant biomass and stock capacity), soil nutrients (organic matter and N content) and water source conservation capacity are identified as landscape function characteristics. A quantitative method and digital model for analyzing evolving landscape functionality in the headwaters areas of the Yangtze River, China were devised. In the period 1986-2000, patch transitions of the region's evolving landscapes have been predominantly characterized by alpine cold swamp meadow, with the highest coverage tending to be steppified meadow or steppe, and desertification landscape such as sand and bare rock land expansion. As the result of such changes, alpine swamp areas decreased by 3.08 x 10³ km² and the alpine cold sparse steppe and bare rock and soil land increased by 6.48 x 10³ km² and 5.82 x 10³ km², respectively. Consequently, the grass biomass production decreased by 2627.15 Gg, of which alpine cold swamp meadows accounted for 55.9% of this loss. The overall stock capacity of the headwaters area of the Yangtze River decreased by 920.64 thousand sheep units, of which 502.02 thousand sheep units decreased in ACS (Alpine cold swamp) meadow transition. Soil organic matter and N contents decreased significantly in most alpine cold meadow and swamp meadow landscape patches. From 1986 to 2000 the total losses of soil organic matter and total N in the entire headwaters region amounted to 150.2 Gkg and 7.67 Gkg. Meanwhile, the landscape soil water capacity declined by 935.9 Mm³, of which 83.9% occurred in the ACS meadow transition. In the headwater area of the Yangtze River, the complex transition of landscape resulted in sharp eco-environmental deterioration. The main indication for these changes involved the intensity of the climate in this region is becoming drier and warmer, resulting in a gradual degradation of the permafrost.";"Wang, Genxu

"AGRIS:US2016207602";"Land Privatization and Livelihood Diversification: An Examination from the Southern Uplands of Vietnam";"";"This paper examines the process of implementing land privatization and its effects on household livelihoods in the Uplands of Vietnam. The research was undertaken with three upland villages situated in the buffer zone of Cat Tien National Park in the southern uplands of Vietnam where have recently been adopted a land privatization program according to the 1993 Land Law and some other frontier development programs, such as nature conservation, remotely mountainous community development programs supported by the central government. Such policies and programs have ultimately aimed at improving both upland livelihoods and environmental sustainability of the uplands, simultaneously. The research demonstrates unequivocally that though the land privatization throughout the nationwide has been guided by the unique legal framework, the implementation of land privatization in the uplands, particularly in the buffer zone communities locating around the protected areas has resulted in the notable divergence across communities, even households. The differences in the result of implementing land privatization in the upland communities were mainly caused by different factors embodied in both land legislation and local practices. Unsurprisingly, the divergence of implementing land privatization among communities and households has actually created differentiation in distributing benefits of land privatization among communities and households. In fact, the empirical findings suggest that land privatization (land titling) served only as initial conditions while households´ initial assets play as the determinants factors which determine how households transfer their land title into material benefits.

In this case study of a regional planning process in a weak mandate state, we find that the regional plan would have produced better land use outcomes, but its impact was severely limited by political conflicts at the county level, a recession that necessitated cuts to non-mandated services, and a lack of state leadership around regional planning. Ultimately, all these factors contributed to the eventual disbandment of the entire regional planning structure in the area.";"Loh, Carolyn G.

Our analysis of MCA in addressing a conflict between state forestry and indigenous Sámi reindeer herding in Upper Lapland, Finland, illustrates MCA's potential in promoting open discussion about policy alternatives and their consequences, and also its limitations in highly controversial policy processes. The key features of the MCA process that served to open up policy discourse were the plural and conditional conclusions, which illustrated the diversity of viewpoints bearing on the Upper Lapland resource management conflict. The main risk of MCA to close down policy processes is to hide the scoring process and let the participants to focus only on the weighing stage. In the article, we present a novel approach to “interrogate uncertainties” and open up the information base. The Upper Lapland case study also illustrates the limits of MCA in the face of fundamental questions of ethical principle. MCA was helpful in addressing the problem situation that was formulated in terms of two competing livelihoods, forestry and reindeer herding, but unhelpful when the problem situation was formulated in terms of indigenous Sámi people struggle for land rights.";"Saarikoski, Heli

"AGRIS:US201500217483";"Land administration for food security: A research synthesis";"";"Food security remains an ongoing global concern: the challenge of ensuring food availability, access, and utility for all, at all times, is yet to be met. The body of literature relating to food security is growing immensely. Land administrators are part of the discourse. Their arguments are spread disparately across academic and professional publications. The distinction between scientific work and political rhetoric is increasingly blurry: the role of land administration needs to be more concisely articulated. This paper provides a new synthesis on the relationships between land administration and food security. It undertakes a review of land administration literature relating to food security. It aims at crystallizing understandings of how land administration supports, or fails to support, food security at a conceptual level, and also the strategic and operational levels of land administration systems. The relationship between land administration and food security appears to be conceptually agreed upon; however, at operational levels the link is less evident. Conceptually, land administration is argued to deliver (and sometimes not deliver) secure land tenure, support for implementation of agricultural policies, access to credit, less litigation, easier land dealings, land taxation, land inventories, and land transaction controls. This enables (or undermines) subsistence farming, development of local agricultural sectors and markets, credit to access to non-local food markets, farm subsidization, more efficient land utilization, fairer international investments, and national food planning strategies. In general, the examined literature tends to focus on problem identification rather than system design. Additionally, the large amount of positive viewpoints need better validation in many cases. Future work needs to concentrate on examining the utility of land information and geospatial tools for food security, extracting lessons from the land administration systems of developed contexts, and improving the links at an operational level.";"Rockson, Georgina

The phenomenon is notable in vineyard areas, where abandonment leads to the loss of the unique character of vineyard landscapes. This paper assesses the extent of vineyard abandonment in Slovakia and analyses the driving forces behind it. We used statistical and Corine Land Cover data to map the change in vineyard areas in Slovakia and analyse the pressure of underlying driving forces. Special attention was paid to small-scale, traditionally managed vineyards that were not changed by agricultural collectivisation and are now considered to be traditional agricultural landscape structures. These areas were mapped using Google Earth aerial photography combined with field research. A case study of the Svätý Jur area provided a detailed analysis of the changes, driving forces and perceptions of local residents. This area is representative of a historical vineyard area that has been deeply affected by the country's political and economic transformations. We found that over the past 20 years almost half the vineyard area in Slovakia has been abandoned or converted to arable land. The import of cheap grape must and wines, increased production costs and insufficient agricultural subsidies have made viticulture unprofitable. Local farmers perceive financial instruments and an inadequate market as limiting factors for farming, together with weak support from local government and the expansion of unsuitable housing. While 65% of local people said they would engage in viticulture if it was more profitable, 31% showed no interest in farming at all. Abandonment of the vineyards is continuous process resulted from the economical and cultural changes after the transition to market-oriented economy. Government support should be directly aimed to protection and management of traditional small scale vineyards and their historical, cultural, biodiversity, and aesthetical values.";"Lieskovský, Juraj

Innovative spatial and urban planning methods and procedures are required, and new approaches and instruments must be elaborated and applied in order to shift from the building scale to the urban and territorial ones. In fact, while energy saving and emission control measures are usually applied to single buildings, plants and technological systems, the urban and territorial scales are not fully considered, although energy consumption and greenhouse gases reduction are connected to the urban form and density, to activities allocation, to mobility, etc., thus involving spatial and land-use planning decisions. It is therefore urgent to overcome the divide between energy and urban planning by elaborating and using new implementation tools. In general, the usual top-down, public-led actions are no longer politically and economically viable, whereas new methods based on public–private partnerships are being progressively adopted. This is a major change, which may set new objectives for planning practices in terms of urban quality, equity, and energy efficiency. This perspective requires redefinition of the usual methods for development rights assignment, and the activation of new planning procedures based on the assessment of actions in terms of performance instead of conformance to pre-defined rules. The expected results regard a more efficient land market and better performing development (or re-development) choices. The article focuses on the Italian case and analyzes the possibility of integrating energy planning with spatial planning, the effectiveness of plan implementation mechanisms, and the prospect of integrate public-led interventions with market tools. Recent innovations in the legislative framework support the inclusion of energy saving and climate change adaptation and mitigation goals in plan implementation procedures.";"Zanon, Bruno

The indirect driving forces of biodiversity impoverishment listed in the Global Biodiversity Strategy that are particularly effective in arid and semi-arid regions are (a) population growth, (b) economic systems and policies that fail to value the environment and its natural resources; (c) inequity in the ownership, management and flow of benefits from both the use and conservation of biological resources; and (d) weakness in legal and institutional systems. The most effective direct human impacts are (a) habitat destruction and fragmentation, (b) overexploitation of biological resources, (c) biological invasion, and (d) agriculture. The problem in arid and semiarid regions, particularly in developing countries, is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge and awareness, the paucity of research, and the diminishing number of competent systematists. This paper discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of each of the indirect driving forces, and the direct human impacts on biodiversity, and reviews case studies related to these impacts, with special reference to those carried out in arid and semiarid regions. These studies include monitoring of the human impact on land cover by remote sensing, effects of landuse on species diversity, impact of habitat fragmentation by summer resorts on coastal dunes, consequences of protection from grazing on biodiversity, comparison of biodiversity in nature reserves and the traditional ema system with that of nearby territories, and the impact of desertification on animal life and endangered species. Case studies also include the tools applied for biodiversity conservation in arid and semiarid lands with special emphasis on endangered species, restoration of degraded habitats and their biodiversity, the significance of nature reserves and captive breeding, the importance of conserving the populations below the species level throughout their geographical range of distribution, and ecotonal biodiversity.";"Ayyad, M.A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"land cover;desertification;grazing";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400063122";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jare.2001.0881";"";"";"";"165-182"

In contrast, only one species of bird has been lost from the Australian continent and there is less concern for the survival of the Australian avifauna than for mammals. This is despite the fact that nearly one in five bird species is listed as threatened or of âspecial concernâ. Moreover, a review of the status of Australian birds at local, regional, state and continental scales shows that the impact of Europeans on the avifauna is much greater than acknowledged. Over most of southern Australia entire avifaunas are threatened with extinction. When allowance is made for habitat loss and degradation, 30 to 90% of bird species across the continent have declined in abundance. The extent of this decline is that the survival of many bird species in the 21st Century is threatened. While a majority of birds in southern Australia has declined in abundance and/or distribution, others have increased. Parallel changes are proceeding in northern Australia. In terms of evaluating impact on the avifauna, an increase in numbers and a change in the composition of avian communities are as significant as the loss of populations and species. Both adversely affect patterns of continental biodiversity and are ecologically dysfunctional. Assuming that current trends continue, over the next century, significant components of the avifauna will be lost as populations proceed to extinction and the composition of avifaunas change at scales ranging from the local to the continental. The pattern of change in avian abundances, and the failure to anticipate or acknowledge the major losses of birds on the Australian continent, shows that conservation emphasis needs to shift from a species by species approach to the conservation of communities and entire avifaunas. Taken together. the scale of the changes in the distribution and abundance of Australian birds is an affirmation that present and projected patterns of human use of the Australian continent are not sustainable. Much needs to be done to reverse the decline of the terrestrial avifauna and achieve ecological sustainability in land use. The most urgent actions are to end the clearing of native vegetation, reduce gazing pressure, remove inappropriate fire regimes, control feral and native animals whose-abundance threatens native species and restore functional ecosyslems, with an emphasis on native vegetation, to a minimum of 30% of the landscape. These need to be accompanied by an aggressive programme to improve water quality in fresh water habitats and restore environmental eater flows, and the creation of a comprehensive. adequate and representative reserve system across the continent irrespective of land tenure. In the absence of such action.

Risk-based land  management is a concept that stands out more and more frequently in soil policies adopted by different European countries,  as well as within the framework of the future European directive on soil protection. This concept intends to act as a lever for  sustainable solution development in terms of rehabilitation by ensuring the following principles: (1) reduction of risks  (human health, ecosystems) allowing sites to be reused safely (concept of fitness for use); (2) prevention of any pollutant  dispersion risk (concept of environmental protection); (3) long-term care while minimising the burden of controlling,  maintenance and monitoring. These ideas have been taken as backdrop for the Walloon decree on soil remediation and  rehabilitation of disused economic activity sites. Risk control has been taken as a key point for any decision related to  historically polluted sites. However, to be effective, this option stands out that reliable and efficient methodological tools are  available for land evaluation (risk assessment). Three decision-making tools, specifically developed for the intended  applications in the Walloon Region, are presented in the paper: (1) a global risk evaluation method allowing ranking of  polluted sites; (2) a method to decide, at the end of the first step of the investigation procedure (preliminary soil  investigation), whether further investigations are required or not; (3) a methodological procedure to proceed to a detailed risk assessment at the end of the in-depth investigation step. Perspectives are proposed to improve these first tools. It has also  been shown that the challenge of sustainable solutions for the management of polluted sites finally depends on answers that  will be progressively developed by the scientific community.

"AGRIS:US2012203680";"THE EVOLUTION OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT EFFICIENCY: THE CASE OF ZONING";"";"This paper argues that law and economics has not come to grips with Arrow's limitation on social welfare economics nor with the evolutionary character of economic and legal institutions. Arrow's theorem makes the concept of a socially efficient economic institution dependent on a prior allocation of property rights. A socially efficient result is efficient only within the bounds of the initial allocation of property rights. A differing initial
allocation would have resulted in a different efficient result. The participants in economic and legal systems are aware of this fact. They see that their positions can be improved both by market trades and by adjustments to property rights. This fact is the engine by which evolutionary law and economic change occurs. Furthermore, evolutionary law and economics has not recognized the fundamentally complex nature of evolution. Contrary to early arguments in law and economics, institutions do not evolve toward efficiency. They do not evolve toward a single point of any kind. Instead, they evolve in a complex and partially unpredictable way; driven by the actions of numerous participants and subject to path dependency and other evolutionary phenomena. The ideas that legal institutions form in an evolutionary manner and that social efficiency is a weak concept have been well-argued in the literature (for reviews see Barry 1991, Samuels 1991). However, the modern development of evolutionary economics has provided tools and metaphors that can strengthen the presentation (Roe 1996). 1 have chosen zoning as my illustration in part because of the numerous attempts by economists to analyze its efficiency and in part because it provides a compelling illustration of the evolutionary view.

This paper first discusses welfare economics and Arrow's theorem. It argues that the persistent focus on social efficiency is misguided and misleading. It is misguided because of its ignorance of the allocation issue; misleading because of its willingness to voice policy conclusions. The paper goes on to discuss evolutionary thought as an alternative to the traditional view. Finally, the paper recounts the development of zoning law as an illustration of the evolutionary phenomena that aggregate welfare economics overlooks.

Place-based studies offer an in-depth knowledge of local conditions specifically regarding the level of implementation of hazard mitigation policies, and shed light on important trade-offs and synergies of various hazard policies.

First, in 2004 we showed that only six of 13 radio-collared ferrets resident near four observation stations approached to within 8m of two stations, and only three of the six entered over 8days of observation. Five of the 15 ferrets available on the 6000ha study area eluded recapture, although all remained present. Second, in 2006 we monitored the survival of 23 radio-collared ferrets before, throughout and after a 5-week field experiment, using toxic bait deployed in 20 automated bait dispensers distributed over 2554ha. Eight ferrets entered a bait dispenser: four entered but did not take the bait; two did not visit but were killed by secondary poisoning; and nine never entered a bait dispenser. After the experiment, intensive live trapping guided by repeated radio-location surveys retrieved only two of 13 collared ferrets that were definitely still alive on the study area. Inefficiency of trapping wide-ranging mustelids such as ferrets, stoats (Mustela erminea) and mink (Neovison vison) is probably commonplace, due to lack of opportunity (if animals take longer to find or enter a trap than it remains available) and/or to active avoidance (refusal to enter traps or to take bait). Our results provide confirmed examples of both, and help explain why short-term or seasonal control of invasive mustelids is often very inefficient, and eradication unlikely.";"King, Carolyn M.

However, there is a need to select independent key properties to identify management classes needed for precise land management. In a previous study performed in the European loess belt, topsoil pH, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and elevation were identified as key properties. In this study we enlarged the number of soil properties by including gamma ray measurements and employed a similar methodology to a field in the sand belt of northern Europe. Based on a principal component analysis we identified the same three variables as key properties. This was surprising given the big differences in landscape topology and pedogenesis between the loess and sand areas. These three key variables were used to delineate management classes using a fuzzy k-means with extragrade classification procedure. This classification was evaluated by mapping the wheat grain yield in the year 2006. A multiple regression model could be constructed that predicted yield from ECa and elevation well (Rₐdⱼ ²=0.88). To analyse the influence of ECa on crop yield in depth a boundary line analysis was conducted. The boundary line could be modelled with an excellent Rₐdⱼ ² of 0.98. It was concluded that ECa, elevation and pH are generic key variables for the delineation of management classes of the aeolian landscapes of north–west Europe. Given its integral nature and strong relationship with crop performances, the authors plea to upgrade ECa from a “secondary” (proxy) source of information to a “primary” variable which can be used directly as a basis for detailed soil mapping of the bulk soil.";"Van Meirvenne, Marc

"AGRIS:US201600027536";"Winter Distribution Model for Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a Conservation Tool for a Threatened Migratory Songbird";"";"Conservation planning and implementation require identifying pertinent habitats and locations where protection and management may improve viability of targeted species. The winter range of Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a threatened Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird, is restricted to the Greater Antilles. We analyzed winter records from the mid-1970s to 2009 to quantitatively evaluate winter distribution and habitat selection. Additionally, we conducted targeted surveys in Jamaica (n = 433), Cuba (n = 363), Dominican Republic (n = 1,000), Haiti (n = 131) and Puerto Rico (n = 242) yielding 179 sites with thrush presence. We modeled Bicknell’s Thrush winter habitat selection and distribution in the Greater Antilles in Maxent version 3.3.1. using environmental predictors represented in 30 arc second study area rasters. These included nine landform, land cover and climatic variables that were thought a priori to have potentially high predictive power. We used the average training gain from ten model runs to select the best subset of predictors. Total winter precipitation, aspect and land cover, particularly broadleaf forests, emerged as important variables. A five-variable model that contained land cover, winter precipitation, aspect, slope, and elevation was the most parsimonious and not significantly different than the models with more variables. We used the best fitting model to depict potential winter habitat. Using the 10 percentile threshold (>0.25), we estimated winter habitat to cover 33,170 km 2 , nearly 10% of the study area. The Dominican Republic contained half of all potential habitat (51%), followed by Cuba (15.1%), Jamaica (13.5%), Haiti (10.6%), and Puerto Rico (9.9%). Nearly one-third of the range was found to be in protected areas. By providing the first detailed predictive map of Bicknell’s Thrush winter distribution, our study provides a useful tool to prioritize and direct conservation planning for this and other wet, broadleaf forest specialists in the Greater Antilles.";"McFarland, Kent P.

Relatively permanent environmental features (e. g. landscape and forest structure) have been used for the assessment of carrying capacity of hunting grounds. Amount of the available winter feed was considered as a limiting factor for major game species in each landscape unit and forest type. While focusing on the actual abundance of feed, many other factors, including mutual interaction among species and populations, were overlooked. In this study we suggest a multifactor approach for gaining more knowledge of the reasons why animals prefer one habitat or habitat combination and avoid others. Two aims were advanced for this study: (1) identifying warning indications about a high risk of damages to provide the hunters and landowners with practicable recommendations; (2) naming the reasons for conflicts between the landowners and users of hunting rights that might be considered by supervising authorities.";"Ozolins, J., Latvian State Forest Research Inst.

"AGRIS:US201600129313";"Genetic data suggest a natural prehuman origin of open habitats in northern Madagascar and question the deforestation narrative in this region";"";"The impact of climate change and anthropogenic deforestation on biodiversity is of growing concern worldwide. Disentangling how past anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to current biome distribution is thus a crucial issue to understand their complex interactions on wider time scales and to improve predictions and conservation strategies. This is particularly important in biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar, dominated by large open habitats whose origins are increasingly debated. Although a dominant narrative argues that Madagascar was originally entirely covered by woodlands, which were destroyed by humans, a number of recent studies have suggested that past climatic fluctuations played a major role in shaping current biome distributions well before humans arrived. Here, we address the question of the origin of open habitats in the Daraina region in northern Madagascar, using a multiproxy approach combining population genetics modeling and remote-sensing analyses. We show that (i) contrary to most regions of Madagascar, the forest cover in Daraina remained remarkably stable over the past 60 y, and (ii) the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), a forest-dwelling lemur, underwent a strong population contraction before the arrival of the first humans, hence excluding an anthropogenic cause. Prehuman Holocene droughts may have led to a significant increase of grasslands and a reduction in the species’ habitat. This contradicts the prevailing narrative that land cover changes are necessarily anthropogenic in Madagascar but does not preclude the later role played by humans in other regions in which recent lemur bottlenecks have been observed.";"Quéméré, Erwan

A good deal of this property is valuable real estate -- coastal dunes, golf courses, and barracks that can be converted to apartments or dormitories. For the beneficiaries of these property transfers the Fort Ord cleanup is a modern day gold rush that is taking place as part of a Superfund cleanup.

This case study addresses this question by examining: (i) how the legal requirements regulating cleanup, community involvement and reuse have been implemented by the Army and the U. S.

"AGRIS:US2016203388";"GRAZING ON PUBLIC LANDS IN THE 21ST CENTURY";"";"A panel of professionals from the ranching, environmental, agency, and university communities was assembled to examine trends relating to the future of grazing on federal lands.  Five factors were identified that were thought to influence the use of grazed forages over the next 20 years.  These factors were (1) multiple uses of public land, (2) public sentiment towards grazing on public lands, (3) environmental and federal agency regulations, (4) permittee issues, and (5) use of science and technology for managing public land grazing.  A list of issues associated with each of the five factors was concurrently developed.  The panel of experts was surveyed to explore the future direction each issue would take and the influence each issue may exert on grazing on public lands.  All four groups were fairly consistent on the way they viewed the future of grazing on public lands.  The most likely scenario includes (1) a significant increase in the demand for multiple uses on public lands, (2) a continued public sentiment against grazing on public lands, (3) and increase in the regulations, and their enforcement, that will negatively impact livestock grazing on the majority of allotments, (4) a continued demand or slight decline in rancher demand for grazing on public lands, and (5) a significant increase in the use of science and technology for managing public land grazing.";"Van Tassell, Larry W.

According to the 109 valid questionnaires in Lanshan Area, Rizhao City, Shandong Province, China, Optimal Scaling Regression Analysis is used to conduct empirical study on the land circulation status of Rizhao City by selecting three variables including family size, the annual net income of rural household and the proportion of cultivating income in annual net income. Function model of factors affecting demand scale of rural land circulation is established.

"AGRIS:US201400192734";"Evaluation of bamboo as an alternative cropping strategy in the northern central upland of Vietnam: Above-ground carbon fixing capacity, accumulation of soil organic carbon, and socio-economic aspects";"";"The mountains of northern Vietnam have lost significant forest cover during the last decades due to the conversion from natural vegetation to cultivated land, leading to the depletion of soil organic matter and land degradation. The study evaluated bamboo as an alternative cropping strategy in the northern central upland of Vietnam. We analyzed above-ground carbon fixing capacity of bamboo, accumulation of soil organic carbon, and socio-economic aspects as compared to other land use systems. Over the long term, a bamboo-based cropping system compared favorably to several other land use alternatives in the area. Compared to cassava, rice and maize, bamboo provides 49–89% higher average return to labor. Carbon content in bamboo's standing above-ground biomass is 17tonsha⁻¹, 18% of that of forest. The soil organic carbon pool under bamboo amounts to 92tonsha⁻¹ to 70cm depth, comparable to both forest and regenerated forest and 20% higher than land cultivated with cassava or maize. The study reveals that a shift in land use from annual crops to bamboo provides an annual net gain of soil organic carbon of approximately 0.44tonsha⁻¹. Such a shift is constrained however by income insecurity in the early stages of plantation, because bamboo takes 3–4 years to mature and has a low return-per-area basis compared to annual cash crops. The study suggests that a crucial incentive for farmers shifting to bamboo production may be to create alternative off-farm income-generating activities which absorb the labor liberated by the labor extensive farming of bamboo.";"Ly, Proyuth

Serrated tussock is a drought-tolerant, wind- and human-dispersed grass of South American origin that has invaded pastures in Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South Africa. The likely effect of climate change on its potential global distribution was assessed by applying six climate-change scenarios to a previously developed model. The projections of climatic suitability under the current climate revealed considerable scope for spread, with the most suitable areas occurring adjacent to existing naturalized populations in Australia, New Zealand, and Western Europe. Under future climates, projected to the 2080s, the land area suitable for serrated tussock contracts globally between 20 and 27%. Changes in projected potential area under the six scenarios were very similar in all geographical regions apart from North America and New Zealand, where the projections range from little change or contraction under the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Centre for Climate Research (MIROC) global climate models (GCMs) to expansion under the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) GCM. Elsewhere, contractions occur in Australia, Asia, South America, and Africa under all six future climate scenarios. By contrast, for Europe, the area climatically suitable for serrated tussock increases under all six scenarios (average increase 47%) through expansions into eastern European countries that are currently unsuitable and through increases in the suitable area in England, Ireland, and Denmark. Since pastoralism is a dominant land use in these regions of Europe, a prudent biosecurity strategy would be to contain the nascent foci of serrated tussock in southern France, along the west coast of Italy, and in the United Kingdom. This strategy could consist of a set of policies to limit human-assisted dispersal of the species' seeds and to reduce wind-borne spread through cultural control of the plant.";"Watt, Michael S.

"AGRIS:US2016216208";"Biodiversity Valuation in Developing Countries: A Focus on Small Island Developing States (SIDS)";"";"The Millennium Development Goals explicitly recognise “sustainable development” as a target. A step towards this is a greater understanding of the significant role of biodiversity in rural communities of developing countries who depend most on the ecosystem goods and services and who as a result may suffer most from its continued degradation. Understanding the input of biodiversity in developing countries to the provision of the ecosystem goods and services (EGS) that are essential to their human well-being is seen as a significant first step in sustainable development, and environmental valuation is a necessary tool for achieving this objective. However, valuing biodiversity in a developing country context can be an intricate affair. While economic valuation literature yields a range of tried and tested methodological techniques for measuring biodiversity, the question remains as to whether these generalised techniques are capable of revealing the complexities of local environmental use in developing countries. A heterogeneous group, “developing countries” can be characterised by a range of factors existing in different intensities that can (1) impact the ways in which local communities interact with their environmental resources (2) impact the efficacy of the methodological and data collection process (3) impact the values obtained from the application of valuation techniques and (4) impact the implementation, success and sustainability of policy and management prescriptions. This paper attempts to address these issues by discussing the main characteristics of developing countries that can impact the biodiversity valuation process and, with specific reference to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), discussing how knowledge of these characteristics can assist the valuation process to better reveal the complex interaction between biodiversity and human welfare in a developing country context.";"Teelucksingh, Sonja S.

Such management practices can affect the surface conditions, which in turn affect wind erosion potential. A variety of land management operations is simulated by identifying the primary physical processes involved and representing each individual operation as a sequenced set of those processes. The process categories include: 1) surface modification (the creation or destruction of ridges and/or furrow dikes that form oriented surface roughness, change the surface random roughness, and destroy the soil crust); 2) mass manipulation within soil layers (the changes in the aggregate size distribution and soil porosity, the mixing of soil and residue among soil layers, and soil layer inversion); 3) biomass manipulation (burying and resurfacing of residue, clipping the standing residue, flattening the standing residue, killing the live crop biomass, and removing biomass); and 4) soil amendments (the application of residue/manure for cover, seeding or planting crops, and irrigation).";"Wagner, L.E.

However, poor conservation outcomes have forced planners to reconsider the role of the forest community in resource use and conservation. Presence of a deep-rooted economic, social, cultural and ethical difference between members of Forest Protection Committee (FPC) constrains group behaviour and their capacity to modify regulations governing resource use. This paper studies the forest policy regimes of India in detail and seeks to investigate the influence of emerging socio-economic issues towards formulating a more robust and sustainable future forest policy by selecting the district of Bankura in West Bengal, India, as a study area, where forest protection regime is practiced rigorously for nearly two decades. The exercise reveals that tribal populations are reluctant to be non-workers and prefer to protect the forest by being a stakeholder in the process of Joint Forest Management (JFM). Thus formulating a more egalitarian distributive JFM mechanism for sharing of benefits fairly across the resource users requires cognizance of collective-choice rule used and the type of heterogeneity existing in the community.";"Paul, Sheeladitya

"AGRIS:US2016216200";"Overcoming the Irrational Land Use in Africa and Other Regions of the World - A Critique to the Myths of Nobel Laureate Schultz and Nominee Hirschman";"";"The paper reveals that ever since the 1950s, after the first land reform of distributing landownership (or possession under public ownership) to small farmers, the irrational and polyopolisticland use by able-bodied part-time and absent small farmers earning higher off-farm income butunwilling to lease the under-producing land beyond their family consumption need to full-timefarmers, has been a global obstacle with both public and private land ownership, traditional andmodern agriculture, fragmented small and consolidatorily enlarged land, low and high incomeeconomies, food under-self-sufficiency and overproduction, and developing and developedcountries, even if land property rights have been well defined and sale/lease allowed. [Polyopoly isinvented by the author to denote the control of a resource by many sellers in contrast to monopoly(by one seller) and oligopoly (by a few sellers)]. This is mainly due to low rents, avoidance ofmisuse by tenants, jealousy in preventing neighbors from prospering, and hobby use. In thosecountries where this land reform has not been completed, there are also large landowners whoexercise it. The full-time farmers, without right to use such under-utilized or idled land, have tosubsist on their tiny farms, cut forests for more land, or quit agriculture for cities or developedcountries. The land of the emigrants is ineffectively used by their old parents, wives or children, orjust idled, without being leased to the remaining able-bodied full-time farmers. Numerousdeveloping nations have to import food with scarce foreign exchanges or ask for donations to copewith food shortage (such as in Africa), while many industrialized nations have provided hugesubsidies to maintain farmers on agriculture which may cause overproduction. The WTO Director-General Lamy has persuaded the developed countries to lose agriculture (which is the fundamentalstrategic lifeline and no country can drop) in exchange for much more industry/services marketaccess of the developing countries (which they cannot afford). Hence the Doha negotiations havebeen blocked. In the recent years, many relatively rich countries, including those with much underutilizedland at home, have bought or rented in land from poor (including African) countries,affecting the latter’s sovereignty or crowding their small farmers out of agriculture, causing neocolonialism.This obstacle has thus harmed agriculture, rural development, income distribution,government expenditure, competition, trade, environment, etc. It has become the most fundamentalmicroeconomic root of the three persisting global macroeconomic problems: food under-selfsufficiency,overproduction and agricultural protectionism. It has turned to be the mostfundamental root (though not the unique one) when the rural facilities are backward (such as innumerous developing countries currently), and the unique root when the rural facilities areadvanced (such as in many developed countries presently). The global food shortage crises since2005 have exposed and confirmed this obstacle.Comparative evidences in Northern and Southern Africa; Asia; Latin America; Central-Eastern Europe and Central Asia; Western Europe; North America and Oceania are presented.Accordingly, the paper challenges the myths of Schultz: (1) small farmers are rational; (2)low income countries saddled with traditional agriculture do not have the problem of many farmersleaving agriculture for nonfarm jobs; (3) part-time farming can be efficient; (4) economies of scaledo not exist in agriculture; and (5) investment in human capital counts much more than institutionalchanges and is the key to agricultural growth. It indicates that Hirschman has ignored that thisobstacle has hampered the linkage effects.The paper has dug out the internationally neglected laws for efficient and competitive landuse in the USA and Western Europe. In the USA, covering all the states, (1) there is a time effect on1-56turning occupied private property into ownership - adverse possession, which means that if a privateperson has occupied a private property (e.g., farmland) without agreement of the owner, while theowner has not sued the occupier during a limited period, then this property will belong to theoccupier. (2) There is a ‘squatters' rights’ law for turning occupied public land into privateownership, which denotes that if a person (squatter) has occupied a public land for over 25 yearsand paid taxes, the Secretary of the Interior may issue a patent for 160 acres of such land upon thepayment of not less than 1.25 dollars per acre. These laws are still exercised. Their mainsignificance is to encourage the efficient use of the idled private and public land resources. Theirmain imperfections are that (1) If the private landowner has found that his idled land is being usedby another farmer without his agreement within the limitations period, he may sue to get the landback, while still idling it. (2) Even if an adverse possessor or squatter has successfully gainedownership of a private or public land, he may idle or under-utilize it later on, without leasing it tothose farmers who wish to produce sufficiently on it. (3) People in general may not wish to loseprivate property including farmland even if they do not use it. In Western Europe, (1) there has beena law to give right to other farmers to produce sufficiently on any under-producing land (i.e., lessthan 40% of the normal output): in the EU Council Regulations 1963/262, 1967/531 and 1963/261;Italy 4 August 1978 (still valid but not applied); and Switzerland from the Middle Ages that anyfarmer can bring his cattle to graze in the private pastures of the Alps (still valid but not applied). Itsmain shortcoming is that it obliges landowners to lease out all their inefficiently used land, so thatpart-time and absent landowners would not be able to produce for family consumption and keepfarming skills; and once lost off-farm jobs, would either have no access to their land rented out, orhave to withdraw it within the contractual period, affecting the lessees. (2) There has also been alaw to oblige landowners to either use their land or lease it out for sufficient production: inGermany 31 March 1915 (until 1961); UK 6 August 1947; Norway 18 March 1955, 25 June 1965,and 31 May 1974 (still applied due to continuing under-self-sufficiency with the cold weather), andDenmark 17 July 1989. Its main shortcomings are that it may cause overproduction, plus the abovementionedone. Both laws have been suspended at the overproduction stage.Improving these laws, and consistent with the ‘Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU’Article 17 Right to Property, the paper raises Proposals: (I) give full-time farmers access to theunder-producing land beyond family consumption need of part-time and absent farmers, and (II)convert the environmentally sensitive farmland back to the nature once a country has encounteredconstant overproduction. They would, without affecting private land ownership, simultaneouslyreach eight aims: (1) minimize/abolish/prevent protectionism, while (2) avoiding overproductionand (3) irrational production abandonment; (4) boost competitive full-time large farmers, whereas(5) not crowding part-time and absent small farmers out of agriculture; (6) reach/maintain basicself-sufficiency in cereals, meanwhile (7) promoting multi-functionality of other agricultural andrural sectors and (8) improving the environment. They would be useful also for public landownership. Hence launching a second land reform – land use reform.By adopting them, the developed countries will not lose agriculture after abolishingprotectionism, and thus have no need to ask the developing countries to open unaffordably moreindustry/services market, hence the unique way for a breakthrough in the WTO Doha negotiations.They could also avoid both land waste and neo-colonialism.(1) Those countries which havenot realized rational and competitive farmland use should do so first at home, rather than unfairlyusing the land of other countries. (2) Farmland sale into foreign ownership should not be allowed,so as to protect the national sovereignty. (3) Farmland lease should be allowed as this will not affectthe national sovereignty. (4) The host country should first cater the need of the domestic farmers forfarmland, at least for family consumption, rather than letting them landless or hold insufficient land,while leasing farmland to foreigners. If their land beyond family consumption need is underproducing,then the other domestic and foreign farmers could be allowed to compete for use.They have received over 200 international responses as appreciation or attention, see theauthor’s fifth FAO publication (http://www.icarrd.org/en/proposals/Zhou.pdf).

The long term soil tillage by conventional methods (using plough) and a large number of passages of mechanization in this type of soil causes a subarable waterproof layer, with a lot of negative consequences in a crop production. This research aims at defining the impact of an ameliorative tillage of soils with heavy mechanical composition and its long term effects on distribution of nitrogen and moisture in the soil and yield of main crops in dry farming conditions.

"AGRIS:US2016222829";"GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROP INNOVATIONS AND PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION: TRADE AND WELFARE EFFECTS IN THE SOYBEAN COMPLEX";"";"We develop a new partial equilibrium, four-region world trade model for the soybean complex comprising soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal. In the model, some consumers view genetically modified Roundup Ready (RR) soybeans and products as weakly inferior to conventional ones; the RR seed is patented and sold worldwide by a U.S. firm; and producers employ a costly segregation technology to separate conventional and biotech products in the supply chain. The calibrated model is solved for equilibrium prices, quantities, production patterns, trade flows, and welfare changes under different assumptions regarding regional government's production and trade policies, differentiated consumer tastes, and several other demand and supply parameters. Incomplete adoption of RR technology naturally arises in the free trade equilibrium, with the United States producing both genetically modified and conventional soybeans. The United States, Argentina, Brazil and the Rest of the World all gain from the introduction of RR soybeans, although some groups of agents (producers or consumers) may lose. Compared to free trade with no domestic bans, a ban on RR production in the Rest of the World improves that region's welfare at some levels of segregation costs but hurts the United States. Introduction of the same ban in Brazil benefits its farmers but makes the region worse off, and an import ban on RR products significantly reduces welfare of all agents. Price support programs for U.S. farmers, despite hurting the United States, have the potential to further improve the world's efficiency. The distribution of welfare between consumers and producers appears to be sensitive to several parameters of the model, but region-level outcomes are robust with respect to most of them and are sensitive only to parameters defining the share of consumers conscious of genetically modified organisms and the elasticity of demand for conventional product varieties.";"Sobolevsky, Andrei

"AGRIS:US201500067124";"Fine-particle emission potential from overflowing areas of the Tarim River";"";"Fine particulates less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) or 10 μm (PM10) are often emitted from river bank or other alluvial lands to the atmosphere during dry and windy seasons worldwide, which contribute to land degradation and poor air quality. Investigation of PM2.5 and PM10 emission potential could contribute to the development of mitigation strategy and better land management practices. In the lowprecipitation zone (<100 mm annual precipitation) of the Tarim Basin in western China, wind erosion and fugitive dust emission are recognized problems on the oasis. There is limited information, however, regarding wind erosion on river overflow areas, areas of temporal flooding, in the Tarim Basin. The objectives of this study were to characterize PM2.5 and PM10 emission potential and wind erosion potential of soils along the Tarim River. The results of particle analysis revealed that most soils (28 soils) were silt loam in the overflowing area of the Tarim River; few (12 soils) soils were sandy loam. The soils had low clay and high silt contents. Soil particles greater than 840 μm (nonerodible soil particles) were not found by sieving all soil samples. Contents of PM2.5 and PM10 ranged from 1.6 to 30.4% and 4.5 to 78.6%. These high percentages of fine soil particulates suggest that mitigation of soil wind erosion and fine-particle emission is important in protecting air quality in the region. The highest content (44.9%) of saltation-size particles (100- to 500-μm diameter) was found in the lower reaches of the river, followed by the middle reaches (14.6%) and then the upper reaches (11.7%) of the river. The highest content of suspension particles (<100-μm diameter) was observed for soils in the middle reaches (13.1%), followed by the upper reaches (11.2%) and the lower reaches (7.1%).";"Li, Xinhu

"AGRIS:US201500202155";"Arsenic in agricultural and grazing land soils of Europe";"";"Arsenic concentrations are reported for the <2mm fraction of ca. 2200 soil samples each from agricultural (Ap horizon, 0–20cm) and grazing land (Gr, 0–10cm), covering western Europe at a sample density of 1site/2500km². Median As concentrations in an aqua regia extraction determined by inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) were 5.7mg/kg for the Ap samples and 5.8mg/kg for the Gr samples. The median for the total As concentration as determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) was 7mg/kg in both soil materials. Maps of the As distribution for both land-use types (Ap and Gr) show a very similar geographical distribution. The dominant feature in both maps is the southern margin of the former glacial cover seen in the form of a sharp boundary between northern and southern European As concentrations. In fact, the median As concentration in the agricultural soils of southern Europe was found to be more than 3-fold higher than in those of northern Europe (Ap: aqua regia: 2.5 vs. 8.0mg/kg; total: 3 vs. 10mg/kg). Most of the As anomalies on the maps can be directly linked to geology (ore occurrences, As-rich rock types). However, some features have an anthropogenic origin. The new data define the geochemical background of As in agricultural soils at the European scale.";"Tarvainen, Timo

"AGRIS:US201400144604";"Comparison of interannual variability modes and trends of seasonal precipitation and streamflow in southern quebec (canada)";"";"The interactions between precipitation, streamflow and groundwater are very complex. In cold temperate regions characterized by harsh winters, winter streamflow is mainly derived from aquifers that are recharged in the spring, during snowmelt, and in the fall, when evapotranspiration is subdued. Despite this complexity, the modes and trends in the interannual variability of spring (April, May, June and July) streamflow and fall (August, September, October and November) precipitation and streamflow were compared to the modes and trends in the interannual variability of winter (December, January, February and March) streamflow in southern Quebec from 1950 to 2000. Results indicate that the variability modes are identical for all four of these hydro‐climatic variables: two modes (south‐east and east modes) on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River on either side of the 47°N and a single mode (south‐west mode) on the north shore. As for the trend, a significant increase in winter streamflow was observed on the north shore. This increase is comparable to that observed in spring streamflow, which suggests that winter streamflow on the north shore is mainly derived from groundwater recharge during the spring. Moreover, both spring and winter streamflows are positively correlated to the North Atlantic Oscillation climate index. On the south shore, south of the 47°N, a significant decrease was observed in the trend of the interannual variability of winter streamflow, this in spite of a significant increase in fall precipitation and streamflow. An increase in evaporation (decreased infiltration) due to a shift from forest cover to agricultural land cover in this region could account for this. However, fall precipitation and streamflow and winter streamflow are significantly correlated to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation winter index. This correlation is negative with the first two variables but positive with the third. This study suggests that, in southern Quebec, the interannual variability of winter streamflow is mainly affected by spring recharge in non‐agricultural catchments (east and south‐west modes) and by farming in agricultural catchments (south‐east mode).

"AGRIS:US201600193131";"Landscape pattern of seed banks and anthropogenic impacts in forested wetlands of the northern Mississippi River Alluvial Valley";"";"Agricultural development on floodplains contributes to hydrologic alteration and forest fragmentation, which may alter landscape-level processes. These changes may be related to shifts in the seed bank composition of floodplain wetlands. We examined the patterns of seed bank composition across a floodplain watershed by looking at the number of seeds germinating per mÂ² by species in 60 farmed and intact forested wetlands along the Cache River watershed in Illinois. The seed bank composition was compared above and below a water diversion (position), which artificially subdivides the watershed. Position of these wetlands represented the most variability of Axis 1 in a Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) analysis of site environmental variables and their relationship to seed bank composition (coefficient of determination for Axis 1: rÂ² == 0.376; Pearson correlation of position to Axis 1: r == 0.223). The 3 primary axes were also represented by other site environmental variables, including farming status (farmed or unfarmed), distance from the mouth of the river, latitude, and longitude. Spatial analysis based on Mantel correlograms showed that both water-dispersed and wind/water-dispersed seed assemblages had strong spatial structure in the upper Cache (above the water diversion), but the spatial structure of water-dispersed seed assemblage was diminished in the lower Cache (below the water diversion), which lost floodpulsing. Bearing analysis also suggested that water-dispersal process had a stronger influence on the overall spatial pattern of seed assemblage in the upper Cache, while wind/water-dispersal process had a stronger influence in the lower Cache. An analysis of the landscapes along the river showed that the midââlower Cache (below the water diversion) had undergone greater land cover changes associated with agriculture than did the upper Cache watershed. Thus, the combination of forest fragmentation and hydrologic changes in the surrounding landscape may have had an influence on the seed bank composition and spatial distribution of the seed banks of the Cache River watershed. Our study suggests that the spatial pattern of seed bank composition may be influenced by landscape-level factors and processes.Nomenclature: USDA, 2005.";"Middleton, Beth

"AGRIS:US2012209688";"Institutional Analysis of Swidden: The Case of Swiddners in Orissa";"";"Swidden being a widespread form of land use in the tropics comprehensively defining it become a difficult task. Its characteristics embrace different types of topography, demographic feature, ethnic and ecological diversities. It also varies in terms of cropping pattern, frequency of land use, tools and methods of practice. It is argued that the institutions governing swidden are static in nature and do not adapt to the requirements of the changing ecological and social needs. This necessitates understanding what characterise institutions in a traditional swiddening society, and hence, changes in these characteristics to appreciate whether swidden is a static form of agriculture or changing over the time and space. There are a few aspects, which underscore the institutional face of swidden. Though, population growth plays a crucial role in swiddening system, it is not a necessary condition that the changes in agricultural institutions are guided by the population factor alone. There are also other forms of institutions to understand whether the swidden system of production is static or not. These include, land -use choices vis-a-vis property right structures and labour sharing arrangements, forms of integration with market, changing technology. They depict the economic interface with institutions. Development and changes in the customs and norms are a few of the analytically complex and notable in stitutional changes in swidden. Considering these factors, we attempt to understand the institutional changes observed in the swidden system. Based on the field survey in five swiddening villages of Orissa, we find varying characteristics of changes in the above discussed institutions that call for a comprehensive understanding of the development processes.";"Jyotishi, A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012209688";"http://purl.umn.edu/25763";"";"";"";""

But studies of changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages along small upland undisturbed watercourses are still lacking. The aim of the study is to analyse variability in macroinvertebrate communities between two different habitats/morphological sequences â shallow (riffle/run/step/) and deeper (pool) channel-bed morphological units on the background of the environmental parameters (local relief, slope, channel confinement ratio, channel-valley walls connectivity, floodplain continuity and channel abut, channel sinuosity and predominant land cover of riparian zone) of seven valley segments (functional process zones) in two seasons of the year (spring and autumn). The longitudinal-downstream gradient research was conducted on the semi-natural upland headwater brook in the Little Carpathians (9,330 m long, average gradient 2.8%) at 15 morphological sequences (30 sampling points). Each sampling point in spring as well as in autumn was characterised by mean flow velocity, discharge, water depth, channel width, channel bottom particle size, and flow types. Selected physico-chemical variables: pH, dissolved oxygen content (DO), oxygen saturation (DO %), temperature (t) conductivity and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured directly in the field using the multisonde measuring device. Organisms were identified into the family level. The results showed that differences in zonation of benthic invertebrates between seasons are more apparent than seasonal variability between pools and riffles. Spring samples followed the increasing gradient of total dissolved solids downstream with characteristic families for upper and lower stretch. The disruption of macroinvertebrates zonation was more evident in autumn samples with greatest effects in pools. Based on RDA, the distribution of families was driven by three significant variables in riffles and four in pools. Alike environmental factors of pool sequences in the middle and upper reaches were responsible for similarity in macroinvertebrate structure. In conclusion, the distribution pattern of benthic invertebrates of the natural part of the small headwater stream in terms of abundance of macroinvertebrate families followed the longitudinal zonation in spring, but in autumn were the local habitat conditions more important.";"LehotskÃ½, Milan

An analysis of plant protection practices using indicators of the risk to operator health and the environment (IRSA, IRTE), together with a frequency-of-treatment indicator (TFI), enabled us to (i) show the variability of these indicators depending on the production system and farmers’ pesticide use strategies and (ii) calculate correlations between these indicators.

The fluxes of evaporation and net ecosystem exchange of carbon were measured from mid-spring to the end of summer in 2005 and 2006 and simulated independently with process models. The observed and modelled data were then compared along a gradient of water levels. Any variation along the gradient would imply an influence of the water table on the flux. It became evident that changes in the water table had no effect on the evaporation and CO₂ fluxes of the peatland. A probable cause could be the high water content of the soil, even for the low water tables, and the stable thermal conductivity of the soil. This study has implications for current land use management, which is aimed at reducing CO₂-emissions.

Based on the modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model and on gray relational analysis, we analyzed the influence of land use changes on carbon sinks and emissions in Guangzhou from 2000 to 2012. The aim was to identify suitable options for built-up land expansion that would allow for minimal carbon losses. The key results were as follows: (1) Built-up land increased by 118.91% in Guangzhou city over the study period, with this expansion taking the form of concentric circles extending around the old Yuexiu district. (2) Carbon emissions over the period of analysis significantly exceeded carbon sink capabilities. The total carbon sink decreased by 30.02%, from 535.40Ã103t to 374.6Ã103t. Total carbon emissions increased by 1.89 times, from 13.73Ã106t to 39.67Ã106t; 80% of carbon emissions were derived from energy consumption. (3) There were large differences in the extent of carbon sink losses at different scales of built-up land expansion and land use change. In Guangzhou, the loss of carbon sink is small when cultivated land (though not prime farmland) and water bodies are converted to built-up land on a small scale. The loss of carbon sink is much smaller when grasslands are converted to built-up land on a large scale. However, forested land, which has excellent carbon sink functions, should not be converted. (4) Changes in carbon sinks were mainly affected by natural factors and land urbanization. Changes in carbon emissions were mainly affected by population urbanization, economic urbanization, and land urbanization. (5) To achieve âeconomical and intensive use of landâ, âurban growth boundaryâ and âecological red linesâ should be determined for government policies on land use management. These factors have great significance for âincreasing carbon sinks and reducing carbon emissionsâ in urban ecological systems.";"Xu, Qian

Desmognathus auriculatus (Southern Dusky Salamander) has purportedly gone from being quite common throughout the southeastern US Coastal Plain to now being enigmatically rare. We used repeated standardized surveys of 5 historically occupied streams and their adjacent riparian zones between 2007 and 2010 to estimate detection rate of Southern Dusky Salamanders. We detected Southern Dusky Salamanders at 3 of 5 historic sites. Mean detection rate across streams known to be occupied at least once during the study was moderately low (mean Â± 1 SE = 0.20 Â± 0.12 for a double-sampled 50-m survey), improved at 2 sites with increasing time since drought, and varied among streams. For comparison, we evaluated detection rates of several other stream salamanders and found those rates to range from 0.37 (Â± 0.07) for Eurycea quadridigitata (Dwarf Salamander) to 0.08 (Â± 0.01) for Siren intermedia (Lesser Siren). Based on markârecapture along a 200-m section of stream and the associated riparian habitat at the site where Southern Dusky Salamanders were most often detected, we estimated 43 (Â± 15) and 97 (Â± 161) individuals to be present FebruaryâMay 2009 and October 2009âMay 2010, respectively. Despite abundant adults, Southern Dusky Salamanders were the only species that we failed to detect as larvae; however, we observed many newly metamorphosed Southern Dusky Salamandersâusually under logs with saturated soil and often near entrances to crayfish burrows. Our results generally support the characterizations of Southern Dusky Salamanders as having become enigmatically uncommon. Because landcover change in the study area has been minimal, we suspect habitat damage from Sus scrofa (Feral Pig) may be responsible for the variation in Southern Dusky Salamander presence and abundance among sites. Because of the low detectability of Southern Dusky Salamanders, future work to identify factors driving Southern Dusky Salamander distribution and abundance will require intensive sampling at sites to provide robust estimates of occupancy or population size.";"Maerz, John C.

"AGRIS:US201600185606";"22 year assessment of deforestation and restoration in riparian forests in the eastern Brazilian Amazon";"";"Brazilian environmental law imposes more restrictions on land-use change by private landowners in riparian forests than in non-riparian forest areas, reflecting recognition of their importance for the conservation of biodiversity and key ecosystem services. A 22-year time series of classified Landsat images was used to evaluate deforestation and forest regeneration in riparian permanent preservation areas over the past two decades, focusing on the municipality of Paragominas in the state of ParÃ¡ in eastern Amazonia. There was no evidence that riparian forests had been more effectively protected than non-riparian forests. Instead, deforestation was found to be comparatively higher inside riparian permanent preservation areas as recently as 2010, indicating a widespread failure of private property owners to comply with environmental legislation. There was no evidence for higher levels of regeneration in riparian zones, although property owners are obliged by law to restore such areas. A number of factors limit improvements in the protection and restoration of riparian forests. These include limited awareness of environmental compliance requirements, the need for improved technical capacity in mapping the distribution and extent of riparian forests and the boundaries of private properties, and improved access to the financial resources and technical capacity needed to support restoration projects.";"NUNES, SÃMIA S.

A positive and negative transformation index of land-cover (PNTIL) was developed to quantitatively evaluate the land-cover changes in every type of BTZ. Three bioclimatic datasets, with a spatial resolution of 1km×1km, were used to classify the BTZ type in Loess Plateau. These include the mean annual biotemperature (MAB), average total annual precipitation (TAP) and potential evapotranspiration ratio (PER). In 1985, 1995 and 2005 land cover data was used to analyze the changes within BTZs. The results show that there are 14 BTZ types, which account for 25.21% of the total land-cover area in Loess Plateau. From 1985 to 2005, cultivated land decreased 0.93% per decade; on average wetland and water areas, woodland and grassland increased 3.47%, 0.24% and 0.06% respectively per decade. During this period the total rate of whole BTZ land-cover transformation decreased from 28.53% to 21.91%. Overall the total positive and negative transformed areas of land cover in BTZs displayed a decreasing trend. Moreover, the results indicate that the transition zones may have exhibited a greater change and landscape diversity than the adjacent biomes in Loess Plateau from 1985 to 2005.";"Fan, Ze-Meng

In this article, we examine the differences between ICESat elevation data (from the 1064 nm channel) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM of 3 arcsec resolution (90 m) and map-based DEMs in the Qinghai-Tibet (or Tibetan) Plateau, China. Both DEMs are linearly correlated with ICESat elevation for different land covers and the SRTM DEM shows a stronger correlation with ICESat elevations than the map-based DEM on all land-cover types. The statistics indicate that land cover, surface slope and roughness influence the vertical accuracy of the two DEMs. The standard deviation of the elevation differences between the two DEMs and the ICESat elevation gradually increases as the vegetation stands, terrain slope or surface roughness increase. The SRTM DEM consistently shows a smaller vertical error than the map-based DEM. The overall means and standard deviations of the elevation differences between ICESat and SRTM DEM and between ICESat and the map-based DEM over the study area are 1.03 ± 15.20 and 4.58 ± 26.01 m, respectively. Our results suggest that the SRTM DEM has a higher accuracy than the map-based DEM of the region. It is found that ICESat elevation increases when snow is falling and decreases during snow or glacier melting, while the SRTM DEM gives a relative stable elevation of the snow/land interface or a glacier elevation where the C-band can penetrate through or reach it. Therefore, this makes the SRTM DEM a promising dataset (baseline) for monitoring glacier volume change since 2000.";"Huang, Xiaodong

Although much of the focus of research on land use and cover change in the tropics has been on deforestation, ongoing socioeconomic changes both locally and globally have made land transitions in the tropics extremely fluid. In addition, feedbacks between land cover change and human behavior constrain the extent and trajectories of land transitions. The sustainability of land use systems in the tropics depends on an understanding of coupled human-natural systems that can lead to general frameworks for management and prediction. The unprecedented availability of land use/cover data together with ecological data collected at large spatial scales offer exciting opportunities for advancing our understanding of socioecological systems. We rely on six studies of land transitions in the tropics to illustrate some promising approaches and pose critical questions to guide this body of research.";"Uriarte, María

In this paper, a 'mixed' model combining the knapsack problem, a household model and a form of spatial equilibrium model into a modelling framework is developed. The impacts of changes in off-farm wage rates, transaction costs in the rental market, the output prices of paddy crops, and land transactions were examined in the model. The simulation has led to the conclusion that the real benefits to farm households from land consolidation may not be apparent until the real opportunity cost of farm labour begins to rise. In addition, a reform policy in the administrative sector which encourages, not only the process of land accumulation and the rental market to be more active, but also farmers to involve themselves more actively in farming will improve their well-being. Moreover, a policy which allows farmers to freely cultivate other annual crops (cash crops) instead of rice and corn may be important and it should be considered in the future.";"Van Hung, Pham

In East Africa, landscape-scale estimates of carbon fluxes are uncertain and factors such as deforestation poorly resolved due to a lack of data. In this study, trends in vegetation cover and carbon for East Africa were quantified using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover grids from 2002 to 2008 (500-m spatial resolution), in combination with a regional carbon look-up table. The inclusion of data on rainfall and the distribution of protected areas helped to gauge impacts on vegetation burning (assessed using 1-km spatial resolution MODIS active fire data) and biome trends. Between 2002 and 2008, the spatial extents of forests, woodlands and scrublands decreased considerably and East Africa experienced a net carbon loss of 494 megatonnes (Mt). Most countries in the area were sources of carbon emissions, except for Tanzania and Malawi, where the areal increase of savannah and woodlands counterbalanced carbon emissions from deforestation. Both Malawi and Tanzania contain large areas of planted forest. Vegetation burning was correlated with rainfall (forest only) and differed depending on land management. Freely available global earth observation products have provided ways to achieve rapid assessment and monitoring of carbon change hotspots at the landscape scale.";"PFEIFER, M.

Alapelv szerint a birtokpolitikában a tőke szabad mozgásának korlátozása tilos – minden tagállam esetében –, de az Európai Bíróság által elismert közérdekből, az arányosság és a szükségesség jogelvének betartásával mégis korlátozható, feltéve, hogy az adott rendelkezések nem a más tagállamok polgárainak hátrányos megkülönböztetésére irányulnak. A földkérdésben véleményem szerint nem vezet előre a nemzeti szuverenitás kontra közösségi jog problematika előtérbe helyezése, megoldás inkább attól várható, hogy megvizsgálják azt, hogy milyen, a közösségi joggal összeegyeztethető szabályozással lehet a célokat megvalósítani.------------------------------------------ Making a distinction between Community law provisions on CAP and on land policy, I conclude that the observations by Endre Tanka, such as the Union law on land policy being “policy itself”, that “legislation in the Member States is limited to the implementation thereof”, and that Community law “nearly precludes any national legislation” on land policy, are exaggerated or incorrect, as Member States may choose not to apply any restriction to the land market, or may even choose to introduce a very strict land policy – to quote Endre Tanka, a value-based land policy, or a democratic land reform. In principle, the free movement of capital may not be restricted under land policy – in any Member State –, but restrictions may still be introduced if they serve public interests accepted by the European Court of Justice and are in line with the legal principles of proportionality and adequacy, provided that such provisions are not intended to discriminate against citizens of the other Member States. In my opinion, focusing on the issue of national sovereignty versus Community law will not bring us closer to a solution. It would be more useful to look into potential regulations which are compatible with Community law and would still help attain the desired goals.";"Korom, Agoston";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016209939";"http://purl.umn.edu/99131";"";"";"";""

The sequence was combined with soil properties to indicate targeted strategies for each location aimed to improve soil moisture availability, biomass utilisation, and long-term viability of the farm or ranching enterprise. As a result of training of land owners and operators in use of this tool, 97% of participants indicated that they have begun or intend to make changes in land management; 78% are intending to make three or more substantial changes; and 91% felt better prepared for the impacts of climate change. The key to the success of this technique is that it identifies critical sustainable production drivers in a simple plan format and offers tailored management options which can address more variable climate conditions.

Large-scale rodenticide applications are typically used to eradicate rats and restore ecological communities. In tropical ecosystems, environmental conditions rapidly degrade baits and competition for baits by non-target animals can result in eradication failure. Our objective was to evaluate persistence of rodenticide baits during a rat eradication program on Palmyra Atoll; a remote tropical atoll with intense competition for resources by land crabs. Following aerial application, bait condition was monitored in four terrestrial environments and in the canopy foliage of coconut palms. Ten circular PVC hoops were fixed in place in each of Palmyra’s four primary terrestrial habitats and five rodenticide pellets were placed in each hoop. Five coconut palms were selected in three distinct regions of the atoll. One rodenticide pellet was placed on each of five palm fronds in each coconut palm. Fresh baits were placed in all monitoring locations after each broadcast bait application. Bait condition and survival was monitored for 7� days after the first bait application and 6� days after second application. Bait survival curves differed between applications at most monitoring sites, suggesting a decrease in overall rat activity as a result of rodenticide treatment. One terrestrial site showed near 100� % bait survival after both applications, likely due to low localized rat and crab densities. Median days to pellet disappearance were one and two days for the first and second application, respectively. Differences in survival curves were not detected in canopy sites between bait applications. Median days to pellet disappearance in canopy sites were 2 and 4� days for the first and second application, respectively. Frequent rainfall likely contributed to rapid degradation of bait pellets in coconut palm fronds.";"Berentsen, Are R.

This process has produced an intense debate on the economic benefits but also about the extent and intensity of the impact of this activity on the coastal ecosystems, particularly the effects of pond construction on mangrove areas and other coastal wetlands. For the Northern coast of Sinaloa (Northwest Mexico), a region where shrimp culture is actively practiced and reproduces most of the shrimp controlled production model in Mexico, a land cover change-detection analysis, with Landsat images, outputs that 75% of the shrimp farming in this region has been built on saltmarshes while less than 1% was constructed on mangrove areas. Through the estimation of landscape metrics for different scenarios (with and without shrimp culture infrastructure), we find that in addition to direct removal of saltmarshes, shrimp aquaculture has significantly modified the spatial patterns of coastal wetlands, retreating wetland borders and fragmenting their patches. These last impacts are mainly related with the development of the linear infrastructure associated with shrimp culture (drainage channels and roads), rather than the construction of the ponds. Present findings and other from similar studies done in Northwest Mexico; allow us to estimate that 60% of shrimp farming in Mexico impacted directly on saltmarshes, contrasting with the 3% of shrimp farms built on mangroves.";"Berlanga-Robles, César Alejandro

The analysis reveals that there has been 20% increase in the agricultural area over the past ten years. Built up area also has increased from 1.35% to 6.36% of the area and dense vegetation also has marginally increased. The remarkable increase in the agricultural area occurs owing to the reclaim of the natural ravines and fallow lands.

"AGRIS:US201300887186";"Why does rainfall affect the trend in soil carbon after converting pastures to forests";"";"When trees are planted onto former pastures, soil carbon stocks typically either remain constant or decrease, with decreases more common in regions with higher rainfall. We conducted a modelling analysis to assess whether those changes in soil carbon, especially the interaction with rainfall, could be understood through consideration of nitrogen balances. The study was based on simulations with the whole-system ecophysiological model CenW which allowed explicit modelling of both carbon and nitrogen pools and their fluxes through plants and soil organic matter. We found that in a modelled coniferous forest without excess water input, total system nitrogen stocks remained similar to pre-forestation values because there were few pathways for nitrogen losses, and without biological nitrogen fixation or fertiliser inputs, gains were restricted to small inputs from atmospheric deposition. However, tree biomass and the litter layer accumulated considerable amounts of nitrogen. This accumulation of nitrogen came at the expense of depleting soil nitrogen stocks. With the change from input of grass litter that is low in lignin to forest litter with higher lignin concentration, organic-matter C:N ratios increased so that more carbon could be stored per unit of soil nitrogen which partly negated the effect of reduced nitrogen stocks. The increase in C:N ratios was initially confined to the surface litter layer because of slow transfer of material to the mineral soil. Over a period of decades, soil C:N ratios eventually increased in the soil as well. Simulations with different amounts of precipitation showed that greater amounts of nitrogen were leached from systems where water supply exceeded the plants' requirements. Reduced nitrogen stocks then caused a subsequent reduction in soil organic carbon stocks. These simulations thus provided a consistent explanation for the observation of greater losses of soil organic carbon in high-rainfall systems after converting pastures to forests. More generally, the simulations showed that explicit modelling of the nitrogen cycle can put important constraints on possible changes in soil-carbon stocks that may occur after land-use change.";"Kirschbaum, Miko U.F.

Data from four Landsat7 ETM+ scenes (March, May, June 2002, September 1999) were included step-wise into classifications by discriminant analysis to document their relevance for classification accuracy. The classification using all four images reached a maximum accuracy of 69.2%, significantly higher compared with single-date classifications and showing less fluctuations in classification accuracy. Considering all four images produced similar accuracies for pixels affected and not affected by temporary snow cover, so that data limitations by partial snow cover can be resolved using multi-seasonal data. As some land cover classes were only poorly discriminated, the approach still cannot provide a level of accuracy sufficient for landscape-scale studies. Further research is suggested on the separability of land cover classes to achieve an adequate thematic resolution for regional assessments of land cover and land cover change.";"Heinl, Michael

From a European perspective it is clear, however, that there are considerable national differences in the decision support process, and more generally in the extent to which this process supports the selection of less invasive, alternative remediation options such as phytoremediation, in situ immobilisation etc. (referred to here as “gentle” remediation technologies). In this paper we present results from the recently completed European Union ERANET SNOWMAN project SUMATECS (Sustainable Management of Trace Element Contaminated Sites), and critically review available decision support tools in terms of their fitness for purpose for the application of gentle remediation technologies. Stakeholder feedback indicates a lack of knowledge amongst stakeholders of currently available decision support tools. We propose that decision support which focuses on gentle remediation is more strongly incorporated into existing, well-established (national) decision support tools / decision-frameworks, to promote more widespread use and uptake.";"Onwubuya, Kene

Land use on the other hand relates more to the societal aspects of a landscape. We argue that much of the spatial configuration of landscape characters is related to land use and that satellite data can be used to represent and investigate interpretations of land use. We propose and demonstrate the joint use of a novel SRPC procedure for satellite imagery together with an explicit representation of category semantics. We use these two mechanisms to identify a collection of conceptual spaces related to land use on Swedish historic summer farms. We also outline a framework for analysis of the relations between two separate ways of knowing: the machine-based knowledge and the human, mental knowledge. An evaluation demonstrates that satellite images can be used to identify land use processes as a mixture of land cover objects occurring in particular spatial contextual relationships closely tied to the land use category semantics. This opens up an unexplored possibility for research on vague spatial ontologies and questions on how to formally articulate different interpretations of space, land use, and other branches of spatial social science.";"Ahlqvist, Ola

A field methodology is developed to characterise five attributes: species composition, cover, height, structure and density. The utility of these data primitives, as land cover ‘building blocks’ is demonstrated via classification of the field data to multiple land cover schema. Per-pixel classification algorithms, trained on the basis of the classified field data, are utilised to classify a SPOT 5 satellite image. The resultant land cover maps have overall accuracies approaching 80%. However, significantly lower validation accuracies are demonstrated to be a function of sample fraction. The aggregation of attributes to classes under-utilises the potential of remote sensing data to describe variability in vegetation composition across the landscape. Consequently, land cover attribute parameterisation techniques are discussed. In conclusion, it is demonstrated that data primitives provide a flexible field data source proven to support multiple land cover classification schemes and scales.";"Farmer, Elizabeth

The model parameters were calibrated and validated, with respect to the data observed from 1983 to 2005. The basin was assessed at the ‘Porto do Mesquita’ gauging station and change in land use and occupation was based on the annual growth scenarios proposed in the partial report of Paraopeba basin’s master plan. The model was found to be highly sensitive to baseflow, its main calibration variable. Statistical analyses produced a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient above 0.75, which is considered good and acceptable. The SWAT model provided satisfactory results in simulating hydrologic pattern under different scenarios of land use change, demonstrating that it can be applied for forecasting discharge in the aforesaid basin. The current land use scenario provided a peak discharge simulation of 1250 m³ s-1, while in years 2019 and 2029 peak discharge simulations were 1190 m³ s-1 and 1230 m³ s-1 respectively.

A USDA study claims that developments in energy production from biomass could increase profits for agricultural commodity producers. However, as William Heffernan and his colleagues have demonstrated, concentration in the agrifood sector limits the economic benefits going to the commodity producers. Relying on Heffernan’s framework, we compare the distribution of intellectual property of corn and other genetically modified crops with that of the emerging biomass technologies. We find that patent ownership in the emerging biofuel sector is not yet as concentrated as in the agricultural biotechnology sector. However, theories of private ordering predict concentration and our data indicate that concentration is occurring.

"AGRIS:FR2016204366";"Categorising farming practices to design sustainable land-use management in mountain areas";"";"In European mountain areas, shrub encroachment resulting from farmland abandonment is most often managed by mechanical operations such as roller chopping or controlled burning, which have proved to be ineffective and unsustainable. Recent agroecological findings highlight the potential impact of grazing on long-term shrub dynamics. We thus explored the potential contribution of livestock farms to the management of shrub encroachment. We studied the diversity of livestock practices and strategies on the scale of a small mountain valley in France where a land-use management plan was initiated. We interviewed 33 livestock farmers with a comprehensive approach and analysed the data in partnership with local land-use managers. To categorise farming practices, we used an innovative constructivist method based on knowledge engineering techniques and tools such as repertory grids. Our results show that the diversity of land-use practices can be summed up by ten practices related to three management domains: (i) livestock management, that is, splitting herds into batches, leading animals to pasture and breeding choices; (ii) the feeding system, including indoor feeding during the year, the hierarchy between haymaking and grazing in spring and the system’s forage autonomy; and (iii) farmland utilisation and maintenance, which comprises hillside use, spatial configuration of grazed areas, maintenance practices and technical choices to cut meadows. We also show that farmers combine these practices within six types of strategies: ensuring feeding security and simplifying labour (type A), maintaining farmland heritage (type B), taking advantage of hillsides (type C), focusing on animal care (type D), combining areas, periods and batches (type E), or selling on local markets (type F). This makes it possible to identify: (1) farmers’ strategies that have the greatest impact on shrub encroachment; and (2) practices that may develop into more sustainable management of shrub encroachment. Our work is thus a first step in developing sustainable land-use management plans in rural areas threatened by shrub encroachment. In return, this deep understanding of farmers’ strategies allowed us to address socially pertinent scientific issues related to the dynamics of grazed plant communities.";"Girard-Fourty, Nathalie

"AGRIS:US201300744377";"Nitrogen losses in runoff from three adjacent agricultural watersheds with claypan soils";"";"Despite improvements in the use of soil conservation practices, crop rotation and managed fertilizer applications, large losses of nitrogen (N) in runoff continue to occur from row-cropped watersheds. Increasing requirements for implementing water quality standards in the United States, has increased pressure for the development of research-based guidelines to reduce N losses from agricultural runoff. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of management, watershed characteristics, and precipitation on TN and nitrate-N (NO3--N) loss over time by comparing losses on three adjacent watersheds with claypan soils. The three adjacent north-facing, corn-soybean rotational watersheds in northeastern Missouri were instrumented with H-flumes, water samplers, and flow-monitoring devices in 1991. Runoff samples from each individual rainfall event between 1991 and 1997 were analyzed for TN and NO3--N concentrations. The 7-year mean annual TN losses on the three watersheds ranged from 13 to 19 kg ha-1 with a mean of 16 kg ha-1. Nitrate-N losses ranged from 8 to 14 kg ha-1 with a mean of 11 kg ha-1. During the study, 67% of the TN was lost as NO3--N with a range from 22% in 1997 to 76% in 1996. The mean annual TN losses for corn and soybean years during the study were 30.7 and 5.7 kg ha-1, respectively. Significantly higher loss (57%) of N from watersheds occurred during the period between fall harvest and spring planting when crops were not present (referred to as the “fallow” period in this paper; 86.8 kg ha-1) compared to N losses during the cropping period (64.5 kg ha-1). In 1994, 96% of the annual TN loss and 98% of the annual NO3--N loss occurred during the fallow period. In contrast, the lowest fallow period losses of TN (19%) and NO3--N (14%) occurred in 1993. The watershed-mean TN and NO3--N losses in 1993 alone accounted for 44 and 46% of the total losses observed over the 7-year period because during that year the study area received 142% of the normal precipitation. When the study area received 51% of the annual precipitation before planting in 1996, the TN and NO3--N losses accounted for 34 and 38% of the 7-year loss, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer that was applied in 1993 and 1996 may also have contributed to the observed large losses. The results of this study suggest that the maintenance of a suitable vegetative cover throughout the year could reduce runoff and lower TN and NO3--N loss from agricultural watersheds under a corn-soybean rotation.";"Udawatta, R.P.

"AGRIS:US201500205310";"Which catchment characteristics control the temporal dependence structure of daily river flows?";"";"Hydrological classification systems seek to provide information about the dominant processes in the catchment to enable information to be transferred between catchments. Currently, there is no widely agreed‐upon system for classifying river catchments. This paper develops a novel approach to classifying catchments based on the temporal dependence structure of daily mean river flow time series, applied to 116 near‐natural ‘benchmark’ catchments in the UK. The classification system is validated using 49 independent catchments. Temporal dependence in river flow data is driven by the flow pathways, connectivity and storage within the catchment and can thus be used to assess the influence catchment characteristics have on moderating the precipitation‐to‐flow relationship. Semi‐variograms were computed for the 116 benchmark catchments to provide a robust and efficient way of characterising temporal dependence. Cluster analysis was performed on the semi‐variograms, resulting in four distinct clusters. The influence of a wide range of catchment characteristics on the semi‐variogram shape was investigated, including: elevation, land cover, physiographic characteristics, soil type and geology. Geology, depth to gleyed layer in soils, slope of the catchment and the percentage of arable land were significantly different between the clusters. These characteristics drive the temporal dependence structure by influencing the rate at which water moves through the catchment and/or the storage in the catchment. Quadratic discriminant analysis was used to show that a model with five catchment characteristics is able to predict the temporal dependence structure for un‐gauged catchments. This method could form the basis for future regionalisation strategies, as a way of transferring information on the precipitation‐to‐flow relationship between gauged and un‐gauged catchments. © 2014 The Authors.

Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are important in cities, both for small-scale urban agriculture and native gardens. To better understand this important ecological issue, we examined bee communities, their response to novel floral resources, and their potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer. We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources.";"Lowenstein, David M.

Agricultural soils that are covered by vegetation or crop residue are less susceptible to degradation by wind and water erosion, organic matter depletion, structural degradation and declining fertility. In general, perennial crops, higher yields, reduced tillage and continuous cropping provide more soil cover than annual crops, lower yields, intensive tillage, residue harvesting and fallowing. This study presents a model for estimating the number of days in a year that the soil surface is protected and demonstrates its application on the Canadian prairies over the period from 1981 to 2006. Over the 25-yr study period, the average soil cover on Canadian prairie soils increased by 4.8% overall. The improvement came primarily as a result of widespread adoption of no-till and a decline in the use of summerfallow, but the gains were offset to a great deal by a shift from higher-cover crops such as wheat, oats and barley to more profitable but lower-cover crops such as canola, soybeans and potatoes. The implication of these trends is that, even though protection of prairie agricultural soils has improved over the past 25 yr, soil cover could decline dramatically over the next several decades if crop changes continue, the adoption of conservation tillage reaches a peak and residue harvesting for biofuels becomes more common.";"Huffman, T.

A Q methodological study in Poland to assess stakeholders’ attitude";"";"Biodiversity conservation is gradually shifting its dependency on public protected areas to take a more holistic ecosystem and landscape approach that includes private lands in addition to public lands. However, effective practice of biodiversity conservation on private land also depends on landowners’ attitude and their willingness to participate and cooperate. This study focuses on Poland where conservation on private land is a relatively new concept but it is slowly gaining recognition, especially after its accession into the European Union. It investigates and classifies the diverse attitudes among stakeholder groups in Poland toward biodiversity conservation on private land that are part of protected areas. Four primary stakeholder groups were considered: conservation and park authorities, local administrative officials, local conservation based NGOs and private landowners. The study was conducted across three sites that represented three different forms of protected areas in Poland: a national park, a landscape park and a Natura 2000 site. Q methodology, a research method from psychology and other social sciences, was used to classify human subjectivity in stakeholders’ attitude in a more systematic manner. The analysis yielded three predominant factors which highlighted the diversity in attitudes among the stakeholder groups based on their knowledge, concerns and experience in the subject. Additionally, it underlined the common recognition among all stakeholder groups for better policy support, stronger collaboration among stakeholder and more financial or compensatory support for landowners to make private land conservation more feasible. Understanding the differences in attitudes will help bridge the gap between conservation priority and conservation opportunity—a current challenge in the field of biodiversity conservation.";"Kamal, Sristi

Remote sensing technology fits well for long-term monitoring and assessment of such effects. The aim of this study was to analyze LU/LC changes between 1980 and 1999 in Samsun, Turkey, using satellite images. Three Landsat images from 1980, 1987 and 1999 were used to determine changes. A post classification technique was used based on a hybrid classification approach (unsupervised and supervised). Images were classified into six LU/LC types; urban, agriculture, dense forest, open forest-hazelnut, barren land and water area. It is found that significant changes in land cover occurred over the study period. The results showed an increase in urban, open forest/hazelnut, barren land and water area and a decrease in agriculture and dense forest in between 1980 and 1999. In this period, urban land increased from 0.77% to 2.47% of the total area, primarily due to conversions from agricultural land and forest to a lesser degree. While the area of dense forest decreased from 41.09% to 29.64% of the total area, the area of open forest and hazelnut increased from 6.73% to 11.88%.";"Güler, Mustafa

"AGRIS:US201400158513";"Urban expansion into a protected natural area in Mexico City: alternative management scenarios";"";"Land use change is one of the main stress factors on ecosystems near urban areas. We analysed land use dynamics within Xochimilco, a World Heritage Site area in Mexico City. We used satellite images and GIS to quantify changes in land use/land cover (LULC) from 1989 to 2006 in this area, and a Markov projection model to simulate the impact of different management scenarios through to 2057. The results show an alarming rate of urbanisation in 17 years. LULC change runs in one direction from all other land use categories towards urban land use. However, changes from wetland or agricultural LULC to urban LULC frequently occur through transitional categories, including greenhouse agriculture and abandoned agricultural land. While urbanisation of natural land is often indirect, it is also effectively permanent. Active management aimed at protecting ecologically valuable habitats is urgently needed.";"Merlín-Uribe, Yair
