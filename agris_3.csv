"AGRIS:US2016213836";"Optimal Patentability Requirements with Fragmented Property Rights";"";"We study the effect of the fragmentation of intellectual property rights on optimal patent design. The major finding is that when several complementary innovative components must be assembled to operate a new technology, the patentability requirements should be stronger than in the case of stand-alone innovation. This reduces the fragmentation of intellectual property, which is socially costly. However, to preserve the incentives to innovate,if a patent is granted the strength of protection should be generally higher than in the stand-alone case.";"Denicolo, Vincenzo

"AGRIS:US201301619070";"Effects of Slash on Herbaceous Communities in Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands of Northern Arizona";"";"Scattering slash (downed woody materials) after tree removal is increasingly prescribed by land managers as a treatment to promote the establishment and growth of understory vegetation in pinyon-juniper woodlands. However, the effects of scattering slash on soil resources and plant communities are poorly understood and often confounded with the release from tree competition. In order to examine how slash affects plant establishment, soil stability, soil nutrients, and soil microbiota, we initiated a 2 x 2 full factorial experiment with two levels of seeding and two levels of slash additions within 30 intercanopy spaces, repeated at two intact pinyon-juniper woodland sites with different soil characteristics in northwestern Arizona. Pretreatment data were collected in 2003 and posttreatment responses were measured in 2004 and 2005. Total plant cover increased within all treatments; however, grasses increased significantly only in the seed-and-slash treatment at both sites. In addition, a greater proportion of seed-and-slash plots contained more reproductively active grasses compared to seed-only plots. Slash treatments also resulted in significantly less sediment movement compared to nonslash treatments. Changes in soil nutrients were not observed, except available NO3-N decreased significantly in slash treatments. Arbuscular mycorrhizal potential and microbial biomass carbon increased as a result of the slash treatment. Addition of woody materials appeared to have general effectiveness at improving the ecological function of soils and promoting understory establishment and thus may be considered a desirable treatment for improving degraded conditions.";"Stoddard, Michael T.

"AGRIS:US201300824847";"Effects of agri-environmental measures, site and landscape conditions on butterfly diversity of Swiss grassland";"";"Agri-environment schemes (AES) were introduced in Europe to mitigate the loss of biodiversity in cultivated landscapes. In Switzerland, farmers have to convert 7% of the arable land into ecological compensation areas (ECA) in order to enhance biodiversity, low-input grassland making up the major part of ECA. This study investigated during 6 years the effect of ECA grassland on butterfly diversity at the field and the landscape scales in two farming landscape units of the Swiss Plateau. Butterfly diversity was compared between low-input and conventional grasslands, controlling for potential influence of local site conditions and landscape context of grasslands. Low-input management of ECA grasslands had a significant impact on butterfly communities, but ECA and conventional grasslands differed more in the composition of species assemblages than in the number of butterfly species. The typical butterfly assemblages on ECA grassland might be linked to the slightly higher plant species richness due to management restrictions. However, the effectiveness of ECA grassland for promoting butterfly diversity varied according to local site conditions (field slope and orientation) and to the amount of ECA and semi-natural elements in the surrounding landscape. Thus, the present study underlines the necessity to account for such environmental variation at multiple scales to be able to detect and interpret effects of AES. Nevertheless, our results suggest that additional restoration measures should be adopted. Especially, the ECA scheme should promote a connected network of ECA grasslands and semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale.";"Aviron, S.

To find out how catchment attributes, such as land use, hydrologic soil groups, and lithology, can affect water quality variables (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻, pH, TDS, EC, SAR), a spatio-statistical approach was applied to 23 catchments in southern basins of the Caspian Sea. All input data layers (digital maps of land use, soil, and lithology) were prepared using geographic information system (GIS) and spatial analysis. Relationships between water quality variables and catchment attributes were then examined by Spearman rank correlation tests and multiple linear regression. Stepwise approach-based multiple linear regressions were developed to examine the relationship between catchment attributes and water quality variables. The areas (%) of marl, tuff, or diorite, as well as those of good-quality rangeland and bare land had negative effects on all water quality variables, while those of basalt, forest land cover were found to contribute to improved river water quality. Moreover, lithological variables showed the greatest most potential for predicting the mean concentration values of water quality variables, and noting that measure of EC and TDS have inversely associated with area (%) of urban land use.";"Hasani Sangani, Mohammad

The article examines a set of land use policies and practices thatcan be used to mitigate the vulnerability of Tajikistan’s large rural population, primarily byincreasing family incomes. Empirical evidence from Tajikistan and other CIS countries suggeststhat families with more land and higher commercialization earn higher incomes and achievehigher well-being. The recommended policy measures that are likely to increase rural familyincomes accordingly advocate expansion of smallholder farms, improvement of livestockproductivity, increase of farm commercialization through improvement of farm services, andgreater diversification of both income sources and the product mix. The analysis relies forsupporting evidence on official statistics and recent farm surveys.

M., Tan, C. S. and Yang, J. Y. 2014. Impacts of 48 years of consistent cropping, fertilization and land management on the physical quality of a clay loam soil. Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 403â419. Soil physical quality (SPQ) is often ignored or under-monitored in long-term field studies designed to determine the economic and environmental sustainability of agricultural practices. Accordingly, a suite of complementary soil physical and hydraulic parameters was measured using intact core samples to determine the SPQ of a Brookston clay loam under a long-term (48 yr) cropping, fertilization and land management study at Woodslee, Ontario. The SPQ under virgin woodlot, fertilized monoculture sod and unfertilized monoculture sod treatments was similar, with optimal SPQ occurring in the top 10â20 cm, but severely suboptimal SPQ occurring below 30 cm because bulk density (BD), relative field capacity (RFC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (KS) were excessive, and because organic carbon (OC), air capacity (AC) and plant-available water capacity (PAWC) were critically low. The SPQ for fertilized and unfertilized monoculture corn under fall moldboard plow tillage was similar and substantially suboptimal throughout the top 40â50 cm due to high or excessive BD and RFC, critically low OC, low or critically low AC and PAWC, and KS that varied erratically from excessive to critically low. The SPQ under fertilized and unfertilized cornâoatâalfalfaâalfalfa rotations (corn and second-year alfalfa fall plowed) was similar and largely non-optimal below 10 cm, but largely optimal in the top 10 cm due to the ameliorating effects of numerous biopores and crop roots. A bimodal soil water release function fitted to release curve data showed that PAWC was determined by soil matrix porosity (PM), and AC was determined by soil structure porosity (PS). Strong inverse linear correlations between BD vs. PM, BD vs. PS and BD vs. OC provided site-specific estimates of optimal ranges and critical limits for PAWC, AC and OC, respectively. Although SPQ changed substantially among treatments, the changes did not extend below 30-to 40-cm depth, and were largely unaffected by long-term annual fertilization. The SPQ below 30- to 40-cm depth was similarly poor across all treatments, and is likely an inherent characteristic of the soil.";"Reynolds, W. D.

"AGRIS:US201600191340";"new view on EU agricultural landscapes: Quantifying patchiness to assess farmland heterogeneity";"";"Mapping and assessment of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes as required by the EU biodiversity policy need a better characterization of the given landscape typology according to its ecological and cultural values. Such need should be accommodated by a better discrimination of the landscape characteristics linked to the capacity of providing ecosystem services and socio-cultural benefits. Often, these key variables depend on the degree of farmland heterogeneity and landscape patterns. We employed segmentation and landscape metrics (edge density and image texture respectively), derived from a pan-European multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing dataset, to generate a consistent European indicator of farmland heterogeneity, the Farmland Heterogeneity Indicator (FHI). We mapped five degrees of FHI on a wall-to-wall basis (250m spatial resolution) over European agricultural landscapes including natural grasslands. Image texture led to a clear improvement of the indicator compared to the pure application of Edge Density, in particular to a better detection of small patches. In addition to deriving a qualitative indicator we attributed an approximate patch size to each class, allowing an indicative assessment of European field sizes. Based on CORINE land cover, we identified pastures and heterogeneous land cover classes as classes with the highest degree of FHI, while agroforestry and olive groves appeared less heterogeneous on average. We performed a verification based on a continental and regional scale, which resulted in general good agreement with independently derived data.";"Weissteiner, Christof J.

Temporal trends in ecosystem service delivery were examined using two methods: qualitative narratives and quantitative scoring of ecosystem service delivery according to land cover. While all sites included in this study are within the same national governance unit (i.e. UK), individual local management decisions were the main agents driving change, influenced by EU and national policies. Gradual change in focus from provisioning to cultural ecosystem services was a persistent trend across most sites, and apparent in both methods. There was generally no net loss in regulating services at the sites. The two methods were subjective but as data were not available for the breadth of ecosystem services present at the sites between 1993 and 2012, it was concluded that it is more informative for holistic assessments to draw on qualitative expert opinion than to ignore less quantifiable services such as many of the cultural services.";"Dick, J.

"AGRIS:US201400145667";"Soil microbial diversity and C turnover modified by tillage and cropping in Laos tropical grassland";"";"Agricultural practices should modify the diversity of soil microbes. However, the precise relationships between soil properties and microbial diversity are poorly known. Here, we study the effect of agricultural management on soil microbial diversity and C turnover in tropical grassland of north-eastern Laos. Three years after native grassland conversion into agricultural land, we compared soils from five land use management systems: one till versus two no-till rotational cropping systems, one no-till improved pasture and the natural grassland. Soils were incubated in microcosms during 64� days at optimum temperature and humidity. Bacterial and fungal diversity were evaluated by metagenomic 454-pyrosequencing of 16S and 18SrRNA genes, respectively. Changes in soil respiration patterns were evaluated by monitoring ¹²C- and ¹³C-CO₂ release after soil amendment with 13C-labelled wheat residues. Results show that residue mineralization increased with bacterial richness and diversity in the tilled treatment 7� days after soil amendment. Native soil organic C mineralization and priming effect increased with fungal richness and diversity in improved pasture and natural grassland. No-till cropping systems represented intermediate situations between tillage and pasture systems. Our findings evidence the potential of controlling soil microbial diversity by agricultural practices to improve soil biological properties. We suggest the promotion of no-till systems as a fair compromise between the need for agriculture intensification and soil ecological processes preservation.";"Lienhard, Pascal

For three breeding seasons (2002â2004), we measured the number of nestlings, fledglings, and dispersed young that were produced by pairs of Ferruginous Hawks nesting within 2365 kmÂ² managed by the Bureau of Land Management. We hypothesized that reproductive success would be influenced by nesting substrate, abundance of prey, distance to the closest occupied raptor nest, and distance to the closest active well. Although the Uintah Basin experienced a drought during our entire study, reproductive success was within the range of estimates reported in other studies in the Intermountain West. Each nesting pair produced an average of 1.9 nestlings, 1.3 fledglings, and 0.9 dispersed young. During our study, 17 nestlings and 14 fledglings died; 55% were due to avian predators, 16% to mammalian predators, 10% to unknown predators, 16% to natural causes, and 3% to unknown causes. Avian depredation may have resulted from increased competition among avian predators for scarce prey resources, or from increased use of juvenile Ferruginous Hawks as an alternative prey source by Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in years of low lagomorph abundance. Our results suggest that the level of oil development that occurred during this study did not have an adverse effect on Ferruginous Hawk reproduction; the effect of a higher level of oil development was beyond the scope of this study.";"Keough, Heather L.

Our fieldwork was carried out from April 2000 to August 2003 in the Dongzhai National Nature Reserve within the Dabie Mountains, China. We identified four major types of forest edges: shrub, farmland, road and residential edge. The association of male Reeves's pheasants with these edges was non-random and varied by season, suggesting that land-cover and land-use patterns surrounding forest fragments could have variable effects on habitat use of Reeves's pheasants. Shrub edges were preferred by males in all seasons and male Reeves's pheasant seldom moved > 200 m from this type of edge. Pheasants tended to avoid farmland edges in summer, stayed within 100 m of the nearest road edges in spring and moved farther from residential edges with season shifts. Furthermore, edge use by male Reeves's pheasants also differed between winter and the other three seasons. Our data demonstrated the relationships between edge effects and the spatial distribution patterns of Reeves's pheasants, and suggested that landscape configuration, including juxtaposition of forest and shrubby vegetation, should be incorporated into management and conservation for addressing edge effects at landscape scales. We suggest monitoring the spatial responses of this species to different forest edges over a longer term and at a larger landscape scale.";"Xu, Ji-Liang

"AGRIS:US201600090468";"Space use by resident and transient coyotes in an urban–rural landscape mosaic";"";"Context Coyotes (Canis latrans) have adapted successfully to human landscape alteration in the past 150 years and in recent decades have successfully moved into urban areas. While this causes concern about human–wildlife conflicts, research also suggests that coyotes tend to avoid humans and human activity in urban areas. For improving management, a better understanding of space use by coyotes is needed. Aims To study how coyote social behaviour influences fine-scale space use in urban areas we present results from an extensive, multi-year GPS telemetry study (2005–13). The study area in coastal Rhode Island is a mosaic of rural, suburban and urban land use and coyotes have only recently arrived. Methods We differentiated between two social classes: residents (individuals that have established a territory; n=24) and transients (individuals that have no territory; n=7). Space use was analysed using mixed effect models and detailed land-cover data. Key results Coyotes tended to select for agricultural and densely vegetated land cover and against land used for housing and commerce. Pasture and cropland were preferred by residents and avoided by transients, especially at night, indicating the role of agricultural land as prime foraging habitat. Both groups selected densely vegetated land cover for daytime shelter sites. Transients selected for densely vegetated land cover both day and night, indicating use for both shelter and foraging. Resident coyotes avoided high- and medium-density housing more than transients. Conclusions We interpret land-cover selection by resident coyotes as indicative of coyote habitat preference, while transients more often occupied marginal habitats that probably do not reflect their preferences. Differences in land cover selection between residents and transients suggest that transients have a corollary strategy to avoid residents. Implications With cover and food appearing to be important drivers of space use, coexistence strategies can build on controlling food resources as well as on the tendency of coyotes to avoid humans. Nevertheless, transients, having the need to avoid territorial resident coyotes as well, show a reduced aversion to land cover with high human activity, creating a higher potential for human–wildlife conflicts.";"Mitchell, Numi

Land, Trees, and Women examines the evolution of customary land tenure institutions in areas of Western Ghana and Western Sumatra where traditional matrilineal inheritance systems have been changing. In these two areas, the authors find that individualization of land tenure has contributed to both increased gender equity and greater efficiency in agroforestry management. While property rights institutions are moving toward providing proper incentives for efficient natural resource management, the authors conclude that any program or legal framework that assigns rights to resources must be evaluated for barriers to women's participation.

"AGRIS:US201400064637";"Resource use conflicts: the future of the Kalahari ecosystem";"";"The Kalahari ecosystem is characterized by natural resource conflicts and land-use pressure resulting from intensification of human activities. This paper addresses three issues of concern associated with the Kalahari ecosystem resource management: (i) the major land-use/land cover shifts in the Kalahari ecosystem since 1970 and the resulting pattern in vegetation species composition, cover and density; (ii) the possible explanations for the observed shifts; and (iii) the possible resource conflicts likely to arise. Data collection involved the comparison of two sets of panchromatic photographs along two transects (Hukunsti–Ngwatle and Tshane–Tsabong) to study land-use/cover shifts that have occurred in the Kalahari ecosystem between 1971 and 1986. Secondly, the nature of possible conflicts resulting from population pressure and associated patterns of land-use was investigated by making observations on selected environmental variables along a 300km transect with diverse environments comprising different-sized settlements, vegetation communities and land-uses. Land-use/land cover shifts have occurred within the Kalahari ecosystem as evidenced by the two transects analysed in this paper. The main changes are the retreat of grass cover up to 18kms from settlements and the increase in thorny and non-thorny woody encroachers closer to the settlements. In the Matsheng area, land-use/land cover gradients reflect marked differences in human pressure. For instance, while settlements (kraals/households) and fields around Tshane (smaller and dwindling settlement) have declined to 5% at the 4km distance in 1986, these land-uses account for 22·3% of land cover at 4km around Hukuntsi (bigger and expanding village). Five major vegetation communities were identified using key plant species during the dry season. However, these communities do not have distinct land-use activities associated with them. Cattle densities were higher in communities found far away from settlements and water points where the grass cover was abundant. Cattle graze far from settlements to obtain quality fodder and trek to the water points around village pans or at cattle posts. There are no definite boundaries between vegetation communities and land-use activities, hence a lot of interaction between activities of these zones depends on the dispersion of resources. Shifts in land-use/cover changes can be accounted for by anthropogenic activities (arable agriculture, livestock grazing and human settlements) enhanced by natural factors like seasonal variations and prolonged droughts of the mid-1980s. It is argued in this paper that potential remedial measures include biosphere conservation areas, resource zoning and resource modeling plans to determine land suitability.";"Moleele, N.N.

As a result, ownership structure of agricultural land in Poland is quite unique among the former socialist Central and East European countries.Until the year 1989, when the transformation to a market economy was initiated, the landmarket in Poland was almost non-existent. The State Land Fund (SLF), an institution created in 1944 was for decades a substitute to land market. Originally, the Fund was responsible for the implementationof the land reform. After nationalization or confiscation of real estates, state farms have been established on a larger part of agricultural land under Fund’s management. The rest has been divided between former farm workers and small farmers owing less than 5 hectares of land.";"Majewski, Edward";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"POL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016208669";"http://purl.umn.edu/48334";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016208843";"Economic Impacts of E. Coqui frogs in Hawaii";"";"Eleutherodactylus coqui, a small frog native to Puerto Rico, was introduced to Hawaii in the late 1980s, presumably as a hitchhiker on plant material from the Caribbean or Florida (Kraus et al. 1999).  The severity of the frogs' songs on the island of Hawaii has lead to a hypothesis touted both in the scientific community and in the popular media that the presence of the frog on or near a property results in a decline in that property's value. The objective of this study is to explicitly test the extent to which this hypothesis is true, and if it is, what the level of localized damage incurred on a property's value is.  The invasion began on either Hawaii or Maui, and has now expanded to Oahu and Kauai. Spread has occurred through the movement of nursery plants and through intentional introduction of the frogs to previously uninfested areas. The coqui frogs have attained some of the highest densities ever observed for terrestrial amphibian populations (up to 133,000 per ha on Hawaii). These extremely dense populations have lead to both economic and ecological concerns, especially on the island of Hawaii. The loud mating song of the male frogs is the most widely cited complaint in Hawaii. The frog's song has been measured to range in the 80-100 decibel level (Beard and Pitt 2005). Given that 45 decibels may be enough to prevent the average person from sleeping , the song of the coqui is considered a form of noise pollution in Hawaii.  In this study we focus only on the direct damage costs of the coqui's loud mating songs through a hedonic pricing model. Because this only one component of the economic costs of noise pollution, it should be considered a lower bound estimate of the true cost of their noise and their presence.  Since this lower bound is generated through measurable losses in property value, its use in invasive species policy should be welcomingly straightforward compared to survey methods or other efforts to quantify damages from ecosystem change. We find that coqui frogs do impose localized damages to real estate values, but by 800 meters distance from a complaint this damage is declining relative to the effect at 500m. The per-transaction reduction in value when frog complaints have been lodged within 500m appears to be about 0.16%, holding constant district, acreage, financial conditions, zoning, and neighborhood characteristics.  This is just over 1/3 of the impact that an increase of 1% in mortgage rates is estimated to have on price.";"Kaiser, Brooks A.

Verifica-se que, ao longo dos anos, através dos programas e projetos, faltou decisão política para realizar as transformações que a estrutura concentrada da terra está a exigir e melhorar as condições de vida das populações sem terra. A violência está presente no processo, fazendo um grande número de vítimas. O julgamento dos conflitos em relação à posse da terra e aos assassinatos se arrastam lentamente, podendo levar anos para se ter uma solução, o que favorece a violência. A falta de crédito, assistência técnica e apoio à comercialização, remete-os a uma situação de fragilidade, apesar de que o simples acesso à terra já proporciona aos assentados uma situação mais favorável, como, por exemplo, a garantia da subsistência familiar. Todavia, os assentamentos têm impactado na demanda por maior acesso aos serviços sociais, influenciam no incremento da oferta de alimentos e potencializam o mercado de consumo. Pelos fracos resultados apresentados e pela ausência de prioridade dada ao problema, apesar do discurso oficial, verifica-se que a reforma agrária, na atual conjuntura globalizada, não constitui uma das estratégias para construção de um projeto de Nação.-----------------------------------------------The article proposes the presentation of the Brazilian land reform, including its theory aspect and the analysis of how the execution is done.

The objective of zoning is to create ecologically desirable non-fragmented forest reserves and group timber production areas. We formulate an integer programming model of forest zoning that explicitly addresses clustering of spatial units allocated to timber production and reserve zones while also promoting separation of these zones. A tabu search algorithm is developed, implemented and tested using a case study. The case study results indicate that up to 5% of the net financial return is sacrificed with a 'satisfactory' grouping of units within each zone. A 'good' separation between the reserves and timber production zone is achieved at the cost of further decline of the net financial return up to 11% relative to the unconstrained case.";"Krcmar, Emina

The model is evaluated against high resolution soundings as well as station observations and is shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the sea breeze well. Sensitivity tests are carried out to investigate the effects of historical land-cover change and changes in soil moisture on the dynamics of the sea breeze. It is found that land-cover change alone, i.e., a change from wooded grasslands to bare soil, with no change in soil moisture initialisation, does not significantly alter the overall structure of the sea breeze but results in higher surface winds due to the reduced vegetation roughness length, which leads to enhanced surface moisture advection inland. On the other hand, land-cover change in conjunction with increased soil moisture results in a considerably weaker, shallower, and less penetrative sea breeze, and delays its onset and duration. A sea-breeze scaling analysis highlights the impact of increasing soil moisture on reducing the sea-breeze volume flux scale.";"Kala, J.

The investigation considers the relative impact differing policy/planning choices will have on the local-scale climate across a city during a typical climatological year (TCY). The aim is to demonstrate a modelling approach which couples a climate-based land classification and simple urban climate model and how this can be used to examine the impact differing urban forms and design strategies have on neighbourhood scale partitioning of energy and resulting consequences. Utilising the Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance (SUEWS) model (JÃ¤rvi et al., 2011) hourly fluxes of sensible, latent and stored heat are simulated for an entire year under four different urban development scenarios. The land cover scenarios are based on those obtained by the MOLAND model for 2026 (Brennan et al., 2009) in our case study city Dublin (Ireland). MOLAND LULC are translated into local climate zones (Stewart and Oke, 2012) for examination. Subsequently, the types of building forms, vegetation type and coverage are modified based on realistic examples currently found across Dublin city. Our results focused on 2 principle aspects: the seasonality of energy partitioning with respect to vegetation and average diurnal partitioning of energy. Our analysis illustrates that compact scenarios are suitable form of future urban development in terms of reducing the spatial impact on the existing surface energy budget in Dublin. Design interventions which maintain the level of vegetation at a ratioâ¥9:16 to artificial surfaces reduces the impact.";"Alexander, P.J.

As a result it became possible to accumulate the experience necessary for extension of these works in scales of all country. Simultaneously a number of difficulties and problems have been identified. It will be difficult to realize these works without elimination of them. In Moldova in 2008 the Government has accepted the Program of land consolidation that was premature step because pilot projects haven't been still implemented, the Concept hasn't been confirmed and Strategy of land consolidation hasn't been developed. Therefore at the present stage it is necessary to concentrate efforts on developing the land consolidation Concept and Strategy and on improvement of actual legal framework in this field. In the paper the author who participated in implementation of these 6 pilot projects offers some ideas concerning this problem. The factors constraining implementation of land consolidation are considered and some measures on their elimination are recommended. A number of theoretical and practical problems demanding examination and solution in the future are considered. First of all, it is necessary to answer to the question: what we want to realize-land consolidation or land reparcelling. Then in Strategy it is necessary to define: either land consolidation should be completely voluntary or particularly or comprehensive compulsory and how in this case one may apply economic levers to accelerate this process; what are the limits of the state intervention in regulation of land relations in modern conditions; whether it is necessary to limit the sizes of land ownerships, etc. Also it is necessary to establish Land Bank and united state entity responsible for land consolidation, to identify the demand of land consolidation specialists and to organize their training by launching education courses, to develop land market, to amend legal provisions on land consolidation, to determine sources and to develop administrative rules for financing land consolidation projects.

В статье приводятся краткие сведения об итогах внедрения пилотных проектов в 6 сëлах Республики Молдова в 2007-2009 годах. В результате удалось накопить опыт, необходимый для распространения этих работ в масштабах всей страны. Одновременно был вскрыт ряд трудностей и проблем, без устранения которых это будет трудно сделать. В Молдове в 2008 году Правительство приняло Программу консолидации земель, что явилось преждевременным шагом, т.к. не были ещë завершены пилотные проекты, не была утверждена Концепция и разработана Стратегия консолидации земель. Поэтому на современном этапе следует сконцентрировать усилия на разработке Концепции и Стратегии консолидации земель, а также совершенствовании действующего законодательства в данной области. В статье приводятся некоторые соображения автора, участвовавшего в реализации 6 пилотных проектов, по данному вопросу. Рассматриваются факторы, сдерживающие развитие работ по консолидации земель и рекомендуются меры по их устранению. Поднимается ряд теоретических и практических проблем, требующих своего дальнейшего изучения и решения. Прежде всего, ставится вопрос о том, что следует реализовывать: консолидацию или репарцелирование земель. В Стратегии необходимо определить: должна консолидация проводится полностью на добровольной основе или следует разработать и применить экономические рычаги для еë ускорения; каковы пределы государственного вмешательства в регулирование земельных отношений в современных условиях; надо ли ограничивать размеры землевладений и другие. Ставится вопрос о создании Земельного банка и единой государственной службы в области консолидации, организации подготовки специалистов, развитии земельного рынка, совершенствовании действующего законодательства.

The global impact of the redistribution of water use driven by agriculture and land use change, of which CDM-AR can be a contributing factor, is a major component of ongoing global change and climate change processes. If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20% (144Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28% (210Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27% (200Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80-100% decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54% in drier areas to less than 15% in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e.g. upstream/downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts. This study demonstrates that it will become increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional water resources, and how the hydrologic dimension of CDM-AR impacts on issues of sustainability, local communities, and food security.";"Trabucco, Antonio

In this study, a multi-objective interval-stochastic land resource allocation model (MOISLAM) was developed for tackling uncertainty that presents as discrete intervals and/or probability distributions. The developed model improves upon the existing multi-objective programming and inexact optimization approaches. The MOISLAM not only considers economic factors, but also involves food security and eco-environmental constraints; it can, therefore, effectively reflect various interrelations among different aspects in a land resource management system. Moreover, the model can also help examine the reliability of satisfying (or the risk of violating) system constraints under uncertainty. In this study, the MOISLAM was applied to a real case of long-term urban land resource allocation planning in Suzhou, in the Yangtze River Delta of China. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violation were obtained. The results are considered useful for generating a range of decision alternatives under various system conditions, and thus helping decision makers to identify a desirable land resource allocation strategy under uncertainty.";"Lu, Shasha

We used a geographic information system and realistic development scenarios largely inspired by the PA (United States) experience, but adapted to a region of QC (Canada) with an already fragmented forest cover and a high gas potential. The scenario with the greatest impact results from development limited by regulatory constraints only, with no access to private roads for connecting well pads to the public road network. The scenario with the lowest impact additionally integrates ecological constraints (deer yards, maple woodlots, and wetlands). Overall the differences between these two scenarios are relatively minor, with <1� % of the forest cover lost in each case. However, large areas of core forests would be lost in both scenarios and the number of forest patches would increase by 13–21� % due to fragmentation. The pipeline network would have a much greater footprint on the land cover than access roads. Using data acquired since the beginning of the shale gas industry, we show that it is possible, within a reasonable time frame, to produce a robust assessment of the impacts of shale gas extraction. The framework we propose could easily be applied to other contexts or jurisdictions.";"Racicot, Alexandre

In addition, we studied the influence of environmental factors (vegetation structure, soil) on distribution and diversity of carabid beetles. A total of 92,495 individuals representing 15 carabid species were collected from the closed landfill. Although the species richness of carabid beetles recorded in the closed landfill was not higher than the other green spaces in the city, the closed landfill could sufficiently provides a stable habitat as a semi-natural area for carabid beetles. Soil pH, Na, and tall grass plant cover influenced carabid assemblage in the closed landfill. However, other environmental variables (e.g., K⁺, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, bare land cover, weedy cover, and tree cover) were not correlated with carabid species composition. It is implied that in the closed landfill, which is a highly modified engineered environment, other abiotic environmental (e.g., drainage, soil texture, leachate, and landscape context, etc.) and biotic factors (e.g., intra- and interspecific competition) may have affected carabid assemblage. Although artificial drainages are essential facilities for landfill management, they are a critical factor that affects the species inhabiting the landfill. However, carabid beetles seemed to randomly fall into the artificial drainage. For successful management of closed landfills, it is very important that minimize the intervention and that develop the ecological sensitively management method.";"Do, Yuno

In addition, GIS allows the user to create simulations on future data scenarios to analyze the results of planning, land use and/or business decisions. In this frame, the object of this study has been the use of the GIS application for medium-term land use planning in Maminas commune to assist local Government authorities on the sustainable management of land resources. The study provided not only the basic spatial database at communal level, but also evaluated the land suitability, land use, land use changes, functioning of irrigation and drainage systems as well as the loss of agricultural land to urbanization. The agricultural land suitability assessment showed that the biggest surface in this commune is made of S2 class with a total of 63% of agriculture land, class S3-2S does not count that much since it is only 1% and adjacent to the texture of the lower horizon, class S3-2T takes a surface of about 21 % and has an inclination of 3-12% that classifies these soils in this class. The remaining 10% is classified in S4 class with an inclination of 13-25%. The data collection for the buildings built before and post 1991 shows the trends of this phenomenon, GIS applications have indicated that a part of buildings is built in the best agricultural land. The data showed that class A total area is 954.5 ha, occupied area 130.4 ha (14%), and class B total area 53.2 ha occupied area 21.3 ha (40%), while in the land of class N the urbanization is too little (only 1.2%).";"L.

"AGRIS:US201400107287";"Mapping functional vegetation abundance in a coastal dune environment using a combination of LSMA and MLC: a case study at Kenfig NNR, Wales";"";"The interactions between wind-blown sand transport, pioneer vegetation and succession vegetation in coastal dune fields play an important role in landform development and determine the balance between stabilization and re-activation of these aeolian landscapes. High-resolution mapping of vegetation communities across a dune field – in particular, the mixture of different functional plant types such as pioneer versus succession species – is critical for the calculation of landscape metrics that enable a rigorous and quantitative testing of numerical simulation models, as well as for informing targeted land management actions that maintain biodiversity and ecological functions. This article presents a method of using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) to inform linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) for quantifying sub-pixel abundance of sand, pioneer and succession vegetation in a coastal dune area in Wales, from archived imagery obtained from the Compact Airborne Spectral Imager (CASI) in 1997. LSMA is first applied to derive sub-pixel fractional abundances of soil, green vegetation (GV) and non-GV elements. An MLC is developed separately for automatically identifying pixels believed to contain a mixture of the two functional vegetation types, and this then serves as a basis for applying a transform that interprets the LSMA results in terms of sand and pioneer and succession vegetation communities. Very high resolution (0.1 m pixels) colour aerial photography, taken simultaneously with the CASI data, and field survey data from both 1997 and 2009 were used to aid the MLC and the transform algorithm and were also used for a limited validation exercise. The LSMA abundance maps achieved an overall accuracy of 82.7% (kappa coefficient κ = 0.78). The reduced MLC vegetation maps (four classes) achieved an overall accuracy of 98.2% (kappa coefficient κ = 0.96). Although it was not possible to validate the final pioneer and succession vegetation abundance maps quantitatively, a qualitative review of the results for selected locations within the dune field indicates the viability of applying MLC to help direct a transformation of LSMA abundance maps into functional vegetation abundance data.";"Zhang, Li

Although temporal signatures have been used to classify different land-cover types, they have not been fully exploited to classify specific crops, and the influence of low resolution should be evaluated. The aims of this study were to seek an effective method to classify specific crops using the temporal signatures in coarse time-series data and to examine the applicability of the data for crop classification as well. A winter wheat-producing region in China was selected for this case study. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day composite land surface reflectance product (MOD09Q1) data with a 250 m spatial resolution were used to calculate the vegetation index data, which was applied to detect the properties of live green plants. The noise in the time series was filtered to minimize the classification uncertainties. The curve shape in the time-series vegetation index profile was used as the major metric to classify winter wheat, and other phenological metrics extracted from the data were used conjunctly as auxiliary functions to improve the separability. The metrics for winter wheat classification were quantified in the large fields with relatively pure pixels. Winter wheat was successfully extracted from the MODIS vegetation index data, and the MODIS-derived result was validated with a fine-resolution (19.5 m) thematic map derived from images collected by the charge-coupled device sensor on board the China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS). It showed that the MODIS-derived result had inevitable low-resolution bias, and the errors of commission and omission were 32.3 and 33.8%, respectively. The overall classification effect of the MODIS-derived result relied upon the distribution of pixel purity in the study area.";"Sun, Huasheng

We also investigated spatial variation in population trends within the UK.Results Bioclimatic zone and wintering habitat type were the most important determinants of population trend. After accounting for the effects of the other variables, species that spend the winter in southern Africa or the humid tropics of central and western Africa showed more negative population trends than those that winter in the arid zone. Species occupying open and woodland habitats declined and generalist species increased, on average. We also suggest that the effect of bioclimatic zone on population trends may be through constraints on the timing of migration.Conclusion Correlations between population change and both wintering area and winter habitat suggest regional changes in climate or land-use in the humid tropics are driving declines in many long-distance migrant species, possibly partly through migratory constraints.";"Ockendon, Nancy

Many recent studies have observed shifts in vegetation cover, particularly an increase in shrub growth. Here, vegetation changes were assessed at the local scale near Umiujaq, northern Quebec (Canada, 56.55Â°N, 76.55Â°W) using colour aerial photographs (1994 and 2010). By applying semi-automated image classification methods and change-detection analysis, we were able to detect and map the dominant vegetation cover changes. Comparison of classification results shows a 12% increase in shrub cover, loss of nearly 8% of lichen cover, stability of the spruce zones, and disappearance of nearly a quarter of thermokarst ponds. The 2 resulting maps were superimposed to spatialize the change. Change-detection analysis revealed that a shift toward shrub-dominated landscape was the most important change in the 1994 vegetation classes.

In this study, empirical models with regard to land cover and spatial scale were introduced and compared to estimate air temperature from satellite-derived land surface temperature and other environmental parameters. Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and meteorological data obtained throughout 2005 in the Yangtze River Delta were adopted to develop statistical algorithms of air temperature. Four empirical regression models with different forms and different independent variables resulted in errors ranging from 2.20°C to 2.34°C. Considering the different relationships between air temperature and land surface temperature for different land types, these four models were evaluated and the most proper equation for each land-cover type was determined. The model containing these selected equations gave a slightly improved mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.18°C. Then the spatial scale effect of this empirical model was analysed with observed air temperature and spatially averaged land surface characteristics. The result shows that the estimation error of air temperature tends to be lower as spatial window size increases, suggesting that the model performances are improved by spatially averaging land surface characteristics. Comprehensively considering the accuracy and computational demand, 5 × 5 pixel size is the most favourable window size for estimating air temperature. The validation of the empirical model at 5 × 5 pixel size shows that it achieves an MAE of 1.98°C and an R² of 0.9215. This satisfactory result indicates that this approach is proper for estimating air temperature, and spatial window size is an important factor that should be considered when calculating air temperature. It is expected that better accuracy will be achieved if the different weights of pixels at different distances can be set according to high-density micro-meteorological data.";"Xu, Yongming

"AGRIS:US201400148332";"Mapping impervious surface expansion using medium-resolution satellite image time series: a case study in the Yangtze River Delta, China";"";"Cities have been expanding rapidly worldwide, especially over the past few decades. Mapping the dynamic expansion of impervious surface in both space and time is essential for an improved understanding of the urbanization process, land-cover and land-use change, and their impacts on the environment. Landsat and other medium-resolution satellites provide the necessary spatial details and temporal frequency for mapping impervious surface expansion over the past four decades. Since the US Geological Survey opened the historical record of the Landsat image archive for free access in 2008, the decades-old bottleneck of data limitation has gone. Remote-sensing scientists are now rich with data, and the challenge is how to make best use of this precious resource. In this article, we develop an efficient algorithm to map the continuous expansion of impervious surface using a time series of four decades of medium-resolution satellite images. The algorithm is based on a supervised classification of the time-series image stack using a decision tree. Each imerpervious class represents urbanization starting in a different image. The algorithm also allows us to remove inconsistent training samples because impervious expansion is not reversible during the study period. The objective is to extract a time series of complete and consistent impervious surface maps from a corresponding times series of images collected from multiple sensors, and with a minimal amount of image preprocessing effort. The approach was tested in the lower Yangtze River Delta region, one of the fastest urban growth areas in China. Results from nearly four decades of medium-resolution satellite data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) and China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) show a consistent urbanization process that is consistent with economic development plans and policies. The time-series impervious spatial extent maps derived from this study agree well with an existing urban extent polygon data set that was previously developed independently. The overall mapping accuracy was estimated at about 92.5% with 3% commission error and 12% omission error for the impervious type from all images regardless of image quality and initial spatial resolution.";"Gao, Feng

The study used PALSAR 50 m resolution orthorectified HH and HV data. As land-cover discrimination is difficult with only two bands (HH and HV), we added textures as additional information for classification. We calculated both first- and second-order texture features and studied the effects of texture window size, quantization scale and displacement length on discrimination capability. We found that rescaling to a lower number of grey levels (8 or 16) improved discrimination capability and that equal probability quantization was more effective than uniform quantization. Increasing displacement tended to reduce the discrimination capability. Low spatial resolution increased the discrimination capability because low spatial resolution features reduce the effects of noise. A larger number of features also improved discrimination capability. However, the amount of improvement depended on the window size. We used the optimum combination of backscatter amplitude and textures as input data into a supervised multi-resolution maximum likelihood classification. We found that including texture information improved the overall classification accuracy by 10%. However, there was significant confusion between natural forest and acacia plantations, as well as between oil palm and clear cuts, presumably because the backscatter and texture of these class pairs are very similar.";"Rakwatin, Preesan

Their protection and restoration have been one of the top environmental management priorities across the US over the last several years. Despite the level of concern, visibility and management effort, little is known about trends in riparian habitats. Moreover, little is known about whether or not cumulative efforts to restore and protect riparian zones and floodplains are affecting the rates of riparian habitat change nationwide. To address these issues, we analyzed riparian land cover change between the early 1970s and the late 1990s/early 2000s using existing spatial data on hydrography and land cover. This included an analysis of land cover changes within 180 m riparian buffer zones, and at catchment scales, for 42,363 catchments across 63 ecoregions of the continental US. The total amount of forest and natural land cover (forests, shrublands, wetlands) in riparian buffers declined by 0.7 and 0.9%, respectively across the entire study period. Gains in grassland/shrubland accounted for the 0.2% lower percentage of total natural land cover loss relative to forests. Conversely, urban and developed land cover (urban, agriculture, and mechanically disturbed lands) increased by more than 1.3% within riparian buffers across the entire study period. Despite these changes, we documented an opposite trend of increasing proportions of natural and forest land cover in riparian buffers versus the catchment scale. We surmise that this trend might reflect a combination of natural recovery and cumulative efforts to protect riparian ecosystems across the US. However, existing models limit our ability to assess the impacts of these changes on specific ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of changes observed in this study on the sustainability of ecosystem services. We also recommend opportunties for future riparian change assessments.";"Jones, K. Bruce

In this article, we analyze the spatial distribution of multiple-ES indicators at three locations on the pioneer fronts of the Brazilian Amazon. We identify trade-offs and synergies between six ES indicators for soil, vegetation and biodiversity characterization. We also propose spatial representations of multiple-ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, rates of water infiltration into soil, soil chemical quality, soil carbon stocks, biodiversity and richness in Sphingidae). Finally, we discuss three different methods to map them depending on the goals of the maps, arguing that maps lean on objective-oriented approaches. The study is based on remote sensing and sampling data from 135 sampling points. We created multiple-ES indicators maps based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a score of ES richness, and discrimination of land cover units. PCA is an appropriate tool for showing high correlations between indicators, nevertheless has notable limitations for visual communication. The scoring method may help mapping ES hotspots, however it fails to consider relationships among them. The land-cover-based method has the advantage of being simple and easy to interpret, still it may not consider important indicators not related to land-cover changes. We discuss the interests and limitations of these different ways to map multiple-ES indicators, regarding the final goals of the maps.";"Clecâh, Solen Le

"AGRIS:US201300872510";"Environmental impacts of introducing grain legumes into European crop rotations";"";"Raw materials for animal feeding are highly deficient in Europe, which results in massive imports of soya beans from North and South America. These imports are connected with a number of environmental problems. Increasing the grain legume production in Europe could be a promising alternative. The impacts of introducing grain legumes into existing European crop rotations are investigated in this article. The environmental impacts are evaluated by using the SALCA (Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment) life cycle assessment method and the ecoinvent life cycle inventory database. Four regions with potential for increasing their grain legume area were chosen for this study: Saxony-Anhalt (Germany), Barrois (France), Canton Vaud (Switzerland) and Castilla y León (Spain). In each of these regions, two crop rotations were defined: a typical cereal-based rotation without grain legumes and an alternative rotation including grain legumes. The production data were collected by the local project partners from statistics, surveys, literature, documents from extension services and using expert knowledge. The impacts of these two crop rotations were compared relative to three functional units representing different functions of agriculture: hectare per year as a measure of the land management function, [Euro Sign] gross margin 1 for the financial function and GJ gross energy of the harvested biomass for the productive function. The following environmental impacts were analysed: demand for non-renewable energy resources, global warming potential, ozone formation, eutrophication, acidification, terrestrial and aquatic ecotoxicity as well as human toxicity. For Canton Vaud, the impacts on biodiversity and soil quality were assessed in addition. Analysed per unit of cultivated area, the introduction of grain legumes into intensive crop rotations with a high proportion of cereals and intensive N-fertilisation leads to a reduced energy use, global warming potential, ozone formation and acidification as well as eco- and human toxicity. The main reasons for this are a reduced application of N-fertilisers (no N to the grain legume and less N to the following crop), improved possibilities for using reduced tillage techniques and greater diversification of the crop rotation, which helps to reduce problems caused by weeds and pathogens (and therefore pesticide applications). The nitrate leaching potential tends to be higher in general, but can be reduced by including catch crops or early sowing of winter grain legumes, where possible. No differences were found for the impacts of crop management on soil quality and biodiversity (studied in Canton Vaud only). In the low-input crop rotation in Spain, the introduction of peas had no favourable environmental effect, mainly because little or no N-fertiliser can be saved. The analysis per [Euro Sign] gross margin 1 (financial function) leads to slightly more favourable results for the grain legume crop rotations compared to the analysis per ha and year. Due to the lower yields of grain legumes compared with cereals, the advantages of grain legumes are smaller when considered per GJ gross energy of the harvested products (productive function). However, the energy efficiency is higher in crop rotations with grain legumes. On the whole, introducing grain legumes into European crop rotations offers interesting options for reducing environmental burdens, especially in a context of depleted fossil energy resources and climate change.";"Nemecek, Thomas

The study area was the province of Siena, in central Italy. Following a DPSIR approach, the State indicators checked the Impact of agricultural policies (Drivers), which have increased the Pressure of specialized crops, and suggested Response actions. The indicators selected for the catchment scale stressed the consequences of land use change on soil quality, capability and suitability. They were: (1) land use and land cover; (2) soil and water conservation management system, (3) soil hydrological group, (4) land capability; (5) land suitability for wine grape production. At the province level, four original indicators highlighted at the reconnaissance scale the impact of the two crops on soil conservation and management - (6) soil erosion risk, (7) soil management - as well as on visual attractiveness of landscape - (8) slope length of vineyards, (9) crop saturation of the landscape unit and its variation in time. The results showed that, at the catchment level, the twenty-fold increase in specialized viticulture and olive tree cultivation, along with the generalised adoption of the “up and down slope” soil and water conservation system, caused the impairment of soil hydrological group, land capability and suitability for growing quality wine. At the province level, soil erosion risk and soil management difficulty almost doubled in the transition from the traditional mixed to the new specialized tree cultivation. The areas traditionally producing wine protected by appellation of origin (DOCG) determined the distribution of land use and all the other impact indicators. Slope length of vineyards showed that the enlargement of the surface covered by vines preferentially affected lands close to already established DOCG farms. DOCG areas resulted somewhat saturated by vineyards, but not by olive tree groves. The response should foresee the following actions: (i) when planting new olive groves and vineyards, measures should be taken to avoid the complete removal of the subsurface soil B horizon; (ii) new plantations should maintain slope degree of less than 21% in any part of the field; (iii) the shape of new plantations should conform to slope morphology, thus avoiding the creation of long, wide and uniform slopes. The aim should be to limit the length of the fields to less than 150-300m and to adopt or preserve the contour management systems.";"Costantini, Edoardo A.C.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) has used a combination of border measures, domestic policies including direct budgetary payments, regulation and mandated administrative processes to support domestic production.This policy note first provides an overview of the policies that Japan has traditionally used to support its agricultural sector. Following this, new policy developments that seem to signal a shift towards a more decoupled framework are described. Finally, some possible changes in the structure of Japanese agriculture resulting from demographic drivers are outlined.";"Gilmour, Brad

"AGRIS:US201600185710";"Legal barriers to effective ecosystem management: exploring linkages between liability, regulations, and prescribed fire";"";"Resistance to the use of prescribed fire is strong among many private land managers despite the advantages it offers for maintaining fireâadapted ecosystems. Even managers who are aware of the benefits of using prescribed fire as a management tool avoid using it, citing potential liability as a major reason for their aversion. Recognizing the importance of prescribed fire for ecosystem management and the constraints current statutory schemes impose on its use, several states in the United States have undertaken prescribed burn statutory reform. The stated purpose of these statutory reforms, often called âright to burnâ or âprescribed burningâ acts, is to encourage prescribed burning for resource protection, public safety, and land management. Our research assessed the consequences of prescribed burn statutory reform by identifying legal incentives and impediments to prescribed fire application for ecosystem restoration and management, as well as fuel reduction. Specifically, we explored the relationship between prescribed burning laws and decisions made by land managers by exploiting a geographicâbased natural experiment to compare landownerâprescribed fire use in contiguous counties with different regulations and legal liability standards. Controlling for potentially confounding variables, we found that private landowners in counties with gross negligence liability standards burn significantly more hectares than those in counties with simple negligence standards (Fâ,ââ = 4.16, P = 0.046). There was no difference in hectares burned on private land between counties with additional statutorily mandated regulatory requirements and those requiring only a permit to complete a prescribed burn (Fâ,ââ = 1.42, P = 0.24) or between counties with burn ban exemptions for certified prescribed burn managers and those with no exemptions during burn bans (Fâ,ââ = 1.39, P = 0.24). Lawmakers attempting to develop prescribed burning statutes to promote the safe use of prescribed fire should consider the benefits of lower legal liability standards in conjunction with regulatory requirements that promote safety for those managing forests and rangelands with fire. Moreover, ecologists and land managers might be better prepared and motivated to educate stakeholder groups who influence prescribed fire policies if they are cognizant of the manner in which policy regulations and liability concerns create legal barriers that inhibit the implementation of effective ecosystem management strategies.";"Wonkka, Carissa L.

It has a great potential for tourism development due to natural, cultural and historical attractions including national natural monuments as well as three rare phenomena of hot springs, bat cave and bitumen springs. In the current study, TOPSIS and AHP methods were applied to conduct the land capability evaluation study. A total number of 16 criteria and 10 constraints were initially determined and then; each map-layer was standardized using fuzzy and Boolean logics. In order to zoning the study area in terms of ecotourism suitability degrees, the raster layers derived from each environment were overlaid. Based on the obtained suitability degrees, the study area was categorized into three classes and final land capability evaluation map of Dehloran County was prepared. The results obtained from AHP Method indicated that Markazi District has the highest number of polygons with high suitability. The districts of Zarrinabad and Mousian are rated in the next priorities, respectively. According TOPSIS Technique, Markazi with a score of 0.910, Zarinabad with a score of 0.241 and Mousian with a score of 0.037 allocated themselves the first to third ranks, respectively.

It is influenced by a considerable number of factors (including climate, soil, topography, land use and types of land management), so that the information on the spatial distribution of soil erosion rate and its related effects can be effectively employed as a baseline data for land use development and water protection. The principal aim of this study is three-fold: (i) to map existing land use; (ii) to assess and map the spatial distribution of average annual rate of soil losses in the study area; (iii) to evaluate spatial matching between existing and proposed land use including a distance analysis from the water body (the Bili-Bili Dam). An analytical procedures used, respectively, include supervised classification of satellite imagery, application of RUSLE (Revised USLE), and overlay analysis in a raster GIS environment, utilising available information in the region covering some parts of Jeneberang catchment, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The results suggest that the outputs of this study can be used for the identification of land units on a cell-basis with different land use types, rate of soil loss, inconsistency between proposed and planned land use, as well as the threat of land degradation to the main river and the dam. The analytical procedures developed in this research may be useful in other areas, particularly in the studies related to the assessment and mapping of land use and erosion for the importance of sustainable land use at a relatively large area.";"Baja, Sumbangan

The impact of RFFSP on adopting households in terms of interactions of assets and other activities was assessed in a comparison of seed‐producing (RF; n� =� 60) and non‐seed‐producing (NRF; n� =� 58) households that were sampled randomly and ranked as poor, intermediate and better‐off. Adoption of RFFSP was not constrained by illiteracy of the household head, the size or ownership status of ponds, or lack of ownership of land or an irrigation pump. Poorer and intermediate households had smaller RF plots and lower production of fingerlings (kg per household) compared with the better‐off, although production efficiency (kg� ha⁻¹) was higher. Restocking of fingerlings in RF household ponds increased productivity by 60% over NRF. Fish consumption of better‐off RF households exceeded NFR by 50%. Among the poor, seasonal benefits of income from sales and subsistence consumption of fingerlings were significant. Rice production in irrigated, and income in both irrigated and rain‐fed seasons was higher, and production costs lower, in riceplots producing fish than in rice‐only plots. Implications for supporting the innovation networks promoting and establishing RFFSP among rice growers, are discussed.";"Haque, Mohammad Mahfujul

"AGRIS:US201500073051";"relative influence of spatial context and catchment- and site-scale environmental factors on stream fish assemblages in a human-modified landscape";"";"- Environmental factors act in a hierarchical manner at multiple spatial scales to influence the organisation of ecological assemblages; however, the relative influence of the different scale-related factor groups is poorly known. We evaluated the importance of catchment-scale and site-scale environmental variables, as well as the spatial context of the sampling sites, in shaping stream fish assemblages in an agriculture-dominated landscape in Hungary. Beside the variables describing spatial context (principal coordinates of a truncated distance matrix among sites), altogether 60 environmental variables were used to predict variability using a variance-partitioning procedure in redundancy analysis. Presence-absence- and relative abundance-based data were examined at two assemblage levels (entire assemblage and native assemblage) at 54 stream sites. Incorporation of spatial variables increased largely the total explained variability in case of relative abundance, but not for presence-absence data. Of the environmentally explained variance, catchment-scale variables (e.g., land cover types, patch density) were relatively more influential for the native assemblage-level analyses, than for analyses at the entire assemblage level, where site-scale variables (e.g., altitude, depth) proved to be more influential. In addition, pure catchment- and pure site-scale variables have the primary role in determining fish assemblage patterns, whereas the influence of shared variance and that of site-scale riparian variables proved to be less important. Our findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating the spatial context of the sampling sites in predicting fish assemblage patterns and the effects of channelisation (dikes) in shaping assemblage-environment relationships in this human-influenced landscape.";"Sály, Péter

"AGRIS:US201500077685";"Comparing the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic factors as mediators of species’ distributions";"";"Models to predict species’ ranges have chiefly been limited to abiotic variables. However, the full ecological niche depends on a myriad of factors, both biotic and abiotic, that often correspond to completely different data types. We applied a methodology based on data mining techniques to construct ecological niche models composed of biotic as well as abiotic variables using three quite different sets of variables: climatic layers, maps of land cover and point collections of Mexican mammals. We show how potential ecological interactions can be inferred from geographic data using co-occurrences as proxies, and generate corresponding distribution models. We consider two case studies: an insect genus (Lutzomyia sp.) and a mammal species (Lynx rufus). We show that for both examples model predictability is higher using biotic versus abiotic variables, but even higher when both variable types are integrated together. Also, by identifying those variables that are most relevant in describing the suitable (niche) and unsuitable (anti-niche) areas we can establish an ecological profile for any geographic location and quantify the relative influence of each location and its impact on species. In conclusion, we show that including both abiotic and biotic factors not only leads to a fuller more comprehensive understanding of the niche, but also leads to more accurate prediction models.";"González-Salazar, Constantino

In the north of Senegal, the Ferlo geographical space is representative of cohabitation between sylvopastoral and agricultural production systems, within which the pastoral activity is maintained under conflictual conditions as traditional complementarities between agricultural and pastoral production systems, or between pastors and communities, tend to deteriorate under land pressure. Such pressure operates for a variety of often divergent goals displaying tangible transformation indicators with social economic and environmental conversion such as illegal land access plurality, disputes and trouble in land allocation, landscape fragmentation and agricultural territory and pastoral restructuring. It is also within this framework that territory decentralisation and development policies have transferred to stakeholders the power to administer, exploit and manage natural resources and lands under their jurisdiction so as to strengthen local governance and respond to sustainable development needs of production systems. The experiment shown in this case study deals with the process of co-building and setting up tools and simulation models in order to accompany and instruct decision making by local communities responsible for applying the law 64-46 of 06 June 1964. The different steps of this participative approach leading to the “AIDA” agent model design and scenarios have been put forward, tested and evaluated by the users.

L’état actuel des paysages et des territoires sahéliens est la résultante d’interactions entre facteurs écoclimatiques, socio-économiques et politiques, à l’oeuvre depuis plus de quatre décennies. Au nord du Sénégal, l’espace géographique du Ferlo est représentatif d’une cohabitation entre des systèmes de production agrosylvopastoraux dans laquelle l’activité pastorale se maintient en compétition avec les autres, car les complémentarités anciennes entre systèmes de production agricoles et pastoraux, ou entre pasteurs et collectivite ´, tendent à se dégrader sous la pression foncière. Ces forces de pression aux intérêts quelques fois divergents ont comme indicateurs de transformation tangibles : la conversion socio-économique et environnementale ; la pluralité des modes d’accès à la terre en dehors du cadre légal ; les litiges et difficultés dans l’affectation des terres ; la fragmentation des paysages ; la restructuration agricole et pastorale des territoires. C’est aussi dans ce contexte que les politiques de décentralisation et d’aménagement du territoire ont transféré aux collectivités territoriales le pouvoir d’administrer, d’exploiter et de gérer les ressources naturelles et le foncier, afin de renforcer la gouvernance locale et de répondre aux enjeux de développement durable des systèmes de production. L’expé- rience présentée ici traite du processus de coconstruction et de mise en oeuvre d’un outil de simulation pour accompagner et instruire les prises de décision des collectivités locales chargées de l’application de la loi sur le domaine national. Les différentes étapes de cette démarche participative qui ont conduit à la conception, au test et à l’évaluation par les utilisateurs du modèle AIDA et de ses scénarios sont présentées.";"Bah, Alassane

However, few studies have been conducted in a large basin to determine the sources and causal factors of N and P from multiple land use and soil types. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied in support of the Small-scale Watershed Extended Method (SWEM) in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR), China. The first-order error analysis (FOEA) was used to identify the key sub-processes that affected the occurrence of NPS pollution. Based on this study, runoff from the dry land and paddy fields was enriched with nutrients, while runoff from purplish soils, paddy soils and yellow earths made up the largest amount of nutrient loads. The results showed that the contributions of individual parameters to the total uncertainty were different among land use and soil types. This study indicated that management efforts for dry land must explicitly account for conservation practices and proper land covers, while conscientious fertilization practices would result in a greater decrease of NPS yields for paddy fields. Grazing practices should be considered for the purpose of N management for yellow earths, while plant density is important to control soil erosion for purple soils.";"Shen, Zhenyao

The aim of the study was to identify abiotic stresses impeding plant establishment and test transplanting of salt-tolerant wetland plants. The site consisted of long cambered rectangular fields that sloped down (2%) to the drainage ditches on both sides. Across this slope, zones were delineated based on moisture gradient as: Up-areas (drier), Mid-areas (moist) and Low-areas (wet). Juncus balticus was transplanted to these zones in August 2004 whereas Spartina pectinata was reintroduced in June 2005. Plant material was collected from nearby marshes. Survival of J. balticus in August 2005 was poorest at the Low-areas probably because of the early season flooded conditions of that zone. S. pectinata survival in June 2006 was good in all zones having better adaptation to early season waterlogged conditions. Early season waterlogged conditions resulted from a perched water table (May-June) and were alleviated only upon the complete thaw of the frozen peat layer on 8 July. Thereafter, important changes in peat characteristics occurred: lowered water table depths that increased redox potentials, decreased moisture content (θ) that increased dry bulk density (ρ), and increased electrical conductivity (EC) that decreased pH. Waterlogged conditions were of greater magnitude and duration at the Low-areas but salinity levels were highest in the Up-areas and Mid-areas. We conclude that local conditions of waterlogging (especially in the Low-areas) and high salinity and low pH (notably in the Up- and Mid-areas) favoured the survival of S. pectinata in all areas and J. balticus in Up- and Mid-areas only.";"Montemayor, Marilou B.

Due to mismanagement of information and bad definition of goals by the government, a massive interest in acquiring communal lands started in the Peninsula of Santa Elena (PSE) after the government announced the construction plan of a large public irrigation system. During this process, information asymmetries regarding the potential of the irrigation system always prevailed in favor of land buyers. After eight years of functioning of the irrigation system, less than 20 percent of its capacity is in use. This leads to a situation in which the operation and maintenance of the canals is not appropriate, thus endangering sustainability of agriculture itself. This paper starts from the hypothesis that AI has an important impact over the observed pattern of land use and therefore irrigation in the PSE. Under the condition of AI for public goods with costly access, a test was conducted to determine which of the characteristics for an optimal allocation fits in the case of the PSE. Farmer's marginal cost of access to irrigation in connection with the concentration of the property of land by new landholders is considered the relevant informational variable. The most important result of this paper is that the presence of AI induces a scenario in which new landholders demand a smaller quantity of irrigation because of the high marginal costs of farming on big farm plots. A second important result suggests that subsidies to new landowners through the provision of irrigation appear to increase inequality with respect to peasant-commoners.";"Herrera, P.A.

"AGRIS:US2016210926";"Conservation Payments: Challenges in Design and Implementation";"";"As Congress develops new farm legislation, some are lobbying for a new partnership between U.S. taxpayers and farmers. In exchange for an annual transfer of $10 to $20 billion from taxpayers to agriculture, farmers would do much more to enhance environmental quality. An attractive feature of a new partnership is that paying for an improved environment provides a clear and justifiable rationale for farm program payments, something that is lacking under current farm programs. By changing management practices and land use, farmers can provide cleaner water, cleaner air, better wildlife habitat, lower net greenhouse gas emissions, and improved long-run soil quality. Private profit maximizers largely ignore the value of these environmental goods. Hence, the goods are underprovided. Having government step in to increase their supply may increase economic efficiency. New, highly funded conservation payment programs for agriculture could achieve both the current income support objective of farm programs as well as environmental objectives if program payments are targeted to achieve environmental benefits rather than targeted to low-income producers. Significant reductions in environmental benefits will occur if payment limits or means testing is used to target payments, unless low-income farmers provide the highest environmental benefits. For many farms, the potential quantity of environmental benefits that can be produced is proportionate to farm acreage. The two basic approaches to conservation payments are (1) voluntary programs that pay farmers for specifications they take, and (2) programs that penalize farmers with taxes or disqualification from other program benefits if prescribed actions are not followed. The first approach is preferred if agricultural income enhancement is a goal. Also, it is doubtful that the second approach is political feasible given that farmers will be asked to give up the ""no strings"" income support they have enjoyed in recent years. Past conservation programs have taught us three key lessons. The first is that making payments based on environmental benefit-to-cost ratios can greatly enhance program efficiency by either cutting the cost of meeting an environmental objective or by greatly increasing the amount of environmental benefits that can be obtained from a given expenditure. Second, adequate verification, monitoring, and enforcement programs will need to be put in place if the promised environmental benefits are to be realized. And third, land set-asides are the most costly way of obtaining environmental benefits. When possible, it is more efficient to encourage productive use of land rather than to retire land. So, for example, instead of paying a farmer to remove land from production in order to reduce nitrate water pollution, a program would pay the farmer to adopt practices that reduce the risk of fertilizer runoff.";"Babcock, Bruce A.

"AGRIS:US201400103051";"Farmers’ perceptions of climate variability and barriers to adaptation: lessons learned from an exploratory study in Vietnam";"";"Southeast Asian countries are confronting climate variability, challenging agricultural sustainability and rural livelihoods. However, little research effort has been devoted to exploring how farmers in those countries perceive climate variability and how the perceptions link to adaptive responses. This paper deploys information from three focus group discussions with 30 male farmers; and six in-depth interviews with one female and five male agricultural officers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Recorded 34-year meteorological data in the delta from 1978 to 2011 is also incorporated to demonstrate the actual climate variability of the region. We find that farmers are becoming increasingly conscious of local climate variability issues. However, they have limited understanding of the importance of adaptation to their livelihoods. They also have limited knowledge of where and who to contact for appropriate climate change adaptation information. No opinions about the link between global warming and local climate variability and change were observed. Casual observation via public media and personal experience dominated farmers’ sources of information. Barriers to farmers’ adaptation are not exclusively restricted to socio-economic factors and resource constraints; e.g. land tenure, technical knowledge, market, social relationship, credit, information, health care, and demographics. Maladaptation, habit, and the perception of the importance of climate variability and adaptation are found as additional constraints. Observed differences in farmers’ and agricultural officers’ perspectives regarding barriers to farmers’ adaptation suggest important policy implications.";"Le Dang, Hoa

"AGRIS:US2016210922";"Economic Reason for Cultivated Land Circulation";"";"Characteristics of interest subjects in land circulation market of rural China are introduced, which are land supplier (peasant household) and requester (large household). It is pointed out that due to the poor management capacity and market adaptability, peasant household may rent some or all the contracted land in the form of subcontract if someone is willing to offer a higher rent. Having high comprehensive quality, large households may introduce new agricultural technology on time. They are good at operating efficient agriculture and scale agriculture and have strong market adaptability and business decision-making skill. Through establishing the cost-benefit function, cost benefit of rural land circulation subject is analyzed and the economic reason of rural land circulation is discussed. Result shows that rural land circulation is the expected analysis of cost benefit by relevant subjects driven by economic benefits, in order to realize the optimum allocation of efficiency. Only when the interests of relevant subjects are ensured or improved, can rural land circulation be carried out smoothly. Finally, suggestions are put forward, such as ensuring the price rise of agricultural products, promoting the development of agricultural science and technology, reducing the circulation cost and enhancing the formation of agricultural scale in order to promote the rapid, orderly and healthy development of rural land circulation.";"Liu, Yang

"AGRIS:US201300745358";"Assessing extinction risk in the absence of species-level data: quantitative criteria for terrestrial ecosystems";"";"The conservation of individual plant and animal species has been advanced greatly by the World Conservation Union's (IUCN) development of objective, repeatable, and transparent criteria for assessing extinction risk, which explicitly separate the process of risk assessment from priority-setting. Here we present an analogous procedure for assessing the extinction risk of terrestrial ecosystems, which may complement traditional species-specific risk assessments, or may provide an alternative when only landscape-level data are available. We developed four quantitative risk criteria, derived primarily from remotely sensed spatial data, information on one of which must be available to permit classification. Using a naming system analogous to the present IUCN species-specific system, our four criteria were: (A) reduction of land cover and continuing threat, (B) rapid rate of land cover change, (C) increased fragmentation, and (D) highly restricted geographical distribution. We applied these criteria to five ecosystems covering a range of spatial and temporal scales, regions of the world, and ecosystem types, and found that Indonesian Borneo's lowland tropical forests and the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest were Critically Endangered, while South Africa's grasslands and Brazil's Mato Grosso were Vulnerable. Furthermore, at a finer grain of analysis, one region of Venezuela's coastal dry forests (Margarita Island) qualified as Vulnerable, while another (the Guasare River watershed) was Critically Endangered. In northern Venezuela, deciduous forests were classified as Endangered, semi-deciduous forests Vulnerable, and evergreen forests of Least Concern. We conclude that adoption of such a standardized system will facilitate globally comparable, repeatable geographic analyses that clearly separate risk assessment (a fundamentally scientific process), from the definition of conservation priorities, which should take into account additional factors, such as ecological distinctiveness, costs, logistics, likelihood of success, and societal preferences.";"Rodríguez, Jon Paul

"AGRIS:US201600069235";"New Super Resolution Mapping Algorithm by Combining Pixel and Subpixel-Level Spatial Dependences With Colorimetry";"";"Super resolution mapping is a continuously growing area of remote sensing. Satellite images coupled with a very high spectral resolution, and are suitable for detection and classification of surfaces and different elements in the observed image. The main problem with high resolution data for these applications is the (relatively) low spatial resolution, which can vary from a few to tens of meters. In the case of classification purposes, the major problem caused by low spatial resolution is related to subpixels, i.e., pixels in the image where more than one land cover class is within the same pixel. In such a case, the pixel cannot be considered as belonging to just one class, and the assignment of the pixel to a single class will inevitably lead to a loss of information, no matter what class is chosen. A new super resolution mapping (SRM) algorithm by combining pixel and subpixel-level spatial dependences with colorimetry is proposed in this paper. The pixel-level dependence is measured by the spatial attraction model with either surrounding or quadrant neighborhood, while the subpixel-level dependence is characterized by either the mean filter or the exponential weighting function. Both pixel-level and subpixel-level dependences are then fused as the weighted dependence for quickly obtaining the optimal spatial distribution of subpixels by employing the colorimetric algorithm. Synthetic imagery and a QuickBird image are tested for validation of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve results with greater accuracy than two traditional subpixel mapping (SPM) methods and the mixed spatial attraction model method. Meanwhile, the proposed method needs considerably less computation time than the conventional mixed spatial attraction model method, and hence it provides a new solution to subpixel land cover mapping.";"Merugu, Suresh

It causes problems in image segmentation and misclassification (snow with other land cover). This perception leads to develop an empirical-statistical based topographic correction (ESbTC) algorithm for reflectance modeling after compared with existed topographic correction methods like Cosine correction, C-correction, Minnaert correction, sun–canopy–senor with c-correction (SCS + C) and slope matching, in the context of snow reflectance. An image based atmospheric correction has used in present study included dark-object subtraction (DOS) and effect of Rayleigh scattering on the transmissivity in different spectral bands of AWiFS and MODIS image data. The performance of different models is evaluated using (1) visual analysis, (2) change in snow reflectance on sunny and shady slopes after the corrections, (3) validation with in situ observations and (4) graphical analysis. Further snow cover area (SCA) has been estimated with normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and validated with support vector machine (SVM), a supervised classification technique. The result shows that the proposed algorithm (ESbTC) and slope-matching technique could eliminate most of the shadowing effects in Himalayan rugged terrain and correctly estimate snow reflectance from AWiFS and MODIS imagery as compared with in situ observations whereas other methods significantly underestimate reflectance values after the corrections.";"Singh, Manjeet

An aspect of competitiveness is the gains in economic efficiency. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to estimate indicators of farm efficiency for the period 1989 to 2008 by farm type and to analyse what the effect on efficiency of changes in the CAP has been. In terms of the methodology, the information used comes from the Scottish Farm Account Scheme (FAS) survey, which allows us to assemble panel dataset and to construct cost efficiency indicators. The results indicate while mixed farms and lowland farms have maintain their levels of efficiency. LFAfarms have seen their efficiency reduced since approximately 2004 or 2005 (especially LFA sheep farm specialists). Also, the analysis shows that there seems to be an increase in the dispersion of farmers in terms of efficiency for some farm types in periods of change in agricultural policy.";"Revoredo-Giha, Cesar

"AGRIS:US201400088227";"Assessing the influence of geography, land cover and host species on the local abundance of a generalist brood parasite, the brown‐headed cowbird";"";"AIM: The brown‐headed cowbird is an obligate brood parasite known to exploit a large number of host species and use a variety of habitats. Much attention has been directed towards uncovering the fundamental factors that affect cowbird abundance; however, no study has evaluated these factors in the context of a biogeographic‐scale analysis that takes into account spatial autocorrelation. Our primary objective was to compare the relative influence of geography, land cover and host species on the local abundance of cowbirds. LOCATION: Great Plains region of the USA. METHODS: We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and the National Land Cover Database to examine the relationships between cowbird abundance and host species, land cover composition and geographic location of a survey route. Multiple regression models were developed for various combinations of these factors. To control for spatial autocorrelation, we used SAM 4.0 (Spatial Analysis in Macroecology) software to implement simultaneous autoregressive modelling of the error term. We then used a model comparison approach to identify the factors that most influence cowbird abundance. RESULTS: Among all models examined, host species richness was the single most strong predictor and the sole statistically significant predictor. Cowbird abundance increased with host species richness but did not change in any significant way with non‐host passerine richness or abundance of host species. Models with land cover variables tended to have the poorest fit to the cowbird abundance data. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cowbirds may be attracted to areas with greater host richness and/or recruit better in such areas, although our data did not allow direct examination of either process. In a greater context, our study demonstrates the utility of a spatially based and geographically extensive analysis in finding range‐wide factors that affect the local abundance of a species.";"Cummings, Katherine

"AGRIS:US201500217974";"decision framework for wetland management in a river basin context: The “Abras de Mantequilla” case study in the Guayas River Basin, Ecuador";"";"The paper presents the development and implementation of a decision support system (DSS) for wetland management in a river basin context under data scarce conditions. It is shown that by combining hydrological, socioeconomic, institutional and biological indicators in a participative approach, a better understanding of the interactions between the different factors affecting the “wetland socio-ecological system conditions” can be created. For this purpose, mathematical models, expert judgment and stakeholder preferences were combined into an integrated DSS framework. The DSS for the Abras de Mantequilla-Guayas Basin environment was derived from a generic, conceptual Decision Support Framework developed and proposed within the WETWin project, taking into consideration the specific conditions at the case study site. Standard methodologies for the characterization of wetland ecosystem services were applied and used to evaluate the effects of potential management solutions using appropriate criteria to assess the trade-offs. In order to account for the interactions between the river catchment and the wetland system, an embedded modeling framework was adopted in which coupled models for rainfall-runoff and hydrodynamics including the wetland and its adjacent rivers provided the inputs to a water allocation model. Using these tools, several management solutions were evaluated, including a baseline scenario where climate changes were combined with the effects of major infrastructure works that are presently envisaged by the local water authority. As a complementary tool for indicators based on poor quantitative data, expert elicitation was incorporated in the decision making process to capture the potential socioeconomic, institutional and ecological impacts of the various management alternatives. Simultaneously, stakeholder consultation (both users and decision markers) was carried out to derive current and future sets of preferences thus determining the criteria weight sets for different user groups. All these elements served as inputs to the DSS choice phase in order to provide a ranking of the proposed management solutions under each management criterion. At present, the option dealing with a moderate landuse substitution and reforestation was the preferred one by local stakeholders. In the future, there could well be an agreement between local actors and governmental agencies when their interests move closer toward more environmentally sustainable landuse. This decision support methodology may facilitate further negotiations toward a sustainable wetland system.";"Arias-Hidalgo, M.

"AGRIS:US201400063070";"10-Year Study on Techniques for Vegetation Restoration in a Desertified Salt Lake Area";"";"Vegetation restoration is one of the most common and effective ways to combat desertification and prevent adjacent areas from sand encroachment in many of the desertified regions of the world. However, vegetation restoration in desertified regions is very difficult because of low rainfall, the mobile ground surface, and cost. An effective, low-cost method of afforestation is urgently required. To determine such a method, a 10-year study was carried out in the Jilantai Salt Lake area. Five different afforestation areas were established: a ‘comparison area,’ a ‘land enclosure area,’ a ‘land enclosure + irrigation area,’ a ‘leveled-afforestation area’ (the dune areas were leveled and then planted with seedlings with added irrigation), and a ‘protected afforestation area’ (the dune areas were planted with seedlings, and the surviving natural vegetation was protected as much as possible). Vegetation-related parameters (survival rate, height, trunk diameter, coverage, canopy size, and density) and environment-related factors (relative humidity, wind velocity, and amount of sand encroachment) were measured by standard methods. Results show that the protected afforestation method had the following advantages: (1) the survival rate was higher for seedlings planted in the protected afforestation area than in the leveled afforestation area; (2) vigor (height, trunk diameter, coverage, and canopy size) was better in seedlings planted in the protected afforestation area than in the leveled afforestation area, especially in the beginning period of revegetation; (3) coverage (of individual species, of all planted vegetation, and of all vegetation) was larger in the protected afforestation area than in the leveled afforestation area; (4) density of naturally germinated plant species was higher in the protected afforestation area than in the other areas, showing that the protected afforestation method provided a suitable growing environment not only for planted species but also for naturally growing species; (5) in the protected vegetation area, relative humidity of air increased and wind velocity was greatly reduced; (6) after the establishment of vegetation by the protected afforestation method, sand encroachment into the salt lake area was significantly reduced. These results suggest that protected afforestation is an effective method of vegetation rehabilitation that has the potential not only to be applied to arid lands in China but also to desertified areas throughout the world; (7) cost-effective calculation shows that the leveled afforestation area costs much more than other areas.";"Gao, Yong

"AGRIS:US201500226006";"Landscape‐scale habitat availability, and not local geography, predicts migratory landbird stopover across the Gulf of Maine";"";"While it is clear that many migratory behaviors are shared across taxa, generalizable models that predict the distribution and abundance of migrating taxa at the landscape scale are rare. In migratory landbirds, ephemeral concentrations of refueling birds indicate that individual behaviors sometimes produce large epiphenomena in particular geographic locations. Identifying landscape factors that predict the distribution and abundance of birds during migratory stopover will both improve our understanding of the migratory process and assist in broad, regionally relevant conservation. In this study we used autumnal passerine stopover data from a five‐year period and eleven stopover sites across coastal Maine, USA, to test four broad hypotheses of migrant distribution and abundance that have been supported in other regions: a) the community characteristics of the pool of potential migrants, b) a site's local geography, c) landscape composition and configuration measured at different spatial scales, and d) interactions between these factors. Our final model revealed that birds concentrate at ‘habitat islands’, sites that possess a disproportionate percentage of the vegetated habitat in the 4‐km surrounding landscape. The strength of this pattern, however, was inversely proportional to a species' remaining migratory distance. Our results corroborate several studies that emphasize the importance of land cover composition at finer spatial scales (< 80 km²) for predicting the stopover distribution and abundances of migratory birds. This suggests that different migrants likely assess stopover sites with similar mechanisms along their migratory route, and these commonalities may be broadly applied to identify stopover locations of conservation importance across the continent.";"McCabe, Jennifer D.

Land-use changes driven by urbanization throughout this region could have a disproportionate impact on remaining natural areas, particularly forests. We used readily available data sets and software to assess land cover change for four municipalities in Iowa and to examine the usefulness of this approach for urban foresters and planners interested in understanding/predicting impacts of land cover change. Urban land cover increased by 28-80% in the communities we examined, primarily because of transitions from grassland and cropland. Although net increases in forest cover occurred in three study areas, significant losses of mature forest cover were masked by transitions of grassland and wetland to early successional forests and by canopy closure within urban land cover types. These analyses could be useful to inform land-use change decisionmaking.";"Bowman, Troy A.

"AGRIS:US201500015711";"Model-based analysis of the environmental impacts of grazing management on Eastern Mediterranean ecosystems in Jordan";"";"Eastern Mediterranean ecosystems are prone to desertification when under grazing pressure. Therefore, management of grazing intensity plays a crucial role to avoid or to diminish land degradation and to sustain both livelihoods and ecosystem functioning. The dynamic land-use model LandSHIFT was applied to a case study on the country level for Jordan. The impacts of different stocking densities on the environment were assessed through a set of simulation experiments for various combinations of climate input and assumptions about the development of livestock numbers. Indicators used for the analysis include a set of landscape metrics to account for habitat fragmentation and the “Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production” (HANPP), i.e., the difference between the amount of net primary production (NPP) that would be available in a natural ecosystem and the amount of NPP that remains under human management. Additionally, the potential of the economic valuation of ecosystem services, including landscape and grazing services, as an analysis concept was explored. We found that lower management intensities had a positive effect on HANPP but at the same time resulted in a strong increase of grazing area. This effect was even more pronounced under climate change due to a predominantly negative effect on the biomass productivity of grazing land. Also Landscape metrics tend to indicate decreasing habitat fragmentation as a consequence of lower grazing pressure. The valuation of ecosystem services revealed that low grazing intensity can lead to a comparatively higher economic value on the country level average. The results from our study underline the importance of considering grazing management as an important factor to manage dry-land ecosystems in a sustainable manner.";"Schaldach, Rüdiger

For this purpose we developed the web-based tool Letsmap do Brasil. The tool has two principal layers. The upper layer contains information on land use and its effect on LPF, i.e. sediment retention, runoff control, nitrogen loss control and agronomic value. The parameterized relation between land use and LPF is the core of the whole system. For each LPF a value specific to land use has been assigned. A second layer contains information on landscape properties and potentials (LPP), e.g. potential for sediment input in river networks and runoff potential. By linking land use and LPPs the system provides a spatially explicit assessment of effects of LULCC on landscape processes and functions (LPF). Letsmap do Brasil might have two major purposes. (1) It will support decision-making in river basin management and sediment management. By creating their own land-use/cover pattern non-expert users are enabled to test effects of LULCC on LPFs. (2) It will support and train non-experts to participate in decision processes in land-use planning.

Participants had a range of enterprises (dairy, beef/sheep grazing, cropping, lifestyle land use), property sizes and computer ownership and expertise. A follow up study was conducted with 12 dairy farmers, where features regarding assessment of nutrient losses from paddocks (Farm Nutrient Loss Index, FNLI) were added to eFarmer. Over 27,000 maps (including 11,000 with aerial photography) were accessed by Land Managers during a 5-month trial period. Despite limited training and support, 1350 people are registered users, and approximately 700 have actively used the tool. Reasons for the success include providing improved access to spatial information, enabling measurement of farm features and creation of farm maps, providing a basis for decision-making about farm inputs, support for better farm and landscape scale action planning and production and Land Managers being able to seek management advice from the extension staff who facilitated eFarmer testing programs. For dairy farmers in the FNLI trial, awareness of off-site impacts increased and most changed management practices. Provision of on-going training and support will be at least as important as further development of the tool itself. Web-based spatial information tools have potential to improve the awareness of Land Managers about their environmental impacts and influence their decision-making. Access to spatial information has potential to reduce information asymmetry between Land Managers, extension staff and catchment planners in a constructive way. It will also change the role of extension staff away from being an expert with answers, to a facilitator enabling learning. Results have applicability in countries where there is a high level of farm computer ownership, relevant spatial information is available in GIS format, where governments are happy to make spatial information available to the public and there is pressure for increased environmental awareness and improved decision making by Land Managers.";"Roberts, Anna M.

Between November 2011 and October 2012, there was on average 50% greater microbial biomass carbon (C) measured by the fumigation extraction procedure under M. laosensis than under C. lanceolata. A one-time measurement of phospholipid fatty acids in soil samples collected in May 2012 suggested M. laosensis plots had greater content of individual lipid biomarkers than C. lanceolata plots. Using a litter manipulation experiment, we found that the increases in content of lipid biomarkers under M. laosensis can be attributed to changed litter chemistry. Analysis of soil mineral N pools indicated that there were significantly lower [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] pools as well as potential net N mineralization rates in M. laosensis soil than in C. lanceolata soil. The relationships among N dynamics, soil chemistry and microbial properties were analysed. The results suggested tree species induced differences in soil N mineralization rates and mineral N pools were related to labile C availability, soil C:N ratio and the composition of the microbial community. Our data of mineral N pools and soil δ¹⁵N implied that the transition of land use from C. lanceolata to M. laosensis leads to an enhanced N retention in the plantation.";"Huang, Zhiqun

These changes may pose significant risks to estuarine fauna, including crustaceans. Several studies have shown relationships between land use classification and levels of stress in estuarine populations. The grass shrimp of the genus Palaemonetes is one of the dominant species found in estuarine tidal creeks, accounting for more than 50� % of all macropelagic fauna. Grass shrimp populations were sampled monthly for 3� years at six estuarine creeks on Kiawah Island, SC. Creek watersheds were estimated using National Aerial Photograph Program color infrared and low-altitude true color aerial photography combined with in situ differentially corrected global positioning system mapping of engineered features. Land classifications delineated included water, marsh, buildings, roads, and lawns. Pairwise comparisons for grass shrimp densities among sites showed significant differences on an annual and seasonal basis. Significant relationships (p < 0.05) between land class variables and grass shrimp density were identified both annually and seasonally. These findings suggest an influence of land use on Palaemonetes spp. populations.";"Daugomah, James W.

In Colorado's Upper Gunnison River Basin, ranchers own the majority of water rights and productive river bottoms as well as approximately 30% of the most important GUSG habitat. This project used mixed-methods interviews with 41 ranch owners to document how ranchers perceive the proposed ESA listing and how they plan to respond to a listing decision. Results show that ranchers support on-the-ground GUSG conservation but are concerned about listing implications. Ranchers are most concerned about their ability to manage public and private lands productively and continue permitted grazing on public lands. If the species is listed, landowners plan to decrease participation in conservation strategies, including plans to adopt conservation easements, participation in conservation programs, and willingness to allow access to private lands for GUSG monitoring. Land-owners also express plans for increased sales of land and water, which could have negative consequences for GUSG habitat. This research suggests that changes in the application of the ESA could lead to beneficial conservation outcomes. These changes include increased transparency, ability to exclude stable populations from listing under the ESA, and commitment to work with local bodies if the species is listed. This project demonstrates the importance of qualitative research for understanding the indirect and unintended effects of species protections in an increasingly interconnected world.";"Knapp, Corrine N.

We supply a set of climate impact scenarios on agricultural land productivity derived from two climate models and two biophysical crop growth models to account for some of the uncertainty inherent in climate and impact models. Aggregation in space and time leads to information losses that can determine climate change impacts on agricultural markets and land‐use patterns because often aggregation is across steep gradients from low to high impacts or from increases to decreases. The four climate change impact scenarios supplied here were designed to represent the most significant impacts (high emission scenario only, assumed ineffectiveness of carbon dioxide fertilization on agricultural yields, no adjustments in management) but are consistent with the assumption that changes in agricultural practices are covered in the economic models. Globally, production of individual crops decrease by 10–38% under these climate change scenarios, with large uncertainties in spatial patterns that are determined by both the uncertainty in climate projections and the choice of impact model. This uncertainty in climate impact on crop productivity needs to be considered by economic assessments of climate change.";"Müller, Christoph

"AGRIS:QL2012002497";"Water rights and the processes of negotiations among irrigators in West Shewa Zone: the case of Indris Scheme in Toke Kutaye District";"";"Though water rights are at the core of exploiting water resources for irrigation purposes, trivial concerns were offered to the case of Indris irrigation scheme in Toke Kutaye district in West Shewa. The historical background and development of the scheme has been presented in a contentious manner. The augmenting number of competitors too paved the way for conflicts that recurrently erupt out and inevitably lead to a succession of negotiation processes. With the inception of such missing gaps, this research aimed to scrutinize water rights and the processes of negotiations among irrigators along Indris modern scheme, in Toke Kutaye district. To maintain this objective, qualitative research methods were predominantly utilized as the main data generating tools in the field. The findings of the research depicted that Indris scheme marked three significant phases in its historical development. In these phases, explorations pertaining to water rights and processes of negotiations were found to be at their immature ground. While the elements of the riparian doctrine of water rights preponderated during its initial phase, the components of appropriative doctrine pronounced more at its middle age. A mix of ingredients from both doctrines interwoven with certain extra requirements determined the water right access of users since the conversion of the scheme into a modern style. Multiple water right rules emanating both from the customary and formal water acts have co-existed to direct the actions of users. In this regard, the theoretical orientations of legal pluralism in water right paradigms proved to coincide with the pragmatic contexts of water users from the scheme. Conflicts in connection to irrigation water use and rights that have escalated over years have been attributed to the decline in the volume of water resources, institutional failures to address the causes adequately, week observance on governing water right rules and increasing demand of users. As a result, negotiation processes aiming to settle disputes were repeatedly initiated either by users, committee members (elders) or courts. The procedures pursed to narrow competing interests around the scheme confirmed the pragmatic applicability of the central arguments of both cyclical and developmental models of negotiation processes discussed comprehensively by Gulliver. Thus, in the face of increasing demands on a declining water resource, the findings of this research revealed out that concerned individuals or relevant institutions need to exert further endeavor on the formulation of water policies that clearly stipulate specific irrigation water entitlements of users. Enforcements on the frame of references set on the water manual need to be rigorously checked on practical implementations. Awareness buildings on irrigation water right claims, promotion of negotiated approaches in disputes and accentuation on customary rules of resource use constituted the dimensions seeking meticulous considerations in prospect.";"Zeleke, T.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"water rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QL2012002497";"http://publications.iwmi.org/pdf/H044097.pdf";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US201400135457";"Making use of the ecosystem services concept in regional planning—trade-offs from reducing water erosion";"";"In this article we demonstrate how to integrate the ecosystem services concept into regional planning using the example of a case study in Saxony, Germany. We analysed how the reduction of water erosion as a regulating service impacts six other ecosystem services. Ecological integrity, provisioning services (provision of food and fibre, provision of biomass), regulating services (soil erosion protection, drought-risk regulation, flood regulation), and the cultural service landscape aesthetics are taken into account. Using a decision support software, we found that the greening of preferential discharge paths can reduce water erosion by 2–7� %. The introduction of hedgerows and the change in the soil management system from tillage to no-till practices revealed a reduction in the total soil loss by 33 and 89� %, respectively. A combination of the three erosion control measures—greening, hedgerows, and no-till management—reduced the soil loss most efficiently by 92� %. We found synergies between the measures for reducing erosion and the provision of ecological integrity, of regulating and cultural ecosystem services. In contrast, the impact on provisioning services was slightly negative. For the land use planning in the case study region we recommend therefore a combination of greening, hedges, and management change. We found that the applied integrated ecosystem services assessment approach, in combination with stakeholder involvement in the scenario development, helped communicating cross-sectoral effects of different management strategies in a comprehensive way and therefore supports regional planning.";"Frank, Susanne

"AGRIS:US201500010125";"Managing carbon in a multiple use world: The implications of land-use decision context for carbon management";"";"Human land use contributes significantly to the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Changes in land management practices have been proposed as a critical and cost-effective mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the storage of additional carbon in vegetation and soils. However many discussions of the potential for land use to mitigate climate change only take into account biophysical factors such as vegetation and land cover and neglect how the agency of land owners themselves affects whether additional carbon storage can be achieved. Unlike many potential REDD opportunities in developing countries, land management in the U.S. to enhance carbon sequestration would occur against a backdrop of clearly defined, legally enforceable land ownership. In addition, more than a third of the land surface in the U.S. is managed by federal agencies who operate under legal guidelines for multiple use and is subject to demands from multiple constituencies. We set out to investigate how the goal of enhancing carbon sequestration through land use is perceived or implemented in one region of the U.S., and how this goal might intersect the existing drivers and incentives for public and private land use decision making. We conducted a case study through interviews of the major categories of landowners in the state of Colorado, which represents a mixture of public and privately held lands. By analyzing trends in interview responses across categories, we found that managing for carbon is currently a fairly low priority and we identify several barriers to more widespread consideration of carbon as a management priority including competing objectives, limited resources, lack of information, negative perceptions of offsetting and lack of a sufficient policy signal. We suggest four avenues for enhancing the potential for carbon to be managed through land use including clarifying mandates for public lands, providing compelling incentives for private landowners, improving understanding of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of managing for carbon, and creating more usable science to support decision making.";"Dilling, Lisa

This can have implications for mitigation policies. This study combined detailed pathway studies with catchment integrated studies to characterise N and P transfer pathways for four agricultural catchments with different land management, soil drainage and geology. A Loadograph Recession Analysis (LRA) method is introduced, to identify and quantify integrated delivery transfer pathways of total oxidised nitrogen (TON), total reactive phosphorus (TRP) and total phosphorus (TP). High temporal resolution river discharge and water quality measurements from a large runoff event (and recession) were used. In two catchments with well drained soils, below-ground delivery pathways of TON represented up to 97% of the total flow event load, and up to 63% of the TRP and TP load. In these catchments, hydrological quick flow pathways were only 2–8% of total flow but were efficient in delivering P (up to 50%). Two other catchments had poor to moderately drained soils where up to 55% of the hydrological pathways were quick flow. This quick flow delivered up to 88% of the event flow P load but background groundwater flows were apparently mixed with point source signals. Results suggest that, in catchments with permeable soils and geology, subsurface pathways will need to be considered for mitigation strategies for both diffuse N and P delivery and measures that target surface transfer pathways such as riparian buffer strips may be ineffective. In such catchments, long chemical recessions from storm events may prolong impacts on the ecological status of receiving rivers.";"Mellander, Per-Erik

Past agro-ecoregionalizations have been subjective, expert opinion driven, crop specific, and unsuitable for statistical extrapolation. Use of quantitative analytical methods provides an opportunity for delineation of agro-ecoregions in a more objective and reproducible manner, and with use of generalized crop-related environmental inputs offers an opportunity for delineation of regions with broader application. For this study, raster (cell-based) environmental data at 1 km scale were used in a multivariate geographic clustering process to delineate agroecozones. Environmental parameters included climatic, edaphic and topographic characteristics hypothesized to be generally relevant to many crops. Clustering was performed using five a priori grouping schemes of 5-25 agroecozones. Non-contiguous geographic zones were defined representing areas of similar crop-relevant environmental conditions. A red-green-blue color triplet was used for visualization of agroecozones as unique combinations of environmental factors. Concordance of the agroecozones with other widely used datasets was investigated using MapCurves, a quantitative goodness-of-fit method. The 5- and 25-agroecozone schemes had highest concordance with a map of major land resource areas and a map of major landform regions, with degree of fit judged to be good. The resulting agroecozones provide a framework for future rigorous hypothesis testing. Other applications include: quantitative evaluation of crop suitability at the landscape scale, environmental impact modeling and agricultural scenario building.";"Williams, C.L.

Consequently, the government has invested substantial resources in soil and water conservation (SWC). One of such interventions was exclosure, which was aimed restoring biodiversity, biomass and soil fertility. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of exclosures on soil fertility restoration and examine its variability across age, agro-ecology and landscape position. The study was conducted in the Gubalafto district of North Wello Zone, northern Ethiopian highlands. Vegetation cover was estimated and soil samples were collected from three age categories (open sites, 10- and 27-year-old exclosures), two agro-ecological zones (mild and cool) and in three landscape positions (lower, mid and upper). The samples were analyzed for selected soil physico-chemical properties using standard laboratory procedures. The results were statistically tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Vegetation ground and canopy cover increased with exclosure age. The soils of the exclosures showed significantly higher organic carbon (9g/kg) and total nitrogen content (1.2g/kg p≤0.06 at α=0.05) than the open sites. However, no statistical significant difference was observed between the 10- and 27-year-old exclosures, indicating that the restoration rate decreased with increasing exclosure age. This could be related to the low quantity and quality of the biomass, which influenced organic matter input and mineralization. Exclosures in the mild zone showed significantly higher soil fertility restoration than those in the cool zone. The differences between the two zones could be attributed to the effect of micro-climate on biomass production, vegetation types and organic matter mineralization. The soil physico-chemical properties neither had significant differences nor followed a regular trend across the landscape positions. The non-significant soil fertility restoration variation across the landscape positions could be attributed to complementary effect of structural SWC measures. Therefore, exclosure implementation and utilization planning should consider soil fertility restoration variation with age, agro-ecology and management conditions of the respective exclosure.";"Damene, Shimeles

However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N₂O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N₂O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N₂O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N₂O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N₂O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3kgN₂ONha⁻¹ y⁻¹) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2kgN₂ONha⁻¹ y⁻¹). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N₂O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N₂O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N₂O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N₂O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N₂O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N₂O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N₂O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.";"Kachenchart, Boonlue

Climate change could therefore have positive or negative impacts on runoff and soil erosion during storms, and previous research has indicated that the impacts could be different at the field, hillslope and catchment scales. This problem was assessed for two Mediterranean watersheds by a combined application of the PROMES regional climate model, the SWAT continuous hydrological and vegetation model, and the MEFIDIS storm runoff and erosion model. PROMES results were used to estimate changes to storm rainfall intensity, while SWAT was applied with the PROMES results to estimate changes to soil moisture and saturation deficit, as well as vegetation cover. The results from both models were used to generate scenarios of changes to storm intensity (increasing), saturation deficit (increasing) and vegetation cover (increasing according to vegetation type). These scenarios were used as input for the MEFIDIS model to study the impacts of these changes on runoff and soil erosion across spatial scales for a set of storms. The simulation results indicate that (i) the increase in saturation deficit and vegetation cover is sufficient, in many cases, to decrease or counterbalance the impacts of increased storm intensity on soil erosion at all spatial scales; (ii) catchment sediment yield is noticeably more sensitive to the climate change scenarios than within-watershed soil erosion, mostly due to the impacts of changes to saturation deficit and vegetation cover on connectivity; (iii) within the watershed, impacts on soil erosion vary with landcover type, with croplands suffering the most negative impacts.";"Nunes, J.P.

"AGRIS:US201400139171";"Use of Fire in the Cerrado and Amazonian Rainforests of Brazil: Past and Present";"";"Humans have been changing the natural fire regimes in most Brazilian vegetation types for over 4000 years. Natural lightning fires can easily happen in savannas and grasslands, but they are rare in the moist rainforests. Today, anthropogenic fires are frequent in both the fire-adapted cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the fire-sensitive rainforest. In this paper, I compare two very different biomes concerning their susceptibilities and responses to fire: the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado. I present an overview of their fire history, especially regarding human-made fires for land management, and pull together information about the use of fire by indigenous peoples in the cerrado and the Amazon, as this information is very fragmented. Accordingly, I describe how fire regimes have changed in these biomes over time due to agricultural practices and the consequences of the current altered fire regimes. After European settlement, fire frequency greatly increased in the cerrado, especially related to cattle ranching, and more recently in the more seasonal landscapes in the Amazon. In cerrado natural preserves, however, managers try to keep fire away, but wildfires eventually come and develop into destructive events. Actions to reduce biodiversity loss and environmental deterioration due to inappropriate fire management are necessary and should be very distinct in both areas: in the Amazon they would include the development of policies to stimulate fire-free, small-scale agricultural projects, and in the cerrado, sustainable use of fire for cattle ranching is possible but the regimes must be fitted to local specific features in order to avoid land degradation. In cerrado conservation areas, proper fire management programs based on scientific knowledge and the incorporation of the traditional expertise of indigenous peoples are needed to maintain the biological diversity, to maintain the ecological processes, and to reduce wildfires.";"Pivello, Vania R.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land management;land degradation;indigenous peoples";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400139171";"http://dx.doi.org/10.4996/fireecology.0701024";"";"";"";"24-39"
"AGRIS:US201500184643";"Challenges in applying scientific evidence to width recommendations for riparian management in agricultural Australia";"";"Intact riparian zones maintain aquatic–terrestrial ecosystem function and ultimately, waterway health. Effective riparian management is a major step towards improving the condition of waterways and usually involves the creation of a ‘buffer’ by fencing off the stream and planting vegetation. Determination of buffer widths often reflects logistical constraints (e.g. private land ownership, existing infrastructure) of riparian and adjacent areas, rather than relying on rigorous science. We used published information to support riparian width recommendations for waterways in agricultural Victoria, Australia. We focused on different ecological management objectives (e.g. nutrient reduction or erosion control) and scrutinised the applicability of data across different environmental contexts (e.g. adjacent land use or geomorphology). Not surprisingly, the evidence supported variable ‘effective’ riparian widths, depending on the objective and environmental context. We used this information to develop a framework for determining riparian buffer widths to meet a variety of ecological objectives in south‐east Australia. Widths for reducing nutrient inputs to waterways were most strongly supported with quantitative evidence and varied between 20 and 38 m depending on environmental context. The environmental context was inconsistently reported, making it difficult to recommend appropriate widths, under different land‐use and physiographic scenarios. The evidence to guide width determination generally had high levels of uncertainty. Despite the considerable amount of published riparian research, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that implemented widths achieved ecological objectives. We emphasise the need for managers to clearly articulate the objectives of proposed riparian management and carefully consider the environmental context. Monitoring ecological responses associated with different riparian buffer widths is essential to support future management decisions.";"Hansen, Birgita D.

Argentine drylands case study";"";"This work addresses increasing concerns about water management for rural productive activities in the vast dry regions of Latin America by assessing renewable energy technologies (RETs) that could be suitable for localized needs. Forecasted trends in climate change and variability make this analysis very relevant, in an area where very little published work exists. While Argentina is widely known for its fertile pampas, around 75 % of the country consists of dry lands. In addition, erosion is increasing by up to 650,000 hectares each year. The coordinated adoption of a set of actions, including land use planning and strengthening productive activities that guarantee access to water and improve water and soil management is needed. Renewable energies could help towards achieving these aims, if water is made available at affordable costs and with suitable technologies. This paper evaluates experiences with three RETs—photovoltaic pumping from deep wells, small wind turbine pumping, and high-power wind turbines, and discusses a potential role for use in rural Argentina. Although cheaper and more reliable renewable alternatives to energy sources such as diesel could be used for pumping from groundwater resources in isolated locations, limitations arise when pumping head and/or water volume requirements are large or highly seasonal. The cost increases and technical challenges of accessing this deeper water, as indicated by case studies, emphasize the importance of planning and support schemes development.";"Nadal, Gustavo Horacio

Improvements in radar data processing and accessibility now make it possible to monitor roosts over a broad spatial scale. OBJECTIVES: We sought to locate all of the Purple Martin roosts in North America and to use the data to evaluate (1) the land cover types associated with roosts (2) relationships among roost persistence, land cover type, and regional population trends. METHODS: We used mosaicked images of radar reflectivity based on the NEXRAD WSR network to locate 234 Purple Martin roosts that were active between 2009 and 2014. Of these roosts, we ground-truthed a subset of 57 with site visits and reports from citizen scientists. We assigned roosts to different classes based on local land cover, and used a variety of statistical and spatial analyses to address the objectives listed above. RESULTS: Roosts were mainly associated with forest, cropland, urban, and water land cover types, with cropland being the most common. There was an apparent preference for urban sites, and urban roosts were associated with the high year-to-year persistence. We found no correlation between roost persistence and regional population trends in data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). CONCLUSIONS: Although they use a diverse array of roosting habitats, urban roosting areas appear to be increasingly important for Purple Martins. Persistence of urban roosts was high, which aligns with the species’ unique natural history and its association with human societies.";"Bridge, Eli S.

"AGRIS:US201600091675";"Convergence of microclimate in residential landscapes across diverse cities in the United States";"";"CONTEXT: The urban heat island (UHI) is a well-documented pattern of warming in cities relative to rural areas. Most UHI research utilizes remote sensing methods at large scales, or climate sensors in single cities surrounded by standardized land cover. Relatively few studies have explored continental-scale climatic patterns within common urban microenvironments such as residential landscapes that may affect human comfort. OBJECTIVES: We tested the urban homogenization hypothesis which states that structure and function in cities exhibit ecological “sameness” across diverse regions relative to the native ecosystems they replaced. METHODS: We deployed portable micrometeorological sensors to compare air temperature and humidity in residential yards and native landscapes across six U.S. cities that span a range of climates (Phoenix, AZ; Los Angeles, CA; Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN; Boston, MA; Baltimore, MD; and Miami, FL). RESULTS: Microclimate in residential ecosystems was more similar among cities than among native ecosystems, particularly during the calm morning hours. Maximum regional actual evapotranspiration (AET) was related to the morning residential microclimate effect. Residential yards in cities with maximum AET <50–65 cm/year (Phoenix and Los Angeles) were generally cooler and more humid than nearby native shrublands during summer mornings, while yards in cities above this threshold were generally warmer (Baltimore and Miami) and drier (Miami) than native forests. On average, temperature and absolute humidity were ~6 % less variable among residential ecosystems than among native ecosystems from diverse regions. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that common residential land cover and structural characteristics lead to microclimatic convergence across diverse regions at the continental scale.";"Hall, Sharon J.

In this paper we focus on the impacts of program interactions. Specifically, using an integrated economic and bio-physical modeling framework, we consider the impacts of the presence of working land programs on a land retirement for an important agricultural regionthe Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). Compared to a land retirement only program, we find that the presence of a working land program for conservation tillage results in significantly lower predicted signups for land retirement at a given rental rate. We also find that the presence of both a large working land and land retirement program can result in more environmental benefits and income transfers than a land retirement only program can achieve.";"Feng, Hongli

Traditional approaches to promoting CREP adoption, based on the adoption-diffusion model, were not effective in promoting CREP. We surveyed farmers in the Cannonsville watershed to evaluate factors affecting CREP adoption. Many variables commonly tied to practice adoption, including farm structure and farmer sociodemographic traits, were poorly correlated with the attitudes of Cannonsville farmers toward CREP. Attitudes toward land costs and farmer resentment toward New York City's control of land and conservation policy were, however, strong predictors of CREP adoption. This suggests that as regional watershed collaborations become more active in managing private landowner conservation behaviors, resentment factors may inhibit adoption of the encouraged practices. Findings provide insight into mechanisms to improve upstream-downstream partnerships and the potential to balance clean water resources with local agricultural production priorities.";"Armstrong, A.

This growth has been largely unchecked, and has led to enormous amounts of foreign direct investment. This unchecked investment has led to destabilization of the natural environment, and, in the case of the Dominical–Uvita corridor on the Pacific Coast, has led to an observed increase in landsliding activity. Data collection for a landslide inventory of the study area was created via direct inspection and remote sensing techniques in December 2007 and November 2008. Evaluation of data was based on the slide location, surrounding land cover/land use, and evidence of reactivation. Data were subjected to a χ2 2 × 3 contingency table and the Freeman–Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability test to gauge the level of impact from human-induced land-use change on the rate of landslide events.

With consequences for the environment, the population, and the economy, accurate products at adequate spatial and temporal resolutions are required and demanded by the science community and stakeholders alike. To address these needs, a new Impervious Surface Area (ISA) product was created for a Portuguese Watershed (Mondego river) from Landsat data (a combination of leaf-on multispectral bands, derived products, and NDVI time series), using Regression Tree Models (RTM). The product provides 30-m spatial resolution ISA estimates (0â100%) with a Mean Average Error (MAE) of 1.6% and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.5%.A strategy to update the baseline product was tested in earlier imagery (2001 and 2007) for a subset of the watershed. Instead of updating the baseline product, the strategy seeks to identify stable training samples and remove those where change was detected in a time series of Change Vector Analysis (CVA). The stable samples were then used to create new ISA models using RTM. The updated maps were similar to the original product in terms of accuracy metrics (MAE: 2001: 2.6%; 2007:3.6%).The products and methodology offer a new perspective on the urban development of the watershed, at a scale previously unavailable. It can also be replicated elsewhere at a low cost, leveraging the growing Landsat data archive, and provide timely information on relevant land cover metrics to the scientific community and stakeholders.";"Mantas, Vasco M.

Consequently, a primary focus of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to address fish habitat in lakes across the state has been to determine relationships between TP concentrations and watershed conditions in Minnesota lakes. Because phosphorus concentrations in Minnesota lakes vary widely corresponding to differences in geomorphology, nutrient criteria were established by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for specific ecoregions. To refine these relationships in Minnesota lakes managed for fishing, we gathered mean summer epilimnetic TP concentrations on 1330 natural lakes to identify where agricultural and urban development have elevated phosphorus levels. Random forest, regression tree, and generalized additive models were used to model spatial variation in lake phosphorus concentrations across Minnesota. Key landscape variables known to influence TP concentrations in lakes, including lake depth and watershed size, were used as explanatory variables in these models, along with agricultural and urban development quantified for lake watersheds from the National Land Cover Dataset. These models explained up to 60% of the variation in TP in lakes across the state and showed a critical benchmark of anthropogenic land use disturbance at 40%, that once exceeded could significantly alter TP levels and consequently fish populations. This information should be useful for fish managers to prioritize conservation efforts and to set appropriate fish population goals.";"Cross, Timothy K.

Several control methods are available but forest managers are constrained by cost, availability, and environmental concerns. As a result forest managers must decide how to allocate limited conservation resources over heterogeneous landscapes. We develop an attribute-based contingent valuation approach that allows us to perform cost-benefit analysis on control programs and inform the distribution of mitigation effort over land units that provide different types of environmental services. We use this approach to examine conservation efforts on three land management units in the southern Appalachian Mountains: Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests. Managers of these forests are focusing their efforts on specific conservation areas chosen for their importance to human-use or ecological services. The result is a network of sites that implicitly defines a tradeoff between ecological and human-use services. Our survey is designed to examine the public's perception of this tradeoff and estimate WTP for hemlock conservation programs. The estimated benefits of conserving hemlocks in the study area outweigh the cost of the mitigation programs by two orders of magnitude. We find that there is substantial support for protection of hemlock stands providing ecological services with very little human-use value. Further, we show that benefits from the current mitigation strategy could be increased by shifting effort to protect more ecological services at the expense of sites that generate primarily human-use value.";"Moore, Christopher C.

The natural processes negatively affecting the soil (available land) are divided into groups according to their hazard extent: a) processes oriented to destroy the soils and lands, b) processes changing the soil cover pattern and leading to degradation of soils and decreasing their fertility
c) processes deteriorating the land productivity. The extent of the distribution and dangerous occurrence of degradation and adverse natural processes in the Asian part of Russia (gully erosion, destruction of seashores and banks of water bodies, changes in river channels and floodplains, underground flood, heavy rainfall, flooding) in federal districts and their administrative units was assessed. The distribution and dangerous manifestation of adverse processes are highly varying at the particular parts of the studied territory in dependence on natural-climatic conditions. In general, the quality of agricultural lands steadily worsens, the soil cover loses ability to fertility restoration. There isn't enough data on a qualitative condition of lands since examinations were conducted fragmentally.

Yet very little is known about how family forest landowners view programs that enable them to sell carbon credits generated from the growth of their forest and the compensation that would be required to encourage a meaningful level of participation. To address this information gap, we conducted a study to identify and quantify family forest landowner interest in participating in a voluntary carbon market trading program in the Lake States, USA. A mail survey was administered to 2,200 randomly selected family forest owners in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. The questionnaire assessed landowner interest in participating in a hypothetical carbon credit trading program and sought information on landowner objectives and practices, perspectives on carbon credit programs and forest land characteristics. A total of 850 usable responses were received. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the factors affecting participation in a forest carbon offset project by family forest owners and estimate landowner participation probability. Results show that carbon program characteristics alongside landowner and parcel characteristics are associated with the decision to participate in a carbon credit program. Specifically, carbon credit payment amount, contract length, gender, value placed on other non-market forest amenities, need for additional income, attitude towards climate change, absentee status, land tenure and total acres owned were found to be significant determinants.

For quantification purposes, a large number of landscape metrics have been developed, with definitions based on measurable patch attributes. Calculation of these metrics is commonly conducted on wall-to-wall maps, whereas a new interest is to use sample data. It is argued that a sample survey takes less time and results are more reliable. The overall objective in this paper was to present the potential of the line interest sampling method for estimating a special contagion metric. The specific objective was to assess statistical properties in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of the contagion metric estimator. This study was conducted on 50.1 km² already manually delineated land cover maps from the National Inventory of Landscape in Sweden. Monte-Carlo sampling simulation was employed to assess the statistical properties of the estimator. The simulation was conducted for different combinations of two sampling designs, four sample sizes, five lines transect configurations, three lines transect lengths, and two classification systems. The systematic sampling design resulted in lower RMSE and bias compared to a simple random one. Both RMSE and bias of the contagion estimator tended to decrease with increasing sample size and line transect length. We recommend using a combination of systematic sampling design, straight line configuration and long line transect. We conclude that there is no need to use mapped data and thus polygon delineation errors can considerably be reduced or eliminated.";"Ramezani, Habib

This project included the construction of a series of ditches through a large peatland to drain the land for agricultural use. The largest of these ditches was the 35 km long Walsh Ditch. Much of the drained wetland affected by the Walsh Ditch is now managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of Seney National Wildlife Refuge. Between 2002–2003, nine large earthen ditch plugs were installed along a 4.5 km section of the ditch in an attempt to restore the hydrological and ecological integrity of the approximately 1400 ha of wetlands and streams. This study explores the effects that the ditch plugs had on the hydrology and vegetation structure of the adjacent landscape 8y later. Plot level measurements (707 m² plots) of hydrology and vegetation, combined with an analysis of land cover change using aerial imagery, indicated that the ditch plugs had been successful in altering the hydrology and vegetation over portions of the area. Mortality of upland tree species more typical of xeric conditions and colonization by typical wetland species indicated that these sites should continue to develop into wetland ecosystems. Land cover change analysis showed an increase in wetland area of 152 ha. The areas of change were concentrated near the plugged ditch and near a large anthropogenic pool.";"Bork, S. P.

The apex court in T. N. Godavarman took upon the responsibility of deciding how forest resources in the country should be accessed and who is (or is not) to have such access. Purportedly done to protect the environment, through the clarification and fine-tuning of national forest-laws, the case has seriously affected the life, livelihood, and habitat of millions of marginal groups. Recent trends demonstrate the wider trend of constitutional courts assuming the roles of adjudication, administration and legislation, all rolled into one, whereby they become problematic sites for creating a hierarchy of conflicting public interests, which claim constitutional validity from different vantage points. Thus, constitutional values of protection of environment and justice - social, political and economic are pitted against each other where unelected courts take it upon themselves to define the legitimate precincts of the theoretical discourse of sustainable use / development; and importantly also implement it into everyday reality, in the way it feels fit.

A financial model of an oil palm plantation in Sarawak, Malaysia, is used to explore six project types, including managed smallholders, three different joint-venture arrangements, renting, and (for comparison) a private plantation on state land. Benefit-cost analysis is used as basis for project, private (shareholder), and stakeholder analyses. There is a trade-off between the efficiency and equity outcomes of the alternative arrangements. While joint venture projects provide higher aggregate net benefits, managed smallholder projects provide more benefits to landholders. When the actual performance of the alternative schemes is taken into account, the managed smallholder approach is superior on both efficiency and equity grounds. The joint venture approach could be improved by combining a fixed rent with a share of dividends to reduce the income risk faced by landholders. In all cases, improved management is needed for the schemes to achieve their developmental potential.";"Cramb, Rob A.

"AGRIS:US201600037106";"Importance of Agricultural Landscapes as Key Nesting Habitats for the American Black Duck in Maritime Canada";"";"Given historical patterns of decline, the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes) has long been a species of concern. To support the identification of core Maritime habitat, the distribution of breeding ducks was mapped at the landscape scale through the combination of GIS-based land cover information and five years of intensive aerial surveys (2006–2010). A predictive, mixed effects model was used to generate the maps, based on the weighted average of coefficients for the top 95% of all-possible models (as measured by AIC weights). The results of the averaged mixed model indicated that annual variation (YEAR), availability of surface water (WET_AREA, LAKE_AREA and WET_DIVERSITY) and occurrence of active agricultural landscapes (AG_PROP and ROAD_DENSITY) were strongly associated with the number of breeding pairs. The presence of larger numbers of breeding ducks in agricultural landscapes represents a departure from studies conducted in more intensively utilized regions (e.g. southern Ontario and Quebec), and suggest that the benefits of breeding in Maritime agricultural areas outweigh potential costs. Using 34,659 prediction points, duck distribution was modeled in relatively high and low years (2008 and 2006, respectively), resulting in detailed maps suitable for the identification of priority areas for habitat restoration and enhancement. In order to help refine conservation management plans, future work should more closely examine the impact of different types and combinations of Maritime agricultural production to better understand the way these landscapes attract breeding ducks.";"Lieske, David J.

"AGRIS:LV2016008200";"Assessing community-level and single-species models predictions of species distributions and assemblage composition after 25 years of land cover change";"";"To predict the impact of environmental change on species distributions, it has been hypothesized that community-level models could give some benefits compared to species-level models. In this study we have assessed the performance of these two approaches. We surveyed 256 bird communities in an agricultural landscape in southwest France at the same locations in 1982 and 2007. We compared the ability of CQO (canonical quadratic ordination; a method of community-level GLM) and GLMs (generalized linear models) to i) explain species distributions in 1982 and ii) predict species distributions, community composition and species richness in 2007, after land cover change. Our results show that models accounting for shared patterns between species (CQO) slightly better explain the distribution of rare species than models that ignore them (GLMs). Conversely, the predictive performances were better for GLMs than for CQO. At the assemblage level, both CQO and GLMs overestimated species richness, compared with that actually observed in 2007, and projected community composition was only moderately similar to that observed in 2007. Species richness projections tended to be more accurate in sites where land cover change was more marked. In contrast, the composition projections tended to be less accurate in those sites. Both modelling approaches showed a similar but limited ability to predict species distribution and assemblage composition under conditions of land cover change. Our study supports the idea that our community-level model can improve understanding of rare species patterns but that species-level models can provide slightly more accurate predictions of species distributions. At the community level, the similar performance of both approaches for predicting patterns of assemblage variation suggests that species tend to respond individualistically or, alternatively, that our community model was unable to effectively account for the emergent community patterns.";"Baselga, Andrés

"AGRIS:US201500155334";"Assessing and mapping biomass potential productivity from poplar-dominated riparian forests: A case study";"";"River systems are subjected to continuous physical changes as a result of their sediment transport. River dynamics is mainly determined by the seasonal variation of weather conditions and, together with the nature of the catchment and land management, affects flow patterns on a local scale. Riparian vegetation is well adapted to this periodical disturbance. It naturally regenerates on the new mineral soil created by the redistribution of river sediments during floods, playing an important role in the maintenance of streams and riverbanks stability. The high level of resilience and productivity of riparian tree species like Populus, contributes to the rapid biomass accumulation of riparian vegetation making these ecosystems of potential interest for biomass production for energy. This paper presents an operational methodology for investigating the biomass potential from riparian forests by coupling airborne laser scanning data and field survey. A case study on assessing and mapping biomass dynamics over a seventeen year period along a tract on the Paglia river, in Central Italy, is presented and discussed. The results highlight that the surface of the poplar-dominated riparian vegetation has significantly changed over the 1989–2006 period. More than 70 ha of new poplar forest were naturally regenerated during the analyzed period. The total amount of aboveground woody biomass of the riparian forest at the second inventory occasion has been estimated in 88 Mg ha⁻¹, evidencing a large amount of technically available resources for bioenergy production (around 80% of the standing woody biomass). The innovative strategy here proposed to assess and map at a very high spatial resolution the aboveground woody biomass of riparian forest meets the monitoring requirements to support energy production based on modern, non-conventional biomass harvest planning options.";"Cartisano, Rosaria

The starting point is that much research on land-use and land-cover change suffers from a time-frame bias, caused by limitations in remote sensing data. At the same time, the use of historical maps as a complementary data-set is rather insignificant. Can information in historical maps be used to extend the baseline in land-use and land-cover change studies? The historical context of the vegetation data is evaluated, and as an illustration of its potential for interdisciplinary research on land-cover and ecosystems change, a section of the map is juxtaposed with a recent pollen record specifically addressing the impact of a 'large infrequent disturbance' (LID) event at the end of the 19th century. It is concluded that the vegetation data in the map are not likely to be reflecting an extreme situation due to the LID event. Finally, the historical vegetation data were visually compared with a national 1995 land-cover data set, illustrating the possibility of using the map data as a baseline in land-cover change studies.";"Börjeson, Lowe";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"TZA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301589125";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01068.x";"";"";"";"185-191"

As the investigation of how human activities affect the natural resources in the park area, which has been defined a main aim of the program, naturally requires expertise from different scientific fields, interdisciplinary research has been fostered in the national park plan since the very beginning of the Man and the Biosphere program in 1981. To analyze the complex interactions and mutual dependencies between socio-economic and natural systems, a variety of monitoring programs have been initialized in different disciplines (e.g. climate sciences, zoology, botany) that are addressed in this paper. As a result of these research efforts, the park offers a profound data basis to be used in future studies (e.g. land cover classifications, maps of geological and soil conditions). Detailed information is provided on a climate monitoring network that has been installed in the park starting in the year 1993. The network has been continuously extended over the years and now provides extraordinary comprehensive information on meteorological conditions in the park, setting the basis for current as well as for potential future climate-related studies. A special characteristic of the station network is the fact that it covers a large range of elevations from 600 m a.s.l in the valleys to 2,600 m a.s.l in the summit regions and is therefore able to capture altitudinal gradients in meteorological variables as typical for Alpine regions. Due to the large number of stations in high elevations (15 stations are in elevations higher than 1,500 m a.s.l) the network provides information on the complex hydrometeorological conditions in summit regions which are often insufficiently represented in observation networks due to the increased costs for maintenance of climate stations in these locations. Beside the various monitoring programs, a variety of numerical models have been (further) developed for application in the park area that make extensive use of the different data collected and therefore largely benefit from the comprehensive data pool. The potential and necessity of the climate monitoring network for modelling studies is demonstrated by utilizing the meteorological recordings in the framework of a hydrometeorological simulation experiment. Further examples of environmental modelling efforts are shortly described together with preliminary model results.";"Marke, T.

Although Aquarius was designed for ocean salinity mapping, our objective in this investigation is to exploit the large amount of land observations that Aquarius acquires and extend the mission scope to include the retrieval of surface soil moisture. The soil moisture retrieval algorithm development focused on using only the radiometer data because of the extensive heritage of passive microwave retrieval of soil moisture. The single channel algorithm (SCA) was implemented using the Aquarius observations to estimate surface soil moisture. Aquarius radiometer observations from three beams (after bias/gain modification) along with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction model forecast surface temperatures were then used to retrieve soil moisture. Ancillary data inputs required for using the SCA are vegetation water content, land surface temperature, and several soil and vegetation parameters based on land cover classes. The resulting global spatial patterns of soil moisture were consistent with the precipitation climatology. Initial assessments were performed using in situ observations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Little Washita and Little River watershed soil moisture networks. Results showed good performance by the algorithm for these land surface conditions for the period of August 2011–June 2013 (rmse = 0.031 m3/m3, Bias = −0.007 m3/m3, and R = 0.855). This radiometer-only soil moisture product will serve as a baseline for continuing research on both active and combined passive–active soil moisture algorithms.

Land mismanagement influences the development of erosion processes, and causes soil degradation that significantly reduces the land’s capacity to infiltrate and retain rainwater. Inappropriate land use as well as development activities replace permeable with impervious surfaces in the watershed. This leads to more rapid runoff generation and the more frequent appearance of torrential floods and bed-load deposits on downstream sections. Environmental degradation creates economicsocial problems within local societies which is often followed by depopulation. Restoring watersheds to their optimal hydrologic state would reduce flood discharge and by increasing groundwater recharge would increase both low-flow and average discharges in springs and streams. Best management practices could be developed through the application of specific combinations of biotechnical, technical and administrative measures, and by using the concept of natural reservoirs. The design of such practices is explored through a case study of the watershed of the river Jelašnica, southeastern Serbia. Realization of these planned restoration works should help decrease the annual yields of erosive material by 44.1% and the specific annual transport of sediment through hydrographic network by 43.6%. Representative value of the coefficient of erosion will be reduced from Z=0.555 to Z=0.379. The value of maximal discharge Qmax-AMCIII(1%)=54.17 cubic meter/s, before restoration, is decreased to Qmax-AMCIII(1%)=41.22 cubic meter/s after restoration, indicating the improvement of hydrological conditions, as a direct consequence of land use changes.

Three days of intensive deliberations by professionals from various research, development and governmental organizations, and of diverse disciplines, backgrounds and nationalities have clearly acknowledged that water management issues remain very crucial for poverty alleviation and rural development in Ethiopia  the overwhelming proportion of the population depends on smallholder agricultural production, which is highly constrained by water availability (absence of perennial rivers, high spatial and temporal availability of rainfall, etc.). This situation, over the years, has generated a critical need for efficient water and land management to reduce production risks and hazards, and enhance stable agricultural and livestock production. Recent decades have witnessed various efforts in the area of irrigation and supplementary irrigation (and other development initiatives), employing various water harvesting technologies, construction of micro dams, diversions structures, etc., which were largely combined with traditional yield-enhancing methods to facilitate sustainable smallholder agricultural production.Most of these efforts did not only fall short of their desired objectives of improving smallholder production conditions but also generated a host of other problems which aggravated smallholder production conditions: the large scale irrigation schemes (e.g. Awash Basin and elsewhere) resulted in secondary soil salinization where large tracts of land have gone out of production; the spontaneous construction of micro-dams across the country (especially in Tigray) is associated with human and livestock health hazards that in some cases has resulted into abandonment of the dams; the production potential of extensive watersheds remain largely unexploited or inappropriately utilized, resulting in extensive degradation of fragile lands, and so on. The potential for effectively integrating crops and livestock management in the context of growing water in complementary crop-livestock systems remains largely unexploited, especially from the perspective of efficient water and land utilization. The limited success of most of the technologies in Ethiopia calls attention to a dire need for research and capacity building to understand the complex issues of water and land management, so as to enhance national and local capacity to deal with water and land management issues to enhance food security, poverty alleviation and national economic development.";"Kamara, A.

We assessed the influence of landscape composition on bee abundance and species richness in apple (Malm spp.) orchards of northeastern Wisconsin during the spring flowering period. A diverse community of bee species occurs in these apple orchards, dominated by wild bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae and the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Proportion of forest area in the surrounding landscape was a significant positive predictor of wild bee abundance in orchards, with strongest effects at a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) buffer distance of 1,000 m or greater. Forest area also was positively associated with species richness, showing strongest effects at a buffer distance of 2,000 m. Nonagricultural developed land (homes, lawns, etcetera) was significantly negatively associated with species richness at buffer distances >750 m and wild bee abundance in bowl traps at all distances. Other landscape variables statistically associated with species richness or abundance of wild bees included proportion area of pasture (positive) and proportion area of roads (negative). Forest area was not associated with honey bee abundance at any buffer distance. These results provide clear evidence that the landscape surrounding apple orchards, especially the proportion of forest area, affects richness and abundance of wild bees during the spring flowering period and should be a part of sustainable land management strategies in agro-ecosystems of northeastern Wisconsin and other apple growing regions.";"Watson, J.C.

The second technique was a quantitative composite fingerprinting technique using geochemical analysis of source materials and suspended sediment samples. As a comparison, the partial least squares model was also used on the geochemical data. In August and September 2009, 30 soil samples of three different land uses (landslides, croplands, and grazing lands) and 21 suspended sediment samples at the catchment outlet were collected. Source samples were sieved to <63 μm. Geochemical analyses consisted of total element concentrations, percentage carbon, percentage nitrogen, and atom percentage ¹⁵N and δ¹³C. Reflectance measurements were taken on dried source samples with a spectrometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Neither technique was able to predict the contributions of the three land use types; they could only distinguish between landslide and topsoil material. The agreement between the results of both techniques was significant for the Unta catchment (R ² = 0.80) but not for the Desera catchment (R ² = 0.39). The uncertainty of the technique using Vis-NIR reflectance measurements was slightly higher than with the geochemical approach. Both techniques revealed that topsoil erosion played an important role during storm runoff discharges. Using the partial least squares model for the geochemical data revealed that uncertainty can differ greatly when using other statistical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative composite fingerprinting technique using spectral signatures from both source and suspended sediment samples was able to quantify the contribution of two source materials (landslides and topsoil). It provided a faster and more cost effective alternative to the conventional geochemical procedure.";"Verheyen, Dries

Evidence against the superiority of private farming, 1883–1913";"";"This contribution deals with agricultural dynamics in late-Imperial Russia. Based upon a comprehensive micro-level data set on annual yields between 1883 and 1913, we provide insight into regional differences of agricultural growth and the development prospects of Russian agriculture before WWI. Making use of the fact that contemporary Russian statistics distinguished between mostly communally governed open fields and privately owned land, we are able to test the implications of different land tenure systems for agricultural yield growth. In a broader sense, we seek to challenge the common narrative of Russia as an exception to the pan-European picture of economic development during the era of industrialization.";"Kopsidis, Michael

Sediment samples were collected at 10, 40, 100, 300, and 500 m from inflow 13 days prior to amendment and 1, 5, 12, 22, and 36 days post-amendment. Background pesticide concentrations ranged from <1 to 977, <1 to 119, and <1 to 2 μg kg−1, for atrazine, S-metolachlor, and permethrin, respectively. Average post-amendment atrazine and S-metolachlor were 2,915–3,927 and 3–20 μg kg−1, respectively at 10–40 m and 538–872 and <1 μg kg−1, respectively at 300–500 m. Average post-amendment permethrin was 65–200 μg kg−1 at 10–40 m and 1–10 μg kg−1 at 300–500 m. H. azteca 10-day survival varied spatially and temporally up to 100 m from inflow. Animal growth, independent of survival, was reduced 40 and 100 m from inflow on day 36, showing continued sediment toxicity of up to 100 m from inflow more than 1 month after amendment. Animal survival and growth were unaffected at 300 and 500 m from inflow throughout the study period. Correlations of pesticide concentrations and H. azteca responses indicated that observed sediment toxicity was primarily from permethrin with potential additional synergistic toxicity from atrazine and methyl parathion. Study results indicate that natural backwater wetlands can be managed to ameliorate pesticide mixture 10-day sediment toxicity to H. azteca within 300 m of inflow and smaller wetlands (≤100 m) may require several months of effluent retention to mitigate effects.";"Lizotte, Richard E.

"AGRIS:US201500217367";"Rural development and challenges establishing sustainable land use in Eastern European countries";"";"The European Union Rural Development Policy (RDP) for the period 2007–2013 seeks to establish a coherent and sustainable framework for the future of Europe's rural areas and is closely related to the improvement of living conditions in the countryside involving aspects of housing, the environment, infrastructure, communication, employment possibilities, land management, etc. Such interventions are very welcome in many Central and Eastern European countries where land reform after the collapse of the Soviet regime has resulted in a worrying drift towards rural depopulation. It is expected that the land consolidation (LC) process will not only allow solutions to the structural problems of rural land but could also create viable rural areas through improvements to rural services and infrastructure, and incentives for economic diversification, etc. Permanent and fluent communication between private and public interest groups is a most important aspect of achieving the stated objectives of land consolidation. However, this presently takes the form of a monologue rather than a dialogue in many Central and Eastern European countries. Today, and after the period of the currency of EU RDP 2007–2013, it is necessary to investigate the attitude and expectations of the interested parties if further degradation is to be avoided and the attractiveness of rural areas through LC projects is to be enhanced. The case study introduced in this paper, based on quantitative and qualitative surveys done with related key groups in Lithuania, reveals the main problems and offers possible solutions which should be reflected in the legislation to avoid the future degradation of rural areas.";"Pašakarnis, Giedrius

"AGRIS:US201500217366";"Mapping syndromes of land change in Spain with remote sensing time series, demographic and climatic data";"";"The country of Spain is representative of land change processes in Mediterranean member states of the European Union (EU). These land change processes are often triggered by European, national and sub-national policies and include widespread land abandonment and urbanisation trends, as well as an increase in land use intensities accompanied by strong exploitation of water resources. The Mediterranean is part of the dryland ecoregion, which is particularly vulnerable to ecosystem degradation. While remote sensing data permit the characterisation of the temporal dimension of land surface processes, the syndrome-based approach aims to integrate this with information on local/regional socio-economic and physical frameworks. In this study, we incorporated two major drivers of land change, climatic boundary conditions and population density change, to understand the patterns of the assessed land cover changes. We used the Mediterranean Extended Daily One Km AVHRR Data Set (MEDOKADS), which represents the Mediterranean Basin at a resolution of 1km² for the period of 1989–2004 at 10-day time intervals. The long-term vegetation trend could be characterised based on a linear regression analysis of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Further descriptors of phenology were calculated, such as the amplitude of annual cycles or the date of occurrence of the annual maximum of vegetation cover. Subsequently, trend analysis was applied to these parameters to map phenology shifts representative of changes in land use/cover. Next, a rule-based classification was employed to integrate the individual results and assign syndromes representing specific land change process patterns. For natural and semi-natural areas, locations characterised by increasing biomass are associated with areas of population loss due to migration to urban centres. By contrast, many fertile agricultural areas are associated with intensification processes, including the expansion of irrigation schemes. Furthermore, areas that are dominated by inter-annual variability in precipitation were identified by employing the results of an analysis of NDVI–rainfall relationships. The resulting data set identifies major land change syndromes for the whole of Spain and links the apparent results of change to driving factors and causes, thus serving as an excellent data source to inform policy makers of effects caused by legislative and management actions.";"Stellmes, M.

In situations where more than one agent is using a limited resource, transaction costs arise, which may affect the governance of that resource. For example, in northern Sweden the forestry and reindeer husbandry sectors incur transaction costs during consultations over land-use management. The analysis presented here indicates that the transaction costs incurred by the forestry industry are mainly affected by the number of consultations held, and that the industry's costs could be reduced if more of the reindeer-herding communities drew up formal land-use plans (RBP). The availability of these RBP affected the behaviour of the forestry companies’ agents. For example, they were more likely to draw up detailed plans prior to consultations when a RBP was available. The method used to measure and model transaction costs may be useful in other situations involving multiple interdependent actors competing for the use of a common resource, especially in cases involving co-management.";"Widmark, Camilla

The presumption is that a view of land as a productive asset implies security which then induces investment and improvements in agricultural productivity.

Any policy to support a revitalized agricultural sector in post – crisis Zimbabwe will need to take account of the multiple meanings of land and build on emerging trends of land reform beneficiary, white farmer, and private sector collaboration; as well as livelihoods diversification.";"Chavunduka, Charles M.

Co-ownership of assets iswidespread in many countries due to inheritance. Central and Eastern Europe offersan interesting natural experiment to assess the effects of such rights imperfectionsbecause of the asset restitution process in the 1990s. Bulgaria is particularlyinteresting because of the prominence of the co-ownership problem (about half of allland plots are co-owned), because of the strong fragmentation of land, and because oflegislation providing an instrument to separate out chosen (endogenous) versus forced(exogenous) forms of co-ownership. We find that land in co-ownership is much morelikely to be used by less efficient farm organizations or to be left abandoned, and thatit leads to significant welfare losses.";"Vranken, Liesbet

"AGRIS:US201500162446";"Frequent fire protects shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) from introgression by loblolly pine (P. taeda)";"";"Across much of the globe, fire is a major disturbance agent of forest and grassland communities. The removal of fire from previously fire-maintained ecosystems, which has occurred in many areas, changes species composition, favoring later less fire tolerant species over fire-adapted ones. A recent measured increase in the rate of hybridization between the fire-adapted shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and less fire-adapted loblolly pine (P. taeda) suggests that introgression may be an emerging threat to shortleaf pine as a genetically distinct species. We used 25 microsatellite markers on seedlings and saplings to test how the use of frequent fire affects the survival of hybrids between the two species by contrasting species makeup and hybridity in regularly burned areas (every 2 years) to that in neighboring unburned areas, both with mixed canopies of loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, and hybrids. The results show that frequent prescribed fire selects against loblolly pine and hybrids, restoring the community to one dominated by shortleaf pine. These results are the first to indicate that frequent fire can resist introgression between two co-occurring native species and that fire exclusion as a land management policy may be having unrecognized deleterious effects on the genetic integrity of species previously isolated from one another based on fire tolerance.";"Stewart, John F.

Supervised classification of Corona and Landsat 5 images of the area (in total 1646 ha) from years before and after the storm (1966–2010) were carried out and parameters characterizing the fragmentation calculated for 3 land-cover classes: forest, areas with low woody biomass and non-forest areas. Influence of windthrow on forest landscape was considerable: areas characterized as “forests” (dominant age exceeds that of young stands) were reduced by 53.3 % in year 1972 (3 years after the storm) in comparison to 1966. Statistically significant influence of storm in land-cover classes were found to mean patch size, mean shape index and mean weighted Euclidean distance. Major part of the analysed un-managed landscape had returned to land-cover class “forest” already 19 years after the storm. However, changes in Shannon’s diversity index demonstrated, that fragmentation of forest landscape had returned to pre-storm state only 30 years after the event. Therefore, if storms are predicted to occur in a frequency less than 30 years, their impact on un-managed (natural) forest landscape could be notable and permanent, changing also the habitat structure. Immediately after the storm mean weighted Euclidean distance between forest patches increased by 45 m. If such situation remains for a long time in future it can influence organisms with small dispersal distances, shaping the composition of species in natural forests. In contrast, detected changes in mean length of the edges might not have notable impact on the ecological diversity in heterogeneous natural forests.

Pētīts meža masīvs Slīteres nacionālā parka daļā, kur kopš 1923. gada izveidots rezervāts (aizliegta saimnieciskā darbība), kuru skārusi 1969. gada novembra vētra. Izmantojot Corona un Landsat 5 satelītattēlus, kas iegūti pirms un pēc vētras (laika periodā no 1966. līdz 2010. gadam), šim meža masīvam (kopā 1646 ha) veikta pārraudzītā klasifikācija. Aprēķinātas fragmentāciju raksturojošo indikatoru vērtības trim zemes virsmas seguma klasēm: platības ar zemu kokaudzes biomasu (t.sk. jaunaudzes), nemeža zemes un mežaudzes (meži, kas pārsnieguši jaunaudzes vecumu). Platība, kas klasificēta kā mežaudze, trīs gadus pēc vētras bija par 53,3 % mazāka nekā pirms tās. Tūlīt pēc vētras samazinājās arī vidējais šīs klases plankuma lielums un pieauga plankumu skaits; 30 gadus pēc vētras (1998. gadā) vidējā plankuma platība bija statistiski būtiski lielāka nekā uzreiz pēc tās, tomēr vēl pēc 10 gadiem, lai gan vidējā platība bija lielāka, atšķirības vairs nebija statistiski būtiskas. Tāpat konstatēts, ka mežaudžu vidējā laukumu forma pirms un 20–40 gadus pēc vētras nozīmīgi (vai statistiski būtiski) neatšķīrās. Vidējais attālums starp mežaudžu klases plankumiem uzreiz pēc vētras (1972. gadā) pieauga par 45 m un bija statistiski būtiski atšķirīgs gan no situācijas pirms, gan 20–40 gadus pēc vētras, bet statistiski būtiskas šī rādītāja atšķirības starp stāvokli pirms (1966. gadā) un pēc vētras (1988., 1998., 2010. g.g.) netika konstatētas.";"Baders, E., Latvian State Forest Research Inst.

"AGRIS:US201301911257";"Improving landscape connectivity in forest districts: A two-stage process for prioritizing agricultural patches for reforestation";"";"Connectivity is a key concern in natural resource planning. Many studies have focused on the development of methods, tools and indices for the assessment of both components of connectivity: structural and functional. In particular, approaches based on graph theory principles have been recently proposed and are being increasingly applied to guide landscape connectivity conservation. However, forest planners and managers still need effective and operational methodologies to detect those landscapes where connectivity should be treated as a particularly critical conservation concern. In addition, in the Mediterranean, as in other parts of the world, socioeconomic changes in the last decades have driven the abandonment of many formerly cultivated lands. This poses both a challenge and an opportunity for managers intending to restore ecological connectivity in forested areas. In this context, setting adequate priorities for the reforestation of agricultural lands is of outmost importance. Here we show how a two-stage hierarchical methodology based on network analysis can be used to meet these needs. In particular, we apply a graph metric based on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale (the Integral Index of Connectivity) to two Mediterranean forest districts in Spain with different management objectives and environmental heterogeneity. First, we identify those landscapes where efforts to improve forest connectivity should be concentrated. In a second stage, we prioritize within those landscapes the individual patches of agricultural lands that, being available for a potential reforestation program, would contribute most to uphold connectivity and ecological flows at wide spatial scales. We show how the extent of the agricultural patches is not strictly related to the contribution to connectivity they would provide if reforested, and how the results of such analysis vary with species traits (dispersal capabilities). We discuss the suitability of the proposed approach for forest landscape planning purposes and conclude that it can provide a useful diagnosis and helpful guidelines for the development of efficient reforestation programs that might be applied in a variety of situations for improving the ecological coherence of forest landscapes.";"García-Feced, C.

MVMC extend over one third of the area of the region. Over the years, MVMC have undergone many changes in terms of ownership and resource management. Such changes have resulted in land tenure insecurity among current landowners, who live in rural areas. The new land uses-mainly related to energy sources-the demographic changes, the role of the Public Administration as a manager of MVMC, the presence of private companies with interests in forests, and the disagreement between forest communities or among commoners of the same community have brought about many conflicts that have gone beyond the limits of forests and have been reflected in public opinion. This paper aims to provide a deeper insight into the level and mode of management of MVMC by determining the level and cause of conflicts associated with this type of forest. To this end, local and regional newspaper articles about conflicts in forest communities were compiled from libraries. In order to find correlations between the different social, economic or environmental variables and the degree of conflict, statistical and spatial analyses were performed. Results reveal a stronger impact of environmental conflicts and conflicts between commoners and government organizations, and a very uneven spatial distribution of conflicts. In addition, this article discusses the interpretation of the higher or lower degree of conflict as a positive or negative contribution to the management of privately owned common land, thus contributing a new methodology to determine the causes and consequences of conflicts over common land management.";"Gómez-Vázquez, I.

But in order to effectively contribute to development agendas, urban agriculture must also present viable, sustainable economic opportunities. This study sets forth vegetable box schemes as a context-appropriate, economically feasible urban agriculture enterprise for which there is growing consumer demand. A survey of 354 subscribers to vegetable box schemes in Cape Town is analysed, finding these households source half of their fresh produce and a quarter of their total groceries from box schemes. The study explores dimensions of consumer satisfaction and considers ways in which box schemes may be expanded.

Land use changes, mainly driven by oasis expansion, significantly impact ecosystem services and functions, but these effects are difficult to quantify. The valuation of ecosystem services is important to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by agriculturalization of oasis. This study aimed to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to land use changes during oasis agricultural expansion activities in the Yanqi Basin from 1964 to 2009. The methods used were based on formula of ecosystem service value (ESV) and ESV coefficients. Satellite data were combined with the ESV coefficients to quantify land use changes and ecosystem service changes in the study area. Sensitivity analysis determined the effect of manipulating the coefficients on the estimated values. The results show that the total ESVs in the Yanqi Basin were $1,674, $1,692, $1,471, $1,732, and $1,603 million in 1964, 1973, 1989, 1999, and 2009, respectively. The net deline in ESV was $71 million in the past 46 years, but the ESVs of each types of landscape changed significantly. The aggregated ESVs of water areas and wetlands were approximately 80 % of the total ESV. Water supply and waste treatment were the two largest service functions and contributed approximately 65 % of the total ESV. The estimated ESVs in this study were elastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimations were robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. These significant changes in land use occur within the entire basin over the study period.

To examine the changes in land use associated with urbanization, the satellite images of the main pool of the Tahtali reservoir prior to filling and subsequent to filling, respectively, are analyzed. Aerial photos of the basin taken in 1995 (October) are compared with images taken in 2005 (November) from the IKONOS satellite through use of several GIS techniques. New residential buildings, greenhouses, and industrial buildings are presented in separate layers, and changes in basin activities are quantified. The effects of urbanization on the water quality are investigated through statistical analysis. The seasonal Kendall test is applied to the water quality parameters monitored bi-weekly at seven stations within the basin for the duration 1997–2005. There was no trend in phosphorus, but there was a negative trend in boron and nitrate and a positive trend in the parameters of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The improvement in nitrate concentrations is attributed to the new regulations on the use of fertilizers in greenhouses. However, increase of BOD and COD concentrations is related to the growing settlement areas and industrial zones, which point to the insufficient wastewater treatment within the basin. Soil erosion within the basin is also quantified by the universal soil loss equation using available maps. Estimated total soil loss rate increased about 2.5 times that of 1995 when the changed land use composition in 2005 is considered in the calculations.";"Elçi, Şebnem

"AGRIS:US201400104140";"Remote sensing and GIS-based landslide susceptibility mapping using frequency ratio and analytical hierarchy methods in Rize province (NE Turkey)";"";"The northeast part of Turkey is prone to landslides because of the climatic conditions, as well as geologic and geomorphologic characteristics of the region. Especially, frequent landslides in the Rize province often result in significant damage to people and property. Therefore, in order to mitigate the damage from landslides and help the planners in selecting suitable locations for implementing development projects, especially in large areas, it is necessary to scientifically assess susceptible areas. In this study, the frequency ratio method and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) were used to produce susceptibility maps. Especially, AHP gives best results because of allowing better structuring of various components, including both objective and subjective aspects and comparing them by a logical and thorough method, which involves a matrix-based pairwise comparison of the contribution of different factors for landslide. For this purpose, lithology, slope angle, slope aspect, land cover, distance to stream, drainage density, and distance to road were considered as landslide causal factors for the study area. The processing of multi-geodata sets was carried out in a raster GIS environment. Lithology was derived from the geological database and additional field studies; slope angle, slope aspect, distance to stream, distance to road and drainage density were invented from digital elevation models; land cover was produced from remote sensing imagery. In the end of study, the results of the analysis were verified using actual landslide location data. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on landslide locations.";"Reis, S.

Average river discharge was higher during 2001 and 2005 ""wet years"" (15 m3/s) than during the drought years of 2002-04 ""dry years"" (8.9 m3/s), but there were no differences in nitrogen loading from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which were the largest and most consistent source of nitrogen to the river (1,330 kg/day). Average total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations remained elevated for 180 km downstream of the Albuquerque WWTP averaging 1.2 mg/l in wet years and 0.52 mg/l in dry years. Possible explanations for the constant elevated TDN concentrations downstream of the major point source include reduced nitrogen retention capacity, minimal contact with riparian or channel vegetation, large suspended sediment loads, and low algal biomass. Somewhat surprisingly, agricultural return flows had lower average nitrogen concentrations than river water originally diverted to agriculture in both wet (0.81 mg/l) and dry years (0.19 mg/l), indicating that the agricultural system is a sink for nitrogen. Lower average nitrogen concentrations in the river during the dry years can be explained by the input of agricultural returns which comprise the majority of river flow in dry years.";"Oelsner, G.P.

"AGRIS:US201301926545";"Landuse impacts on SOC fractions and aggregate stability in typic ustochrepts of Northwest India";"";"The soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions are good indicators of soil quality and environmental stability. Among the factors affecting SOC pool and fluxes in a watershed, land use changes and soil erosion are factors of importance. The differences in SOC and its fractions among different land uses can help understand the process of soil carbon dynamics. A study was conducted in Typic Ustochrepts of Northwest India to understand the impact of forest, grassland, agricultural and eroded lands on aggregate stability and SOC fractions. The undisturbed soil aggregates were sampled from different land uses in a watershed in Shiwaliks of lower Himalayas. The aggregate stability was determined by shaking the pre-saturated aggregates under water and by single simulated raindrop technique. The SOC, labile carbon, hot-water soluble carbon, particulate organic carbon and aggregate associated organic carbon were determined in aggregates of different sizes as well as in the bulk soils. The water stability of aggregates expressed as mean weight diameter (MWD) and stability index (SISRT) was highest in surface soils (0-15 cm) of grasslands followed by forest, agricultural and eroded lands. The WSA > 2 mm (water stable aggregates > 2 mm) were highest (17.3%) in grasslands and lowest (0.85%) in eroded lands. The eroded soils had 2.2, 7.4 and 3.4 times higher amount of micro-aggregates (WSA < 0.25 mm) than agricultural, forest and grassland soils, respectively. The SOC in surface soils significantly decreased by 27% in forest and 45% in agricultural land from that in grassland soils. In subsoil (15-30 cm), the SOC in eroded, agricultural and grasslands was statistically similar. The SOC stock in the subsoil (15-100 cm) was of significance. The grassland soils could store 41 Mg ha⁻¹ SOC stock compared to 31 Mg ha⁻¹ in the subsurface layer. This difference widened in forestland, where subsoil contained 73.4% of total SOC stock in 100 cm soil profile. Among all the SOC fractions studied, labile carbon was mostly affected by erosion and was 91.6% lower in eroded than in grassland soils. The magnitude of aggregate associated organic carbon decreased with aggregate size in all the land uses. Among the SOC fractions, the aggregate stability under simulated raindrop impact could better be explained (R ² = 0.78) by hot water soluble carbon whereas the water stability of aggregate could better be explained (R ² = 0.69) by particulate organic carbon.";"Saha, Debasish

"AGRIS:US2016203373";"ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT LAND USE TYPES IN THE MODEL AREA OF BODROGKÖZ";"A földhasználat-váltás gazdasági modellezése a bodrogközi tájgazdálkodási mintaterületen";"This study deals with five settlements (Karos, Karcsa, Pácin, Nagyrozvágy, Cigánd) of Bodrogköz. The main goal of the case-study is to provide a method for the assessment of the economic impacts of land-use planning. The paper shows the connection between economic and land-use models of specific areas. Although the input conditions of the evaluations (e.g. agri-environmental payments) have changed, the framework of the methodology is independent from the input variables, so it can be a useful example for similar assessments.The first part of the study focuses on potential alternative land use options for the region. We suggested changes in land use on the basis of the so-called ’ecotype’ model. In the second part we present the economic evaluation method of the land use changes. We analyzed the consequences of the suggested conversions based on an economic model. Data collection was done by using questionnaires.The results indicated that in the studied area a range of significant modifications should be carried out, including especially the reduction of arable land area in favour of forests and grasslands.The economic assessments indicated that adjusting land use to suit the potential of the land offers economic advantages; that is, when the suggested changes are implemented with the help of agro-environmental subsidies. Our study however, disregarded all other types of costs (investing into new machinery and special equipment), as well as the social (psychological) aspects of conversion. This latter issue should be taken seriously because significant changes often require farmers to engage in entirely new activities. As transition to a new, drainage-based management system influences a larger area, it also demands cooperation from the farmers and the inhabitants.Researchers and experts consider our evaluation a suitable background for further studies. Our study provides farmers with local information so they can efficiently co-operate in regional land use activities. Similar studies and the continuation of this particular study are suggested in smaller regions within the floodland of River Tisza, where many attempts have already been made to introduce measures of flood¬land landscape management.As the case-study area is an important site of floodplain landscape management, our findings may contribute significantly to the wealth of information on the new perspectives of this special farming method. Therefore another aim of the research was to develop a framework for complex assessments of the floodland landscape management methods. ----------------------------------------------------- A bemutatásra kerülő öt bodrogközi településre (Karos, Karcsa, Pácin, Nagyrozvágy, Cigánd) kiterjedő kutatásunk két részből állt.Az elemzések első része a termőföld hasznosítására vonatkozó javaslatokat alapozta meg, a második rész pedig a javasolt változások gazdasági következményeit kísérelte meg modellezni.A termőföld hasznosítására vonatkozó javaslatok megalapozásához az úgynevezett „ökotípusos” modellt használtuk, míg az elemzés második részében a gazdasági hatásokat kérdőíves felmérésen alapuló ökonómiai modell segítségével értékeltük.Az elemzések eredményei egyértelműen igazolták, hogy a termőhelyi adottságok (beleértve a rendszeres vízkivezetés, így az ártéri gazdálkodás lehetőségét is) alapján a térségben jelentős változásokra lenne szükség. Ez elsősorban a jelenleg szántóként használt területek csökkenését, az erdő- és gyepterületek növekedését jelentené.A termőföld hasznosítására vonatkozó javaslatok gazdasági értékelése azt mutatta, hogy a termőhelyi adottságokhoz történő igazodás – az agrár-környezetgazdálkodási támogatásokat is figyelembe véve – gazdasági szempontból is kedvező lehet. A vizsgálat ugyanakkor nem terjedt ki arra, hogy egy ilyen új típusú környezethasználat megvalósítása milyen egyéb költségekkel jár (új gépek, berendezések), és nem foglalkozik a szociológiai (pszichológiai) kapcsolódásokkal sem. Ez utóbbi azért lehet fontos, mert a gazdáknak a korábbi tevékenységükhöz képest gyakran egy teljesen más típusú tevékenységre kell átállniuk. Továbbá a javasolt termőföld-használatok csak gazdálkodói összefogással valósíthatók meg, hiszen a rendszeres vízkivezetésen alapuló gazdálkodás nagyobb összefüggő térséget érint. A kutatók és a tervezők véleménye alapján az elvégzett elemzések jó kiindulópontot adhatnak a további kutatások elvégzésére, köztük a felsorolt hiányosságok pótlására. A vizsgálat elősegítheti a gazdálkodók hatékonyabb tájékoztatását és ezáltal azok térségi együttműködésének magvalósulását. Hasonló típusú kutatások elvégzését, illetve a jelenlegi munka kiterjesztését elsősorban a Tisza menti ártéri területek esetében javasoljuk, ahol már több helyi próbálkozás is történt az ártéri tájgazdálkodás megvalósítására.";"Schneller, Krisztian

The analysis of the identified sub-regions indicated that the monthly and seasonal precipitation in sub-region C2 had the values above average, while C1 and C3 had the precipitation values under average. The analysis of the linear trend of the mean annual precipitation showed an increasing trend for the stations located in Serbia and three sub-regions.

The Act has limited clearing and development to crops, has protected biodiversity, and may have enhanced soil and water conservation. But this analysis of the prices paid for land in Moree Plains Shire shows that the Act has reduced land values by some 21 per cent and has already reduced annual incomes by 10 per cent across the whole Shire. This reduction in annual incomes may well reach 18 per cent by 2005. This decrease in income means that farm households in the Shire currently must give up 15.6 per cent of their household income because they must protect native vegetation on their farms. In contrast, urban households in Australia must give up only 0.55 per cent of one per cent of their income through taxes for the same purpose. The Act has imposed these costs on farmers who are already struggling financially, has made the distribution of income in the community less equal, and has made farm families bear far higher costs than urban families.

Location: Rice fields in the coastal plain of southern Brazil. Methods: Six rice fields with different management practices were randomly selected (three dry rice fields and three flooded rice fields). Six collections were carried out over the rice cultivation cycle. Richness and biomass were measured using the quadrat method. Results: A total of 88 macrophyte species was recorded. There was no statistical interaction between management practices and rice cultivation phases for macrophyte richness and biomass. Macrophyte species richness and biomass changed over time, but were similar between flooded and dry rice fields. The first three axes generated by detrended correspondence analysis explained 29% of the variation in species composition and the multivariate analysis of variance showed that there was a statistical interaction between management practices and agricultural periods. Conclusions: Rice fields may help to conserve an important fraction of the aquatic macrophyte diversity of wetlands of southern Brazil by providing the setting up of a greater number of species within the agricultural landscape. However, rice fields must not be viewed as surrogate systems for natural wetlands. The difference in species composition between flooded and dry rice fields is interesting in terms of biodiversity conservation. If rice producers could keep part of their agricultural land flooded during the fallow phase, this management practice could be an important strategy for the conservation of biodiversity in areas where natural wetlands have been converted to rice fields.";"Rolon, Ana S.

"AGRIS:US201500146386";"political ecology of land management in the oil palm based cropping system on the Adja plateau in Benin";"";"The Adja plateau (Benin) is densely populated by tenant and landowner farmers engaged in oil palm based cropping. Landowners use oil palm sap for the production of sodabi (a local spirit), and an oil palm fallow (if no crops are grown beneath the palms) to restore soil fertility. In this area, growing oil palm for its oil is uncommon. Tenants access the land under specific contracts but are not allowed to plant oil palm. They grow food crops beneath the oil palm and extend the cropping period by severely pruning the palms because their right to grow food crops terminates when the palms reach a height of 2m. The competing claims between landowners and tenants and between oil palm and annual food crops result in conflicts over practices that either degrade or restore soil fertility. Using a political ecology perspective, we examined how two overlapping institutions shape access to and management of the land: the customary tenure system and the legal system that was introduced to regulate titling and contracting. These institutions have divergent implications for tenants and landowners, in terms of both social equity and land management practices. The implications of this institutional patchwork (bricolage) for joint learning to achieve sustainable agriculture are discussed.";"Yemadje, R.H.

The functioning of selected farming systems and value chains were studied by means of interviews, surveys and farmer group discussions. The findings show that in the ON rice remains the prime agricultural activity; although half of the farm households own cattle (for capital insurance and draught power), livestock management is troublesome because of a lack of grazing land and water points. Rice production is lucrative but approximately half of the farmers in the area studied do not have the land or capital to obtain a good harvest or sell at a profit. The ON supports rice farming through the provision of infrastructure and subsidies but the hierarchical structure of the ON's services and limited human resources hinder the timely availability and quality of its services. More affluent farmers do cope but poorer farmers have a problem to make ends meet. Diversification towards intensive livestock production might offer a new opportunity. The research station, dairy processing unit and dairy co-operatives are dynamic organizations and farmers appear eager to explore this opportunity but our analysis shows the revenue remains modest. We conclude that in order to improve the livelihood of the farmers, especially of the poor, it is critical to focus on institutional change within the rice sector. New forms of collaboration between the ON and the rice farmer organizations might solve most service delivery problems. However, this would require a long process of delicate brokerage, farmer organization and advocacy training. It would be important in the meantime to support activities that generate short-term visible results in the rice or dairy sector.";"Doumbia, D.

This article aims to give insight into how farmers look at soil quality management. Design/methodology/approach: It analyses diverse land management practices and visions on soils and soil quality of ten agroecological and 14 conventional smallholder farmers in Araponga, Minas Gerais, Brazil. As agroecological farming (that is, managing soils with minimum use of external inputs) requires more complex knowledge, it is assumed that agroecological farmers would be more knowledgeable on soils compared to conventional farmers. This case study tests the hypothesis that differences in land management practices between agroecological and conventional farmers can be explained by differences in their knowledge on soils. Findings: The hypothesis turned out to be faulty: agroecological and conventional farmers do not differ in what they know about soils, but how they use their knowledge in their farming strategy. Both groups of farmers have different but rational farming strategies. Practical implications: Designing policies and measures to make farming more environmentally friendly and more sustainable as two-way knowledge exchange between farmers and science (and not as one-way knowledge transfer from science to farmers), to benefit from vital and context-based farmers’ knowledge and to ensure successful implementation of more sustainable land management practices. Originality/value: By analysing farmers’ visions on soil quality management and farming strategies, this study shows that farmers’ knowledge is valuable for farmers, for scientific knowledge on soil quality management and for policies which are to be effective and adapted to the local environment.";"Klingen, Klarien Elisabeth

We surveyed wood-energy facilities, fibermills, sawmills, private landowners, and government landholders to investigate the expected impact of a vibrant wood-energy market on the southern wood supply chain. Specifically, our study was designed to document potential competition for resources, wood supply chain profitability, and landowner willingness to sell timber to energy facilities. Results indicate that wood-energy facilities and traditional mills were not competing for raw material on a large scale at the time of the study, but competition is expected over the next decade. Almost 90% of fibermills reported that traditional forest industry mills should enter the wood-energy market, but most were skeptical that the new market would improve profitability. Ninety percent of responding landowners reported a willingness to sell to energy facilities if the right price is offered and all of those who had already sold timber to an energy facility were satisfied with the experience. Only 3.5% of respondents were unwilling to sell timber to an energy company, and only one of these respondents listed timber production as a primary objective, which indicates those who would not harvest timber for energy, may be unlikely to harvest timber for other purposes also. This study suggests that the southern wood supply chain is in position to profit from a wood-energy market; however, concerns remain about the coexistence of the forest products and wood-energy industries.";"Conrad, Joseph L.

The pixels' time-stability properties were examined with respect to soil, vegetation and topographic parameters in order to determine which physical parameters can be used to identify good candidate observation locations for validating soil moisture from satellite observations and global-scale model output. The results show that the time-stability concept remains valid at the satellite scale. The root mean square error values were 1·47, 1·51, 1·93 and 2·32% for the 1st, 2nd, 50th and 100th most stable fields, respectively. The most stable locations had sand and clay percentages consistent with sandy loam soils and moderate to high normalized difference vegetation index values. Neither land cover nor topography properties could be used to identify potentially stable fields in the study region. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Jacobs, Jennifer M.

CNA is defined as the maximum allowable applied or generated amount (AGA) of a nutrient from natural and human sources that can be emitted and still allow compliance with water quality standards. The CNA calculation method is based on properties of diffuse source pollution, including (i) estimation and analysis of nutrient input-output balances in terrestrial and riverine systems; (ii) prediction of terrestrial nutrient export loads and AGA using riverine loads; and (iii) calculation of critical AGA to meet different regulatory compliance locations (e.g., end of a reach or for the whole reach). The CNA concept was developed, validated and applied for total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) in the ChangLe agriculture-dominated watershed (864km²/27.8km reach) of eastern China. Results indicated that CNA was 7174tNy⁻¹ and 5004tPy⁻¹ for the reach-end control method and 8290tNy⁻¹ and 4425tPy⁻¹ for the whole-reach control method. Annual TN AGA exceeded CNA by 53.2-61.3% and 46.0-55.2% for reach-end and whole-reach control methods in 2004-06, respectively. In contrast, TP AGA values were 90.3-95.9% and 68.3-73.2% below CNA values for reach-end and whole-reach control methods, respectively. These calculations provide a target or permissible nutrient amount that can be used to develop management practices that allow attainment of water quality objectives at the watershed scale.";"Chen, DingJiang

For the Taita Hills study area in Kenya, multi-temporal land-cover models of 1987, 1999 and 2003, derived from Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) imagery using a multi-scale segmentation/object relationship modelling (MSS/ORM) methodology and a rainfall layer, a digital elevation model (DEM) and a digital soil map were applied to model potential soil loss. Population growth in the area has led to a shortage of agricultural land and movement of people to the lowlands, evidenced by a 39% (9.3 km²) increase in croplands from 30% to 41% of the study area during the research time frame. Expansion took place mostly in surrounding foothills and lowlands, at the expense of natural shrubland and grassland, but also occurred in the hills. Universal soil-loss equation (USLE) model results showed a 60% (4 km²) increase in the area of very high potential soil loss, from 7% of the study area in 1987 to 12% in 2003, due mainly to very high soil-loss potential in croplands. Whilst the area of croplands as a whole increased, the relative proportion of very high soil-loss potential in croplands remained 20%, both in 1987 and in 2003, indicating that newly cleared agricultural lands with vulnerable soils are the most at-risk areas.";"Erdogan, Hakki Emrah

"AGRIS:US201400106812";"Assessing the short-term impacts of changing grazing regime at the landscape scale with remote sensing";"";"Livestock grazing is an important form of land use, affecting ecosystems worldwide. In ecoregions that evolved with low densities of large ungulates, such as those in the western United States, there is ongoing debate as to the appropriate concentrations of livestock that can be sustained. Limited landscape-scale monitoring makes it difficult to pinpoint the landscape-scale impacts of livestock on ecosystems. In this study, we use remote sensing to identify landscape-scale changes in Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for community greenness, following changes in land use in south-central Idaho, United States. Grazing allotments in the study area have been managed by Lava Lake Land & Livestock (Lava Lake) since 2001, and recent landscape-scale changes include reduced grazing intensity, longer rest periods and reduced grazing in riparian zones. Additionally, sheep bands owned by Lava Lake were collared with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to track their daily locations during the 2004–2005 summer grazing seasons. We found that increased NDVI was more likely to occur adjacent to riparian channels, which have been a focus for ecological recovery by land managers at Lava Lake. Decreased NDVI was most likely within 500 m of sheep grazing. However, the extent of impact differed depending on land use and elevation. Decreased NDVI on allotments with a large reduction in total number of sheep was most likely within only 60–150 m. Grazing on lands at elevations above 2300 m had no relationship to decreased NDVI. Our results suggest that grazing impacts are heterogeneous across the landscape and depend strongly on stocking rates and elevation (which is correlated to precipitation). Spatial analysis of NDVI can identify landscape-scale changes resulting from livestock grazing that may not be apparent from local monitoring. Patterns of change identified with remote sensing can guide ecosystem monitoring across extensive public and private lands.";"Bradley, Bethany A.

We studied the environmental limitations affecting the realized breeding and wintering distributions of the Citril Finch (Carduelis citrinella), one of the few endemic bird species of European mountain ranges. To assess the environmental limits that shape the seasonal distribution, we used species distribution models (SDMs) derived from macroclimate in combination with land cover information. Our data suggest a high congruence between the potential modelled breeding distribution of the Citril Finch and the currently known breeding sites, indicating a high level of niche filling. The unusual absence in several suitable breeding habitats at the eastern and northern range limit (Eastern Alps, Carpathians, Bavarian Forest, Harz Mountains, Fichtelgebirge, Krkonoše Mountains) is likely linked to a combination of both missing resources and restricted physiological migration capacities from the available wintering grounds. Since the accomplished migratory distances hardly exceed more than 500� km, it seems likely that the distance to the main wintering areas is too large for exceeding eastern and northern range limits. We discuss the differences in SDM outcomes when including distal predictor variables instead of using proximal predictors alone, and highlight the importance of considering a seasonal niche duality to gain more insights into complex range effects in species with seasonal ranges.";"Engler, Jan O.

This paper develops a theoretical model of land use to analyze the optimal conservation of landscapes when land quality is spatially heterogeneous and wildlife habitat is fragmented and socially valuable. When agriculture is the primary cause of fragmentation, we show that reforestation efforts should be targeted to the most fragmented landscapes with an aggregate share of forest equal to a threshold, defined by the ratio of the  opportunity cost of conversion to the social value of core forest. When urban development is the primary cause of fragmentation, we show how spatial heterogeneity in amenities and household neighbor preferences affect the optimal landscape and the design of land-use policies.";"Lewis, David J.

Fast developmental activities and population pressure in the hills of Khanapara–Bornihat area near Guwahati city (about 10 km east of Guwahati) results rapid alteration of the land use/land cover in the recent times. This also causes the growth of land use over the unsuitable topography. As a result, there is a general degradation of the natural resources within the area. So, urgent measures have to be adopted to take up the conservation measure for the management of natural resources. Watershed wise conservation is considered to be the most acceptable and convenient approach. In the context of watershed management, watershed prioritization gained importance in natural resource management. The present study makes an attempt to prioritize the sub-watersheds for adopting the conservation measure. The prioritization is based on land use and slope analysis using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques in Khanapara–Bornihat area of Assam and Meghalaya state (India). The study area of 323.17 sq. km is divided into three 5th order, four 4th order and two 3rd order sub-watersheds. Land use/Land cover change analysis of the sub-watersheds has been carried out using multi temporal data of SOI toposheets of 1972 and IRS LISS III imagery of 2006. The study shows the significance changes in land use pattern especially in settlement and forest lands from 1972 to 2006. Slope map of the sub-watersheds prepared from the contour values in the toposheets show the wide variation of slope in the area ranging from 0° to 87°. Based on the extent/nature of land use/land cover changes over time and land use/land cover—slope relationship analysis, the sub-watersheds are classified into three categories as high, medium and low in terms of priority for conservation and management of natural resources.";"Sarma, Santanu

Land uses at site 1 were maize [M]; pre-harvest burnt sugarcane [SC]; permanent kikuyu pasture [KIK]; pine forest [PF]; wattle forest [W] and undisturbed native grassland [NAT], whereas land managements at site 2 were pre-harvest burning of sugarcane [Bto] or green cane harvesting with retention of a trash mulch [T] (with [F] or without [Fo] fertilizer additions). At site 1, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) separated all land uses, indicating variation in species composition between sites. Species richness and diversity but not evenness differed between land uses. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that soil properties (extractable P, acidity, Mg, total cations, K and organic C) were significantly related to bacterial community composition. At site 2, NMS indicated large differences in soil bacterial community composition under trashing versus pre-harvest burning. Species richness was significantly different between treatments but not evenness or diversity. CCA indicated organic C was the main factor associated with the trashing/burning effect and exchangeable Mg with the fertilizer effect, on bacterial communities. Long-term differences in land use or soil management within a single soil type and location thus induced substantial differences in bacterial community composition.";"Wallis, P.D.

The study involves field studies and modelling of the geographical distribution of yams and seeks correlations between environmental and ethno-biological data. Terrain analysis consists of phyto-ecological surveys and interviews with local inhabitants. A cluster analysis of a multi-date image of data obtained by remote-sensing is used to assess land-cover. The Bayesian post-probabilities of occurrence of each species are inferred using Weight of Evidence modelling linked to a Geographical Information System. The model is implemented with land-cover units and annual Moisture Availability Index evidential-layers and is driven by species presence data. The probabilities of occurrence of each species throughout the whole area as well as within and without the protected areas and in the vicinity of the sites of enquiries are calculated. A multi-factorial analysis makes it possible to shed light on the relationships among land use, the availability of yams, the uses of yams, knowledge and local practice. Results provide statistical evidence of spatial association between the yam species and the environmental descriptors taken into account. The study also provides evidence of an important regional variability in the actual uses and knowledge of wild yams. The rather widespread use of wild yams as a food complement, in social relations and as merchandise in local trade in the North of the area studied, which is far less observed in the South, is one of the major components of this variability.";"Devineau, Jean-Louis

The model is tested using data from Kenya where FHH are categorized by different land tenure security schemes.

"AGRIS:US201400002706";"When edges meet: interacting edge effects in an African savanna";"";"1. Ecological edges (zones separating ecosystems or land cover types) can function as active boundaries, unique habitats and dynamic transition zones. Abiotic factors, species and species interactions exhibit strong responses to edges, and these responses - edge effects - can profoundly impact ecosystem structure and function. 2. Edge effects may be altered by the presence or proximity of other nearby edges. This phenomenon - edge interaction - is poorly understood, though its importance is increasingly recognized. Edge interactions are likely in fragmented or patchy landscapes that contain many edges. In such landscapes, understanding how nearby edges interact may be critical for effective conservation and management. 3. I examined edge interactions in an East African savanna. In this landscape, abandoned cattle corrals develop into treeless, nutrient-rich ‘glades' that persist as preferentially grazed areas for decades to centuries. Glades represent important sources of structural and functional landscape heterogeneity and have major impacts on distributional patterns of plant and animals. 4. I used existing variation in inter-glade distance to investigate the importance and strength of glade edge interactions for plants, Acacia ants and large herbivores. Specifically, I compared response patterns obtained from transects that extended outward from isolated glades (>250 m from another glade) and non-isolated glades (<150 m from another glade). 5. Edge effect patterns between nearby glades differed significantly from patterns around isolated glades. When compared to areas outside isolated glades, areas between glades had almost twice the density of trees, half as much large herbivore use, reduced cover of glade-dominant grasses, and different Acacia ant communities. Many of the edge effects observed between non-isolated glades could not be inferred from effects around isolated glades. 6. Synthesis. These findings suggest that edge interactions can alter plant and animal distributions in patchy landscapes. Edge effects near multiple edges can be stronger, weaker or qualitatively different from those near isolated edges. Such edge interactions can increase or decrease structural and functional continuity between nearby patches. Appropriate extrapolation of local edge effects in complex and fragmented landscapes will require greater understanding of edge interactions.";"Porensky, Lauren McGeoch";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400002706";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01824.x";"";"";"";"923-934"

What is the relative importance of (1) local site factors and (2) landscape factors in determining spontaneous vegetation succession? Location: Various regions of the Czech Republic, Central Europe. The regions represent two categories characterized by agrarian lowlands, with a relatively warm and dry climate, and predominant woodland uplands with a relatively cold and wet climate. Methods: Gravel‐sand pits ranged in age from 1–75 years since abandonment. Three types of sites were distinguished: dry, wet and hydric in shallow flooded sites. Vegetation relevés were recorded with species cover (%) visually estimated using the space‐for‐time substitution approach. Local site factors, such as water table and soil characteristics, and landscape characteristics, namely climatic parameters, presence of nearby (semi‐) natural plant communities and main land cover categories in the wider surroundings, were evaluated. Results: Ordination analyses showed that water table was the most important local site factor influencing the course of spontaneous vegetation succession. Succession was further significantly influenced by soil texture, pH, macroclimate, the presence of some nearby (semi‐) natural communities and some land cover categories in the wider surroundings. Spontaneous vegetation succession led to the formation of either shrubby grassland, deciduous woodland, alder and willow carrs, and tall sedge or reed and Typha beds in later stages depending predominantly on the site moisture conditions. Conclusions: Although the water table was the most influential on the course of vegetation succession, the landscape factors together explained more vegetation variability (44%) than local site factors (23%).";"Rehounková, Klára

These may undergo secondary succession or reforestation. We experimentally tested the response of soil chemical properties to secondary succession (old field) and to Quercus ilex plantation (reforested cropland) in a Mediterranean cropland that was abandoned 13 years ago. We also evaluated the relevance of previous reforestation management (four combinations of presence and absence of irrigation and shading) in addition to current environmental conditions (herbaceous community and cover of oak canopy) on soil chemistry in the reforested cropland. Carbon and NH4+–N concentrations and availability of mineral N were higher in the reforested cropland than in the old field. However, soil pH, total N, P, K and NO3−–N concentrations, mineralization rates, and available PO43−–P were similar in the reforested cropland as well as in the old field. Previous reforestation management practices, particularly irrigation, and current environmental conditions, mostly biomass and composition of the herbaceous community, affected soil chemistry. Irrigation increased K and P concentrations and NH4+–N availability. This study highlights the overall slow dynamics of soil chemistry in Mediterranean ecosystems, which has resulted in little variation of soil properties in reforested cropland after more than a decade. Reforestation can accelerate the recovery of some soil properties of abandoned cropland in comparison with secondary succession, but these effects will be more noticeable in longer time periods.";"Cuesta, B.

"AGRIS:US201301869666";"Uneven distribution of weeds along extensive transects in Australia's Northern Territory points to management solutions";"";"The Top End region of the Northern Territory, Australia, is noted for its relatively unmodified natural state. To gain some insight into the potential for maintaining ecosystem health in this region we undertook a study that assessed the distribution of weeds across very extensive transects. This weed survey was distinct from other studies in that many of the sample sites were distant from tracks or other infrastructure. Twenty-one weed species were recorded along 2000 km of transects. Weeds were reported from 18.7% of the 718 sample points. The incidence of weeds was found to be significantly associated with land tenure, being highest on pastoral lands and peri-urban areas, and very low on Aboriginal lands. The incidence of weeds increased significantly with increasing levels of infrastructure and with increasing proximity to watercourses. There are three main conclusions from this study. First, much of the Top End, particularly remote Aboriginal lands, has exceptionally low levels of weed infestation. Secondly, in such areas, given the relatively small extent of vegetation change through weed invasion, maintenance or re-imposition of traditional fire regimes should be achievable. Thirdly, there is substantial potential for spread of weeds to remote areas, with such spread most likely to occur through increased penetration by infrastructure. Importantly this study indicates that there is still opportunity to prevent widespread weed invasion across the Top End, which is timely given the current Government consideration of the potential for the region to support future agricultural expansion and the fast-paced development of mining, oil and gas resources.";"Preece, Noel

"AGRIS:US201500202678";"tool for mapping and spatio-temporal analysis of hydrological data";"";"There is a need in water sciences for computational tools to integrate large spatially distributed datasets to provide insight into the spatial and temporal domains of the data while allowing visualization, analysis in the spatial and temporal dimensions, data metrics, and pattern recognition in the same application. Spatial and temporal variability of hydrological processes as well as the associated phenomena transport is better represented in high spatio-temporal resolution datasets. A conceptual data model and analysis tool, SPELLmap, was developed at the USDA Agricultural Research Service, Grazinglands Research Laboratory using the Delphi programming language to rapidly process, manipulate, analyze, and visualize large geo-located datasets. SPELLmap integrates the spatial and temporal domains of hydrological data to perform analyses in space and time while providing data metrics. SPELLmap has the capacity to represent three or four dimensional problems using a layer data structure. Three examples to illustrate SPELLmap functionalities were provided for the raster and raster-to-network domains. SPELLmap can be used for data interpolation, visualization, gridding, pattern recognition, and data metrics in integrated environmental modeling problems.";"Guzman, J.A.

"AGRIS:US2016215344";"ASSESSING THE COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USE CHANGES: A SITE-SPECIFIC, POLICY-SCALE MODELING APPROACH";"";"The growth in federal conservation programs has created a need for policy modeling frameworks capable of measuring micro-level behavioral responses and macro-level landscape changes. This paper presents an empirical model that predicts crop choices, crop rotations, and conservation tillage adoption as a function of conservation payment levels, profits, and other variables at more than 42,000 agricultural sites of the National Resource Inventory (NRI) in the Upper Mississippi River Basin. Predicted changes in crop choices and tillage practices are then fed into site-specific environmental production functions to determine changes in nitrate runoff and leaching and in water and wind erosion at each NRI site. This policy-scale model is applied to the case of green payments for the adoption of conservation practices (conservation tillage and crop rotations) in the Upper Mississippi River Basin, a region under scrutiny as a significant source of nutrient loadings to the Mississippi River, causing hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Results from this application suggest that payments for conservation tillage and crop rotations increase the use of these conservation practices. However, the acreage response is inelastic and the programs are not likely to be cost effective on their own for addressing the hypoxia problem in the Gulf of Mexico.";"Wu, JunJie

For generation and evaluation reasons, the findings fromthe factor research are the focus of the study. After introducing the topic ofsuccess factor research, current empirical methods are compared based on theirexplanatory potential. As a result of the comparison, it was decided to apply aconfirmatory approach.Linear structure equation models with latent variables are applied to the database.The explanation of the method occurs in chapter 3. They are applied on thefactor analysis as well as the path analysis because linear structural equationmodels concern both.In the following, the database, which is based on the results of annual financialstatements of agricultural enterprises from southern Saxony-Anhalt, is introduced.Following, there occurs the characterisation and discussion of the data.The next chapter contains the results of the partial analytical investigation ofpossible variables which may influence the success of agricultural enterprises.Embedded in a theoretical framework, the basic theoretical hypotheses wereformulated. The theoretical basis of research hypotheses is based on the managementmodel for enterprises, which makes a distinction between managementlevel and other dimensions of business administration. Based on these results,and on the results of the descriptive evaluation, concrete research hypotheses areformulated. The hypotheses imply a positive effect of the single dimensions ofbusiness administration, such as market orientation, technology orientation, costorientation and resource orientation, on enterprise success.The hypotheses are tested in factor-analytic models, and structured equationmodels of the first and second order are discussed regarding content. As a result,production and costs orientation and market orientation most affect enterprisesuccess. Therefore, the influence of management and business administrationwere found to be factors of success in different performance data.

"AGRIS:US2016215616";"Land grabbing in Eastern Europe: global food security and land governance in post - Soviet Eurasia";"";"While ‘land grabbing’ in Africa by China, and other populous, high-income Asian countries such as South Korea got quite some attention, land grabbing in post-Soviet Eurasia has gone largely unnoticed. However, as this paper shows, recently also in the latter region foreign state and private companies are accumulating vast expanses of farm land. The paper discusses the factors which make post-Soviet Eurasia such an attractive area for international investment, with arguably much more potential than most areas in Africa or Asia. Second, the process of land accumulation and acquisition of farms is described. Both domestic as well as international accumulation of land is dealt with, placing this in the domestic context of agricultural development and institutions. Furthermore, the main actors (investors) involved in land grabbing are distinguished (according to their country of origin and legal or institutional form). Third, the paper outlines the main obstacles (and points of contention) concerning the emergence (and effectiveness/performance) of domestic and especially international, agro-holdings in the region, and will present some preliminary findings around the question whether this development is a necessary step towards agricultural modernization, or that there are substantial disadvantages to land grabbing.";"Visser, Oane

"AGRIS:US201400107148";"Development of a sub-pixel analysis method applied to dynamic monitoring of floods";"";"Traditional ‘in situ’ measurement techniques often fail to record the spatial distribution of floodplains. In that case, remote sensing provides inexpensive and reliable methodologies to map flooded areas and compute flood damage. The identification and monitoring of floods, due to their highly dynamic nature, require the use of high-time-resolution satellite images with the drawback that such images usually have low to medium spatial resolution. In this context, the traditional classification techniques would not be suitable for delineating floods because they use ‘hard methods’ of classification, where the coarse pixel is assigned to a unique land cover class, generating inaccurate maps of the flooded area. In contrast, the ‘soft methods’ assign several land cover classes within the coarse pixels. In this article, the theoretical basis regarding an innovative methodology of sub-pixel analysis (SA) to identify flooded areas is developed. The improvement in flood delineation is achieved with the use of primary topographic attributes, which stem from a digital elevation model (DEM). The methodology was applied to the monitoring of flood events in the lower Senegal River Valley, using satellite images with moderate spatial resolution. The proposed methodology was demonstrated to be effective for mapping the flood extent: the correct mapping of flooded areas was about 80% in all considered regions, whilst the better performance of supervised classification was 53%.";"Giraldo Osorio, Juan Diego

The results showed that: (i) Under drought stress of 20% PEG-6000, the germination rate, vigor index, germination index and biomass of pigeon pea seeds on day 7 cultivated with karst water were all greater than that of the allogenic water treatment group, while the seed germination stress index was significantly smaller than that of the allogenic water treatment group, suggesting that karst water environment was more favorable to pigeon pea seed germination, (ii) Without drought stress, the malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities of pigeon pea seeds cultivated with karst water were all smaller than that of the allogenic water group. However, under drought stress, the SOD activity was significantly higher than that of allogenic water group, suggesting pigeon pea SOD in karst water was able to more rapidly respond to external drought stress, and increase its own activity to reduce the damage to the plants. And (iii) with and without drought stress, the soluble protein level of the karst water group was higher than that of the allogenic water group, while the free amino acid level was lower than that of the allogenic water group. This difference was more significant with the presence of drought stress, suggesting that the karst water environment was more favorable to the accumulation of soluble proteins and thus produced larger biomass. Hence, pigeon pea is a tree species that is adapted to high-calcium, alkaline environments in karst areas, and is of great significance for the revegetation and rocky desertification control in mountainous karst areas.";"Fen, Huang

"AGRIS:US2016210040";"ANALYSING THE LOW ADOPTION OF WATER CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGIES BY SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA";"";"Natural resource degradation and water scarcity are a global concern, which typically threatens the sustainability of smallholder farmers' livelihoods in semi-arid developing areas.  As part of research efforts, a number of water-conservation technologies (WCT) have been developed, yet with low adoption rates in smallholder farming environments.  This paper discusses the concepts of adoption and innovation, comparing the perspectives of research operators to the ones of smallholder farmers.  Discrepancies are highlighted and ultimately explain low uptake of technologies by farmer.  Then it addresses socio-economic factors affecting such adoption.  It is argued that WCT show specific traits: (1) diversity and applicability to different time and spatial scales; (2) hence, the dependency upon a context.  These traits influence dissemination and adoption of WCT, and should not be ignored, from the early stage of technology development.  It is shown that adoption does not only depend on individual farmers willingness, but also upon the role of property rights on resources, and collective action at community level.  Other specific issues and factors like the demand for WCT, the role of public sector and research, and related biases are also discusses.  It finally draws some recommendations towards rural livelihoods that are more sustainable.  Farmers' participation in technology development, taking account of local indigenous knowledge and sound institutional arrangements are among other the pathways that are suggested towards a better integration of technology development and innovation processes.";"Perret, Sylvain R.

Growing evidence indicates that regeneration of Mediterranean forests can be halted under certain circumstances and that successional stages can become notoriously persistent. The Mediterranean sclerophyllous forest in central Chile is been largely transformed into savannas dominated by the invasive legume tree Acacia caven as result of interacting management and ecological factors. We used multi-temporal satellite imagery to study the transition dynamics of these major vegetation types over the last four decades (1975–2008). Vegetation changes were related to indicators of resource availability (topography, water availability, solar radiance), potential propagule availability (distance to forest remnant patches) and disturbance regimes (grazing, fire occurrence and distance to roads and cities). During this study period, forests were mostly converted into Acacia savannas (46.1%). Acacia savanna was the most persistent natural vegetation type. The probability of sclerophyllous forest degradation into Acacia savanna increased on drier northern-exposed slopes, close to roads and further away from forest remnants. In contrast, forest regeneration from Acacia savanna was higher on moister southern-exposed slopes and closer to forest remnants. Acacia savannas are increasingly being converted into cultivated land on the moister locations or switching into a bare soil state in locations close to cities and further away from forest remnants. These results highlight the vulnerability of diverse sclerophyllous forests and its increasing conversion into persistent Acacia savannas in the Mediterranean region of central Chile and identify the ecological conditions for successful conservation and restoration of the native sclerophyllous forest vegetation that can be used for sensible land use planning.";"Van de Wouw, Paul

This study analyses the implementation of the new moose management system, focusing on the newly formed partnerships at ecosystem level (the moose management areas) and their potential to ease conflicts between participants and develop into sustainable collaborations that enable ecosystem-based management. Empirical evidence was obtained from semi-structured interviews with involved actors (hunters, landowners, wildlife managers and forest consultants) in five Swedish counties. Several challenges, based on the participants’ abilities, willingness and understanding needed to implement the new management system, were identified. Lack of funding, unclear roles and responsibilities appear to be the most serious issues. If these are not properly solved, then they have the potential to hamper and aggravate the implementation of the new management system, that is, the ecosystem-based management, as well as the partnership arrangement.";"Bjärstig, Therese

We used data from households, key informants (elders, park managers), and focus group discussions. Poor wildlife policy resulting in space competition between wildlife and humans (other forms of land use), limited means of revenue generation for insiders and centralized benefits from tourism have accumulated grievance and then conflict between national park authority and local communities. Contested land tenure and overlapping claims generated by ill-defined property rights, as interrelated factors, sustained the conflicts. Weak information sharing, rising demographic pressure and conservation policies, giving more priority to global and national than local interests, contributed to the conflict. The result implies that efforts in revitalizing customary authorities and institutions and introducing a co-management strategy can immensely provide an avenue to manage conflicts between communities and park managers.";"Teferra, Fekadu

"AGRIS:US2016201457";"Security of Tenure and Land Registration in Africa: Literature Review and Synthesis";"";"In 1984, the Land Tenure Center embarked on a project to evaluate the experiences with land registration and tenure reform in Africa. The goal was to determine is African states been able to use tenure reform and land registration to provide greater security of tenure than was available through customary tenure systems. Donor agencies focused attention on the creation of individual freehold title, emphasizing the heightened security of holding, marketability, and access to credit under such tenure. National governments, on the other hand, were more concerned to see that land was used productively rather than merely accumulated for purposes of prestige or inheritance or as a hedge against inflation, and for this reason have tended to favor granting more circumscribed rights, such as leaseholds or rights of occupancy. This literature review and synthesis was prepared as part of an effort to increase very substantially our knowledge, especially on a quantitative level, of tenure and development relationships in Africa. The literature review is an attempt to gather in one place data about the diverse efforts at land registration and to describe briefly for each country the various registration programs that have taken place (if any), why they were undertaken, and what subsequent studies of these programs have found. Among other things, it will be seen that the intended benefits, and beneficiaries, of land registration have changed over the century or so since the first systems were put in place. In addition to these variations over time, there are also differences among Anglophone, Francophone, and Lusophone countries, differences that not only influenced the structure of registration systems established during the colonial era, but also continue to inform the kinds of registration systems adopted today.";"Dickerman, Carol W.

Here, I synthesize the complex effects of incentives on ecosystem services through their influence on land use and management. Linkages between incentives and land use change, and between land use change and ecosystem services can be one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. Change in land use and management can affect multiple ecosystem services, with both co-benefits and trade-offs. Incentives can motivate multiple changes in land use and management and multiple incentives often interact with both synergies and tensions in their effect upon ecosystem services. These vary over both space and time, and can be non-linear. Depending on incentive design, changes in ecosystem service supply can also have a feedback effect on incentive prices. I suggest that continued quantitative development is required to further explore these linkages: in the influence of incentives on land use change; in the impact of land use change on ecosystem services, and; in ecosystem service supply feedbacks on incentive prices. Quantifying and understanding these linkages is essential to progress more comprehensive analyses of the impact of incentives on ecosystem services, and the design of incentives capable of realizing synergies and avoiding tensions.";"Bryan, Brett A.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use planning";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217859";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2012.12.010";"";"";"";"124-134"

Substituting these normal form-factors and their relative heights into a generalized volume equation from the literature, the coefficients of the volume equation for P. bambusoides were determined. The applicability of the determined volume equation was evaluated using the test data collected from four different districts. The volume equation worked as a good model for estimating apparent culm volume for P. bambusoides, although it provided an underestimation of the culm volume when the site productivity was low. The result also demonstrated that there was a need for distinguishing the volume equation among bamboo species, because of the variability in the culm form. In conclusion, the volume equation presented here is one of the most effective models for evaluating the culm volume or stock for P. bambusoides.";"Inoue, Akio

A Case Study in the Cuitzeo Lake Watershed, Central Mexico";"";"Efficient natural resources management, including continental water at watershed level, requires understanding the arrangement of landscape attributes in a region. The geographical analysis of landscape attributes is a useful approach to delineate relatively homogeneous watersheds or regions. This research was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of land cover through time on regionalisation modelling in the poorly-gauged Cuitzeo Lake Watershed, and to develop models to create two hydrogeographical regionalisations for the years 1975 and 2000. The inputs required by the regionalisation methodology were integrated in a GIS and validated before carrying out statistical regionalisation procedures (cluster analysis and PCA). GIS operations were done in Arc View 3.2 and statistical analyses in PC-ORD. Median Euclidean distances with mean distance linkage methods were used. A 75% of similarity was chosen as the threshold to generate regions. Importance rankings of regions were obtained using multicriteria evaluation methods. Based on the analysis, 38 of the 52 subwatersheds belonging to the Cuitzeo Lake Watershed were clustered; eight groups were defined in 1975 and nine in 2000. According to PCA, the strongest positive variables are associated to morphometric, geologic, land cover and soil attributes. Fourteen subwatersheds were never clustered. Four subwatersheds changed of cluster between 1975 and 2000. This change is explained because of rainfed agricultural parcel abandonment, and subsequent shrubland growth. This means that the hydrogeographical regionalisation is sensitive to land cover change processes. The methodological approach applied in this research is a low-cost and fast alternative for evaluating the impact of land cover and land use change on hydrogeographical regionalisation; in consequence, data and information generated during the analysis were made available to local authorities so that they can improve both water resources planning and their informational baseline for decision making and for development of environmental policies in the Cuitzeo Lake Watershed.";"Carlón Allende, Teodoro

Valencian agriculture has some key characteristics that make it different to the agriculture practiced in other Spanish regions. Such specificity brings about the existence of particular problems which are intrinsic to this region (some, however, are common to all farmers). On the other hand, the common agricultural policy (CAP) has contributed to create other type of social and ecological problems in the European agriculture. Organic agriculture, which has experienced an extraordinary increase in Europe and Spain in the last few years, could contribute to solve these problems. However, and despite the recent increase, this agriculture is still a minor practice in Spain in relation to the so-called conventional agriculture. In order to extend organic agriculture, it is necessary to overcome the barriers affecting this type of production.

El presente artículo sugiere a la agricultura ecológica como una herramienta útil para el desarrollo rural en general, y de la comunidad valenciana en particular. La agricultura valenciana presenta una serie de características definitorias que la hacen diferente a la agricultura practicada en otras comunidades autónomas. Dicha especificidad conlleva la existencia de problemas también a esta comunidad (algunos de ellos comunes a los problemas de todos los agricultores y ganaderos). Por otro lado, la política agraria común (PAC) ha contribuido a generar otro tipo de problemas sociales y medioambientales en toda la agricultura europea. La agricultura ecológica, que ha crecido de manera extraordinaria en los últimos años en España y el resto de Europa, podría ayudar a solventar dichos problemas. Sin embargo, y a pesar del desarrollo de los últimos años, esta agricultura todavía supone una práctica minoritaria en España en relación a la agricultura convencional. Para favorecer el aumento en la producción agrícola ecológica es necesario superar las barreras que se oponen a su desarrollo.";"Rivera Ferre, M.G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2005-12-31";"es";"land policies;rural development;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Policy & Legislation";"150;ESP";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=ES2007000023";"http://gestar1.unizar.es/cederul/revista/num9/6.pdf";"";"";"";"95-102"

"AGRIS:US201600185104";"Can ecological land classification increase the utility of vegetation monitoring data?";"";"Vegetation dynamics in rangelands and other ecosystems are known to be mediated by topoedaphic properties. Vegetation monitoring programs, however, often do not consider the impact of soils and other sources of landscape heterogeneity on the temporal patterns observed. Ecological sites (ES) comprise a land classification system based on soil, topographic, and climate variations that can be readily applied by land managers to classify topoedaphic properties at monitoring locations. We used a long-term (>40y) vegetation record from southeastern Arizona, USA to test the utility of an ES classification for refining interpretations of monitoring data in an area of relatively subtle soil differences. We focused on two phenomena important to rangeland management in the southeastern Arizona region: expansion of the native tree velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina Woot.) and spread of the introduced perennial grass Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees). Specifically, we sought to determine if a quantitative, ES-specific analysis of the long-term record would (1) improve detection of changes in plant species having heightened ecological or management importance and (2) further clarify topoedaphic effects on vegetation trajectories. We found that ES class membership was a significant factor explaining spatiotemporal variation in velvet mesquite canopy cover, Lehmann lovegrass basal cover, and Lehmann lovegrass density measurements. In addition, we observed that the potential magnitude of velvet mesquite and Lehmann lovegrass increases varied substantially among ES classes. Our study brings attention to a practical land management tool that might be called upon to increase the effectiveness of vegetation-based indicators of ecosystem change.";"Williamson, Jeb C.

Spatially explicit data about the nature conservation areas, land use plans and steep slopes were integrated with Multi-source National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI) data. The Finnish forestry model MELA was used in the calculations related to updating forest data and estimating different scenarios of timber production with and without constraints. In the study area, the annual volume of maximum sustainable cutting removal defined for the next 30 years was decreased by one-third due to restrictions. The presented approach could be used, for example, to assess timber availability at the landscape level. Future challenges include ensuring the compatibility of spatially explicit data obtained from different sources, identifying the feasibility of forest management operations in the restricted area, and incorporating near-nature forest management operations in the forest planning system in order to estimate the timber production.";"Kärkkäinen, Leena

Human activities have transformed the landscapes in southern China where damaged river systems need to be restored and better managed for achieving environmental sustainability. Toward this end, we quantified the land use and land cover pattern of the Dongjiang River watershed, China between 1990 and 2006 based on remote sensing data and field measurements. We then analyzed how river flow and several water quality variables were related to landscape attributes at three scales: subwatershed, catchment, and buffer. Our results show that the water quality of the Dongjiang River differed among the upper, middle, and lower reaches and also changed significantly during the recent decades. These changes in space and time indicate a trend of accelerating deterioration in water quality. Also, land use and land cover pattern had major impacts on the flow and water quality of the Dongjiang River at multiple spatial scales. In particular, urban land use, although small in percent cover, exerted a disproportionately large influence both locally and over distance. We also found that most water quality variables (Cl⁻, EC, NH₃–N, and NO₃–N) were correlated with landscape pattern on all three spatial scales although the correlation was stronger at the subwatershed scale than at the catchment and buffer scales. This scale multiplicity suggests that, while water-monitoring and river restoration need to adopt a multi-scale perspective, particular attention should be paid to the subwatershed scale. In addition, the control of pollution sources associated with socioeconomic activities ought to be explicitly incorporated in landscape management practices.";"Zhou, Ting

"AGRIS:US201500163047";"Pan-European distribution modelling of stream riparian zones based on multi-source Earth Observation data";"";"Freshwater ecosystems are among the most degraded and threatened globally. A need for systematic assessment of riverine habitats is thus well-documented. Riparian zones are especially important due to the large array of ecosystem and social services they can provide, while also recently gaining a major role in the new European biodiversity policy. In this context, the necessity to gather spatial information on extent, distribution and characteristics of the riparian zones is clear. This paper presents the development of a novel model to derive geographical distribution and basic characteristics of stream riparian zones in Europe, including both river-floodplain systems and the riparian networks of minor and ephemeral streams. A series of relevant descriptive attributes (water boundary, vegetation presence, land-cover, upland boundary and local geomorphology) is initially selected from the existing literature to describe the presence of riparian zones. Spatially explicit estimates of these attributes are obtained using available Earth Observation data and pan-European thematic datasets. Finally, the information layers are combined through an aggregation system that assigns a degree of belonging to the riparian zone class using two fuzzy membership functions to evaluate water influence and presence of natural vegetation, respectively. Riparian zones with no hydrological connection are also incorporated in by the model based on functional considerations. The distribution of stream riparian zones was derived and mapped for the whole of Europe at fine resolution. Modelled riparian zones extend for approximately 91,000km², considering the entire range of low to high membership to the riparian class. A characterization of land-cover types was derived based on Corine Land Cover 2000 data, showing that European riparian zones are strongly dominated by forest habitats. Accuracy assessment was performed using independent ecological datasets and visual validation, indicating that producer accuracy is equal to 84.5±1.3% and user accuracy to 72.6±5.8% at 95% confidence level. The proposed model and output can represent valuable information for large-scale research activities of riparian environments and to support national and supra-national conservation programmes.";"Clerici, Nicola

The contrast between the potential ofagricultural enterprises and their present desolate condition remains verystriking. At the same time, the role of individual subsidiary holdings inagricultural production has increased substantially. The general economic crisisin agriculture encouraged growth in the number of individual subsidiaryholdings (ISH) and made them the most important agricultural producers inUkraine.The goals of this dissertation are (1) to analyse the development oforganisational forms in Ukrainian agriculture, taking into account historicalfactors, (2) to determine differences between successful and unsuccessfulenterprises, and (3) to determine the relationships (linkages) between ISHs andlarge agricultural enterprises.To fulfill the goals of the dissertation data from 78 large agricultural enterprisesfor 1995-1999 was examined. Moreover, in 2000 and 2002, 90 ISHs from 17large agricultural enterprises were surveyed. The results of all interviews weresummarized, including those that significantly deviated from the average, inorder to present both norms and extremes.The study found a considerable divergence among restructured farm enterprises,both in terms of internal reorganisation and efficiency and in terms ofmanagerial attitudes of new farm managers. Also various historical, economicand other reasons had an impact on the structure of reformed enterprises; thesefactors differ significantly by region in the Ukraine. These differences inagricultural development have their origins in property rights development aswell as in differences of geopolitical position, and, therefore, in the influence ofdifferent cultures. The study emphasizes that in Ukraine there exists a cleartendency to establish agricultural enterprises with many owners and employees.The future development of large agricultural enterprises is entirely depended onsetting up of adequate general economic conditions, consequential internalrestructuring of agricultural enterprises and essential changes in the enterprise’smanagement.The efficiency of ISHs is very strongly affected by how and where they receivetheir production inputs.

The present study evaluated the capabilities of carbon sequestration and foliar dust retention in 88 woody tree species, and 1520 individuals in the greenbelts along Taiwan National Highways no. 1 and no. 3. More than 2.2 and 1.7 million average annual vehicle passages were respectively recorded for the two highways. Among species, Bischofia javanica, Acacia confusa, Swietenia macrophylla and Alstonia scholaris exhibited optimal carbon sequestration capabilities in trunks and branches, with respective carbon storage levels of 175, 105, 23.8 and 15 kg per plant. Results showed a respective estimated 19.9 and 12.3 thousand tons of carbon sequestrated by trunks and branches in greenbelts of Highways no. 1 and no. 3, respectively. The foliar dust retention capabilities of Ac. confusa and Casuarina equisetifolia were the highest in the two greenbelts, with respective foliar dust retentions of 564.9 and 60.3 g per plant. The leaves in the two greenbelts retained an estimated 47.9 and 17.3 t of foliar dust for Highways no. 1 and no. 3, respectively. The present study demonstrated that woody plant species in greenbelts exhibit a substantial contribution to carbon sequestration and foliar dust retention for two heavily used highways in Taiwan.";"Wang, Y.‐C.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"TWN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400170012";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2011.00494.x";"";"";"";"244-251"
"AGRIS:US201600190107";"Effects of land abandonment on bird communities of smallholder farming landscapes in post-war Croatia: implications for conservation policies";"";"Land abandonment is a widespread phenomenon in agricultural systems, especially in former communist countries of Eastern and South-eastern Europe. Moreover, Croatia was affected by acts of war which enhanced the depopulation of marginal areas impelling further land abandonment. Agricultural landscapes in Croatia are highly parcelled with various proportions of forest habitats due to traditional smallholder farming systems. Secondary successions as a consequence of land abandonment affect farmland birds that are among the most endangered bird species in Europe. We examined bird communities along a habitat gradient in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. We used the share of woody vegetation cover as a proxy measure for land abandonment that we classified in four classes. Our results showed no significant Shannon Wiener Index differences of bird communities along the land abandonment gradient. However, there were differences in abundances when we examined bird guilds such as farmland, forest and âotherâ birds separately. However, the conservation value of each of the four land abandonment classes did not show significant differences. We extracted single bird species such as the Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio), Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) and European Robin (Erithacus rubecula) as potential indicator species for the four examined land abandonment levels. With these four species we successfully modelled the distribution of the recorded bird assemblages at the plot level along the four vegetation succession stages. We emphasized the need to develop new and integrative land use management concepts for areas affected by land abandonment in order to formulate sound conservation policy.";"MikuliÄ, K.

Approximation Soil Taxonomic System of the region western part of the Büyük Menderes Basin by using Landsat satellite images in remote sensing technique. The data gathered from field observation about some soil properties and land requirements of different land use types were correlated and as a result of that the boundaries of land use patterns were carried out. Land use patterns were detected according to suitable land use classes for soil mapping units and potential land use map were done. Land use assessment is likely to be the prediction of land potential for productive land use types. This case is great important in guiding decisions on land uses in terms of potential and conserving natural resources for future generations. The main objective of this study was to determine land resources and to assess potential land use in the west part of the Büyük Menderes Basin of Aegean region. The study area covers about 24.300 km2 and formed on alluvial material deposited by Büyük Menders River. Using Landsat 5 TM satellite images, which cover back and foot slope of mountain and alluvial plains of the western part of Menderes Basin, and taking physiographic units of the region as basis, detailed soil series and phases were determined. Soils of the region were classified as Entisol, Inceptisol as 2 orders, 4 suborders, 4 great groups and 6 sub groups, and 10 series. Twenty-five different land utilization types grouped into 4 major land use groups were evaluated for the studied area’s soils. ILSEN computer model was used to determined potential land use groups and suitable classes for agricultural uses. In addition, ArcGIS software was used to generate their maps and database. Suitability map for agricultural uses results showed that, distributions of the best, relatively good, problematic and restricted agricultural lands were 31,68%, 22,63%, 22,16% and 23,53% respectively. Only 31,68% of the study area has the best land for agricultural uses.

They have been recognised as critically endangered in south-eastern Australia under Australian biodiversity conservation legislation. However, little has been recorded about their hydrology, functioning or biodiversity values; i.e. the factors that make them intrinsically ‘swampy’. In this paper, we developed a simple threshold model of wetland hydrology based on historical rainfall records and calculated evaporation records matched to records and recollections of the owners of swamps, and documented water-plant and microalgal species richness. The model indicated that swamps were inundated to at least 10-cm depth in an average of 6.3 years per decade for most of the 20th century. The average dry time between inundations was 1.27 years (maximum of 4.5 years). Since 1998, the frequency of inundation appears to have decreased, and the average dry times have increased. Despite, or because of, their temporary nature, these swamps have high biodiversity values among the vegetation and the microalgae, more than has been recorded for near-by permanent wetlands. There is no evidence that a drier and warmer climate will have a negative impact on biodiversity values; however, land management is likely to be important for maintaining these systems as the climate changes.";"Casanova, Michelle T.

"AGRIS:US201400149685";"evaluation of fractal characteristics of urban landscape in Indianapolis, USA, using multi-sensor satellite images";"";"There is an increasing interest in applying fractal analysis to measure the spatial complexity of remotely sensed images. This study provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of three fractal algorithms (isarithm, triangular prism, and variogram) for characterizing urban landscapes in Indianapolis, USA, based on eight satellite images taken by five sensors (Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and IKONOS). Fractal dimensions (FDs) were computed for both individual spectral bands and classified images to understand the fractal characteristics of land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns. Results indicated that FD values were sensitive to the computational algorithms used. It was found that the performance of different FD algorithms varied by application. The red and the near-infrared bands were the most spatially complicated bands among all spectral bands of the Landsat and ASTER images as well as the IKONOS images. The most fragmented LULC type was grassland. FD analysis of Landsat-derived LULC maps revealed that the urban landscape in Indianapolis had experienced great change between 1975 and 1991 as well as between 1991 and 2000. It is concluded that the fractals were useful in discriminating the image spatial complexity of various types and show potential in characterizing the temporal changes of urban landscape. However, fractal analysis alone may not be sufficiently effective to characterize urban landscape changes. Detailed quantitative change information is needed to assist in the interpretation of resultant FD values.";"Liang, Bingqing

Variations in the phenology of oviposition between the two mosquito seasons resulted from differences in the patterns and amounts of rainfall early in the season. Aerial images of each study neighborhood were digitized, and the proportions of specific types of land cover within buffer zones encompassing ovitraps were estimated. Retrospective analyses showed that in some neighborhoods, oviposition intensity was significantly associated with specific types of land cover. However, in general, it seemed that gravid Ae. albopictus searched throughout the landscape for water-filled containers in which to lay eggs. Peridomestic surveys were carried out concurrently with ovitrap collections to estimate production of Ae. albopictus pupae in discarded water-filled containers and the abundance of females in vegetation that made up the resting habitat. Results of linear regression analyses indicated that the mean standing crop of pupae (total and per container) per residence was not a significant predictor of mean egg densities in ovitraps. However, the mean standing crop of adult females was a significant but weak predictor variable, because the magnitude and sign of regression coefficients varied between neighborhoods. Linear spatial regression analyses revealed that oviposition intensity was not spatially dependent on pupal standing crop or the numbers of pupae-positive containers distributed peridomestically. However, a weak spatial dependence on the standing crop of adult females was found in some neighborhoods. Based on spherical variogram models, kriging was carried out to predict the spatial patterns of oviposition in suburban neighborhoods. Focal areas of high and low oviposition intensity were evident in most neighborhoods; however, the spatial patterns of oviposition changed between mosquito seasons. Kriging predictions were evaluated, using cross-validation, by systematically removing each data point from our data set and predicting the removed point by using the remaining points. The root mean square (standardized) error values of best fitting variogram models approximated 1, and plots of standardized PRESS residuals showed no distinct pattern for most neighborhoods, indicating that predictions of the spatial distribution of oviposition intensity were valid. Spherical variogram models are a satisfactory method for describing the spatial distribution of Ae. albopictus oviposition, and kriging can be a useful technique for predicting oviposition intensity at locations that have not been sampled.";"Richards, S.L.

However, a designated and in-depth study on its interaction with land use change and agricultural development is still very limited. The authors, therefore, attempted to address this issue by using five villages representing three agro-ecologies (highland, midland and lowland) for the period between 1965 and 2007. The study indicated that land policies of the imperial and communist regimes contributed largely to the increase of arable land while a decrease in vegetated land. This is, however, reversed in the EPRDF regime. Land productivity/crop harvest (t/ha) and herd size per household have declined. Agricultural policies played active roles in the change of water area and indirectly contributed to the change of construction land.";"Teka, Kassa

"AGRIS:US201301577156";"Impact of past and present land-management on the C-balance of a grassland in the Swiss Alps";"";"Grasslands cover about 40% of the ice-free global terrestrial surface, but their quantitative importance in global carbon exchange with the atmosphere is still highly uncertain, and thus their potential for carbon sequestration remains speculative. Here, we report on CO₂ exchange of an extensively used mountain hay meadow and pasture in the Swiss pre-Alps on high-organic soils (7-45% C by mass) over a 3-year period (18 May 2002-20 September 2005), including the European summer 2003 heat-wave period. During all 3 years, the ecosystem was a net source of CO₂ (116-256 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹). Harvests and grazing cows (mostly via C export in milk) further increased these C losses, which were estimated at 355 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹ during 2003 (95% confidence interval 257-454 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹). Although annual carbon losses varied considerably among years, the CO₂ budget during summer 2003 was not very different from the other two summers. However, and much more importantly, the winter that followed the warm summer of 2003 observed a significantly higher carbon loss when there was snow (133±6 g C m⁻²) than under comparable conditions during the other two winters (73±5 and 70±4 g C m⁻², respectively). The continued annual C losses can most likely be attributed to the long-term effects of drainage and peat exploitation that began 119 years ago, with the last significant drainage activities during the Second World War around 1940. The most realistic estimate based on depth profiles of ash content after combustion suggests that there is an 500-910 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹ loss associated with the decomposition of organic matter. Our results clearly suggest that putting efforts into preserving still existing carbon stocks may be more successful than attempts to increase sequestration rates in such high-organic mountain grassland soils.";"ROGIERS, NELE

"AGRIS:US201600091805";"Landscape and local effects on occupancy and densities of an endangered wood-warbler in an urbanizing landscape";"";"CONTEXT: Golden-cheeked warblers (Setophaga chrysoparia), an endangered wood-warbler, breed exclusively in woodlands co-dominated by Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) in central Texas. Their breeding range is becoming increasingly urbanized and habitat loss and fragmentation are a main threat to the species’ viability. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of remotely sensed local habitat and landscape attributes on point occupancy and density of warblers in an urban preserve and produced a spatially explicit density map for the preserve using model-supported relationships. METHODS: We conducted 1507 point-count surveys during spring 2011–2014 across Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP) to evaluate warbler habitat associations and predict density of males. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate multiple components of detection probability and evaluate covariate effects on detection probability, point occupancy, and density. RESULTS: Point occupancy was positively related to landscape forest cover and local canopy cover; mean occupancy was 0.83. Density was influenced more by local than landscape factors. Density increased with greater amounts of juniper and mixed forest and decreased with more open edge. There was a weak negative relationship between density and landscape urban land cover. CONCLUSIONS: Landscape composition and habitat structure were important determinants of warbler occupancy and density, and the large intact patches of juniper and mixed forest on BCP (>2100 ha) supported a high density of warblers. Increasing urbanization and fragmentation in the surrounding landscape will likely result in lower breeding density due to loss of juniper and mixed forest and increasing urban land cover and edge.";"Reidy, Jennifer L.

In addition, the use of remotely sensed imagery in Europe has been extended towards determination of the areas potentially eligible for the farmer subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), through interactive or automatic land cover identification. For accurate quantification and fast identification of agricultural land cover areas from the imagery, a hybrid method, which combines automated clustering of self-organizing maps with object based image analysis, and called SOM+OBIA, is proposed. Performance analysis on three test zones (using multi-temporal Rapideye imagery) indicates that for the basic land cover categories (forest, water, vegetated areas, bare areas and sealed surfaces), unsupervised classification with the proposed SOM+OBIA method achieves an identification accuracy comparable to the accuracy of the traditional interactive object oriented analysis, with considerably less user interaction.";"Taşdemir, Kadim

Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre‐existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species’ life‐forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre‐existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life‐forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate‐dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate‐dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre‐existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate‐dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species’ ecological niches in these forests.";"Basnou, Corina

This research investigated the effect of the amounts of irrigation in combination with tillage practices on soil evaporation (E), water consumption (ET) characteristics, and grain yield performance and water use efficiency (WUE) for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) in strip planting in an Oasis region. The field experiment, conducted at Wuwei station during 2008–2010, had two tillage systems (reduced tillage with wheat stubble retention vs. conventional tillage without stubble retention), and three (low, medium, and high) levels of irrigation, in a randomized complete block design. Averaged across three years, soil evaporation with medium and high levels of irrigation was 6.8% and 5.4% greater than that with low level of irrigation, respectively. Total water consumption of wheat/maize crops under the medium and high irrigation levels was 8.5% and 18.5% greater, respectively, than that under low irrigation. However, grain yields were similar under the medium and high levels of irrigation, so was WUE. The effect of tillage on the wheat/maize intercropping was inconsistent across years or among treatments: soil moisture at harvest was 3.0–7.6% greater in the fields with reduced tillage compared with those with conventional tillage in 2008 and 2009, but no difference was found in 2010; the E/ET ratio of reduced tillage was 9% lower than the ratio under conventional tillage in 2008, 3% higher in 2010, but no difference between the two tillage systems in 2009. Across three years, there was a general trend that the WUE of the wheat/maize intercropping system with reduced tillage was greater (by 4–11%) than that with conventional tillage. We conclude that a medium level of irrigation is sufficient to achieve crop yields and WUE equivalent to those under high level of irrigation, provided that a reduced tillage practice is applied to the wheat/maize intercropping in Oasis areas.";"Fan, Zhilong

"AGRIS:US201400169654";"Expansion to abandoned agricultural land forms an integral part of silver fir dynamics";"";"Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is a tree species distributed mainly in central Europe. It once was a dominant tree species within some forests of this region. The causes for its rapid decline in the past two centuries have not yet been sufficiently explained. It is argued that human activities have been largely responsible for expansions and contractions of silver fir populations. On the basis of the current distribution of silver fir, historical maps and palaeoecological data, we describe the expansion of silver fir forests. We use fine resolution at the landscape level, an approach that has so far been neglected. Our study area lies in the northern part of the White Carpathian Mountains, Czech Republic. The area comprises 7045ha, 65% of which is covered by forests. This landscape was shaped by early modern colonization from the 16th century onwards and has changed greatly since the decline of its traditional utilization in the 19th and 20th centuries. The area of forests almost doubled from 1838 to 2005 while the area of pastures and arable land decreased. We identified 172ha of silver fir forests by field mapping, which represent 2.5% of the whole study area and 3.8% of its forested part. We used land use history variables (based on subsequent land cover maps from 1838, 1882 and 1956) and terrain variables (derived from a digital elevation model) in a logistic regression to model the probability of silver fir forest occurrence. Land use history was highly significantly correlated with the occurrence of silver fir forests. Approximately 59% of silver fir forests occur on land used as pastures in 1838, 28% are on former arable land, meadows and fallows, while only 13% have been forested continuously since the 19th century. We know from historical sources that the surrounding forests (now mainly Norway spruce monocultures) were dominated by silver fir up to the 1860s. Silver fir can act as a pioneer species.

This study estimated the prevalence and risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis transmission in indigenous cattle at the human-animal interface in the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania. RESULTS: A total of 1,103 indigenous cattle from 32 herds were investigated for the presence of bTB using the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin Test. Epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing system were also collected. The apparent individual animal prevalence of tuberculin reactors was 2.4% (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7 – 3.5%), whereas the true prevalence was 0.6% CI, 0.6 – 0.7% as indicated by a reaction to avian tuberculin purified protein derivatives (PPD) which is more than 4� mm greater than the reaction to avian tuberculin PPD. The results showed that 10.6% (117/1,103) showed non-specific reactions (atypical mycobacterium). The herd prevalence of 50% (16/32) was found. Tuberculin skin test results were found to be significantly associated with age, location, size of the household and animal tested. Of 108 respondents, 70 (64.8%) individuals had not heard about bovine tuberculosis at all. Thirty five percent (38/108) of respondents at least were aware of bTB. About 60% (23/38) of respondents who were aware of bTB had some knowledge on how bTB is spread. Eighty one percent (87/108) of respondents were not aware of the presence of bTB in wildlife. There is regular contact between cattle and wild animals due to sharing of grazing land and water sources, with 99% (107/108) of households grazing cattle in communal pastures. CONCLUSION: The study has demonstrated a high reported interaction of livestock with wildlife and poor knowledge of most cattle owners concerning bTB and its transmission pathways among people, livestock and wildlife. Although the overall proportion of animals with bTB is relatively low, herd prevalence is 50% and prevalence within herds varied considerably. Thus there is a possibility of cross transmission of bTB at wildlife-livestock interface areas that necessitates use of genetic strain typing methods to characterize them accurately.";"Katale, Bugwesa Z

"AGRIS:US201300761979";"landscape connectivity index for assessing desertification: a case study of Minqin County, China";"";"As a global and regional environmental problem, desertification assessment is an instrumental component in developing global/regional actions plans aimed at preventing and/or eradicating desertification issues. Using a landscape assessment approach allows for relatively quick assessments of desertification that can then be used in developing practicable application plans at the regional level in desertification prevention planning and decision-making. This study was conducted to determine whether a cost-distance connectivity index could both reveal evidence of, and act as an indicator for, desertification. Cost-distance, a simple GIS-calculated connectivity measure, was applied to a 1997 land use map to indicate desertification in Minqin County, China. The results showed that connectivity based on cost-distance follows basic landscape ecological principles including species-area relations and edge effects, and indicates desertification. Although grain size had a significant effect on the cost-distance index, especially at patch boundaries, log cost-distance closely corresponded with degree of desertification within grain size. Changing the extent of analysis had no significant effect on the cost-distance index and its relevance to degree of desertification. The Minqin County landscape had a high level of connectivity, although the area's grasslands, oasis irrigated cultivated lands, alkali-saline lands and forestlands played important roles in resisting desertification. Three areas require restoration of native vegetation or afforestion to cut the connectivity of desertified patches. The application of connectivity based on cost-distance provides a straightforward, easily visualized description of desertification. In addition, land use data is readily available in China, allowing for relatively easy and quick assessments of regional level desertification for planning and decision-making.";"Sun, Danfeng

"AGRIS:DJ2012089441";"Cambodian peasant's contribution to rural development: a perspective from Kampong Thom Province";"";"The paper aims to identify the rationality of peasant communities and their contribution to rural development in Kampong Thom province. To do so, an interdisciplinary analytical framework addresses the dynamics of land use and land tenure, the strategies of labor force allocation as well as the determinants of land and labor agricultural productivities amongst peasant communities. It rests on details field surveys in two communes located in very distinct agro-ecological settings of Kampong Thom province. A land use change analysis based on time-series aerial photos is conducted with participatory inventories of natural resources. It shows that endogenous management of forest and fisheries resources generate significant incomes and, at the same time, contribute to maintaining biodiversity. The paper analyses how this contribution is challenged by the non-peasant actors involved in massive State land privatization. Aiming to full employment, peasant households enjoy a great flexibility in the way they allocate labor force, especially in line with the age of active labor and the fluctuation of labor opportunity costs. Principally due to an unequal land holding distribution, agricultural income is unfairly distributed but this inequality is actually balanced by the access to common-pool resources of crucial importance for the poorest and by the recourse to non farming activities, which is an important factor of socio-economic differentiation amongst households. The main economic indicators of rice production confirm that peasant households always try to maximize their income in step with the production factor they have in relatively less amount. A land market simulation stresses that, contrarily to theoretical assumptions, land access through sale (and purchase) does not result in a fairer land distribution. Nevertheless, land leases amongst peasant households seem more promising to ensure equitable access to land as they are embedded in collective security mechanisms activated by peasantry. The paper argues that peasant communities in the studied area constitute a solid basis for rural development as they offer a very good articulation between economic efficiency, social justice and environmental sustainability. Finally, recommendations are formulated to properly address peasant contribution to rural development in the new national agrarian policies.";"Diepart, JC.";"";"Les Presses agronomiques de Gembloux";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"";"rural development;land tenure";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KHM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012089441";"http://www.pressesagro.be/base/text/v14n2/321.pdf";"";"";"";"321-340"

We used temporal land-cover data for the Chesapeake Bay region and the state of New Jersey to compare patch-based and area-density scaling measures of fragmentation for detecting changes in the spatial scale of forest that may result from forest loss. For the patch-based analysis, we examined changes in the cumulative distribution of patch sizes. For area-density scaling, we used moving windows to examine changes in dominant forest. We defined dominant forest as a forest parcel (pixel) surrounded by a neighborhood in which forest occupied the majority of pixels. We used >50% and >=60% as thresholds to define majority. Moving window sizes ranged from 2.25 to 5,314.41 hectares (ha). Patch size cumulative distributions changed very little over time, providing no indication that forest loss was changing the spatial scale of forest. Area-density scaling showed that dominant forest was sensitive to forest loss, and the sensitivity increased nonlinearly as the spatial scale increased. The ratio of dominant forest loss to forest loss increased nonlinearly from 1.4 to 1.8 at the smallest spatial scale to 8.3 to 11.5 at the largest spatial scale. The nonlinear relationship between dominant forest loss and forest loss in these regions suggests that continued forest loss will cause abrupt transitions in the scale at which forest dominates the landscape. In comparison to the Chesapeake Bay region, dominant forest loss in New Jersey was less sensitive to forest loss, which may be attributable the protected status of the New Jersey Pine Barrens.";"Wickham, J.

This species is becoming widespread in shady, moist woodlands and lawns in the northern United States and southern Canada. Despite its invasive attributes, lesser celandine continues to be marketed by the nursery sector. A hardy and easy plant to grow, lesser celandine has a dense compact growth form that makes it ideal for border plantings and showy flowers that make it a desirable garden species for early spring color. The species easily escapes cultivation, colonizing primarily moist woodland habitats. Once established, lesser celandine creates a monoculture and is purported to displace native ephemeral species. Several factors make control of lesser celandine difficult, including a large root structure, which facilitates clonal reproduction and spread. The ephemerality of lesser celandine results in a relatively brief window in which to apply control measures. Land managers need to be aware of this common garden species as a potentially invasive weed and need to be able to differentiate it from the similar native marsh marigold. Effective management strategies are needed to protect native woodland understory species and biodiversity in natural and seminatural areas of affected regions.";"Axtell, Annie E.

Given the important role of land prices, the impact such increases would have on significant national development efforts, including the on-going land reform programme and other aspects of agricultural restructuring, provide strong justification for this investigation. The cointegration approach was employed within a framework that allowed for both long-run and short-run dynamics of the relationships to be identified. Building on previous structural modelling of farmland prices in the country, and using much expanded time series spanning forty-nine years, it was possible to establish some patterns of causation in the relationships between farmland prices and a range of macro-aggregates, including interest rate on debt, the rate of inflation, Gross Domestic Product, among others. Although the important role of foreign buyers is suggested by some of the results, there is need for further studies on this subject, using alternative data sets. The finding of a Granger causality relationship between farmland prices and GDP is interesting to the extent that it reflects buying power and confirms impressions about the crucial role of farmland prices in national economic management and the successful implementation of the on-going agrarian reforms in South Africa.";"Obi, Ajuruchukwu

We do so by asking respondents to estimate the value of two different forest property rights regimes where only the level of property security differs and all other forest plot characteristics are constant. We use this information to identify the value of the property rights security. Our results reveal that a significant number of individuals are willing to pay for an additional area of forestland but that the amount offered appears to be inadequate to compensate sellers, as very few land market transactions actually take place. The results further indicate that income relates positively to WTP, irrespective of forest property regime. Wealth, age, and ethnicity also have an impact on the amount households are willing to pay. As expected, there was a significant mark-up on the more secure right. Econometric estimates of the difference between the WTP for secure and insecure property rights show that a higher level of female education, and household age decrease the difference between the two WTP measures while the difference tends to increase as income improves. This has important policy implications, as it indicates that households tend to evaluate the property rights institutions differently.";"Linde-Rahr, Martin";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"forestry;property rights";"Forest Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301559602";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-008-9202-3";"";"";"";"465-478"

We use panel unit root and cointegration analysis to test if the present value model holds for a sample of 31 U.S. States covering the period 1960-2000. Preliminary results indicate that farmland prices and cash rents are non-stationary and non-cointegrated assuming a constant discount rate. The absence of cointegration may be due to the presence of a regime shift representing a time-varying discount rate. To accommodate this possibility, we introduce new panel cointegration tests that allow for unknown regime shifts in the cointegration relationship. The results suggest that the cointegration hypothesis cannot be rejected if there is a regime shift. Thus, while the present value model of farmland prices must be rejected when the discount rate is presumed constant, it cannot be rejected once we allow for regime shifts representing a time-varying discount rate.";"Gutierrez, Luciano

"AGRIS:US201500054905";"Tradeoffs in Performance of Native Warm-Season Grass Cultivars and Locally Harvested Seed Managed for Wildlife Habitat or Livestock Production";"";"Native warm-season grasses have potential to increase the ecosystem services associated with grazing lands and to provide a source of forage for livestock. In the upper Midwest, minimal region specific information is available to grass-based farmers on how to manage native pastures for long-term productivity and persistence. Wildlife biologists suggest delaying defoliations until mid-summer to preserve grassland bird habitat, yet production-based management recommendations warn against late season defoliations. Moreover, the source of seed to use for pasture establishment, cultivar or locally harvested seed (LHS), is unclear. We initiated an on-farm experiment to evaluate the effects of two rotational grazing schedules, June to July or July to September, for differences in vegetation cover, vigor, yield, and nutritive value of paddocks seeded with native warm-season grass cultivars or LHS. After 2 yr, native grass cover was similar across all treatments. Vigor, as measured by spring etiolated growth, was sustained under grazing and across seed sources for the dominant native grasses big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and Indiangrass [Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash]. Total yield was greatest when grazing was deferred until July, but this resulted in decreased nutritive value for both seed sources. These results indicate that native warm-season grasses have potential to persist under rotational grazing in upper Midwest pasture systems and that pasture performance is controlled by the timing of the first grazing cycle. The lack of a consistent seed source effect suggests that the LHS and cultivars used in the study are suitable for pasture use in the region.";"Chamberlain, S.K.

"AGRIS:US201500212472";"Evaluation of statistical gap fillings for continuous energy flux (evapotranspiration) measurements for two different land cover types";"";"Over the past few decades, energy and water fluxes have been directly measured by a global flux network, which was established by regional and continental network sites based on an eddy covariance (EC) method. Although, the EC method possesses many advantages, its typical data coverage could not exceed 65 % due to various environmental factors including micrometeorological conditions and systematic malfunctions. In this study, four different methodologies were used to fill the gap in latent heat flux (LE) data. These methods were Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO_PM) equation, mean diurnal variation (MDV), Kalman filter, and dynamic linear regression (DLR). We used these methods to evaluate two flux towers at different land cover types located at Seolmacheon (SMC) and Cheongmicheon (CMC) in Korea. The LE estimated by four different approaches was a fairly close match to the observed LE, with the root mean square error ranging from 4.81 to 61.88 W m⁻² at SMC and from 0.89 to 60.27 W m⁻² at CMC. At both sites, the LE estimated by DLR showed the best result with the value of the coefficient of correlation (R), equal to 0.99. Cost-effectiveness analysis for evaluating four different gap-filling methods also confirmed that DLR showed the best cost effectiveness ratio (C/R). The Kalman filter showed the second highest C/R rank except in the winter season at SMC followed by MDV and FAO_PM. Energy closures with estimated LE led to further improved compare to the energy closure of the observed LE. The results showed that the estimated LE at CMC was a better fit with the observed LE than the estimated LE at SMC due to the more complicated topography and land cover at the SMC site. This caused more complex interactions between the surface and the atmosphere. The estimated LE with all approaches used in this study showed improvement in energy closure at both sites. The results of this study suggest that each method can be used as a gap-filling model for LE. However, it is important to consider the strengths and weaknesses of each method, the purpose of research, characteristics of the study site, study period and data availability.";"Park, Jongmin

The research presented in this article is aimed at describing the influence of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium availability on crop yields across the major soil types of Hungary, under different climatic conditions. For this purpose, historical times series data from a 5-year period (1985–1989) regarding soil, land management, and crop yield of more than 80,000 fields, representing approximately 4 million ha of arable land, were statistically analyzed. The database was recently recovered from statistical archives stored in the format of digital records of the early 1980s and were used to study the productivity of major soil types for winter wheat cropping under balanced fertilizer input. Calculations were made to quantify the effects of soil nutrient levels. The evaluation was also performed for optimal and suboptimal climate conditions. Results show that the effect of nitrogen availability (as obtained from organic-matter content) had the largest influence on winter wheat yields. Up to a 26% difference in yields was observed, both on those soils with balanced material regimes and on those with leaching material regimes, under optimal climatic conditions. The effect of different levels of phosphorous was most significant under optimal climatic conditions on soils with balanced material regimes, reaching up to 17% difference between soils with very low and high phosphorous levels. The effect of different levels of potassium was the least significant in soils with balanced material regimes (maximum 8% difference among categories) and somewhat more pronounced in soils with leaching material regimes. Differences between the effects of nutrient levels due to climatic variation were also observed. According to our findings, stable production can be planned on croplands with average nutrient availability, regardless which of the two soil types they belong to. On the other hand, yield gap can be detected on fields with both low and high nutrient levels among optimal and suboptimal years, for all three nutrients [nitrogen–phosphorus–potassium (N–P–K)] of the analysis. Although our findings are based on historical data, most of the main relationships described are valid under current climatic and management conditions as well.";"Hermann, Tamás

Few people resettled in Mhlanganisweni, a part of the village more diverse in its social composition, returned to their former sites.

OWNERS, TENANTS, AND TAXES";"";"The American bias that privileges owners over tenants has its roots in early US history, in the colonial practices of limiting suffrage to property owners, and in the formation of a Constitution that protected the propertied minority from the propertyless majority. While the property test for suffrage eventually disappeared, the property bias persists, just as other barriers of gender, national origin, poverty, religion and race remain pervasive in our society. The impacts of this bias are felt not only by tenants but also by their landlords and is exercised through community organizations dominated by owners as well as common practices of zoning and tax policy. Three recent property tax bills of the New Jersey legislature illuminate the tenuous status of renters in tax policy. Even the most cursory review of recent survey data reveals the degree to which the stigma of rentership is inappropriate. This paper argues that America's renters are its owners too, and planners should foster policies that enforce greater equity among renters and owners.";"Krueckeberg, Donald A.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"1998-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016206684";"http://purl.umn.edu/12813";"";"";"";""

Assessment of biodiversity trends and progress toward targets requires effective and sound indicators. In our article, we review and compare the leading multispecies biodiversity indices used in global and regional assessments. We reviewed basic characteristics of these aggregated and composite biodiversity indicators and evaluated them with regard to their ecological performance, policy relevance and other accounting aspects. Indices analyzed include species and populations based indicators, such as Living Planet Index and Red List Index, as well as ecosystem based indicators like Natural Capital Index and Biodiversity Intactness Index. We also include measures of ecological integrity such as Marine Trophic Index and Index of Biotic Integrity. Indicators analyzed differ in both their ecological focus, baselines, basic units or policy use. Multispecies biodiversity indices illustrate prevailingly negative trends in the state of nature as a result of human induced pressures, especially land cover change. Biodiversity loss is therefore not decoupled from socioeconomic progress. We show that current indicators include a balanced mix of important biodiversity aspects and have some policy resonance. Leading biodiversity indices should be further promoted and integrated into monitoring, modelling and decision-making frameworks.";"Vačkář, David

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides.

"AGRIS:US201500162554";"Landscape predictors of wolf attacks on bear-hunting dogs in Wisconsin, USA";"";"Context In Europe and the United States, wolf–human conflict has increased as wolf populations have recovered and recolonised human-dominated ecosystems. These conflicts may lead to negative attitudes towards wolves and often complicate wolf management. Wolf attacks on bear-hunting hounds (hereafter, hounds) are the second-most common type of depredation on domestic animals in Wisconsin, USA, and, typically, the most costly in terms of compensation per individual animal. Understanding the geospatial patterns in which these depredations occur could promote alternative hunting practices or management strategies that could reduce the number of wolf–human conflicts. Aims We compared variables differentiating between wolf attacks on hounds and non-hounds (e.g., pets), we constructed a spatial, predictive model of wolf attacks on hounds, and we explored how the landscape of risk changed over time. Methods We characterised landscape features of hound depredations using logistic regression. We applied the spatial model to a geographic information system (GIS) to display spatial patterns and to predict areas of risk for wolf attack. Key results Our model correctly classified 84% of sites of past depredations, 1999–2008, and 78% of nearby random-unaffected sites. The model correctly predicted 82% of recent (2009–11) depredation sites not used in model construction, thereby validating its predictive power. Risk of wolf attack on hounds increased with percentage area of public-access land nearby, size of the nearest wolf pack, proximity of the nearest wolf pack, and decreased with percentage of human development. National and county forest lands had significantly (P<0.001) more hound depredations than did other land-ownership types, whereas private lands had significantly fewer. Conclusions Risk of wolf attacks on hounds had distinctive temporal and spatial signatures, with peak risk occurring during the black bear hound training and hunting seasons and in areas closer to the centre of wolf pack territories, with larger wolf packs and more public access land and less developed land. Implications Our analysis can help bear hunters avoid high-risk areas, and help wildlife managers protect wildlife and recreational use of public lands, and reduce public costs of predator recovery. We present a risk-adjusted compensation equation. If wildlife managers choose, or are required, to provide compensation for hounds attacked by wolves, while hunting on public lands, we suggest that managers consider adjusting compensation payments on the basis of the relative landscape of risk.";"Olson, Erik R.

"AGRIS:US201500199971";"Landscape futures analysis: Assessing the impacts of environmental targets under alternative spatial policy options and future scenarios";"";"Environmental targets are often used in planning for sustainable agricultural landscapes but their impacts are rarely known. In this paper we introduce landscape futures analysis as a method which combines linear programming optimisation with scenario analysis in quantifying the environmental, economic, and social impacts associated with achieving environmental targets, on a landscape scale. We applied the technique in the Lower Murray in southern Australia. Landscape futures models were used to identify specific geographic locations in the landscape for six natural resource management (NRM) actions such that regional environmental targets are achieved. The six potential NRM actions that may be undertaken to achieve environmental targets include remnant vegetation management, ecological restoration, conservation farming, deep-rooted perennials, and the production of biomass and biofuels feedstock for renewable energy generation. We developed landscape futures under four alternative spatial prioritisation policy options and four future climate and commodity price scenarios. The impacts of each landscape future were calculated across a range of environmental, economic, and social indicators. The external drivers, climate change and commodity prices, and internal decisions such as policy options for spatially prioritising NRM actions, both have a strong influence on the costs and benefits of achieving environmental targets. Illustrative results for the cleared agricultural areas in the Mallee region indicate that whilst achieving targets can have substantial environmental benefits, it requires large areas of land use and land management change, and is likely to be costly (up to $348.5 M per year) with flow-on impacts on the regional economy and communities. Environmental targets can be achieved more cost-effectively through spatial planning. Costs can be further reduced if markets are established for carbon, biomass, and biofuels to enable landholders to generate income from undertaking NRM. Landscape futures analysis is an effective tool for supporting the strategic regional NRM policy and planning decisions of how best to set and achieve environmental targets.";"Bryan, Brett A.

Negative effects can be mitigated by changes in land management such as land use changes and/or implementation of intervention measures such as – amongst others – the construction of artificial wetlands and water treatment plants. Usually budget constraints limit the number of measures that can be implemented by catchment management authorities which creates an optimisation problem, namely maximising the total water quality benefits subject to a budget constraint. Here we present a case study from the Ellen Brook catchment in Perth, Western Australia, which suffers from serious waterway health problems. We evaluate a variety of suggested intervention measures and determine the benefits they return. Cost utility analysis (CUA) and subsequent combinatorial optimisation are employed to determine a portfolio of intervention sites that returns the maximum aggregated benefit subject to a budget constraint. Shortcomings in this approach are identified when future uncertainties are to be accounted for and we perform a comparative study using modern portfolio theory (MPT). It is demonstrated how MPT and CUA can be jointly used to consistently account for triple bottom line aspects and aspects of future uncertainties such as uncertainties in future climate variability.";"Marinoni, O.

Such a nexus has received increasing attention among politicians and local stakeholders, as its complex outcomes depend on mutual interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors. This is particularly true in southern Europe, where important processes of land degradation (LD) have been observed in recent years. This paper analyses population growth (1871–2007) in southern Italy and questions its relationship with the level of land vulnerable to degradation. Results indicate that vulnerable lands were more likely associated with areas where population growth has determined environmental pressures on coastal areas and the neighbouring lowlands during 1950–1980. This pattern consolidated the socioeconomic polarisation between core and peripheral areas. Since the 1980s, however, southern Italy has experienced a phase of polycentric development, possibly determining a ‘decoupling’ between population density and land vulnerability to degradation. Population increased in moderately vulnerable areas but decreased in highly vulnerable areas. The policy implications of these results are discussed.";"Salvati, Luca";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"sustainable land management;land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"150;ITA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500003863";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2011.593007";"";"";"";"81-88"

Hence, it is critical to assess the attitudes and opinions of a major stakeholder group in order to establish partnerships between protected areas (PAs), adjacent communities and other management agencies. This study employed a qualitative inquiry to identify and assess factors that influence public sector stakeholder support for community-based ecotourism (CBE) development and for conservation of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP). In-depth semi-structured interviews were used to solicit data from 15 local and national representatives who have worked or resided in the Kgalagadi region for a period of at least 6 months. Findings revealed variations in opinion between local and national representatives in relation to collaboration and partnership initiatives, conservation projects, park management, tourism development and park benefits to local communities. There was overall uncertainty with respect to the designation of the KTP, since it had generated unfavourable conditions for adjacent local people, local authorities and village leaders. Nearly all local representatives indicated an imbalance with regard to resident collaboration and partnership in KTP conservation-related projects, and the general management activities. The contentions included concerns about land ownership and control, human–wildlife interactions, perceptions about communication with park authorities, lack of transparency with respect to activities and inequality of park benefits. Two major policy concerns were a low level of community participation in park activities and a lack of collaboration and communication between management and residents.";"Moswete, Naomi N.

Currently changes in LULC and variations in SOC often are studied and modeled separately. However, both are conjoined and should be seen as part of a cascading ecosystem framework. This is not only true for SOC but also for other biophysical parameters which are governed by human activities. At a watershed scale, this relationship is exceptionally important and the focus should be towards studying the impact of LULC change on the levels of SOC in spatially explicit terms. To advance knowledge on this front, we studied transformations of LULC, erosion and SOC from the start of settled agriculture in a moderate size basin of 9340 ha in Union and Pulaski Counties of Southern Illinois. The primary objective of this research was to study the evolution of SOC at the regional scale, as a result of historical land use change and erosion from 1851 to 2005. To model SOC, we used CENTURY 4.0 whereas LULC changes in the area were derived by visually classifying aerial photographs. Long-term erosion associated with different LULC was computed through Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). To simplify the task of carrying out numerous simulations (>5000), the study area was divided into cells of 100 m x 100 m. Since CENTURY is only vertically spatially explicit, each of these cells was designated as individual locations homogeneous with respect to different input and output parameters like SOC, erosion and LULC. Validation in the study was performed by aggregating and comparing CENTURY derived output with SOC estimates given in the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic Database for the year 2000. Our results show a correlation of 0.63 between the simulated and observed SOC estimates. In the study area, approximately 64% of SOC has been lost since the establishment of European-American settlements. Losses are considerable for the soil types which had higher initial levels of SOC. However, from the beginning of 1980, the simulations indicate rising carbon sequestration due to conservational management practices. This assessment is common across all LULC classes considered here. Though comparatively, rates of recovery of lost SOC are higher for areas which converted from agriculture to forest.";"Yadav, V.

In this paper we explore the potential of developing a typology of graziers to more effectively tailor policies and programs with the aim of improving land management outcomes. This is of particular importance since growing public concern about the environmental performance of the beef industry has led to increasing pressures on graziers to change their land management practices to decrease off-property impacts. To gain a better understanding of graziers’ land management practices and the factors that inform their decisions on how they manage their land we first developed a conceptual model of the relationship between grazier and grazing land where both can, ideally, thrive through conscious and timely land management decisions made and implemented by the grazier. A successful grazier land relationship is likely to be consistent with value systems and social and economic factors, although the particulars of any individual approach may vary spatially and temporally. These factors, in particular graziers’ values and motivations to follow a particular management strategy, guided the development of our typology of graziers. Australia's Bowen-Broken basin, which has been identified as a major contributor of sediment and nutrients that enter the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, served as a case study for this research. Three broad types of graziers emerged: (1) traditionalists, (2) diversifiers, and (3) innovators. The authors argue that by understanding graziers’ values and motivations underlying each of the grazier types, government agencies and NRM organisations can more effectively tailor their policy and extension programs towards specific types of graziers and can work with specific groups to achieve reductions in sediment and nutrient runoff from grazing properties.";"Bohnet, Iris C.

Feedback about the implementation of this new policy suggests that agriculture continues to drive deforestation. This article explores farmers' household livelihood strategies and land use changes in response to changing forest access rules arising from community-based land management. Based on studying in-depth surveys and participatory mapping in the eastern rain forest highlands, we outline patterns in farmers' responses, exploring the relationship between sociodemographic factors, livelihood strategies, and patterns of land use. Our findings suggest that heterogeneity in farmers' adaptation capacities is closely related to different land use patterns. Furthermore, both conservation and agricultural sustainability have suffered from unintended impacts: an increase of forest clearing, intensification in cultivated area, and an impoverishment of the poorest households. These detailed reviews of household adaptation processes suggest that the zoning-based management scheme would benefit from incorporating a more detailed farm level land use approach. Land use patterns have the potential to inform the design of improved conservation-development initiatives by revealing strategic indicators that could allow practitioners to target households for conservation measures according to their adaption capacities";"Toillier, Aurélie

We built a predictive model of spider species richness within a protected area assessing those environmental factors that have the strongest effect in the distribution of spider species richness. Our results show a strong relationship between spider species richness and landscape descriptors of land cover. We also assessed the importance of the spatial scale to identify patterns of spider diversity and we selected the optimal spatial scale for species richness and composition by a multiscale approach. We found that this relationship in spiders occurs at relatively fine scales, i.e., 220 x 220 m. The multiple linear regression model at the optimal scale explained 82% of the total variance in species richness. We used the Jackknife procedure to validate the model and we obtained a predictive map of spider richness by extrapolating the model to the entire range of the protected area. Our results show that predictive modelling is a useful tool to estimate the spatial patterns of diversity in a widespread group of arthropod generalist predators.";"De Mas, Eva

There is a need to analyze whether current forest carbon standards include adequate requirements to ensure IP's rights in REDD projects. This paper summaries the negative social impacts that REDD projects can cause in forest indigenous communities and establishes an evaluation framework of policies and measures needed to avoid or mitigate those impacts. This framework is used to assess how current carbon standards for REDD projects address social issues and whether they adequately protect IP's rights. The results of this assessment show that carbon standards, by and large, do not adequately include social standards to protect IP's rights. For example, while many standards call for clarification of tenure, few actually include recognition of traditional land and resources right. In addition, only half of the standards analyzed require monitoring of social impacts throughout the project's implementation, or require free prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples. Therefore, forest carbon standards for REDD projects should incorporate social principles in their methodologies or should be implemented jointly with social forest carbon standards.";"Fuente, T.

It widely affects everybody– environment and landscape is changed, new buildings are constructed, new villages are developed in countryside. If such recensions aren’t planned it can cause serious problems in nearest future, considering limitedness and great significance of the land as unique resource. For correction of errors in land use immeasurable resources and decennaries are necessary. Tendencies in land use development and related problems concern to all people of Latvia, especially landowners. Concept of land management means form of land use and protection for insurance of sustainable development of land use. Land reform in Latvia is going to be completed. It means in fact in cadastre information system and Landbook (legal register) already are registered all land parcels and all landowners and lawful possessors. The land use in Latvia affect such global tendencies as change of climatic conditions and necessity in alternative energy, therefore in frame of land management have to be improved system of territory development, purposefully used different financial instruments, improved knowledge of landowners in sustainable land use and protection. These circumstances persistently activate problems of system of improvement of territory planning development. Essential attention in the paper is given to the rights and responsibilities of local municipalities in land administration. In realization of land policy and land administration, local municipalities are responsible for planning of land use, facilitation of development of territory use, int.al., facilitation of land consolidation, determination of regulations in land use and erection of buildings, and land monitoring.

The NFPP reformed the state forest enterprises to reduce deforestation, increase the amount of forestland to be protected, and increase the sustainability of logging, while improving their financial viability. The SLCP reformed collective (i.e. private) forests in the villages, by compensating farmers for retiring marginal (mostly slope) land. Together, these two programmes are the largest reforestation programmes in the world, in term of people affected (over 125 million people), land reforested or protected (over 150 million ha), and budget (over 800 billion yuan between 1998 and 2020). We review these two programmes within the broad political and socio-economic conditions of the country during these years.";"Delang, C.O.

"AGRIS:US201600186742";"Biofuels on the landscape: Is âland sharingâ preferable to âland sparingâ?";"";"Widespread land use changes, and ensuing effects on ecosystem services, are expected from expanding bioenergy production. Although most U.S. production of ethanol is from corn, it is envisaged that future ethanol production will also draw from cellulosic sources such as perennial grasses. In selecting optimal bioenergy crops, there is debate as to whether it is preferable from an environmental standpoint to cultivate bioenergy crops with high ecosystem services (a âlandâsharingâ strategy) or to grow crops with lower ecosystem services but higher yield, thereby requiring less land to meet bioenergy demand (a âlandâsparingâ strategy). Here, we develop a simple model to address this question. Assuming that bioenergy crops are competing with uncultivated land, our model calculates land requirements to meet a given bioenergy demand intensity based upon the yields of bioenergy crops. The model combines fractional land cover of each ecosystem type with its associated ecosystem services to determine whether landâsharing or landâsparing strategies maximize ecosystem services at the landscape level. We apply this model to a case in which climate protection through GHG regulationâan ecosystem's greenhouse gas value (GHGV)âis the ecosystem service of interest. Our results show that the relative advantages of land sparing and land sharing depend upon the type of ecosystem displaced by the bioenergy crop; as the GHGV of the unfarmed land increases, the preferable strategy shifts from land sharing to land sparing. Although it may be preferable to replace ecologically degraded land with highâGHGV, lower yielding bioenergy crops, average landscape GHGV will most often be maximized through highâyielding bioenergy crops that leave more land for uncultivated, highâGHGV ecosystems. Although our case study focuses on GHGV, the same principles will be applicable to any ecosystem service whose value does not depend upon the spatial configuration of the landscape. Whenever bioenergy crops have substantially lower ecosystem services than the ecosystems with which they are competing for land, the most effective strategy for meeting bioenergy demand while maximizing ecosystem services on a landscape level is one of land sparing: focusing simultaneously on maximizing the yield of bioenergy crops while preserving or restoring natural ecosystems.";"Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J.

"AGRIS:US201500062345";"Use of Landsat thermal imagery in monitoring evapotranspiration and managing water resources";"";"Freshwater resources are becoming increasingly limited in many parts of the world, and decision makers are demanding new tools for monitoring water availability and rates of consumption. Remotely sensed thermal-infrared imagery collected by Landsat provides estimates of land-surface temperature that allow mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) at the spatial scales at which water is being used. This paper explores the utility of moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery in water resource management. General modeling techniques for using land-surface temperature in mapping the surface energy balance are described, including methods developed to safeguard ET estimates from expected errors in the remote sensing inputs. Examples are provided of how remotely sensed maps of ET derived from Landsat thermal imagery are being used operationally by water managers today: in monitoring water rights, negotiating interstate compacts, estimating water-use by invasive species, and in determining allocations for agriculture, urban use, and endangered species protection. Other applications include monitoring drought and food insecurity, and evaluation of large-scale land-surface and climate models. To better address user requirements for high-resolution, time-continuous ET data, novel techniques have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of Landsat thermal-band imagery and temporal resolution between Landsat overpasses by fusing information from other wavebands and satellites. Finally, a strategy for future modification to the Landsat program is suggested, improving our ability to track changes in water use due to changing climate and growing population. The long archive of global, moderate resolution TIR imagery collected by the Landsat series is unmatched by any other satellite program, and will continue to be an invaluable asset to better management of our earth's water resources.";"Anderson, Martha C.

"AGRIS:US201300785988";"relative importance of landscape properties for woodland birds in agricultural environments";"";"1. Studies of landscape change are seldom conducted at scales commensurate with the processes they purport to investigate. Landscape change is a landscape-level process, yet most studies focus on patches. Even when landscape context is considered, inference remains at the patch-level. The unit of investigation must be extended beyond individual patches to whole mosaics in order to advance understanding of faunal responses to landscape change. 2. In this study, we aggregated data from multiple sites per landscape such that both the response and explanatory variables characterized 'whole' landscapes, allowing for landscape-level inference about factors influencing species' incidence. 3. We used hierarchical partitioning and Bayesian variable selection methods to develop species-specific models that examined the influence of four categories of landscape properties - habitat extent, habitat configuration, landscape composition and geographical location - on the incidence of 58 species of woodland-dependent birds in 24 agricultural landscapes (each 100 km²) in south-eastern Australia. 4. There was strong evidence for a positive effect of habitat extent for 27 species. Thirty species were related to at least one of the four landscape composition variables, and geographical location was important for 19 species. Habitat configuration was influential for 13 species and where important, the impacts of fragmentation per se were detrimental. 5. Variation among species in the influential landscape variables indicates that different species respond to different sets of cues in land mosaics. Thus, although all species were grouped a priori as 'woodland-dependent', expectations based on general ecological characteristics may prove unreliable. 6. Synthesis and applications. These results underscore the value of moving beyond the fragmentation paradigm focused on the spatial pattern of habitat vs. non-habitat, to a greater appreciation of the composition and heterogeneity of land mosaics. Landscape-level inference will enable improved conservation outcomes by recognizing the influence of landscape properties on biota and devising strategies at this scale to complement patch-based management. We provide strong empirical evidence that biodiversity management in agricultural landscapes must focus on habitat extent. Complementary management of other landscape attributes, such as habitat aggregation and intensity of agricultural land-use, will also enhance the value of agricultural landscapes for woodland birds.";"RADFORD, JAMES Q.

"AGRIS:US201400167431";"Impacts of land use and plant characteristics on dried soil layers in different climatic regions on the Loess Plateau of China";"";"A dried soil layer (DSL) formed in the soil profile is a typical indication of soil drought caused by climate change and/or poor land management. The responses of a soil to drought conditions in water-limited systems and the impacts of plant characteristics on these processes are seldom known due to the lack of comparative data on soil water content (SWC) in the soil profile. The occurrence of DSLs can interfere in the water cycle in soil–plant–atmosphere systems by preventing water interchanges between upper soil layers and groundwater. Consequently, a DSL may limit the sustainability of environmental restoration projects (e.g., revegetation, soil and water conservation, etc.) on the Loess Plateau of China and in other similar arid and semiarid regions. In this study, we investigated and compared the impacts of soil type, land use and plant characteristics within each of the three climatic regions (arid, semiarid, semihumid) of the Loess Plateau. A total of 17,906 soil samples from 382 soil profiles were collected to characterize DSLs across the Plateau. Spatial patterns of DSLs (represented by four indices: (1) DSL thickness, DSLT; (2) DSL forming depth, DSLFD; (3) mean SWC within the DSL, DSL-SWC; and (4) stable field water capacity, SFC) differed significantly among the climatic regions, emphasizing the importance of considering climatic conditions when assessing DSL variations. The impact of land use on DSLs varied among the three climatic regions. In the arid region, land use had no significant effect on DSLs but there were significant effects in the semiarid and semihumid regions (P<0.05). The development of DSLs under trees and grasses was more severe in the semiarid region than in the semihumid region. In each climatic region, the extent of DSLs depended on the plant species (e.g., native or exotic, tree or grass) and growth ages; while only in the semiarid region, the DSL-SWC and SFC (P<0.001) were significantly influenced by soil type. The DSL distribution pattern was related to the climatic region and the soil texture, which both followed gradients along the southeast–northwest axis of the Plateau. Optimizing land use can mediate DSL formation and development in the semiarid and semihumid regions of the Loess Plateau and in similar regions elsewhere. Understanding the dominant factors affecting DSLs at the regional scale enables scientifically based policies to be made that would alleviate the process of soil desiccation and sustain development of the economy and restoration of the natural environment. Moreover, these results can also be useful to the modeling of the regional water cycle and related eco-hydrological processes.";"Wang, Yunqiang

Previous research largely generated mixed and incomplete findings on the effects of rural out-migration on agricultural change. Meta-analysis is considered as an important research strategy for comparing and integrating results from individual studies. Using a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) approach, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent case studies of labor out-migration and agricultural change in rural China. The analysis revealed general contextual patterns of migration impacts on agriculture. Migration-induced agricultural change was mainly conditional upon the specific conjunctural configuration of a rural communityâs economic development level or geographical locality, its land resources and dependence on agriculture, and whether the period under investigation was post-agricultural tax abolition. Overall, this meta-study provides the big picture of the complex migrationâagriculture relationships in rural China, which is often missed in smaller-scale case studies. Such synthetic findings are particularly useful for informing evidence-based rural development planning and policy making.";"Qin, Hua

Blume is a neotropical multipurpose tree species, which could be used in forest restoration and agroforestry. Several cultures, however, require liming to satisfactory yields in acid soils. Therefore, it is important to determine the effect of liming to this native species, in order to include it in agroforestry associations. The aim of this work was to evaluate the morphological changes of T. micrantha, including the calcium oxalate (druses) and cystolith density, as caused by the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) addition. The assay included three treatments: control, pH 5.3; treatment 1, pH 5.5; treatment 2, pH 6.0. The liming reduced the root biomass and increased the shoot biomass. The leaf specific mass and nutrients concentration were not changed. The leaves presented higher density of druses in treatment 2. The cystolith density was not modified, but the cystolith size was increased by the liming. The results indicate liming tolerance in this species.";"Adamski, J.M.

Although long-term solutions to the crisis require a regional political solution, there are several local activities that can reduce the degradation of water supplies and larger eco-systems. These include desalination of seawater and brackish water, water import and domestic water filtration units. The big problem is to allow the groundwater aquifer to recharge over time.

Such impacts have the potential to result in loss of N to surface waters and acidification, both of which could have serious consequences for water quality and downstream habitats. We present results from a 6-year study of Calluna-dominated alpine heathland in Scotland, designed to assess the interactive effects of N addition (0 and 50 kg N ha⁻¹ y⁻l), simulated accidental fire and grazing on soil solution chemistry. Both N addition and to a lesser extent burning had significant effects on soil solution chemistry, whereas grazing had no significant impact. Soil solution nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) and ammonium (NH₄ ⁺) concentration showed a rapid response to N addition and N addition also resulted in acidification of soil solution. A ‘flush' of base cations, which normally buffer soil from the acid effects of deposited N, accompanied the excess N released from the soil to soil solution. The N treatment had no effect on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), however, concentrations were significantly (14%) lower at the burned plots. In addition to treatment effects, temporal analysis of data from control plots demonstrated that soil solution chemistry was influenced by extremes in weather conditions. Peak NO₃ ⁻ concentrations were observed in soil solution following the cold winter of 2000-2001 when there were frequent freeze/thaw events. A large pulse of base cations was lost from the soil following the dry year of 2003. These weather-induced responses potentially exacerbate the treatment effects observed in this study.";"Helliwell, R. C.

"AGRIS:US201301873533";"Large-Scale Patterns of Quercus ilex, Quercus suber, and Quercus pyrenaica Regeneration in Central-Western Spain";"";"In Central-Western Spain, forests and woodlands composed of Quercus sp. support outstanding levels of biodiversity, but there is increasing concern about their long-term persistence due to a lack of regeneration. We hypothesize that this regenerative lack is operating on a large geographic scale; that there are differences in the abundance of regeneration between three oak species; that oak regeneration is governed mainly by forest management and structure; and that shrubs act as important physical protectors of seedlings and saplings. We analyzed whether densities of oak seedlings and saplings in several size classes were related to stand-structure, understory, and physiographic variables potentially affecting regeneration. Data collected at a regional level (1 km × 1 km grid) by the Spanish Forest Inventory were evaluated from 2,816 plots. Results revealed that regeneration failure was common for all size categories, from small seedlings to large saplings, and for the three oak species studied, especially the evergreens. Of the Quercus ilex, Q. suber, and Q. pyrenaica plots studied, 49%, 62%, and 20% were lacking any small seedlings, and 82%, 96%, and 56% did not have any large saplings, respectively. Regeneration was positively correlated with tree cover and density, especially of small and medium-sized trees, and negatively correlated with the presence of large trees, indicating that regeneration failure is mostly associated with more open, uniform, and/or aged woodlands. Regeneration densities of Q. ilex and Q. suber were positively correlated with all understory variables, suggesting that the presence of pioneer shrubs represent a major safe site for early tree recruitment, independent from specific shrub species.";"Plieninger, Tobias

"AGRIS:US201600200635";"Reforestation and slope-position effects on nitrogen, phosphorus pools, and carbon stability of various soil aggregates in a red soil hilly land of subtropical China";"";"The impact of slope position on forest restoration processes may dominate the interaction among topsoil aggregates, nutrients, and organic carbon (C) stability following reforestation on degraded hilly land. Six paired plots of shrubland and Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) plantation reforested on shrubland were selected at different positions along a 25Â° slope in subtropical China. Soil and ecosystem nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and organic C stocks were quantified using a combination of excavation, harvest, and modeling methods. Carbon stability in differently sized soil aggregates was measured using dry sieving and closed-jar alkali-absorption methods. Reforestation increased total ecosystem C, N, and P stocks, but did not alter soil C and P stocks, and decreased N stocks at 0â75 cm soil depth by 18%. The shift from shrubland to forests increased organic C stability for various soil aggregates, particularly with a mean increase of 34% and 30% at lower and middle slope positions, respectively. The slope-position effect was largely attributable to the increased mean mass diameter of soil aggregates and the reduced organic C mineralization potential in larger soil aggregates relative to smaller soil aggregates. Soil aggregates had more stable organic C in forests than in shrubland due to increase in the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) and carbon to phosphorus (C/P) ratios with reforestation. Slope position influenced restoration effectiveness in the red soil hilly region.";"Zou, Li-Qun

Anhand vonModellrechnungen für das Prognosejahr 2015 wurde das Bioenergiepotenzial exemplarischfür zwei Untersuchungsregionen, eine Ackerbau- und eine intensive Futterbauregion, sowiefür Baden-Württemberg insgesamt, abgeschätzt. Es zeigt sich, dass insbesondere die mehrjährigenKulturen wie Miscanthus und Kurzumtriebsplantagen einen großen Anteil an einerlandwirtschaftlichen Energieproduktion ausmachen würden.

Considering four land management technologies (fallowing, terracing andinorganic and organic fertilizers), the study estimates a multinomial logit model tolink farmers’ characteristics to the choice of technologies. The findings show thatinvestments in land management are driven by factors such as land tenure security,level of poverty and participation in community organizations (social capital), and,most importantly, that household level poverty reduces the probability of adoption ofmost of the technologies, while social capital and land tenure security increase it. Thefindings suggest that more efficient government efforts to reduce poverty wouldenhance the adoption of SFM technologies. Other policies that would enhance theadoption of sustainable land management practices are infrastructure development,tenure security through a more efficient system of land registration, and investment inand use of social capital institutions.";"Birungi, Patrick

"AGRIS:US201600079918";"In-between sprawl and fires: long-term forest expansion and settlement dynamics at the wildland–urban interface in Rome, Italy";"";"Understanding the intimate dynamics of urban–wildland interfaces in Mediterranean landscapes is particularly challenging because of multiple biophysical factors (dry or arid climate, low-quality soils, poor vegetation cover) determining an increased environmental sensitivity to human pressure. Although dense and compact cities were sprawling rapidly in the most recent decades, many suburban areas in southern Europe still preserve biodiversity-rich habitats, traditional crop mosaics and high-quality relict forest stands. Diachronic forest and settlement maps were analysed over two time intervals (1936–1974 and 1974–2006) representing different socio-economic contexts on a local scale with the aim to assess trends in forest land cover vis à vis urban growth in Rome, central Italy. Forests expanded into agricultural land during the whole time period following cropland abandonment and benefiting from a higher level of land protection from urbanisation, especially during the most recent decades. Although the broadleaved wood dominated the composition of forest fragments at the wildland–urban interface at both the beginning and the end of the study period, coniferous stands showed a slower decrease compared to other wood types, such as those dominated by chestnut or beech. The observed changes in forest composition are the result of a higher disturbance level, possibly triggered by the increase of fire frequency and severity, a higher fragmentation of natural land, intense soil sealing and a larger occurrence of invasive species. Forest diversity increased especially in areas with medium-density settlements, indicating a tendency towards more heterogeneous forest structures at the urban–wildland interface compared to natural landscapes. A long-term monitoring of settlement dynamics and woodland expansion is required to inform a sustainable management of Mediterranean suburban forests.";"Biasi, Rita

"AGRIS:US201301557997";"Land desertification monitoring and assessment in Yulin of Northwest China using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS)";"";"The objective of this study is to develop techniques for assessing and analysing land desertification in Yulin of Northwest China, as a typical monitoring region through the use of remotely sensed data and geographic information systems (GIS). The methodology included the use of Landsat TM data from 1987, 1996 and 2006, supplemented by aerial photos in 1960, topographic maps, field work and use of other existing data. From this, land cover, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), farmland, woodland and grassland maps at 1:100,000 were prepared for land desertification monitoring in the area. In the study, all data was entered into a GIS using ILWIS software to perform land desertification monitoring. The results indicate that land desertification in the area has been developing rapidly during the past 40 years. Although land desertification has to some extent been controlled in the area by planting grasses and trees, the issue of land desertification is still serious. The study also demonstrates an example of why the integration of remote sensing with GIS is critical for the monitoring of environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions, e.g. in land desertification monitoring in the Yulin pilot area. However, land desertification monitoring using remote sensing and GIS still needs to be continued and also refined for the purpose of long-term monitoring and the management of fragile ecosystems in the area.";"Zhang, Yuanzhi

"AGRIS:US201301681173";"Soil CO₂ emissions in agricultural watersheds with agroforestry and grass contour buffer strips";"";"The potential for agricultural soils to act as a sink and sequester carbon (C) or a source and emit carbon dioxide (CO₂) is largely dependent upon the agricultural management system. The establishment of permanent vegetation, such as trees and grass contour buffer strips, may cause accumulation of above- and below-ground C over time, thereby acting as a sink for tropospheric CO₂. However, the effects of contour grass strips and grass-tree strips (agroforestry) on soil CO₂ emissions have not been extensively studied in row-crop watersheds in the temperate regions. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of agroforestry and grass contour buffer strips and landscape position on soil surface efflux rate of CO₂ in three adjacent agricultural watersheds with claypan soils in northeast Missouri. The three watersheds were in a corn-soybean rotation, and contained (1) cropped only (CR), (2) cropped with grass contour strips (GR), or (3) cropped with tree-grass contour strips (AF) management systems. Soil surface CO₂ efflux was measured throughout the 2004 growing season at the upper (UBS), middle (MBS), and lower (LBS) backslope landscape positions within the three watersheds. The cumulative soil CO₂ production was lowest in the CR (0.9 kg CO₂-C m⁻²) compared to the AF (1.5 kg CO₂-C m⁻²) and GR watersheds (1.5 kg CO₂-C m⁻²). The lower backslope position (1.6 kg CO₂-C m⁻²) across all three watersheds produced 32 and 40% greater cumulative soil CO₂ than the upper and middle backslope positions, respectively. A 72-day incubation study determined the effects of 40, 60, 80, and 100% soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and N rate (0 and 1.39 g KNO₃ kg soil⁻¹) on soil CO₂ efflux from bulk soil collected under each management system. The cumulative CO₂ production was highest in the grass soil (1,279 mg CO₂-C kg soil⁻¹) compared to the agroforestry (661 mg CO₂-C kg soil⁻¹) and cropped (483 mg CO₂-C kg soil⁻¹) soils regardless of WFPS and N rate. The highest cumulative CO₂ production for the grass soil (1,279 mg CO₂-C kg soil⁻¹) occurred at 80% WFPS, and was approximately 2 to 2.6 times greater than the agroforestry and cropped soils at 80% WFPS. The results of this study indicate that conservation management practices, such as grass and grass-tree contour buffer strips, and landscape position affect soil surface CO₂ production and accumulation of soil organic C that may influence soil C sequestration.";"Bailey, Neal J.

"AGRIS:US201400155726";"Waterproofing Topsoil Stockpiles Minimizes Viability Decline in the Soil Seed Bank in an Arid Environment";"";"Topsoil is a valuable resource for revegetation of mine sites as it contains seeds of plant species indigenous to the local environment. As mine site restoration is undertaken after the completion of mining, it is a common practice to stockpile topsoil in preparation for restoration activities. While many studies have found a decrease in seedling emergence with increasing stockpile age in temperate regions around the world, a few examine the effect of stockpile age on topsoil seed bank and seedling recruitment in arid environments. Seed longevity is promoted under dry conditions whereas viability loss is increased under warm and moist conditions. Here in a study in Australia's Great Sandy Desert, the effect of topsoil storage age and method of storing topsoil (under‐cover and exposed) on seedling recruitment was examined for a major gold mining site. There was a trend for lower seedling emergence (68% lower) and species richness (30% lower) from topsoil stored for 2 years than from topsoil direct returned and topsoil stored for 1 year. Seedling emergence from topsoil stockpiled for 2 years was more than 3.5‐fold higher from covered topsoil stockpiles than uncovered topsoil stockpiles. For two ecologically dominant species, after 2 years of storage, seedling emergence of the grass Triodia basedowii was 13% of direct returned topsoil and seedling emergence of the shrub Acacia stellaticeps was 68% of direct returned topsoil. The implication of the decline in seedling emergence from topsoil stockpiling on mine site revegetation in a biodiverse arid region is discussed.";"Golos, Peter J.

"AGRIS:US201301686788";"Efficacy of Integrating Herder Knowledge and Ecological Methods for Monitoring Rangeland Degradation in Northern Kenya";"";"The world-wide debate on land degradation in arid lands, usually linked to local land use practices, does not reflect methodological advancements in terms of assessments and monitoring that integrate local communities' knowledge with ecological methods. In this paper, we evaluated the efficacy of three different methods related to herder assessments and monitoring of land degradation; herder knowledge and ecological methods of assessing impacts of livestock grazing along gradients of land use from settlement and joint monitoring of selected marked transects to understand long-term vegetation changes in southwestern Marsabit northern Kenya. The performance of each method was carefully evaluated and interpreted in terms of the indicators used by herders and ecologists. Herder interpretations were then related to ecologists' empirical analysis of land degradation. The Rendille nomads have a complex understanding of land degradation which combines environmental and livestock productivity indicators, compared to conventional scientific approaches that use plant-based indicators alone. According to the herders, the grazing preference of various livestock species (e.g., grazers versus browsers) influences perceptions of land degradation, suggesting degradation is a relative term. The herders distinguished short-term changes in vegetation cover from long-term changes associated with over-exploitation. They attributed current environmental degradation around pastoral camps, which shift land use between the alternating wet and dry seasons, to year-round grazing. We deduced from long-term observation that herders interpret vegetation changes in terms of rainfall variability, utilitarian values and intensification of land use. Long-term empirical data (23 years) from repeated sampling corroborated herder interpretations. Land degradation was mostly expressed in terms of declines in woody plant species, while spatial and temporal dynamics of herbaceous species reflected the effects of seasonality. The efficacy of the three methods were inferred using explanatory strengths of ecological theory; insightfulness of the methods for describing land degradation and the likelihood of using the methods for promoting local community participation in the implementation of the UN Convention on Combating Desertification (CCD) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).";"Roba, Hassan G.

The Lerma–Chapala–Santiago (LCS) is biophysically diverse and heavily modified by urbanization and agricultural expansion. Land cover maps classified with a Mahalanobis distance algorithm and possibilistic metrics of class membership were used to quantify uncertainty (potential error in class assignment) and change confusion (potential error in land change identification). While land change analysis suggests that ~33% of the landscape underwent a change in class, led by changes from or to the mosaic class (~19% of landscape), classification uncertainty values for 2001 and 2007 were 0.59 and 0.62, respectively, with highest uncertainty among bare soil classes, and an average confusion index value of 0.65, with pixels experiencing change at 0.67 and pixels experiencing persistence at 0.61 on average. These results indicate that uncertainty and potential error in land cover classifications estimates may inhibit accurate assessments of land change. Estimates of land change may be refined using these metrics to more confidently identify true landscape change and to find classes and locations that are contributing to errors in land change assessments.";"Christman, Zachary

"AGRIS:US201500211435";"Mapping urban sprawl and impervious surfaces in the northeast United States for the past four decades";"";"Mapping urban expansion and impervious surfaces (IS) has become a useful tool for supporting watershed assessments. The lack of large-area time-series maps created the need to develop an approach and products that can easily be scaled. In this research application, 81 Landsat 1, 2, and 5 scenes for the epochs of 1975, 1985, and 1996 were used to map urban land use/land cover across New England, USA. A Classification And Regression Tree (CART) using random forest classified the landscape into a scheme matching the 2011 National Land Cover Database scheme, which was then aggregated to urban versus nonurban land cover. Regression models between Tasseled Cap brightness and greenness indices and IS values were developed. The CART and IS models were applied to modern imagery and backcast to selected archived imagery to generate maps of urban and IS across New England for the past four decades. The aggregated urban versus nonurban maps had an overall accuracy of 95% and the IS model had an R ² of 0.89. Multiscale spatiotemporal analyses show the highest urban expansion in watersheds along the coasts in southeastern New England and along highway corridors. Imperviousness intensity increase of urban existing in 1975 was highest for the coastal northeast between 1975 and 2011. The products will be used to support lake risk management and help identify potential stressors to lake health in the northeast.";"Torbick, Nathan

The identification and mapping of landscape elements that may enhance functional connectivity is usually a subjective process based on visual interpretations of species movement patterns. New methods based on mathematical morphology provide a generic, flexible, and automated approach for the definition of indicators based on the classification and mapping of spatial patterns of connectivity from observed or simulated movement and dispersal events. The approach is illustrated with data derived from simulated movement on a map produced from satellite imagery of a structurally complex, multi-habitat landscape. The analysis reveals critical areas that facilitate the movement of dispersers among habitat patches.

"AGRIS:US201500002809";"Sustainable Soil Management Practices in Small Farms of Southern Nigeria: A Poultry-Food Crop Integrated Farming Approach";"";"A major reason given for the decline in per capita food production in Nigeria over the last two to three decades is the gradual decline in land productivity. Available information shows that in southern Nigeria, for example, there was recorded a consistent decline in yield per hectare of major food crops between 1995 and 2000. Evidence from the literature suggests that the main reason for this persistent decline in soil productivity is the perpetuation of unsustainable soil management practices by small food crop farmers that dominate the food production landscape in the country. This study therefore sets out to find out whether the adoption of a poultry based integrated food crop production system is economically viable in southern Nigeria. This is predicated by the fact that the environment in the southern part of Nigeria is well adapted for poultry production. Primary data was collected in Edo state, southern Nigeria, through a sample survey using a well structured questionnaire. A total of 94 poultry-based integrating farmers was selected using a combination of stratified and systematic random sampling procedure. A Linear Programming (LP) model was used to analyze and determine the optimal enterprise combination that maximizes the dual objectives subject to the production constraints of the small farms. The result shows that the dual objectives of maximizing Total Gross Margin (TGM) and simultaneously ensuring sustainable soil management practices was possible under full integration of poultry-food crop production. The results of the study suggest that a poultry-based integrated food crop production system, if given more attention by farmers and backed up by policy, may be an acceptable and feasible way of stemming the declining trend in soil productivity in southern Nigeria.";"Agbonlahor, M.U.

"AGRIS:US201600006452";"Alternative Rangeland Management Strategy in an Agro-Pastoral Area in Western China☆";"";"Governance plays a key role in rangeland management. In China, all rangeland, including pastoral land and agro-pastoral land, is owned by the State. Since 1980, use rights have been granted to households by the Chinese government extending the household contract responsibility system (HCRS). But in the agro-pastoral areas of northwestern (NW) China, the rangeland degradation is more severe than that in pastoral areas. The HCRS is difficult to implement because the limited and fragmented grazing land cannot be contracted to individual households. Thus the pastures in the agro-pastoral areas are grazed as communal pastoral land and the rate of rangeland degradation has accelerated as livestock numbers have grown. Several measures have been introduced in an attempt to reverse this degradation trend, but most failed. This paper reports a 5-year comparison of three rangeland management regimens, including the national “Protecting rangeland by restricting grazing” (PRRG) project under the individual HCRS (PRRG under IHCRS), the Allied Householders Contract Responsibility System (AHCRS) program funded by the World Bank/GEF, and the free grazing on common pasture as the control area (CA) at Mayinggou Village, Yongchang County, Gansu Province in NW China. The results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between AHCRS and the other two regimens (PRRG under IHCRS and CA) in terms of biomass of palatable forages, cover, and plant diversity index of vegetation but no significant difference (P > 0.05) between PRRG under IHCRS and CA. Reducing the number of livestock in AHCRS also resulted in increased revenue from the livestock turn-off rate compared with that in PRRG under IHCRS and CA. Therefore, AHCRS is a better alternative management regimen for rangelands in agro-pastoral areas. AHCRS can solve the overgrazing problem, maintain or improve household income, and potentially ensure a long-term sustainable rangeland management regimen in agro-pastoral areas in NW China.";"Hua, Limin

"AGRIS:US201600181136";"effect of artificial lighting on the arrival time of birds using garden feeding stations in winter: A missed opportunity?";"";"The proliferation of artificial lighting at night is one of the key anthropogenic changes associated with urbanised areas as well as some non-urban areas. Disruption to natural light/dark regimes can have considerable effects on the timing of different behaviours of birds, particularly during the breeding season. However, the effect of artificial lights on the timing of behaviours during winter has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that time partitioning of foraging can have implications for avian winter survival. In this study, we assess at a landscape scale during winter, whether birds arrive at feeding stations earlier in areas with increased levels of artificial lighting using data from a citizen science project. Arrival times of the ten most commonly recorded species were associated with a combination of the density of artificial lights, temperature, rainfall and urban land cover. We found no evidence that birds advance the onset of foraging in gardens with more artificial lights nearby; contrary to our prediction, birds generally arrived later into these areas. This is possibly a response to differences in food availability or predation risk in areas with more artificial lights. We conclude that artificial light at night may not be as important for driving the timing of foraging behaviour in winter as previously thought, but it remains to be seen whether this represents a missed opportunity to extend the foraging period or an adaptive response.";"Clewley, Gary D.

"AGRIS:US201600190291";"Edge expansion of Araucaria forest over southern Brazilian grasslands relies on nurse plant effect";"";"The vegetation in the southern Brazilian highlands is characterized by Araucaria forest and Campos grassland. Evidences indicate that Araucaria forest is currently expanding over grassland and that this expansion may occur by nucleation or edge dynamics. Nucleation mechanisms of Araucaria forest expansion are well documented, whereas mechanisms of expansion starting from the forest edge are not. In this study, we aimed (1) to assess how prominent is Araucaria forest expansion over Campos grassland starting from the forest edge, and (2) to discuss about the possible mechanisms underlying sapling community colonization in grassland. We conducted our sampling in 11 transects disposed from the forest edge towards the grassland. The transects were distributed in four study sites. Each transect was 50 m long and was divided into 25 plots with area of 8 m2. All forest woody sapling individuals were identified and registered. We considered distance from forest edge, presence of dead shrubs, Baccharis uncinella cover, nurse tree cover and rock cover as predictors of forest plant abundance and composition. Niche and distance contribution on the explanation of sapling composition and abundance were partitioned using, respectively, canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regressions. Cover of nurse trees explained almost 31% of total variation in sapling abundance, followed by the distance from the forest edge that explained 6.9%. Site explained 7.6% of total variation in sapling species composition, followed by distance from the forest edge, which explained 2.3%, whereas niche had a minor (2.1%) and non-significant proportion of variation explanation. Our findings show that Araucaria forest expansion over native grasslands in southern Brazil relies deeply on the nurse plant effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that Araucaria forest forms nuclei scattered in the grassland where nurse plants or nurse rocks are established. Here, we bring evidences that nurse plants are important also to the tree encroachment starting closer to the forest edge. This study provides new information on the mechanisms involved in the forest expansion over native grasslands.";"Carlucci, M. B.

What constrains forest regeneration is poorly understood, and restoration attempts have been largely unsuccessful. We assessed the contribution of four different mechanisms of tree recruitment limitation (that is, source, dispersal, germination, and establishment) in a cork oak (Quercus suber) system in southern Portugal. Using a combination of field studies and experiments, we quantified seed production, seed removal and dispersal, seed survival and germination, seedling establishment and survival, as well as cork oak natural regeneration for the three dominant vegetation types in this system (Cistus ladanifer shrubland, oak forest, and oak savanna). We found that all four forms of cork oak recruitment limitation were significantly more severe in shrublands than in oak forests and savannas, so that oak seedling recruitment in shrubland was impeded in multiple ways. Our results explain why transitions from shrublands to oak savannas and forests are extremely difficult, and that the release from arrested succession in this system requires the simultaneous relief of multiple constraints on recruitment limitation in the early life history of oaks. These results have important implications for the restoration and conservation of Mediterranean oak systems.";"Acácio, Vanda

Whether erosion may have such an impact on modern societies as well, is subject to debate. In this paper we quantify the relationship between crop yields and soil water available to plants, the most important yield-determining factor affected by erosion, at the European scale. Using information on the spatial distribution of erosion rates we calculate the potential threat of erosion-induced productivity losses. We show that future reductions in productivity in Europe as a whole are relatively small and do not pose a substantial threat to crop production within the coming century. However, within Europe there is considerable variability, and although productivity in northern Europe is not likely to be significantly reduced by soil erosion, for the southern countries the threat of erosion-induced productivity declines is stronger.";"Bakker, Martha M.

"AGRIS:US201300832662";"Land-Use Change and Stream Water Fluxes: Decadal Dynamics in Watershed Nitrate Exports";"";"Stream water exports of nutrients and pollutants to water bodies integrate internal and external watershed processes that vary in both space and time. In this paper, we explore nitrate (NO₃) fluxes for the 326 km² mixed-land use Fall Creek watershed in central New York for 1972-2005, and consider internal factors such as changes in land use/land cover, dynamics in agricultural production and fertilizer use, and external factors such as atmospheric deposition. Segmented regression analysis was applied independently to dormant and growing seasons for three portions of the period of record, which indicated that stream water NO₃ concentrations increased in both dormant and growing seasons from the 1970s to the early 1990s at all volumes of streamflow discharge. Dormant season NO₃ concentrations then decreased at all flow conditions between the periods 1987-1993 and 1994-2005. Results from a regression-based stream water loading model (LOADEST) normalized to mean annual concentrations showed annual modeled NO₃ concentration in stream water increased by 34% during the 1970s and 1980s (from 1.15 to 1.54 mg l-¹), peaked in about 1989, and then decreased by 29% through 2005 (to 1.09 mg l-¹). Annual precipitation had the strongest correlation with stream water NO₃ concentrations (r = -0.62, P = 0.01). Among land use factors, corn production for grain was the variable most highly correlated to stream water NO₃ concentrations (r = 0.53, P = 0.01). The strongest associative trend determined using Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) was found between stream water NO₃ concentrations and N-equivalence of dairy production (Bonferroni adjusted P value = 0.0003). Large increases in dairy production were coincident with declining nitrate concentrations over the past decade, which suggest that dairy management practices may have improved in the watershed. However, because dairy production in the Fall Creek watershed has been fueled by large increases in feed imports, the environmental costs of feed production have likely been externalized to other watersheds.";"Johnson, Mark S.

We investigated the relative role of local (13 soil and tree stand structure variables) and regional factors (19 climate, land cover and geographic location variables) in determining the richness of several vascular plant functional groups in indigenous forest fragments in southeastern New Zealand. The predictor variables explaining the largest fraction of the variation in species richness were identified using a backward and forward stepwise procedure, with adjustments for the number of variables and testing for multicollinearity. The total proportion of variation explained by local and regional factors was highest for tree species richness (54.1%) and lowest for herbaceous species richness (28.2%). We found differences between the functional groups in the extent to which species richness was explained by local vs. regional factors, but both showed some ability to explain the species richness of all functional groups. The abundance of the strongly competitive tree species Nothofagus menziesii (silver beech) had a strong negative effect on total, tree and herb species richness, but it had only minor effects on woody and fern species richness. Once the effect of this local variable was accounted for, the remaining variation in tree and woody species richness was mainly explained by regional variables. Herbaceous and fern species richness, on the other hand, was strongly correlated with local as well as regional variables. We emphasize the importance of using a fixed plot size when the relative effects of local and regional factors on patterns of species richness are to be compared and evaluated.";"OhlemÃ¼ller, R.

"AGRIS:LV2016010744";"La valeur économique des paysages des villes périurbanisées";"";"In this research, we propose a method for describing rural landscapes in peri urban areas and evaluating their impact on house and land prices. This method matches quantitative geography and econometric methods used for hedonic analysis. A geographical model is used for producing variables describing the landscape an observer can look at when located in a specific house or a land parcel. This model takes account of these parts of the landscape that are hidden by houses, buildings, hills, forests,. . . The variables produced by the model describe the size of the area that can be seen and its repartition across various types of land use (agriculture, forest, buildings, roads, water,. . . ). They are used as explanatory factors for the price paid for buying the house or land parcel, using hedonic regression. This method has been simultaneously used in six areas: the periurban areas of the cities of Dijon, Besançon, Lyon, Marseille and Brest and the whole Nord-Pas de Calais region. We are then able to compare results obtained using the same methodology for various areas, with various types of landscapes. Moreover, for Dijon, Besançon and the Nord-Pas de Calais regions, we can compare variables produced using different sources of information. For Dijon and Besançon, they differ with respect to the thinness and the quality of the satellite images used for analysing landcapes, the best one being much more expansive. For the Nord-Pas de Calais, we compared two types of geographical information systems. Our results confirm that the quality of the landscape that can be seen when located at a house or in a land parcel significantly influences its price. A landscape, with notably green areas, has a value that is capitalized into house and land prices. However, the measure of this value is highly variable across regions and is highly sensitive to the quality of the data used by the geographical model. Therefore, at this stage of the research work, our results cannot be used for operational purposes.

La recherche présentée ici propose une méthode de description et d’évaluation des caractéristiques d’un paysage qui combine la géographie quantitative et l’économétrie des modèles hédoniques. Un modèle géographique produit des indices caractérisant les paysages à partir d’une reconstitution de la vue depuis le sol, en tenant compte des effets du relief et des masques que les objets hauts opposent à la vue. Il décrit la quantité de paysage vu par un observateur au niveau du sol en la répartissant entre 13 types d’occupations du sol. Les variables produites par le modèle géographique sont utilisées dans des régressions hédoniques qui permettent d’évaluer l’impact des attributs paysagers ainsi mesurés sur les prix des transactions immobilières. Nous avons appliqué cette méthode à six zones géographiques périurbaines, autour des villes de Dijon, Besançon, Lyon, Marseille et Brest et pour l’ensemble de la région Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Nous pouvons ainsi comparer les résultats obtenus en appliquant la même méthode sur le même type de données, dans des contextes différents, notamment par le type de paysage. De plus, pour Dijon, Besançon et le Nord-Pas-de-Calais, nous disposons de plusieurs sources d’information géographique différant par leur qualité, notamment la finesse des images satellitaires utilisées ; ce qui nous permet d’analyser l’impact de la qualité des données sur la qualité de la description des paysages et sur les évaluations économiques qui en résultent. En règle générale, les résultats obtenus montrent que la contribution des attributs paysagers au prix des biens fonciers et immobiliers est faible mais significative. Les paysages, en particulier les objets « verts » (couverts arborés et agricoles), sont valorisés par les ménages à travers leur capitalisation dans les valeurs immobilières, en particulier dans l’espace périurbain. Cependant, les résultats obtenus sont très sensibles à la qualité et à la finesse des sources d’information utilisées pour décrire le paysage. Ils sont également très variables d’une zone géographique à l’autre, sans que l’on dispose actuellement de facteurs explicatifs de cette variabilité.";"Brossard, Thierry

Multivariate analysis of variance (manova), Simpson Index of Diversity (sid) and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (dca) were used to assess variation in the proportions of the six main dietary components (cereal and broad-leaved plant leaves, weed seeds cases, cereal grains, husks of grasses and other plant material).Results Thirty-seven different kinds of plant food items were found, and the most numerous were cereal leaves (58.2% in total of all items), followed by leaves of broad-leaved plants (21.8%), weed seed cases (13.3%), cereals grains (3.5%), husks of grasses (1.2%) and other plant material (2.0%). Diet composition differed significantly between winter cereals, winter oil-seed rape, stubble fields and permanent fallows. The dca showed that the two first axes explain 38% of the total variance of the diet. The diet diversity was highest in stubble fields and permanent fallows, and the smallest in winter cereals. Dietary diversity was negatively correlated with the overall abundance of leaves, and positively with the abundance of weed seeds, cereal grains and husks of grasses.Conclusion Cereal leaves might replace other food items, which suggests that food resources are not a critical factor limiting the population of Grey Partridges during winter. A high proportion of weed seeds and cereal grains in the diet of Grey Partridges in stubble fields confirms the importance of these fields as sources of food of high-calorific value. Maintenance of stubble fields and cover crops with natural regeneration of annual weeds should constitute an important element of a strategy for the recovery of Grey Partridge populations in arable landscapes in Europe.";"Orłowski, Grzegorz

To this end, we investigated microclimate differences within an urban park (the Singapore Botanic Gardens) to assess if variations in plot-scale land cover affect both objective (measured) and subjective (surveyed) microclimate data. Over two monsoonal seasons, we obtained data from four distinct sitesâa tropical rainforest stand, a palm tree valley, a water-body feature, and the park visitorsâ centre. Measured climate data (e.g. air temperature, vapour pressure, wind velocity and globe temperatures) were used to derive mean radiant temperature Tmrt and three thermal comfort indices (e.g. temperature-humidity index THI, physiological equivalent temperature PET, and wet-bulb globe temperature WBGT). Concurrent to these measurements, we also surveyed park users (n=1573) for perceived microclimate sensations and preferences in thermal, humidity, wind and sun exposure, as well as their overall assessment of climate comfort/discomfort. The results indicate significant differences in both measured and perceived microclimates over different sites and seasons, with (i) selected heat stress thresholds based on thermal comfort indices exceeded at several sites, and (ii) visitors perceived generally hot, humid and low-wind conditions throughout. Variations in respondent acclimatisation to tropical climates are observed between correlations of WBGT and some sensation votes, with apparently stronger correlations with more acclimated respondents. While humidity was voted as the most uncomfortable climate variable across all sites, a large majority of respondents felt comfortable climate conditions throughout. Present results confirm that vegetation canopy characteristics affecting wind and sun exposure appear to be important factors in outdoor thermal comfort. Lastly, we suggest that future tropical outdoor thermal comfort studies consider the critical aspects of site humidity and wind to discern comfort/discomfort levels.";"Chow, Winston T.L.

One alternative for agricultural water resource management in areas of recurrent drought is allocation through market mechanisms. While past research has aimed to explain why farmers are reluctant to participate in already established water markets, this research seeks to identify the appropriate market mechanism given farmers' preexisting attitudes toward water markets. Statistical analysis of survey data from 166 farmer interviews in the Rio Grande Basin indicate that farmers are significantly more likely to participate in short-term water mechanisms, such as spot water markets and water banks than in permanent transfer mechanisms, particularly those that fully separate water rights from land. In sharp contrast to expectations, the choice of market mechanism did not differ significantly between farmers based on their a priori intention to buy, sell or both buy and sell in these markets. Choice of market mechanism also did not differ among farmer types although small, lifestyle or hobby farmers clearly preferred spot water markets to other types of short-term mechanisms. Evaluating these attitudes a priori may help to design more suitable water market mechanisms for the basin.";"Hadjigeorgalis, E.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"water rights;water management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300917006";"http://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html";"";"";"";"594-605"
"AGRIS:US201400143897";"Sanaga discharge at the Edea Catchment outlet (Cameroon): An example of hydrologic responses of a tropical rain-fed river system to changes in precipitation and groundwater inputs and to flow regulation";"";"The Sanaga River is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's largest and greatly regulated rivers. Available flow data for this hydrosystem largely cover the pre- and post-regulation periods. From comparisons between unregulated (hypothetical) and observed scenarios, it has been possible to separate and to quantify hydro-climatic (groundwater + rainfall) change effects from anthropogenic impacts (especially dam-related alterations). To appreciate shifts in the river regime, discontinuity detection tests and the IHA model were applied to discharge data series reflecting average and extreme flow conditions, respectively. Results obtained principally from the Hubert segmentation method reveal that a major discontinuity occurred in 1970-1971 separating a surplus phase between 1945-1946 and 1969-1970, and a deficient and much contrasted one, from 1971/1972. This implies that the Sanaga catchment is dominantly affected by hydro-climatic changes. However, wide land cover/land use changes experienced here since 1988 have resulted in an increase in surface runoff. Additional quickflows linked to these changes may have partly compensated for the substantial decline in the dry season rainfall and groundwater inputs observed from this date. Although at the monthly scale, dam-related impacts on average flows increase with stage of regulation, the seasonal variability of the river regime remains generally unaffected. A comparison of the IHA statistics, calculated from unregulated and observed streamflow data, show that hydrologic shifts occurring in maximum and minimum discharges are mostly significant from 1971/1972 and are mainly due to the action of dams. Minimum flows appear, however, widely impacted, thus reflecting the prime objective assigned to the existing reservoirs, constructed to supplement flows for hydroelectricity production during the dry season.

Median concentrations for Hg are 0.030mg/kg (range: <0.003–1.56mg/kg) for the Ap samples and 0.035mg/kg (range: <0.003–3.12mg/kg) for the Gr samples. Only 5 Ap and 10 Gr samples returned Hg concentrations above 1mg/kg. In the geochemical maps the continental-scale distribution of the element is clearly dominated by geology. Climate exerts an important influence. Mercury accumulates in those areas of northern Europe where a wet and cold climate favours the build-up of soil organic material. Typical anthropogenic sources like coal-fired power plants, waste incinerators, chlor-alkali plants, metal smelters and urban agglomerations are hardly visible at continental scales but can have a major impact at the local-scale.";"Ottesen, Rolf Tore

We differentiated the species according to propagule size, dispersal mode, and geographical distribution in Israel. Our results in 28 experimental units containing a pit, a mound, and a portion of the undisturbed surrounding ""matrix"" showed that species richness, total plant density, and biomass yield were higher in the pits and mounds than in the matrix. Soil moisture at 0â15 cm depth was higher in the pits, but lower in the mounds relative to the matrix. Species with larger propagules (>5 mm) became more abundant, and those with tinyseeds (<1 mm) became less abundant, in the humanâmade patches relative to the undisturbed matrix. Windâdispersed species and those with secondary dispersal by runoff were denser in pits and mounds, while shortâdistance rain dispersers were more abundant in the matrix. ""Edge"" species, occurring in the study site at the edge of their geographical distribution in Israel, increased more in density, species richness, and biomass than general ""core"" species, for which the study site is in the center of their distribution. The annual plant community responded to changes in three environmental factors: (1) microtopographic structure from flat surface to mounds or pits, which function as traps for seeds; (2) soil surface texture from densely packed to loose soil in pits and mounds, which provide suitable sites for larger propagules; (3) soil moisture availability, increasing in the pits but decreasing in the mounds relative to the matrix. The relevance of the study was discussed in relation to (1) combating desertification, (2) sustainable arid land use, and (3) species conservation.";"Boeken, Bertrand

Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) parameters, estimated from data acquired by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite series, are particularly adapted to assess these changes. This work presents an application of the yearly land-cover dynamics (YLCD) methodology to analyse the behaviour of the vegetation, which consists of a combined multitemporal study of the NDVI and LST parameters on a yearly basis.

There is evidence that in some cases, reforestation facilitates forest succession toward natural species composition. However, the success of a scheme varies according to site conditions, and systematic investigations are required for adaptive management. Monoculture plantations were used to reforest abandoned pastures at the study site in Hokkaido, northern Japan. At the study site—a 40-year-old nonnative larch (Larix kaempferi) plantation—the effects of thinning and deer-browsing exclusion treatments on the demography of understory saplings were analyzed to achieve appropriate management planning for reforestation. After deer-browsing exclusion, saplings of various species became established, and species composition corresponded closely to that of a natural conifer–broadleaved mixed stand. Saplings of shade-tolerant species, such as Abies sachalinensis and Acer mono, were abundant. Thinning influenced the demography of saplings over an 8-year period and significantly affected the height growth rate of A. sachalinensis saplings, which show strong variations in response to varying light conditions. There were also negative effects of thinning, such as increased mortality and decreased height growth rate of broadleaved saplings, the growth of which was suppressed by facilitated growth of A. sachalinensis. Thus, treatments used for reforestation must take into account differences in demographic traits of tree species by including long-term monitoring.";"Shoyama, Kikuko";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"JPN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400067096";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-011-0178-8";"";"";"";"77-87"
"AGRIS:US201300863532";"Combining classification tree analyses with interviews to study why sub-alpine grasslands sometimes revert to forest: A case study from the Swiss Alps";"";"Natural reforestation reflects a decline in traditional agricultural practices. In the last decades, natural forest re-growth has replaced much of the grasslands in the Swiss mountains. This is an area where traditional cultivation has preserved unique landscapes and habitats of high ecological value. We investigated the patterns and determinants of natural reforestation of sub-alpine grasslands at the sub-parcel level using raster cells as the units of the analysis, and at the municipality-level. The study encompassed four municipalities in the Swiss Alps. Land-use data were derived from aerial photographs taken between the 1950s and 2000. We derived the research design for fieldwork (interviews in this study) from spatial statistical models (classification trees in this study). This method is known as the “finding answers in the errors” approach. This allowed us to relate the behaviour of landowners and operators to changes in land-use/land-cover types, which is one of the main challenges in land-use/land-cover change research. Three of four classification trees accurately described the locations where natural reforestation occurred, which was mostly on steep and north-facing slopes. However, additional information from interviews was necessary to understand the patterns and determinants of reforestation. Interviews revealed that policy factors (e.g. delayed land consolidations) enhanced forest re-growth. Some sites remained under cultivation despite model predictions of reforestation. Socio-economic factors, not incorporated into the models, explained these discrepancies. These factors included the opportunity costs of farm labour (e.g. aged farmers retaining traditional practices), a conversion to low-cost cultivation practices (e.g. deer and horse pasturing), agri-environmental requirements (e.g. land required to avoid exceeding the prescribed number of livestock per hectare) or other benefits (e.g. hobby farming). Many farms were abandoned during the 50-year study period. The remaining farms often increased in size, whereas farm labour remained stable or decreased. Farm labour costs increased faster than incomes, leading to undergrazing and the cessation of tree and shrub clearance. Although our discussion references specific case study areas, our methods are applicable to the study of other areas undergoing land-use change.";"Gellrich, Mario

External influences such as forest clearance and soil management affect biological indicators making them useful to point out whether the land use strategy is sustainable. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to assess the utility of some soil chemical and microbiological properties and 16S rDNA diversity in bacteria domain and their significance as soil-quality indicators in different land use systems in southern Brazil, Paraná State. Nine sites with soil originated from basalt (Rhodic Ferralsol), previously covered with the Atlantic native forest were evaluated: a native forest tract as reference; three sites artificially reforested with native species, but with understory differently managed; secondary forest naturally regenerated from abandoned pasture; artificially reforested with eucalyptus; two wheat-cropped sites at differing vegetative stages; one site in fallow. Twenty-four chemical and microbiological properties and their derivatives were assessed, in addition to molecular diversity of bacteria domain based on denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Amongst all variables, the most dissimilar along the sites were total organic C, microbial biomass C and N, and ammonification rate. Total organic C was highest in the native forest, followed by secondary forest, eucalyptus and the artificially reforested sites; the wheat-cropped and fallow sites produced the lowest values. This trend was also observed for ammonification rate, which was closely correlated to organic C. Microbial biomass C and N were also higher in the reforested sites, whereas for microbial N biomass, the eucalyptus site resembled to the wheat-cropped and fallow sites. The DGGE analysis revealed that the fallow, eucalyptus and wheat-cropped sites had less bacterial diversity. All the sites reforested with native species grouped with the native forest, while the eucalyptus, fallow and wheat-cropped sites formed separate clusters. A similar clustering pattern was observed when all chemical and microbiological properties were considered in a grouping analysis. The results for reforestation employing native species tended to be similar to those of the stable native forest, while the use of an exotic species (eucalyptus) tended to be similar to those of the cropped sites. In addition, the fallow site showed general unfavorable trends in microbiological indicators and less bacterial diversity, suggesting that such soil management is not sustainable at least in subtropical areas. In this case, would be preferable provide the soil with vegetal covering that increase the organic C inputs and consequently microbial diversity and activity.";"Nogueira, M.A.

Quantitative and spatially explicit data on ecological change are, however, scarce and current estimates are often based on simplistic representations of deforestation and land use change. Significant uncertainties in current estimates therefore remain. The present study was conducted to assess deforestation and other important complex land use change trajectories in the eastern highlands of Madagascar. A time-series of satellite imagery dating from 1972 to 2001 was used to analyse overall change and rates of change between different land use types in the study area. Forest cover in the study area was approximately 8060 ha in 1972 and 4278 ha in 2001. Rates of deforestation were not, however, constant throughout this period, but varied from 52 ha yr-1 (1972-1992) and 341 ha yr-1 (1992-1999). The increased rates in the 1990s were attributed to turbulent political conditions on the island during the latter period and shows the complex relationships between social, political and ecological processes governing deforestation and land use change processes. Accessibility (distance to villages and roads) and elevation were shown to be the most important predictors of deforestation risk in the study area. Intensive cultivation of slopes (tanety) increased by about 3400 ha ([almost equal to] 65%) during the study period, a significant part of which came from cultivation of grassland savanna (net increase [almost equal to] 1700 ha). These trends were found to be indicative of increasing pressure on available land resources in the region, leading to extensive cultivation of marginal grasslands and ultimately significant soil fertility decline.";"Vagen, T.G.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"deforestation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"MDG";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301113206";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.01.007";"";"";"";"219-228"

Our paper highlights the contradiction between the employment goals announced and the proliferation and effect of machinery acquisition subsidies granted to improve competitiveness. These subsidies may reinforce farmers’ attempts to increase their land, and contribute to the laying off of agricultural workforce. Diversification of operations could potentially counter this process, but its progress is hardly discernible. We surveyed 104 farmers in three LEADER micro-regions to find out about the farm development motives of farmers and farmer families, the status of farm diversification, their plans concerning multifunctional agriculture, as well as the relevant positive and negative factors. Within the functions other than agricultural production, we specifically addressed public services other than the provision of goods. Apart from their natural desire to develop their farm in a safe manner, the farmers interviewed were motivated mostly by a desire to improve the financial situation of the family. Most of them thought that purchasing more land would be the most important step towards this goal. With respect to employment, family members were mentioned, while the creation of employment opportunities for other was ranked very low, even by diversified farms. The promotion of flexible forms of employment was specifically seen a governmental responsibility. The findings highlight the contradictions existing between centrally announced goals, regional and industry processes and the attitude of farmers in the field of employment.";"Feher, Alajos

The European Union Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 recognizes the need to incorporate ecosystem services into land-use management, conservation, and restoration actions. The inclusion of ecosystem services into restoration actions and plans is an emerging area of research, and there are few documented approaches and guidelines on how to undertake such an exercise. This paper responds to this need, and we demonstrate an approach for identifying both key ecosystem services provisioning areas and the spatial relationship between ecological processes and services. A degraded semi-arid Mediterranean river basin in north east Spain was used as a case study area. We show that the quantification and mapping of services are the first step required for both optimizing and targeting of specific local areas for restoration. Additionally, we provide guidelines for restoration planning at a watershed scale; establishing priorities for improving the delivery of ecosystem services at this scale; and prioritizing the sub-watersheds for restoration based on their potential for delivering a combination of key ecosystem services for the entire basin.";"Trabucchi, Mattia

A general reason is probably that various types of transaction costs limit coordination among farmers. A more specific explanation is that coordination on land markets or machinery cooperation is difficult to achieve when farmers are heterogeneous as some kind of price differentiation is necessary for a Pareto-superior solution. This paper investigates experimentally such a coordination game with heterogeneous agents using an example inspired by agricultural land markets. The experimental findings suggest that a Pareto-optimal solution may not be found when agents are heterogeneous. The findings provide evidence for market failures and cooperation deficits as reasons for unexploited economies of scale in agriculture. Our findings are consistent with coordination failures that appear to be driven by behavioural factors such as anchoring-and-adjustment, inequity aversion, and a reverse form of winner’s curse.";"Balmann, Alfons

The research was conducted in the area of Megalo Dereio, which is located in Evros region, in north-eastern Greece in 2010. Herbage production was measured and ecological diversity indices were determined at three different shrub cover regimes (open, moderate, dense). Herbage production decreased progressively as juniper cover increased. Floristic diversity was significantly higher in the moderate shrub cover regime, while it was dramatically reduced in the dense shrub cover regime.";"A.P., Kyriazopoulos

"AGRIS:US2012202386";"AN ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURES IMPLEMENTED TO RESOLVE LAND USE CONFLICT AND OVERSTOCKING BY MASAI PASTORALISTS IN KAJIADO DISTRICT, KENYA";"";"This paper evaluates two recently implemented strategies to control land use conflict and overgrazing in Kajiado district of southern Kenya, stressing the importance of analyzing attempts to alter traditional pastoralist production systems in terms of the ""complex ethno-ecological mosaic in which political power allocates access to strategic resources"".  A situation, structure, performance paradigm is applied to the problem.
Factors central to the situation which underlie the issue of overgrazing are grounded in the ecological and historical context.  Highly unpredictable rainfall, repeated drought, and an increasingly constricted resource base form the primary constraints of the Masai production system.  In response, complex cultural adaptations and herd management strategies have evolved to provide maximum security and support for the institution of the family.  It is these social factors which must be kept in mind as the evaluation of intervention strategies proceeds.
Two intervention strategies designed to address the issue of overstocking from slightly different perspectives are described in detail and then evaluated in terms of their likely performance outcomes. These strategies are land adjudication into group ranches, and the payment of Wildlife Utilization Fees to group ranches bordering on the national parks.  For a number of reasons; especially those related to property rights, and the costs of obtaining information, reaching agreement, and enforcing decisions; it appears unlikely that either strategy will be very effective in changing herd management practices such as mobility or the stocking of large numbers.";"Laker-Ojok, Rita";"";"";"AGRIS";"1980-12-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"KEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012202386";"http://purl.umn.edu/11021";"";"";"";""

Four individuals of Nassauvia magellanica and one of Gamochaeta nivalis (both Asteraceae) are growing robustly and in close proximity of each other on dry ash and scoria soil near a ruined whaling station which, in recent years, has been frequently visited by large numbers of ship-borne tourists. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty and the Management Plan for the island, designated an Antarctic Specially Managed Area, provide strict regulations for the conduct of visitors to this site and precautions against the accidental introduction of non-indigenous species. While their establishment on this remote volcanic island may have been anthropogenically mediated, natural immigration cannot be ruled out as both species produce seed adapted for wind-dispersal in their native Tierra del Fuego. The ecological consequences if one or both of these aliens spreads beyond their present restricted location are considered. While determined efforts are being made to implement rigorous biosecurity measures in Antarctica, current Antarctic Treaty policy on dealing with colonizing invasive alien species is indecisive and requires urgent action and clear recommendations.";"Lewis Smith, Ronald I.

This paper discusses determinants of farmland prices in Canton Zurich. A hedonic price model was used to estimate 1) the implicit value of an agricultural use of a land parcel, 2) the implicit value of the option to convert a farm parcel to a non-farm use and 3) the implicit consumptive value (value of owning land) of agricultural land. 
The analysis found farmland prices are influenced by agricultural production attributes as well as factors that influence the non-agricultural demand for land. In Canton Zurich, it can be assumed that economic development has already taken place in all communities in which it was possible. Its effect on farmland prices is therefore already manifested by influencing factors such as population density and the circumstances regarding land use. Once the new law on farmland became effective (1.1.1994), speculatory motives became much less a feature of land purchases. The weight of the factors determining price has thus shifted from ""non-agricultural"" to ""agricultural"". Arousing concern is on the other hand the fact that after 1994, the likelihood of transactions on good parcels located in economically strong communities has shrunk significantly. The ruling on maximum price may be responsible for the demise of the agricultural land market. 
The policy recommendations arising from the results relate both to the provisions of farmland legislation and to aspects of the law on space planning. In particular, innovations are proposed with regard to the keeping of price statistics, the terms of taking possession at income value and the definition of agricultural structures.";"Giuliani, Gianluca

This would enable estimation of how much carbon emission a project could potentially prevent and thus how much carbon credit should be rewarded. However, different factors like forest degradation and the lack of linearity in forest cover transitions challenge the accuracy of such scenarios. Here we predict and validate such BAU scenarios retrospectively based on forest cover changes at village and district level in North Central Vietnam. With the government’s efforts to increase the forest cover, land use policies led to gradual abandonment of shifting cultivation since the 1990s. We analyzed Landsat images from 1973, 1989, 1998, 2000, and 2011 and found that the policies in the areas studied did lead to increased forest cover after a long period of decline, but that this increase could mainly be attributed to an increase in open forest and shrub areas. We compared Landsat classifications with participatory maps of land cover/use in 1998 and 2012 that indicated more forest degradation than was captured by the Landsat analysis. The BAU scenarios were heavily dependent on which years were chosen for the reference period. This suggests that hypothetical REDD+ activities in the past, when based on the remote sensing data available at that time, would have been unable to correctly estimate changes in carbon stocks and thus produce relevant BAU scenarios.";"Ankersen, Jeppe

The model results demonstrate the possible land use/land cover change scenarios for the years from 2000 to 2070 by examining the broad narrative of each SRES within the context of a local setting, such as the Kyoungan River Basin, constructing narratives of local development shifts and modeling a set of ‘best guess’ approximations of the future land use conditions in the study area.

Currently, subsidence amounts to 1–2 cm/year. Water management in these areas is complex and costly, greenhouse gases are being emitted, and surface water quality is relatively poor. Regional and local authorities and landowners responsible for peatland management have recognized these problems. In addition, the Netherlands Royal Meteorological Institute predicts higher temperatures and drier summers, which both are expected to enhance peat decomposition. Stakeholder workshops have been organized in three case study areas in the province of Friesland to exchange knowledge on subsidence and explore future subsidence rates and the effects of land use and management changes on subsidence rates. Subsidence rates were up to 3 cm/year in deeply drained parcels and increased when we included climate change in the modeling exercises. This means that the relatively thin peat layers in this province (ca 1 m) would shrink or even disappear by the end of the century when current practices continue. Adaptation measures were explored, such as extensive dairy farming and the production of new crops in wetter conditions, but little experience has been gained on best practices. The workshops have resulted in useful exchange of ideas on possible measures and their consequences for land use and water management in the three case study areas. The province and the regional water board will use the results to develop land use and water management policies for the next decades.";"Brouns, Karlijn

A comparison of ecological regionalization schemes";"";"Ecological regionalizations, such as ecoregions or environmental clusters, are often used as coarse filters for conservation. To be effective biodiversity surrogates, regionalizations should contain distinct species assemblages. This condition is not frequently evaluated and regionalizations are rarely assessed comparatively. We used a national dataset of Canadian butterfly collections to evaluate four regionalizations (ecoregions, land cover and productivity regime classifications, and a spatial grid) at two thematic resolutions using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and species indicator values. Overall, the spatially constrained schemes (ecoregions and grids) best captured patterns of butterfly community composition and species affinities, indicating that butterfly communities are strongly structured by space at the continent scale. In contrast, when comparing regions only within spatial or environmental neighbourhoods (i.e., comparing between regions that are adjacent along geographic or environmental gradients), all regionalizations performed similarly. Adjacency in environmental space is thus as important as physical adjacency at determining community dissimilarity. Productivity regimes and land cover will be useful biodiversity surrogates when considered in conjunction with space or within a spatially constrained area. This finding was confirmed with two ecoregional case studies (of the Algonquin-Lake Nipissing and Thompson–Okanagan Plateau ecoregions), which also revealed that the relative performance of regionalizations depends upon the context of the study area. We conclude that including species data can improve the efficiency of environmental surrogates for systematic conservation planning.";"Andrew, Margaret E.

In this paper we investigate how to incorporate albedo changes in a carbon accounting tool to show the net effect of land use change on the climate. Using a study area in southern Europe, albedo and carbon sequestration modelling results are linked to determine the combined radiative forcing balance. The results show that under specific circumstances afforestation/reforestation measures may not automatically have positive impacts in a global warming context because the cooling effect of most of the carbon sequestered is neutralized by the warming effect of albedo changes. However, sensitivity analyses lead to the conclusion that improved albedo data from satellite images (MODIS) could influence and enhance outputs significantly. The paper points out that accounting based exclusively on GHG units does not, in the case of land use change, reflect the entire picture. It is highly recommended that in future global warming impacts of land use systems and biogenic products (e.g. solid biomass, liquid biofuels) should be studied using life cycle assessments (LCA) and should include these additional—non-GHG effects—on climate change.";"Schwaiger, Hannes P.

A necessary condition for an efficient trading system is heterogeneity among methyl bromide users with respect to the costs of switching to potential alternative pest control measures, which would lead to cost savings from trading.  Using data on these costs from current methyl bromide users, the authors show that this necessary condition appears to be met, and characterize the potential cost savings that could occur if critical use permits can be traded from methyl bromide users with lower costs to those with higher costs.  Several potential mechanisms for implementing these trades are considered, and differ in the extent to which permit for use may be traded within a commodity-use, or traded among methyl bromide users producing different commodities.  The total incremental costs of the simulated trading system were higher when permits are traded only among methyl bromide users within a commodity sector, while the costs were lowest when the methyl bromide users are allowed to freely trade their permits across sectors.";"Kim, Hong Jin

Typically in groundwater models this exchange flow is related to a difference in head between the river and some point in the aquifer, through a “coefficient.” This coefficient has been defined differently as well as the location for the head in the aquifer. This paper proposes a new coefficient, analytically derived, and a specific location for the point where the aquifer head is used in the difference. The dimensionless part of the coefficient is referred to as the SAFE (stream‐aquifer flow exchange) dimensionless conductance. The paper investigates the factors that influence the value of this new conductance. Among these factors are (1) the wetted perimeter of the cross‐section, (2) the degree of penetration of the cross‐section, and (3) the shape of the cross‐section. The study shows that these factors just listed are indeed ordered in their respective level of importance. In addition the study verifies that the analytical correct value of the coefficient is matched by finite difference simulation only if the grid system is sufficiently fine. Thus the use of the analytical value of the coefficient is an accurate and efficient alternative to ad hoc estimates for the coefficient typically used in finite difference and finite element methods.";"Morel‐Seytoux, Hubert J.

More recently, Real Options approaches have been employed to value single and infinite rotation forests with a flexible harvest age. Under a stochastic timber price process, it has been shown that the valuation of a flexible rotation forest is equal or higher than that of a fixed rotation forest, because a flexible harvest regime delays the harvest if the timber price is not favourable, whereas a fixed harvest regime would proceed to harvest regardless of the price. Often, valuation of fixed and flexible rotation ages are compared using 2 different methods – NPV (or LEV) and Real Options. The latter tends to have higher data requirements, employ different assumptions and is much more complex to estimate. Because of these differences, it may be difficult to isolate the cause of the increased valuation. In this work, we apply a relatively simple Binomial Tree method from Guthrie (2009) to value both fixed rotation and flexible rotation forests. This method uses the same data, with the same assumptions for both valuations. By holding everything equal, the difference in valuation is solely attributable to the fixed versus flexible harvesting decisions. Original results for both single and infinite rotations are presented using New Zealand Radiata Pine data. Under a mean reverting timber price process, the Binomial Tree approach offers useful insights on the increased valuation due to flexible harvest decisions.";"Tee, James

People still reproduce space in these two spatialcategories but society and governments are no longercapable in producing this symbolic space in a physical andsocial way. It is clear that a top-down imposed,uniformising planning discourse is not able to get a grip onpresent urbanising processes and therefore alternativestory-lines are needed.An alternative story line of ‘open space as public space’,points at the societal importance of public space and couldbe useful in understanding the challenges in presentnetwork society. In a context in which almost the entireFlemish space is ‘urban’, open-space-fragments seem to beable to fulfil a role as public space and have to becomestructuring spatial elements for further urbanisation.Three success factors in (designing) planning the openspace seem to have the potential to be a lot more essentialto the spatial visioning on open space fragments/ruralareas than the current functional delineation of parts ofthe natural and agricultural structure.At the same time it is clear that multifunctionalagriculture (MFA), meeting a broad spectrum of societaldemands, is strongly related to the critical success factorsfor a good functioning of ‘public open space’, not on thereference scale of urban public space but on that of thecollective open space at the regional level.

Here, we show how paleoenvironmental records can provide important multidecadal perspectives on ecosystem services (ES). More than 50 different paleoenvironmental proxy records can be mapped to a wide range of ES categories and subcategories. Lake sediments are particularly suitable for reconstructing records of regulating services, such as soil stability, sediment regulation, and water purification, which are often less well monitored. We demonstrate the approach using proxy records from two sets of lake sediment sequences in the lower Yangtze basin covering the period 1800–2006, combined with recent socioeconomic and climate records. We aggregate the proxy records into a regional regulating services index to show that rapid economic growth and population increases since the 1950s are strongly coupled to environmental degradation. Agricultural intensification from the 1980s onward has been the main driver for reducing rural poverty but has led to an accelerated loss of regulating services. In the case of water purification, there is strong evidence that a threshold has been transgressed within the last two decades. The current steep trajectory of the regulating services index implies that regional land management practices across a large agricultural tract of eastern China are critically unsustainable.";"Dearing, John A.

Using the Irish, Danish and Dutch farm level data, we identify the extent to which both system and product switching after the introduction of decoupling has occurred and to what extent these changes have contributed to productivity growth in the agriculture.

Due to the variable nature of these processes and to the variable characteristics of the areas where they occur, there is no general rule linking land degradation and biological diversity decline. Thus, a geographically limited approach focusing on drivers of change may provide a more appropriate base upon which synergies can be built. This exercise is undertaken for the case of northern Mediterranean. Three related processes are discussed: land use change (in the form of agricultural abandonment and intensification, as well as urbanization), wildfires and overuse of freshwater resources. Agricultural abandonment stands out as it may or may not have adverse effects on land resources and it may promote either a reduction in biological diversity or a shift in community synthesis. Agricultural intensification affects adversely both biological diversity and land resources, though often through different mechanisms. Urbanization, by taking up space, wildfires, if they recur in short intervals or they are very extended spatially, and overuse of freshwater resources adversely affect both issues through common mechanisms. The fact that the various drivers may operate through different mechanisms and sometimes they do not even produce consistently positive or negative results calls for a site-specific understanding of the mechanisms. As many of the processes generating these patterns are not reversible, e.g. intensification of agriculture or tourism growth, ways should be sought to reconcile them with conservation.

This sudden move required new management capacities for such organizations, demands that were not catered for at the time. Basically, the organizations managed their systems through their own learning and efforts.Only 10 years later, by the end of the 1990s, the Peruvian government started a large-scale training initiative directed towards WUAs, mostly in the Peruvian costal areas. Now, eight years later, considerable achievements have been made in relation to water service fee collection and accounting-related aspects. But internal organizational management of most WUAs remains weak, a problem made worse by the many changes in leadership and instability of personnel.Some WUAs in the interior of the country, and the National Board of Water Users Associations, have taken initiatives on their own to develop the capacity of their leaders, technical and administrative personnel and users. This process of creating ""local capacity builders"" within the water organizations still encounters many difficulties, both externally and internally.

After applying the NDVI, PC2, and TM 4 image differencing techniques, the images obtained were transformed into change/no change maps. The thresholds identified to highlight the changes were set at 0.6� s for NDVI and 0.7� s for PC2 and TM 4. Before applying the PCC technique, the satellite images were classified through the supervised classification method. The overall accuracy obtained was 85.91� % and the kappa statistics 0.8249 for 1993, 88.18� % and 0.8497 for 2009, respectively. The assessment of the changes detection methods in the studied area shows that the first place is occupied by NDVI image differencing with an overall accuracy of 83.80� %, followed by PCC method with 83.20� %, PC2 difference with an overall accuracy of 81.60� %, and TM 4 difference with an overall accuracy of 79.40� %.";"Vorovencii, Iosif";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ROU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400056476";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3571-y";"";"";"";"2685-2699"
"AGRIS:US201300910662";"Developing UK farmers' institutional capacity to defend their water rights and effectively manage limited water resources";"";"Developing farmers' institutional capacity to defend their water rights is central to sustaining irrigation farming in the UK. Increasing demand and competition for water and the introduction of new water regulations have led many farmers to re-evaluate the security of their water rights. As a consequence, some have formed water abstractors groups, a trend which is strongest in eastern England, where irrigation is most concentrated and water resources are most stressed.""Collective choice"" theory attempts to explain how institutions evolve to share common resources and what key elements are needed for them to endure over the long term. This paper compares the characteristics of four existing water abstractors groups against those of ""collective choice"" theory. It concludes that it is applicable in the UK context and relevant when addressing a range of emerging water management challenges.The approach taken offers a means of analysing capacity at an institutional level and suggests a way of supporting the development of existing water abstractors groups as well as developing new ones. It is argued that this approach to developing institutional capacity could be used elsewhere where problems between resource availability, environmental protection and the sustainability of agricultural production are evident.

"AGRIS:US201500015775";"effects of fencing on carbon stocks in the degraded alpine grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau";"";"Quantifying the carbon storage of grasslands under different management strategies can help us understand how this ecosystem responds to different land management practices. To assess the C cycle and the importance of soil microbial biomass carbon, we measured the levels of soil organic carbon, biomass carbon (above- and underground) and soil microbial biomass carbon in areas with different grazing intensities and different management strategy (fenced and unfenced) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We also calculated the ratio of soil microbial biomass carbon to soil organic carbon as an indicator of the soil organic matter availability and quality. Results showed that degradation had significant effects on the soil organic carbon, biomass carbon and microbial biomass carbon (P < 0.05). However, fencing only had a significant effect on the non-degraded and moderately degraded grasslands (P < 0.05). We also found that the level of soil microbial biomass carbon was positively correlated with the biomass carbon and soil organic carbon. From our research, we concluded that the level of soil microbial biomass carbon was crucial to the C cycle in the alpine grasslands and that fencing may be an important management strategy for restoring lightly or moderately degraded grassland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.";"Li, Yuanyuan

"AGRIS:US2016217900";"The Effect of Climate Change, CO2 Fertilization, and Crop Production Technology on Crop Yields and Its Economic Implications on Market Outcomes and Welfare Distribution";"";"Many studies have done econometric estimates of how climate alters crop yields and or land rents in an effort to gain information on potential effects of climate change.  However, an important related factor, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and in fact a driver of climate change is ignored.  This means the prior econometric estimates are biased as they infer what will happen under climate change from observations in the recent past, but without consideration of CO2 effects.  Furthermore although CO2 has been varying, it has proceeded at a very linear pace and cannot be disentangled from technological progress using historical crop yield data.  This paper is designed to overcome this issue and estimate the consequences that CO2 has and will have in conjunction with climate change. The paper also partitions yield growth into temporal CO2 and climate change affected components and begins to address an issue of how climate change and its drivers will affect rates of technological progress. Moreover, we also factor in a number of conditions regarding to extreme events. This allows us 1) to estimate the consequences of such factors on yields; 2) to project given forecasts of climate change induced shifts in those factors what the implications are for yield distributions; and 3) carry this into welfare and technological change analyses.First, we use a stochastic production function approach of the type suggested by Just and Pope (1978, 1979) estimated with a three-step feasible generalized least squares approach to estimate the effect of climate change and CO2 fertilization on crop yields. The observational data of crop yields and planted acreage are collected from the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service. State-level climate data used in this study are obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experimental data are obtained from the USDA Agricultural Research Service and SOYFACE, University of Illinois. Next, to investigate the implication of future climate change on crop yield and its variability, we employ our estimated coefficients together with future climate change projected by standard GCMs used in the IPCC (2007) with the IPCC SRES scenario A1B. Finally, to explore the market outcomes and welfare implications of economic units given climate-induced shifts in yields across US regions, we plug in our projected percentage changes of mean crop yields into the agricultural sector model (ASM), a price endogenous, spatial equilibrium mathematical programming of the agricultural sector in the US. Our initial results find that yields of C-3 crops, soybeans, cotton, and wheat, positively respond to the elevated CO2, while yields of C-4 crops, corn and sorghum do not. However, we find that C-4 crops indirectly benefit from elevated CO2 in times and places of drought stress. We find the effect of crop technological progress to mean yields is non-linear with inverted-U shape in all crops, except cotton. Our study also reveals that ignoring the atmospheric CO2 in econometric model of crop yield studies is likely to overestimate the pure effect of climate change on crop yields as CO2 enhances those yields. For climate change impact, the average climate conditions and their variability appear to contribute in a statistically significant way to both average crop yields and their variability. Moreover, generally we find that the effect of CO2 fertilization generally outweighs the effect of climate change on mean crop yields in many regions. In terms of market outcomes and welfare distribution, we find the yield growth under the combined climate change and CO2 effect tends to decrease price in 2050. Planted acreage of all crops in North Plains, except wheat winter, is projected to increase, while it tends to decrease in South Plains, Lake States, Delta States, Southeast, and Mountains for almost all crops. Overall consumers’ surplus is projected to increase, while producers’ surplus is heterogeneously affected across US regions, but in total decreases by about $ 4.72 billion. Overall the total US welfare is increased about $ 2.27 billion compared to the base scenario. There are several clear implications of above findings. For example, 1) returns to agricultural research should be reevaluated in the light of climate change influences as for example aggressive CO2 mitigation will decrease returns; 2) models using econometric methods to predict future crop yields should be aware that ignoring CO2 fertilization may overestimate the real effect of climate change on crop yields; and 3) welfare losses for producers under climate change are likely with consumers gaining.";"Attavanich, Witsanu

"AGRIS:US201600132313";"Whole-Catchment Manipulations of Internal and External Loading Reveal the Sensitivity of a Century-Old Reservoir to Hypoxia";"";"Climate change is predicted to have widespread impacts on freshwater lake and reservoir nutrient budgets by altering both hypolimnetic hypoxia and runoff, which will in turn alter the magnitude of internal and external nutrient loads. To examine the effects of these potential climate scenarios on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) budgets, we conducted a whole-catchment manipulation of hypolimnetic oxygen conditions and external loads to Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR), an old, eutrophic reservoir in a reforested catchment with a history of agricultural land use. Throughout 2 years of monitoring, internal N and P loading during hypoxic conditions dominated the hypolimnetic mass of nutrients in FCR, regardless of changes in external loading. FCR commonly functioned as a net sink of N and P, except during hypoxic conditions, when the reservoir was a net source of ammonium ([Formula: see text]) to downstream. We observed extremely high nitrate–nitrite ([Formula: see text]), soluble reactive P (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) retention rates, indicating that the reservoir served as a sink for greater than 70% of [Formula: see text] inputs and greater than 30% of SRP, TN, and TP inputs, on average. Our study is notable in the length of time since reforestation (>80 years) that a reservoir is still exhibiting high N and P internal loading during hypoxia, potentially as a result of the considerable store of accumulated nutrients in its sediment from historical agricultural runoff. Our whole-catchment manipulations highlight the importance of understanding how multiple aspects of global change, waterbody and catchment characteristics, and land use history will interact to alter nutrient budgets in the future.";"Gerling, Alexandra B.

"AGRIS:US2016201025";"IMPACTS OF LAND RESDISTRIBUTION ON LAND MANAGEMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY IN THE ETHIOPIAN HIGHLANDS";"";"The increasing problem of landlessness in Ethiopia has put pressure on regional governments to redistribute land.  In 1997 and 1998, a major land redistribution was undertaken in the Amhara region, reducing landlessness where implemented.  While the impacts of such redistributions have been hotly debated, little empirical evidence exists concerning the actual impacts of this redistribution.  We find that the recent land redistribution in Amhara has had a positive impact on land productivity, by increasing access to land of farmers who are more interested or able to use purchased inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds.  Our results, however, do not show much effect of the recent land redistribution or expectations of future redistribution on land improvement and management.  Thus, to the extent that investment in land improvement are necessary for conservation purposes, it appears that the policy change to stop redistributions is unlikely to have a substantial impact on reducing land degradation in this region of Ethiopia.";"Pender, John L.

"AGRIS:US201600184642";"Daytime Habitat Selection by Resident Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in Southern Idaho, U.S.A";"";"Energy and other anthropogenic development are increasing throughout the range of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in western North America, and both private and government agencies have expressed concern about indirect and direct effects on Golden Eagles. To facilitate sustainable development and reduce risk to Golden Eagles, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has established guidelines to assist developers in project planning and siting. A major component of environmental impact assessment is documenting Golden Eagle spatial use near a project site before development. Unbiased estimates of habitat selection (spatial use) in and near a proposed project area are possible with location data collected by Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters attached to a sample of Golden Eagles in the area. During spring 2011, we identified occupied Golden Eagle territories within a study area in southern Idaho, and deployed four GPS and Argos tags on resident adult Golden Eagles. We developed seasonal resource selection functions (RSFs) for each monitored Golden Eagle, and estimated seasonal daytime habitat selection by the average Golden Eagle by averaging predictions from four RSFs. The final RSFs estimated that relative probability of selection by Golden Eagles was highest closer to nests and over moderately rugged terrain. Other predictor variables such as brightness (a measure of non-vegetated habitats) and slope were also seasonally important. Model validation indicated the models reliably predicted Golden Eagle use within the study area. This is the first study estimating Golden Eagle habitat selection based on a combination of GPS and nest locations. The process we developed may be used to improve our understanding of Golden Eagle habitat selection and to provide valuable information to help minimize risk to Golden Eagles from different land management practices.";"LeBeau, Chad W.

"AGRIS:US201400123594";"Recognition of climatic effects of land use/land cover change under global warming";"";"Greenhouse gas emissions and land use/land cover change (LUCC) are two human activities notably affecting climate change. Will temperature and precipitation increase significantly during global warming resulting in more pronounced LUCC climatic effects? Considering the interannual forcing of these two factors, the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM4.0) was used in this study to investigate the importance of climatological background to LUCC impacts. Experiments based on the difference in the background climate, the greenhouse gas concentrations in 1850 and in the present age indicate contrary changes in climate sensitivity through estimations of the radiative forcing associated with LUCC, which are 0.54°C/(W/m²) and −0.26°C/(W/m²), respectively. Therefore, the background climate appears to play an important role in the regional impact of LUCC, especially at higher latitudes. In addition, global warming predominantly influences snow-albedo feedback in the mid-latitudes, thus determining the impact of LUCC, whereas the regional difference in precipitation caused by global warming is responsible for the differing climate response to LUCC in the tropics and subtropics.";"Hua, WenJian

"AGRIS:US201301684007";"Response of soil microbial and invertebrate communities to tracked vehicle disturbance in tallgrass prairie";"";"Soil biota drive fundamental ecosystem processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and maintenance of soil structure. They are especially active in grassland ecosystems such as the tallgrass prairie, where much of the net primary productivity is allocated belowground and ultimately processed by heterotrophic soil organisms. Because both soil microbes and soil fauna display perturbation responses that integrate the physical, chemical, and biological changes to their environment, the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities is used widely as an indication of the ecological status of soils. To investigate the effects of military training on tallgrass prairie soil communities, a replicated small-plot study of tracked vehicle disturbance effects was initiated at Fort Riley, Kansas in 2003. This article reports subsequent rates of recovery for soil microbial and invertebrate communities over a range of disturbances encompassing different soil types (silty clay loam and silt loam soils), environmental conditions (wet vs. dry traffic events), traffic intensities (single vs. repeated traffic), and track areas (curve vs. straightaway). Microbial biomass in wet silty clay loam soil treatments and on curve areas in silt loam soil was suppressed for 1-2 years following disturbance but increased to levels greater than undisturbed plots in all treatments by the fourth year. Nematode abundance, family richness, trophic composition, and community structure also displayed maximum disturbance for wet treatments and curve areas. Trophic composition and community structure continued to exhibit disturbance effects throughout the 4-year study period, even after recovery of nematode abundance. Earthworm abundance displayed the most severe reductions (78% across soil types, treatments and areas) immediately following tank traffic but, like microbial biomass, subsequently increased to levels greater than undisturbed plots. Nematode community structure provided a reliable and comprehensive assessment of the status of the soil food web and was an effective bioindicator of ecosystem recovery following traffic disturbance. In addition, given the dominant role of earthworms in ecosystem processes and their extreme sensitivity to tracked vehicle disturbance, it is recommended that this group be included in monitoring protocols for military training land managers.";"Althoff, Peggy S.

"AGRIS:US201600184648";"Migrating Birds' use of Stopover Habitat in The Southwestern United States";"";"In the arid Southwest, migratory birds are known to use riparian stopover habitats; we know less about how migrants use other habitat types during migratory stopover. Using radar data and satellite land-cover data, we determined the habitats with which birds are associated during migration stopover. Bird densities differed significantly by habitat type at all sites in at least one season. In parts of Arizona and New Mexico upland forest supported high densities of migrants, especially in fall. Developed habitat, in areas with little upland forest, also supported high densities of migrants. Scrub/shrub and grassland habitats supported low to intermediate densities, but because these habitat types dominate the Southwestern landscape, they may provide stopover habitat for larger numbers of migratory birds than previously recognized. These results are complicated by continuing challenges related to target identity (i.e., distinguishing among birds, arthropods and bats). Our results suggest that it is too simplistic to (1) consider the arid West as a largely inhospitable landscape in which there are only relatively small oases of habitat that provide the resources needed by all migrants, (2) think of western riparian and upland forests as supporting the majority of migrants in all cases, and (3) consider a particular habitat unimportant for stopover solely on the basis of low densities of migrants.";"Ruth, Janet M.

"AGRIS:US201301882679";"Current distribution of older and deciduous forests as legacies from historical use patterns in a Swedish boreal landscape (1725-2007)";"";"We combine historical maps and satellite derived data to reconstruct the development of a Swedish boreal landscape over the past 300 years. The aim is to understand legacies from past use patterns in present-day forest composition and consequences for conservation objectives from a landscape perspective. We analyze landscape development in cross-tabulation matrixes, building change trajectories. These trajectories are tested in linear models to explain the distribution of present-day landscape composition of coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forests >110 years. Of 49 tested change trajectories, 11 showed a significant association. Associations for mixed and coniferous forests were similar and linked to characteristics such as forest continuity, which characterized the studied landscape. Deciduous older forests did not show any association to forest continuity but were more likely to occur on areas that specifically shifted from forests with grazing in the 1720s to open impediment (likely indicating low tree coverage) in the 1850s. There were large shifts and spatial redistribution in ownerships over time. Use patterns and legacies varied between small- and large-scale ownership categories as well as within small-scale categories. The legacies found in the study indicate a complex origin of heterogeneous landscape elements such as older deciduous forests. Additionally, the origin of the legacies indicates a potential need to diversify conservation management based on the influence of past use patterns. Despite large inconsistencies in historical and contemporary data we argue that this type of analysis could be used to further understand the distribution of landscape elements important for conservation objectives.";"Eriksson, Sofia

In this study, we investigated the larval habitats of mosquitoes and characterized their seasonal and spatial dynamics in arbovirus foci. METHODS: We searched for wet microhabitats, classified in 9 categories, in five land cover classes (agriculture, forest, savannah, barren and village) from June, 2010 to January, 2011. Mosquito immatures were sampled monthly in up to 30 microhabitats of each category per land cover and bred until adult stage for determination. RESULTS: No wet microhabitats were found in the agricultural sites; in the remaining land covers immature stages of 35 mosquito species in 7 genera were sampled from 9 microhabitats (tree holes, fresh fruit husks, decaying fruit husks, puddles, bamboo holes, discarded containers, tires, rock holes and storage containers). The most abundant species was Aedes aegypti formosus, representing 30.2% of the collections, followed by 12 species, representing each more than 1% of the total, among them the arbovirus vectors Ae. vittatus (7.9%), Ae. luteocephalus (5.7%), Ae. taylori (5.0%), and Ae. furcifer (1.3%). Aedes aegypti, Cx. nebulosus, Cx. perfuscus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Er. chrysogster and Ae. vittatus were the only common species collected from all land covers. Aedes furcifer and Ae. taylori were collected in fresh fruit husks and tree holes. Species richness and dominance varied significantly in land covers and microhabitats. Positive associations were found mainly between Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus. A high proportion of potential enzootic vectors that are not anthropophilic were found in the larval mosquito fauna. CONCLUSIONS: In southeastern Senegal, Ae. furcifer and Ae. taylori larvae showed a more limited distribution among both land cover and microhabitat types than the other common species. Uniquely among vector species, Ae. aegypti formosus larvae occurred at the highest frequency in villages. Finally, a high proportion of the potential non-anthropophilic vectors were represented in the larval mosquito fauna, suggesting the existence of unidentified sylvatic arbovirus cycles in southeastern Senegal.";"Diallo, Diawo

Groundwater pollution is a major issue, because it is susceptible to contamination from land use and other anthropogenic impacts. A study was carried out to build a vulnerability map for the Ordos Plateau using the DRASTIC model in a GIS environment. The map was designed to show the areas of the highest potential for groundwater pollution based on hydrogeological conditions. Seven environmental parameters, such as depth to water table, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone media, and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, were incorporated into the DRASTIC model and GIS was used to create a groundwater vulnerability map by overlaying the available data. The results of this study show that 24.8 % of the study area has high pollution potential, 24.2 % has moderate pollution potential, 19.7 % has low pollution potential, and the remaining 31.3 % of the area has no risk of groundwater pollution. The regional distribution of nitrate is well correlated with the DRASTIC vulnerability index. In contrast to this, although the DRASTIC model indicated that the western part had no risk, nitrate concentrations were higher in some of these areas. In particular, higher nitrate concentrations were recorded along river valleys and around lakes, such as the Mulin River valley. This is mainly caused by the intensive agricultural development and favorable conditions for recharge along river valleys.";"Yin, Lihe

This paper argues that prior appropriation creates sufficient certainty to allow for economic development and facilitate water markets, yet is flexible enough to adapt to changing priorities and water supplies. Because it possesses both flexibility and certainty, it is a strong enough framework for the Western United States to weather the possible effects of climate change on water supply.";"Schutz, Jonathan R.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"climate change;water rights";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400169351";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2012.726544";"";"";"";"700-707"

It is important to understand farmers' forest ownership objectives as this will enhance economic analysis in general, but also to formulate more effective policies that take into account the range of motivational profiles of landowners. Using principal component analysis, three core motivations for forest ownership are identified representing economic, lifestyle and multifunctional benefits. Using a binary logistic regression model these ownership objectives were found to have a significant impact on farmers' forest management. For instance, farmers with relatively stronger economic motivations for forest ownership were found to be much more likely to harvest thinnings whereas the opposite was true of those with more lifestyle orientated objectives. In order to tailor policy at groups with different forest ownership objectives it will be important to be able to identify them through more easily observable owner and property characteristics. This study through multivariate regression analysis found factors such as age of the farm operator, land quality, system of farming, off farm employment and environmental attitudes were related to farm forest owners' ownership objectives. The study concludes that a better understanding of the heterogeneity in farmers' forest ownership objectives will enable policymakers to tailor incentives that more closely align with the diverse motivational profiles of different groups of landholders.";"Howley, Peter";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"farming systems;landowners";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"IRL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500015599";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.03.013";"";"";"";"105-112"

Organic matter content of soil is an essential component for fertility and productivity in both, natural and human-induced ecosystems. Despite its importance to soil quality, soil organic carbon has been little studied in these rangelands. The main goal of this study is to assess the amounts and characteristics of soil organic matter in grazed open woodlands of SW Iberia as influenced by vegetation cover and land management. Soil properties were analysed from 22 environmental units selected from 10 farms distributed throughout the region of Extremadura being representative of different rangeland types: dehesas (wooded rangelands), scrublands of Retama sphaerocarpa and treeless grasslands. Some of the soil samples were used for a chemical fractioning of soil carbon. Farmer interviews were conducted in order to quantify livestock densities and stocking rates and to assess land management. Results showed that soils are generally shallow, acidic, with low soil organic carbon contents and poor in nutrients. Areas with higher soil carbon stocks corresponded to units encroached by Retama sphaerocarpa shrubs and dehesas with 49.2T·ha⁻¹ and 46.0T·ha⁻¹, respectively, particularly those developed on schist. Soil organic carbon concentrated mainly in the top 5cm soil layer, displaying large variability (mean: 2.30%). SOC was relatively high beneath the tree canopy (mean: 3.35%) and less concentrated and reduced in variability with depth. Regardless of the variation of total amount of carbon among cover types, the proportion of each carbon fraction from the total carbon was kept relatively constant whatever the cover type. A multivariate analysis performed and other results suggest that land mismanagement and excessive stocking rates could be related with the appearance of bare soil areas, therefore negatively affecting soil organic matter by removing the sensitive topsoil materials through water erosion.";"Pulido-Fernández, Manuel

"AGRIS:US201500015595";"Environmental drivers and spatial dependency in wildfire ignition patterns of northwestern Patagonia";"";"Fire management requires an understanding of the spatial characteristics of fire ignition patterns and how anthropogenic and natural factors influence ignition patterns across space. In this study we take advantage of a recent fire ignition database (855 points) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the spatial pattern of fire ignitions in the western area of Neuquén province (57,649 km²), Argentina, for the 1992–2008 period. The objectives of our study were to better understand the spatial pattern and the environmental drivers of the fire ignitions, with the ultimate aim of supporting fire management. We conducted our analyses on three different levels: statistical “habitat” modelling of fire ignition (natural, anthropogenic, and all causes) based on an information theoretic approach to test several competing hypotheses on environmental drivers (i.e. topographic, climatic, anthropogenic, land cover, and their combinations); spatial point pattern analysis to quantify additional spatial autocorrelation in the ignition patterns; and quantification of potential spatial associations between fires of different causes relative to towns using a novel implementation of the independence null model. Anthropogenic fire ignitions were best predicted by the most complex habitat model including all groups of variables, whereas natural ignitions were best predicted by topographic, climatic and land-cover variables. The spatial pattern of all ignitions showed considerable clustering at intermediate distances (<40 km) not captured by the probability of fire ignitions predicted by the habitat model. There was a strong (linear) and highly significant increase in the density of fire ignitions with decreasing distance to towns (<5 km), but fire ignitions of natural and anthropogenic causes were statistically independent. A two-dimensional habitat model that quantifies differences between ignition probabilities of natural and anthropogenic causes allows fire managers to delineate target areas for consideration of major preventive treatments, strategic placement of fuel treatments, and forecasting of fire ignition. The techniques presented here can be widely applied to situations where a spatial point pattern is jointly influenced by extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic point interactions.";"Mundo, Ignacio A.

Both study areas are located in industrialized regions of the country, where atmospheric pollution is a problem and irrigation of food crops is mostly practiced on the use of wastewater/contaminated water. For the purpose of this study, MFCs samples were collected and assessed for HMs (Cr, Ni, Cd, Pb, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Fe) by using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Concentration of HMs such as Pb and Cd exceeded the Food and Agriculture/World Health Organization's recommended limits in all MFCs, while Cr in most of the vegetables of the Sialkot and Gujranwala districts also exceeded that limit. The health risk index was >1 in Triticum aestivum for Pb and Cd intake in the Sialkot district and only Pb in the Gujranwala district. Therefore, this study suggests pretreatment of wastewater and its utilization for lawns and green belts irrigation, rather than for food crops. This study also suggests a regular monitoring of HMs in the irrigation water, subsequent soil, air, and MFCs in order to prevent or reduce health hazards.";"Khan, Muhammad Usman

Deformation is measured at specific points in a radar image called persistent scatterers (PS), which are characterized by long-term constant backscattering properties (high coherence) of the radar signal. Reliable PSI processing requires a stack of 15–50 SAR images and more, and processing is time-consuming (computational costs) and expensive (referring to both, costs for the SAR data and labor costs). Previous research for PS assessment used already acquired SAR data. This paper presents two new methods for predicting PS prior to the radar recording of the area of interest using freely available or low-cost land cover data, topographical maps and OpenStreetMap data. In the procedure, the distance between the assessed PS is calculated and classified regarding to the applicability for PSI processing. Additionally, the dispersion of the assessed PS within the site is analyzed. The results of the two assessment methods are validated using data of real PSI processing. Here, we show that the developed PS assessment techniques are fast and reliable tools to test the spatial applicability of PSI.";"Plank, Simon

"AGRIS:US201301921247";"Spatial fields' dispersion as a farmer strategy to reduce agro-climatic risk at the household level in pearl millet-based systems in the Sahel: A modeling perspective";"";"The rainfall pattern in the Sahel is very erratic with a high spatial variability. We tested the often reported hypothesis that the dispersion of farmers' fields around the village territory helps mitigate agro-climatic risk by increasing yield stability from year to year. We also wished to evaluate whether this strategy had an effect on the yield disparity among households in a village. Based on a network of approximately 60 rain gauges spread over 500km² in the Fakara region (Southwest Niger), daily rainfall was interpolated at 300m×300m resolution over a 12-year period. This data was used to compute, by means of the APSIM crop simulation model, millet biomass and grain yields at the pixel scale. Simulated yields were combined with the land tenure map of the Banizoumbou village in a GIS to assess millet yield at field and household level. Agro-climatic risk analysis was performed using linear regression between a spatial dispersion index of household fields and the inter-annual (instability) and inter-household (disparity) millet yield variability of 107 households in the village territory. We find that the spatial variability of annual rainfall induces an even higher spatial variability of millet production at pixel, field and household levels. The dispersion of farm fields reduces moderately but significantly the disparity of millet yield between households each year and increases the inter-annual yield stability of a given household. The less the household fields are scattered, the more the presence of a fertility gradient around the village enhances the inter-annual stability but also the disparity between households. Our results provide evidence that field dispersion is an effective strategy to mitigate agro-climatic risk, as claimed by farmers in the Sahelian Niger. Although the results should be confirmed by further research on longer term rainfall spatial data, it is clearly advisable that any land reforms in the area take into account the benefits of field dispersion to mitigate climatic risk.";"Akponikpè, P.B.I.

Focus group participants consisted of landowners who had responded to an earlier mail-back survey (2010) on forest carbon offsets. Two focus groups were held per state with an average of eight participants each (49 total). While landowner participant types varied, overall convergence was reached on several key issues. In general, discussion results found that the current payment amounts offered for carbon credits are not likely, on their own, to encourage participation in carbon markets. Landowners are most interested in other benefits they can attain through carbon management (e.g., improved stand species mix, wildlife, and trails). Interestingly, landowner perceptions about the condition of their own forest land were most indicative of prospective interest in carbon management. Landowners who felt that their forest was currently in poor condition, or did not meet their forest ownership objectives, were most interested in participating. While the initial survey sought landowner opinions about carbon markets, a majority of focus group participants expressed interest in general carbon management as a means to achieve reduced property taxes.";"Miller, Kristell A.

"AGRIS:US201500014755";"FUZZY RULE BASE APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING A SOIL PROTECTION INDEX MAP: A CASE STUDY in the UPPER AWASH BASIN, ETHIOPIAN HIGHLANDS";"";"Land use practices and vegetation cover distribution are considered to be the most important dynamic factors that influence the land degradation or the soil erosion of a region. In this study, a Soil Protection Index (SPI) is defined as a function of land use practices and intensity of vegetation cover. This index is used to map the relative degree of protection of topsoil from being eroded by external effects such as rainfall and overland flow. A fuzzy rule‐based model integrated within ArcGIS® has been set‐up and tested with the aim to develop SPI maps. The amount of vegetation cover distribution, that is, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as proxy parameter and Land Use–Land Cover map are chosen as fuzzy input parameters for the SPI as the desired system output. The approach was tested in the Upper Awash basin in Ethiopia. The output SPI map was qualitatively evaluated against the expert‐defined land degradation risk class, and it was found that locations that are mapped with ‘low and very low’ SPI classes at different time periods of the year have a high potential land degradation risk. Furthermore, socio‐economic data (‘population and livestock densities’) and environmental parameters (‘altitude and soil erodibility’) for the region are used to correlate with the SPI map as an indirect method of evaluation. It is found that population and livestock density explained 68 per cent of the spatial distribution pattern of predicted SPI and an adjusted R‐squared value of 0·681 (p < 0·05) was obtained. It was also found that the SPI distribution over the region for two different time periods, that is, January and July 2001, correlated positively (R² = 0·41 and R² = 0·51) with the soil erodibility of the region. The transferability and applicability of the model for different environmental settings or landscapes were tested by mapping the SPI of Italy. This SPI map of Italy was compared with the soil erosion map of Italy produced by the European Soil Bureau. It can be concluded that the SPI map reflects the potential land degradation risk distribution of the case‐study region. Results show that a fuzzy rule‐based model can provide useful preliminary information even without detailed and precise data information for developing appropriate strategies for land degradation assessment vital for sustainable land use management.

"AGRIS:US201500217697";"Reducing contention amongst organisations dealing with commercially valuable but invasive plants: The case of buffel grass";"";"Policy development can fail when organisations tasked with managing contentious species for different outcomes are at odds. Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L. syn. Pennisetum ciliare L. Link) has been planted worldwide and is a valuable pasture grass but it is contentious because of its environmental impacts. Due to this contention, government agencies in Australia have been reticent about developing policy for sustainable management of buffel grass. We developed a workshop procedure in which representatives of government and non-government organisations with an interest in buffel grass could discuss impacts and management of the plant in a non-adversarial setting. Orientation of the organisations ranged from a strong pastoral production focus to a strong conservation management focus. Workshops were run in four contrasting regions, which differed in climate, predominant land use and pastoral dependence on buffel grass. The results showed that, perhaps unexpectedly, diverse organisational stakeholders had similar perceptions of the positive and negative impacts of buffel grass on production and conservation, despite differences in their orientation, and there were differences amongst regions. Objectives for managing buffel grass on conservation reserves and on grazing lands of low conservation value were also generally agreed, and the tools appropriate to the objectives were largely uncontroversial although they varied regionally. The main contention was in regard to management objectives for grazing land of high conservation value. We suggest that there is sufficient common ground amongst organisations to initiate policy development for sustainable management of buffel grass in Australia, provided the process is responsive to the needs of stakeholders and to regional differences in environmental, social and economic potential. We also suggest that this process can be a model for reducing contention over other invasive but commercially valuable species.";"Friedel, M.H.

Owing to the paucity of appropriate technology and financial resources, the prioritization of watersheds has become an inevitable process for effective planning and management of natural resources. Lidder catchment constitutes a segment of the western Himalayas with an area of 1,159.38 km². The study is based on integrated analysis of remote sensing, geographic information system, field study, and socioeconomic data. Multicriteria evaluation of geophysical, land-use and land-cover (LULC) change, and socioeconomic indicators is carried out to prioritize watersheds for natural resource conservation and management. Knowledge-based weights and ranks are normalized, and weighted linear combination technique is adopted to determine final priority value. The watersheds are classified into four priority zones (very high priority, high priority, medium priority, and low priority) on the basis of quartiles of the priority value, thus indicating their ecological status in terms of degradation caused by anthropogenic disturbances. The correlation between priority ranks of individual indicators and integrated indicators is drawn. The results reveal that socioeconomic indicators are the most important drivers of LULC change and environmental degradation in the catchment. Moreover, the magnitude and intensity of anthropogenic impact is not uniform in different watersheds of Lidder catchment. Therefore, any conservation and management strategy must be formulated on the basis of watershed prioritization.";"Malik, Mohammad Imran

"AGRIS:US201400147950";"China's crop productivity and soil carbon storage as influenced by multifactor global change";"";"Much concern has been raised about how multifactor global change has affected food security and carbon sequestration capacity in China. By using a process‐based ecosystem model, the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), in conjunction with the newly developed driving information on multiple environmental factors (climate, atmospheric CO₂, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition, and land cover/land use change), we quantified spatial and temporal patterns of net primary production (NPP) and soil organic carbon storage (SOC) across China's croplands during 1980–2005 and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Simulated results showed that both crop NPP and SOC increased from 1980 to 2005, and the highest annual NPP occurred in the Southeast (SE) region (0.32 Pg C yr⁻¹, 35.4% of the total NPP) whereas the largest annual SOC (2.29 Pg C yr⁻¹, 35.4% of the total SOC) was found in the Northeast (NE) region. Land management practices, particularly nitrogen fertilizer application, appear to be the most important factor in stimulating increase in NPP and SOC. However, tropospheric ozone pollution and climate change led to NPP reduction and SOC loss. Our results suggest that China's crop productivity and soil carbon storage could be enhanced through minimizing tropospheric ozone pollution and improving nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency.";"Ren, Wei

This study investigates how voluntary geographic information systems (VGI) can be used to identify areas important for anthropocentric and biocentric values across a spatial planning region to inform place-based conservation planning. The study also identified anthropocentric–biocentric areas where both anthropocentric and biocentric values were assigned to the same location. Differences in local knowledge and number of visits were observed between value orientations. Differences in distance to marine reserves, conservation land, and residential areas were also observed. The study highlighted how VGI can be a useful tool to encourage awareness and engagement initial stages of the planning cycle while providing spatial data to identify place-based conservation opportunities across diverse conservation values.";"Jarvis, Rebecca M.

Collaborative planning is seen as promising approach to achieve sustainable use of the remaining agricultural areas.Cognitive empathy between local stakeholders in periurban areas of the Peruvian Andesâmore powerful urbanites and less influential smallholdersâis a helpful ingredient for collaboration at eye level: but are urbanites empathetic toward smallholders and their perceptions of urban expansion? Using the example of the periurban Shullcas Valley near the city of Huancayo Metropolitano, this empirical study reveals: (1) the city dwellersâ motives to live on the new urban periphery, (2) how urbanites assess the impacts of urban growth on smallholders, and (3) to what degree these assessments conform to the farmersâ perceptions.The results show that urbanites are mostly empathetic toward smallholders: they clearly perceive advantages and disadvantages, especially the irretrievable loss of agricultural land on the valley floor. However, they show little awareness of the smallholdersâ land tenure situation and their dependency on the lease of additional farmland. Consequently they largely overestimate the advantages of rising land prices driven by an increasing demand for lots. The results point to the need for including periurban smallholder farmers into urban planning and call for the creation and/or valorization of cognitive empathy in a preparatory process to collaborative planningâespecially in the new urban peripheries of the Central Andes.";"Haller, Andreas";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"urbanization;urban planning;farmers;land tenure";"Urban Tenure";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"PER";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600198120";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.015";"";"";"";""

To combat salinisation a community-based approach has been adopted. This paper reviews the nature and effectiveness of this approach, describing its rationale, strengths and weaknesses. The community-based approach is shown to have been highly successful in raising awareness and providing education about the problem of dryland salinity in Australia, and has encouraged group participation in managing the problem. The approach has allowed some internalisation of the externalities associated with dryland salinity, with peer group and community pressure helping to address some salinity problems. However, the approach has not greatly lessened the threat of salinisation. Community and regional groups continue to receive the bulk of salinity management funding yet it is funding for development of new innovations, technologies and policies that is also critical to combating salinity. A conclusion is that there may have been an over-investment in the community-based approach and under-investment in the development of skills and research infrastructure required to develop innovative solutions to lessen the cost of salinity.";"Kingwell, Ross

Tourism was analysed in Camargue (France), a wetland area of high biodiversity value, via semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders. Three types of stakeholders were interviewed: protected area managers, livestock farmers and public institutions. This was done to examine whether they manage the land to enable tourism and/or maintain or restore the ecological state of ecosystems. It was found that tourism sustainability is taken into account by protected area managers and livestock farmers. Management measures are partly taken to facilitate tourism and partly to make it compatible with the stakeholders' main activity as well as with the required ecological state of the ecosystem. Conversely, public institutions that are in charge of tourism do not consider damage caused to ecosystems, which has led to the unsustainable use of beaches. We argue that the ecosystem services concept is useful for conservation provided that both sides of land management are taken into account: the use of ecosystem services and the maintenance or restoration of ecosystems. The sustainability of the use of ecosystem services should be central in future research and implementation.";"Beltrame, Coralie

Using stakeholders' perceptions, this study evaluates the existing restricted RS wood trade and provides insights for developing a sustainable trade policy by involving private landowners as a strategy for improving its conservation in the wild. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats–Analytic Hierarchy Process framework was used to analyze perceptions of four stakeholder groups (Administrators, Landowners, Traders, and Knowledgeable Sources). There was a consensus among the stakeholders that the challenges for sustainable RS wood trade outweigh the positive features. High price of RS wood and availability of niche international market were seen as the most important Strengths. Long gestation crop (+40years), lack of Incentives, small land holdings, administrative complexities, and competition from commercial agriculture crops were identified as the main challenges. Results indicate that before proceeding with an imminent policy change, it is important to address the major challenges. These results provide a basis to prioritize and address the existing challenges and reinforce the positive features of RS wood trade. A sustainable wood trade policy formulated by incorporating stakeholders' perceptions may help in improving the conservation status of this endangered species.";"Kukrety, Sidhanand

We investigated the risks of these adverse landscape conditions on a small headwater stream by digitizing land cover at a fine scale and relating it to benthic invertebrate diversity and metal concentrations at 13 sites in the system. The combination of historically barren landscape and modern impervious surfaces such as asphalt, roofs, and hard gravel was associated with decreased benthic invertebrate community diversity at all four watershed spatial scales measured. The same combination of barren bedrock and impervious surface was associated with increased levels of potentially toxic Ni, whereas increased Cu was most strongly associated with bedrock alone. Our results highlight previously undocumented relationships in this historically impacted area between unrestored landscapes, modern impervious surfaces, and their potential risks to aquatic life.

However, they could display relevant plant diversity, and contribute to urban ecosystem services. This study combined surveys at 100 m², and at patch level, with the aim to investigate how patch size, stand and urbanization, affected the structure of plant communities in thirty woodland fragments (0.1–2 ha), spontaneously developing in the small, historical city of Padova (Northern Italy). Trees, shrubs and other perennial species dominated the plant communities in these patches. Alien species were common, in both the understory (freq. = 97 %, mean richness = 4.33) and tree layer (freq. = 90 %, mean richness = 1.50). Species typical of native communities also occurred. Understory communities were associated with ancient forest, nitrophilous, and ruderal species; highlighting an overall heterogeneity. Road and railway density was moderately correlated with total species richness in the understory, whereas, urbanity (i.e. the concentration of built environment excluding road and railway density), and tree density were not. Furthermore, alien tree dominance negatively influenced total and native tree layer species richness and, moderately positively, native understory species richness. These results highlight that spontaneous novel woodland patches, even if they are minor fragments in small historical cities, maintain diverse green infrastructures that may supply an array of urban ecosystem services, when adequately recognised by city plans.";"Sitzia, Tommaso

In particular, urban regeneration entails programmes of urban transformation that involve the rehabilitation of existing parts of a city, re-use previously built-up area and abandoned buildings, and redevelop blighted urban spaces to increase urban sustainability. Few existing studies have evaluated the real environmental outcomes and effectiveness of regeneration programmes in terms of physical variables such as newly provided green spaces, access to public transportation, climate change or seismic-risk reduction.This paper proposes a method for spatially quantifying the benefits of regenerating areas with reference to environmental and urban factors, such as reduction of seismic risk, increase in accessibility and diversity of land use. Each aspect is evaluated by spatial indicators, calculated at different geographical units that steadily increase in size, in order to understand the effects of a single regeneration area and of a number of concurrent areas. The work focuses on the municipality of Catania (Italy), a high-density urban context, with a general lack of green spaces, and high levels seismic risk exposure.Results show that positive benefits can be extended from regeneration areas to contiguous relevant portions of the city, and that even a limited number of regeneration areas can produce relevant benefits. These benefits rely on the combination of characteristics of regeneration areas and urban environments in which they are located, such as population density, presence/accessibility of urban services, and land-use diversity.";"La Rosa, Daniele

To materialize the effects of spatial pattern of green cover on ULST, Landsat ETM + image data on May 5, 2002 was acquired to be processed for ULST estimation and to generate Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classes. Given to five percent of total available cells with a randomized distribution across the built-up areas, the linkage between ULST and composition, configuration and structure of green cover class was quantified. Five patch level landscape metrics including nearest distance (ND), patch area (AREA), perimeter to area (PARA), shape index (SHAPE) and core area index (CAI) were chosen and applied as explaining variables in statistical analyses due to their potential effects on ULST. Results of the present study have revealed that all the landscape metrics values of the green cover class were significantly correlated to their nearest ULST sample points, amongst which a stronger linkage was observed between ND (r = 0.611, p <0.05) and ULST compared to others. Stepwise generalized additive modeling method-based multiple linear regression model was then fitted to dataset and resulted in developing the model (r² = 0.41, p <0.05), explaining the relationship between spatial pattern of green cover and ULST. Finally, we concluded that the present study could provide additional level of knowledge through which urban planners can optimize composition, configuration and structure of green cover patches to mitigate the adverse impacts of LST phenomenon especially where urbanization is still ongoing.";"Asgarian, Ali

This study was conducted in Baltimore County, Maryland, to quantify the differences in characteristics of soil in a residential neighborhood and adjacent forest patch sampling at a fine scale. The first objective was to compare soil characteristics in a residential neighborhood among ecotope types of forest, lawn, and planting beds that were underlain by the same parent material and thus only differed in plant cover. Another objective was to examine differences in soil properties of lawn soils that differed in age by 10 years. The final objective was to quantify the variation of these residential and forest soils. Composite soil samples from the surface to a depth of 5 cm were taken from planting beds and lawns from 50 residences and an adjacent forest patch. Results showed that the forest soil had 30 % more SOM and was more acidic than lawn soil. Conversely, Mg, P, K, and Ca were 47 to 67 % lower in forest compared to lawn soils even though both soils developed from similar parent materials. For the residential lawns, the older development had significantly higher concentration of soil P. There was also a difference between front and back lawns where front lawns had 26 and 10 % higher concentrations of Ca and Mg, respectively, and a higher pH than the back lawns. Finally, the variation of soil characteristics of all areas sampled, from lowest to highest was pH < SOM < K < Mg < Ca < P. Results of this study suggest that anthropogenic factors appear to overwhelm natural soil forming factors in suburban residential areas in the Baltimore metropolitan area and these differences appear to increase with time.";"Yesilonis, Ian D.

We tested this hypothesis for aquatic insect communities in tank-forming bromeliads in forested and non-forested habitats in Costa Rica. Bromeliad tanks hold much of the standing water in this region and therefore provide an important resource for insects with aquatic larval stages. We quantified the relative importance of land-use type and the bromeliad-specific ââlocalââ environment on the insect community, and also the effect of land-use type on this local environment. Insect species responded to both land-use type and the local environment, with these variables explaining a total of 36%% of species densities. The local environment independently explained 19%% of insect densities, while land-use type explained 17%%, mainly through its modification of the local environment. Local environmental conditions were strongly correlated to land-use type (rÂ² == 0.64), with non-forest habitat having a higher average temperature, a greater variation in temperature, and a lower density of bromeliads. Our results indicate that the land-use type in which bromeliads occur influences the relative densities of insects by altering the local environment of bromeliads. Therefore, maintaining bromeliads under land-use conversion will not necessarily maintain the bromeliad insect community of the original forested habitat.Nomenclature: Croat, 1978; Rzedowski, 1978.";"Ngai, Jacqueline T.

Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) and miscanthus are potential biomass feedstocks; however, supply will rely on farmer willingness to grow these crops. Despite attractive crop establishment grants for dedicated energy crops (DECs) in the UK, uptake remains low. Drawing on results from an on-farm survey with 244 English arable farmers, 81.6% (87.7%) of farmers would not consider growing miscanthus (SRC), while respectively, 17.2% (11.9%) would consider growing and 1.2% (0.4%) were currently growing these crops. Farmer age, location, land ownership, farm type, farm size and farmer education level were not significant factors in determining acceptance of DECs. The main reasons cited for not growing DECs were impacts on land quality, lack of appropriate machinery, commitment of land for a long period of time, time to financial return and profitability. Reasons cited for willingness to grow DECs included land quality, ease of crop management, commitment of land for a long period of time, and profitability. Farmers cited a range of ‘moral’ (e.g. should not be using land for energy crops when there is a shortage of food), land quality, knowledge, profit and current farming practice comments as reasons for not growing DECs, while those willing to grow DECs cited interest in renewable energy, willingness to consider new crops, and low labour needs as rationale for their interest. Farm business objectives indicated that maximising profit and quality of life were most frequently cited as very important objectives. Previous research in the UK indicates that farmers in arable areas are unlikely to convert large areas of land to DECs, even where these farmers have an interest and willingness to grow them. Assuming that those farmers interested in growing DECs converted 9.29% (average percentage of arable land set-aside between 1996 and 2005) of their utilised agricultural area to these crops, 50,700ha and 89,900ha of SRC and miscanthus would, respectively, be grown on English arable farms.

"AGRIS:US201600001868";"formalization fix? Land titling, land concessions and the politics of spatial transparency in Cambodia";"";"In a widely read paper, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, World Bank and others propose systematic property rights formalization as a key step in addressing the problems of irresponsible agricultural investment. This paper examines the case of Cambodia, one of a number of countries where systematic land titling and large-scale land concessions have proceeded in parallel in recent years. Cambodia's experience exemplifies the challenges of the ‘formalization fix’ – the proposition that property formalization constitutes a preferable front-line defense against land grabbing – and highlights formalization's uneven geography as an issue that has yet to generate adequate discussion internationally. Three dimensions of Cambodia's less-than-successful formalization fix efforts stand out: (1) the spatial separation of systematic land titling and agribusiness concessions that emerged during the 2000s and has only recently begun to be addressed; (2) the deployment of property formalization as a means of land grabbing, especially when applied selectively and unevenly; and (3) the political arena of efforts to legitimize ‘state land’. The paper questions the formalization fix as a policy solution, and argues for both greater spatial transparency in property formalization efforts throughout the global South, and greater attention to the problem of unmapped state land in general.";"Dwyer, Michael B.";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"property rights;land grabbing";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"KHM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001868";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2014.994510";"";"";"";"903-928"
"AGRIS:US201600199651";"Assessing the influence of forest ownership type and location on roundwood utilization at the stump and top in a region with small-diameter markets";"";"Research conducted in a variety of hardwood regions across the United States has indicated that utilization of small-diameter roundwood is hindered by a lack of markets. Efficient removal of such material could enable silvicultural practices to improve stand conditions and economic return for landowners. However, evidence from other studies has suggested that markets alone may not be enough to encourage small-diameter utilization, and that management decisions are important as well. This study sought to compare roundwood utilization at the stump and top for different ownership categories and locations in north-central Wisconsin, a region with active pulpwood and other low-grade markets and different types of forest ownerships. Thirty-six recently harvested sites were visited in 2007 and 2008 across three ownership types (managed county-owned forests, private land timber sales involving a professional forester, and private land timber sales without involvement of a professional forester) and two locations (county groupings) with different markets. Results of a linear mixed model indicated that ownership type was a significant predictor variable for the utilization measures studied (stump diameter, top diameter, and stump height). Location effects were significant for stump diameter and stump height. Sales on unmanaged private forests exhibited the largest stump and top diameters and highest stump heights, regardless of location. Overall, this study suggests that both management practices and markets influence harvest site small-diameter utilization.";"Bumgardner, Matthew

An introduction to land grabbing and political reactions ‘from below’";"";"Political reactions ‘from below’ to global land grabbing have been vastly more varied and complex than is usually assumed. This essay introduces a collection of ground-breaking studies that discuss responses that range from various types of organized and everyday resistance to demands for incorporation or for better terms of incorporation into land deals. Initiatives ‘from below’ in response to land deals have involved local and transnational alliances and the use of legal and extra-legal methods, and have brought victories and defeats. The relevance of political reactions to land grabbing is discussed in light of theories of social movements and critical agrarian studies. Future research on reactions ‘from below’ to land grabbing must include greater attention to gender and generational differences in both impacts and political agency.";"Hall, Ruth

NO₂, a traffic pollution marker, and benzene, an industrial pollution indicator, stand out among the types of air pollution linked to these effects. The aim of this work is to show the methodology used to assign exposure levels for both pollutants and preliminary reports in the INMA (Environment and Childhood) Asturias cohort in Spain. This cohort consists of 494 pregnant women and their children, who have been recruited and followed since 2004. Air pollution levels were measured at 67 points by means of passive samplers. The mean NO₂ measured value was 21.2 μg m⁻³ (range 3.5 μg m⁻³ to 44.5 μg m⁻³), and the mean benzene value was 2.72 μg m⁻³ (range 0.18 μg m⁻³ to 9.17 μg m⁻³) at urban sampling points and 0.64 μg m⁻³ (range 0.04 μg m⁻³ to 2.62 μg m⁻³) in rural locations. The Pearson correlation coefficient among pollutants was 0.42. Land Use Regression models were built to predict exposure at the homes of pregnant women. Altitude, road distances and land use were part of the models. The percent of explained variance was 52% for NO₂ and 73% for benzene in the urban zones. No residual autocorrelation was found. Predictions were corrected based on the Air Quality Network of the Principality of Asturias taking into account pregnancy seasonality. Exposure indicators were determined for each term and for the entire pregnancy for each woman. Values for urban locations were higher than those for rural and benzene estimations for 5% of the cohort women were above the European Union annual limit value. Air pollution exposure for the INMA-Asturias cohort clearly depends on the place of residence. In particular, benzene concentrations are remarkably high if an individual lives in an urban and industrial area, which is an issue of management intervention and regulatory concern. Exposure assessment for different pollutants will allow us to evaluate potential adverse effects in foetal and infant health caused by air pollution.";"Fernández-Somoano, Ana

To accomplish this, we contrasted job and income data collected from 1996, before the Programs inception, with similar data from 1998 and 1999. We also calculated a Human Development Index (Índice de Desenvolvimento Humano--HDI) and a Life Condition Index (Índice de Condição de Vida - ICV) for the two communities for the period between July 1998 and June 1999. Primary data were gathered by a survey applied to the sample communities. The results showed that the Reform had its strongest positive impact on producer incomes and employment in the community economically based on irrigated agriculture, Barra I. The earnings of an average farmer farming irrigated crops in Barra I were 0.571 of a Brazilian minimum wage, above the State of Cearás poverty line of 0.487 minimum wage, and above the incomes of dry-land crop farmers in Cacimba Nova, the other studied community (0.085 minimum wage). The values of the two calculated indices were below the United Nations Development Programs HID values for a country or region considered to be at a reasonable level of development (0.8). We also found that the producers from these communities produced reasonably well and made good use of technical and financial support, even though they had a low level of education.

Este estudo teve como objetivo detectar os impactos socioeconômicos do Programa Reforma Agrária Solidária sobre as comunidades beneficiadas. Para isso, calculou-se a geração de emprego e renda nas situações anterior (ano de 1996) e atual, ou seja, posterior à implantação do Programa, além dos Índices de Desenvolvimento Humano (IDHI) e de Condições de Vida (ICVI), no período atual. Foram utilizados dados de natureza primária obtidos através de pesquisa direta, realizada nas comunidades selecionadas. Os resultados encontrados na pesquisa, quanto à geração de emprego e renda, dão conta de que os impactos econômicos proporcionados pelo Programa se fizeram sentir principalmente na comunidade Barra I, onde se pratica agricultura irrigada, através do incremento do nível de emprego da mão-de-obra e da renda dos produtores. Observou-se que, mesmo com um nível educacional bastante baixo, é possível, com uma boa assistência técnica e apoio financeiro, produzir razoavelmente bem. Constatou-se a superioridade do nível de renda per capita média mensal dos produtores da área irrigada (0,571 salário mínimo) em relação à renda obtida pelos produtores da área de sequeiro (0,085 salário mínimo). Os produtores da área irrigada encontram-se acima do patamar de renda que define a ""linha de pobreza"" do Estado do Ceará (0,487 s.m.). Por sua vez, os produtores da área de sequeiro encontram-se bem abaixo desse patamar de renda. Concluindo, tem-se que os valores dos índices obtidos são considerados baixos quando comparados com os estabelecidos pela ONU para que um país, ou região, alcance um bom nível de desenvolvimento (maior que 0,800).";"Medeiros, Elano José Rocha de(Universidade Federal do Ceará)

We conducted a questionnaire survey and semi‐formal interviews with farmers throughout KwaZulu‐Natal, examining farmers’ livestock husbandry, land‐use changes and perspectives towards jackals as a perceived threat to livestock. Many (75%) respondents acknowledged expanding agricultural activities on their farmlands since the onset of their farming careers. However, the perception was that these changes placed little pressure on mesopredators as farmers reported frequent daily (25%) and weekly (31%) sightings of jackal, and regular predation on livestock (72%). Some landowners (31%) reported between one and five livestock losses annually and suggest that mitigation strategies to prevent livestock losses are in place. Farmers suggested the increasing intensity in agricultural practices provided a greater food source for jackals allowing them to thrive in expanding agricultural conditions and, in some circumstances, farmers admitted to possibly being a cause through poor disposal techniques for dead animals. Feedback from farmers emphasized the importance of having collaboration between farmers to control jackal predation and reduce human–wildlife conflict.";"Humphries, Bruce D.

Pollution sources located on the earth’s surface or underground have affected the quality of the environment. A significant amount of impact could be reduced if the allocation of potential pollution sources was based on an evaluation of environmental conditions. The main objective of this study was to develop a methodology for the allocation of potential pollution sources by employing GIS and multi-criteria evaluation techniques. This methodology was applied to a study area located in the eastern part of Lithuania. A GIS-based land suitability analysis was performed after identifying 16 factors concerning the geological and socio-economic environment, which were important for environmental protection, land use and spatial planning. The environmental and socio-economic factors were divided into eliminating and limiting criteria. Criteria maps based on the selected factors were compiled. Areas delineated by eliminating criteria were identified as unsuitable for development (according to national legislation). Limiting criteria were evaluated according to the suitability level, which were determined in this study considering the principles of sustainable development. The relative importance of each criterion was assessed utilising the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). A land suitability index (LSI) was calculated and the final result of the land suitability analysis was summarized in three suitability maps (environmental, socio-economic and composite). Four suitability classes (unsuitable, least, moderately and most suitable) for the allocation of potential pollution sources in the study area were used, and the nine most suitable candidate sites were selected according to the proposed methodology.";"Bagdanavičiūtė, Ingrida

Here, we evaluated seasonal variations in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) as well as microbial activity (as qCO₂) for 16 months with respect to several factors relating to soil moisture and nutrients under different land management practices (plant residue application, fertilizer application) in both clayey (38% clay) and sandy (4% clay) croplands in Tanzania. We observed that MBC and MBN tended to decrease during the rainy season whereas they tended to increase and remain at high levels during the dry season in all treatment plots at both of our test sites, although soil moisture did not correlate with MBC or MBN. qCO₂ correlated with soil moisture in all treatment plots at both sites, and hence soil microbes act as decomposers mainly during the rainy season. Although the effect of seasonal variation of soil moisture on the dynamics of MBC, MBN, and qCO₂ was certainly greater than that attributable to plant residue application, fertilizer application, or soil texture, plant residue application early in the rainy season clearly increased MBC and MBN in both clayey and sandy soils. This suggests that plant residue application can help to not only counter the N loss caused by leaching but also synchronize crop N uptake and N release from soil microbes by utilizing these microbes as an ephemeral nutrient pool during the early crop growth period. We also found substantially large seasonal variations in MBC and MBN, continuously high qCO₂, and rapid turnover of soil microbes in sandy soil compared to clayey soil. Taken together, our results indicate that soil microbes, acting as both a nutrient pool and decomposers, have a more substantial impact on tropical sandy soil than on clayey soil.";"Sugihara, Soh

Although changes to plant assemblages are becoming better known, however, our understanding of how shrub encroachment affects rodent communities is low. In this study, we investigated relative abundance of five rodent species in sixteen southern Kalahari rangelands where shrub cover ranged from low (<5%) to high (>25%). Rodent abundance was determined on three trapping grids (40 x 100 m) for each site. Our results show that increasing shrub cover affected rodent species differently. The relative abundance of hairy-footed gerbil, short-tailed gerbil and bushveld gerbil declined with increasing shrub cover, whereas highveld gerbil and striped mouse exhibited hump-shaped relationships with shrub cover. Overall, species richness decreased with increasing shrub cover and a negative impact of high shrub cover above 15% on rodent abundance was congruent for all species. We conclude that our results support the hypothesis that long-term heavy grazing that results in area wide shrub encroachment, threatens the diversity of arid environments.";"Blaum, Niels

The principal features of these lands are high salt content, high pH, and poor soil structure with low water infiltration and poor drainage. These conditions effectively prevent the exploitation of such land for agriculture. In this study, we have compared 17 soil conditioning agents for their abilities to promote seed germination and growth under both laboratory and field conditions. One of these, Hydrolyzed Polymaleic Anhydride (HPMA), was identified as a highly effective agent for soil improvement. Laboratory germination experiments and laboratory and field cultivation of a variety of plants both showed that addition of HPMA could significantly increase the germination percentage and plant growth rate. Distinct from other Ca-carrier agents such as gypsum, HPMA increases the dissolution of CaCO₃, which is abundant in the calcareous saline-alkali soils. This allows Ca²⁺ in soil solution to displace the over-abundant Na⁺ in the soil colloids. This process greatly improves soil properties such as the bulk density, which decreased, and the capillary soil rise height of water and soil water infiltration rate, which increased. Direct SEM and AFM imagery showed flocculent soil precipitation (soil aggregates) after HPMA addition, and a looser structure of those aggregates. The addition of HPMA also reduced the soil pH and EC. These changes in soil chemical and physical properties are a likely explanation for the soil improvement effected by HPMA. The high content of insoluble CaCO₃ in saline-alkali land such as that in northeastern China (up to 13%) favors the further exploration of HPMA as an ameliorative agent.";"Wang, Wen-Jie

This study was designed to document and map the current status of the tropical dry deciduous forest of the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), Central India, (using IRS P6 LISS IV data) and to describe its landscape structure at three levels of organization viz. landscape, class, and patch.

The TATR landscapes have a total of 2,307 patches with a mean patch size of 25.67 ha and patch density of 1.7 patches per km². Amongst all land cover classes, mixed bamboo forest is dominant—it occupied maximum area (77.99%)—while riparian forest is least represented (0.32%). Mixed forest has maximum number of patches among all vegetation classes. Results have shown that despite being dominant in the area, mixed bamboo forest has low patch density (0.25/100 ha). Dominance of mixed bamboo forest is attributed to large patch sizes and not to the number of patches.

"AGRIS:US201600123763";"Integrating land cover structure and functioning to predict biodiversity patterns: a hierarchical modelling framework designed for ecosystem management";"";"CONTEXT: Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) dynamics is one of the main drivers of global environmental change. In the last years, aerial and satellite imagery have been increasingly used to monitor the spatial extent of changes in LU/LC, deriving relevant biophysical parameters (i.e. primary productivity, climate and habitat structure) that have clear implications in determining spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity, landscape composition and ecosystem services. OBJECTIVES: An innovative hierarchical modelling framework was developed in order to address the influence of nested attributes of LU/LC on community-based ecological indicators. METHODS: Founded in the principles of the spatially explicit stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM), the proposed methodological advances are supported by the added value of integrating bottom-up interactions between multi-scaled drivers. RESULTS: The dynamics of biophysical multi-attributes of fine-scale subsystem properties are incorporated to inform dynamic patterns at upper hierarchical levels. Since the most relevant trends associated with LU/LC changes are explicitly modelled within the StDM framework, the ecological indicators’ response can be predicted under different social-economic scenarios and site-specific management actions. A demonstrative application is described to illustrate the framework methodological steps, supporting the theoretic principles previously presented. CONCLUSIONS: We outline the proposed multi-model framework as a promising tool to integrate relevant biophysical information to support ecosystem management and decision-making.";"Bastos, Rita

The models of agrarian policy in EU and EAEU are compared, stressing that the EAEU statute document envisages the agreed (coordinated), but not uniform agrarian policy. That is the principal difference from EU agrarian policy, which contains uniform economic rules. The EU created two financial funds (of guaranteed and stable development), which are used for support of farmers. It is suggested to employ useful experience of the EU in the new integrating formation. Also analyzed is the mechanism of forming the integrating relations, which includes the development of overall agreed forecast balances on basic kinds of food, creation of stabilizing fund, development of uniform methodology for assessing the food security and independence, mutual presentation of corresponding information, development of interstate commodity transfer network, creation of interstate center on monitoring and forecasting the food situation in Europe Asia economic union.

Евразийского экономического союза (ЕАЭС) и возможным его последующим расширением рассмотрены вопросы соотношения национальной и коллективной продовольственной безопасности в условиях интеграции стран, основные направления обеспечения такой безопасности. Сопоставляются модели аграрной политики ЕС и ЕАЭС. Подчеркивается, что в учредительном документе ЕАЭС предусматривается согласованная (скоординированная), но не единая аграрная политика. Это принципиальное отличие от аграрной политики ЕС, в которой существуют единые экономические правила. В ЕС созданы 2 финансовых фонда (гарантирования и устойчивого развития), из которых осуществляется поддержка фермеров. Предлагается использовать полезный опыт ЕС в новом интеграционном образовании. Анализируется механизм формирования интеграционных отношений, включающий разработку сводных согласованных прогнозных балансов по основным видам продовольствия, создание стабилизационного фонда, разработку единой методологии оценки продовольственной безопасности и независимости, взаимное предоставление соответствующей информации, развитие межгосударственной товаропроводящей сети, создание межгосударственного центра по мониторингу и прогнозированию продовольственной ситуации в Евразийском экономическом союзе. Отмечается необходимость учитывать риски и угрозы, возникающие из-за экспансии высокосубсидируемой более дешевой импортной продукции.";"Ushachev, I.G.

"AGRIS:US201600123765";"Getting to the root of the matter: landscape implications of plant-fungal interactions for tree migration in Alaska";"";"CONTEXT: Forecasting the expansion of forest into Alaska tundra is critical to predicting regional ecosystem services, including climate feedbacks such as carbon storage. Controls over seedling establishment govern forest development and migration potential. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), obligate symbionts of all Alaskan tree species, are particularly important to seedling establishment, yet their significance to landscape vegetation change is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We used ALFRESCO, a landscape model of wildfire and vegetation dynamics, to explore whether EMF inoculum potential influences patterns of tundra afforestation and associated flammability. METHODS: Using two downscaled CMIP3 general circulation models (ECHAM5 and CCCMA) and a mid-range emissions scenario (A1B) at a 1 km² resolution, we compared simulated tundra afforestation rates and flammability from four parameterizations of EMF effects on seedling establishment and growth from 2000 to 2100. RESULTS: Modeling predicted an 8.8–18.2 % increase in forest cover from 2000 to 2100. Simulations that explicitly represented landscape variability in EMF inoculum potential showed a reduced percent change afforestation of up to a 2.8 % due to low inoculum potential limiting seedling growth. This reduction limited fuel availability and thus, cumulative area burned. Regardless of inclusion of EMF effects in simulations, landscape flammability was lower for simulations driven by the wetter and cooler CCCMA model than the warmer and drier ECHAM5 model, while tundra afforestation was greater. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest abiotic factors are the primary driver of tree migration. Simulations including EMF effects, a biotic factor, yielded more conservative estimates of land cover change across Alaska that better-matched empirical estimates from the previous century.";"Hewitt, Rebecca E.

Despite its urban appearance, greenhouse development often manages to evade urban containment policies. But a ban on greenhouse development might well result in under-utilisation of the economic value of the sector and its potential for sustainability. Specific knowledge of the urban and rural character of greenhouses is essential for the implementation of planning strategies. This paper analyses Dutch planning policies for greenhouses.

Opportunities and constraints";"";"An overview is given of the natural, socio-economic, agronomical and marketing conditions for vegetable production in the Red River Delta (RRD) of Vietnam. The seasonal variation in temperature in the RRD is the main determinant for the production season of vegetables. Heavy rainfall in the hot season increases production risks, as it may physically damage crops. Frequent rainfall in this period may enhance disease incidence. Landholdings are small and individual plots are the smallest of Indochina. Vegetables typically are produced in flooded rice based systems. Such systems are characterized by poor soil structure for vegetable production and high labour demand for the construction of raised beds. Highly perishable crops can only be grown close to the markets in the peri-urban areas. Less perishable crops can be produced further away from the city markets. Generally, large quantities of pesticides are used and there is increasing public concern about pesticide residues on products. The small landholdings, small plots and consequently the small amounts of product, limit effective marketing and make the producers dependent on collectors. Given the trends in population dynamics and human diets, urban vegetable demand in the RRD, however, has ample opportunities to grow. Effects have been analysed and categorised in opportunities and constraints for adopting improvements. A potential pathway to sustainable development is the development of permanent vegetable production systems, with producers co-operating in producers organizations, enabling them to work on a larger scale, produce larger volumes, introduce harvest date planning and quality control and aim for the integration of production with marketing in a vegetable value chain. By simultaneously adopting Good Agricultural Practices, consumers’ food safety concerns can be addressed. The expected increase in vegetable demand is likely to open new opportunities for the RRD vegetable producers.";"Huong, Pham Thi Thu

Such predictions are highly uncertain given: (i) differences in site quality, management regimes and planting geometries (belt versus block configurations) result in rates of sequestration that are highly variable at regional scales and (ii) uncertainties in carbon accounting methods in future carbon markets. Here we examined the economics of three case studies (two of farm forestry and one of biodiverse environmental plantings) to address these issues. There was significant variation in economic viability both between and within case studies (average coefficient of variation of 39%) as a result of differences in site quality, management regime and planting geometries. We conclude that if carbon offset investment targets marginal land (i.e. areas of farms of lowest productivity), carbon prices required for economic viability are <$18t CO₂-e, even at a relatively high discount rate of 8%. Although regional employment generated per hectare tends to be less than many existing agricultural enterprises, any jobs generated from use of this low productivity land for carbon forestry would be additional. Economic viability was generally greatest for 3−4 row belt farm forestry plantings because of increased growth, particularly in areas of relatively high rainfall. Supplementary payments may therefore be needed to make biodiverse environmental plantings competitive in areas of lower rainfall and thus less profitability.";"Paul, K.I.

The numbers of farm households opting to exit from agriculture increases sharply under the scenario characterised by the removal of the CAP. The statistically significant determinants are mostly consistent with previous studies, but show different behaviour when comparing the exit decision with the willingness to sell the farm. The outcomes of this study seem to deliver a clear policy message reinforcing the notion that the current CAP payments are important for staying in/exiting farming activities, but the land reallocation process clearly requires more targeted instruments. At the same time, greater attention should be paid to mechanisms of land rent or alternative land tenure solutions.";"Raggi, M.

The method is based on the Land Suitability Index (LSI), a cartographic GIS-based index originally developed for the region of Barcelona (Spain) and aimed at determining the suitability of each point in a region for urban development, considering three sub-indexes: (i) Naturalness, (ii) Ecological Connectivity and (iii) Natural Risk. Using the LSI we evaluated the already approved urban plans of the municipalities in the region, considering two scenarios: the initial land use or baseline scenario (S0) and the designated land use or planned scenario (S1). The results show that overall the planned scenario will result in a loss of around 16% of naturalness, with particularly negative effects on brushwood and wetland areas. Connectivity will decrease by around 17%, and urban areas exposed to many types of natural risks will increase considerably, from approximately 49% to 92% of the total urban surface. Finally the LSI shows that around 252ha are suitable for new urbanization in the extension area. This corresponds to around 0.7% of the total extension area (37.381ha), which represents 12% of the region (271.398ha). We propose this methodology can be a valuable contribution to the design of Strategic Environmental Assessment applications and indicators for land planning in Latin America.";"Rojas, Carolina

"AGRIS:US201500146414";"ethical foundation for careful animal husbandry";"";"Current practices in intensive animal production increasingly raise questions with respect to animal ethics both among the public in Europe and in political circles. This paper integrates three areas of philosophical views in order to formulate a general ethical position with respect to animal husbandry. The first area regards the question to what type of beings animals are. Secondly, an evaluative model of agrarian practices is employed in order to obtain a better perception on the place of animals in animal husbandry. In these two lines of thinking, reformational philosophy from the school of Dooyeweerd is explicitly employed. In the third view, current thinking regarding normative ethics, in general, and animal ethics, in particular, is utilized to elaborate on the ethical aspect of the practice of animal husbandry. It is argued that the major ethical principles for evaluating the manner in which animals are cared for and treated in animal husbandry are the concepts of the ‘intrinsic value’ of animals, animal welfare, and the principle of care, the latter being the core principle of the ethical aspect. On the basis of the literature, these three concepts are elaborated consistent with reformational philosophy. This leads to an integrated interpretation of an ethically correct practice of animal husbandry.";"Jochemsen, Henk";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"animal husbandry;land reform";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"150";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500146414";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2013.05.011";"";"";"";"55-63"

It reports on analysis of survey results particularly addressing CDM-AR projects in South and South-East Asia (SSEA), and on knowledge obtained from both (i) experts in SSEA countries and (ii) developers, investors and consultants in the Annex I countries. Despite a wide variety of opinions, respondents from both groups expressed a number of similarities in their vision. For example, availability of land suitable for tree planting in host countries, and the development of community-based forestry were considered by experts as major strengths of CDM-AR. There was a consensus between the two groups of experts regarding certification and developing standards for CDM-AR. Community participation, with a focus on local livelihoods and biodiversity conservation, were identified as the basic criteria for success. The similarities and differences revealed in the attitudes of experts make it possible to identify and explain areas of potential conflicts between the CDM-AR developers/investors and local communities, and therefore, to assist in managing conflicts that could arise, as well as to enable better targeting of CDM-AR within land use changes in host countries in order to provide more effectively the co-benefits to end-users, both at a local level and internationally.";"Nijnik, Maria

A thorough analysis of land use change patterns and the ability to predict these changes are necessary for the effective design of regional environmental, growth, and development policies. We estimate a multinomial discrete choice model with spatial dependence using parcel-level data from Medina County, Ohio. Accounting for spatial dependence should result in improved statistical inference about land use changes. Our spatial model extends the binary choice “linearized logit” model of Klier and McMillen (2008) to a multinomial setting. A small Monte Carlo simulation indicates that this estimator performs reasonably well. Preliminary results suggest that the location of new urban development is guided by a preference over lower density areas, yet in proximity to current urban development.

"AGRIS:US2016212350";"Determinants of Iowa Cropland Cash Rental Rates: Testing Ricardian Rent Theory";"";"Based on the Ricardian rent theory, this study employs the variable profit function to analyze the determinants of Iowa cropland cash rental rates using county-level panel data from 1987 to 2005. Accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelations, responses of local cash rental rates to changes in output prices and other exogenous variables areestimated. We find that Iowa cash rental rates are largely determined by output/input prices, soil quality, relative location, and other county-specific factors. Cash rents go up by $79 for a $1 increase in corn price in the short run. The marginal value of cropland quality, as represented by row-crop corn suitability rating index, is about $1.05. Ethanol plants are not found to have a significant local effect on cash rental rates, impacting local rental markets mainly through the national futures price. Scale of the local livestock industry and adoption of genetically engineered crops have significant impacts on localcash rental rates. In addition, changes in crop output prices are found to have long-run effects on cash rental rates. The long-run change in cash rents is approximately $109-$114 for a $1 change in corn price and is reached in about four years. Our research may be viewed as a test of the Ricardian rent theory.

An analysis of productivity and efficiency developments in the transformation phase.";"Russlands Weg vom Plan zum Markt: Sektorale Trends und regionale Spezifika. Eine Analyse der Produktivitäts- und Effizienzentwicklungen in der Transformationsphase.";"More than ten years after the departure of the Central and Eastern EuropeanCountries (CEEC) towards market economy and democracy now it seems to bepossible as well as necessary to analyse the present settings, the developmentsso far, and relevant problems faced during the transition. The main tasks aremaking the transition process empirically transparent and investigate its determinants.This has to be done in order to understand the particular trends and –based on that – to conceptualise sustainable policy concepts as well as adjustedreform measures. According to this challenge an analytical dilemma arise regardinga general focus on the subject on hand side (universal validity of the results)and the desire for diversified and precisely answers to the empirical questionson the other side. For the present study this conflict has been solved by selectingthe Russian Federation as one of the most heterogeneous research subjectswith a predominant position among the transition countries. In order tocapture the variety of the transition process Russia has been analysed along itsterritorial units (simplified: regions)9 divided into four sectors: industry, services,agriculture and construction, respectively, analysed aggregated as well asseparately for the period 1993-2000.Beside the transition process on a sectoral and regional level the main determinantsof these developments as well as their relevant political aspects are fromparticular interest. Accordingly, for this study three general objectives have beenformulated.10(1) Explore and record (quantitative comparable) the individual transition path,(2) Discover and verify the determinants of the transition process,(3) Derive policy implications (call for action, priorities, agenda, etc.).This successive structure of objectives – depict the transition, verify determinants,summarise policy implications – has been transferred directly into a threestage approach: (analytical step 1, 2, 3 (realised in the chapters V, VI, VII).The analytical idea is to approximate the progress of transition by individual developmentsof productivity. According to the analytical concept (see: chapter II)positive welfare effects have to be expected as a characteristic result of a successful transition due to an overcome of co-ordination and incentive problemswhich are typically inherent in a planned economy. Hence, the way from ""a plantoward a market"" can be properly illustrated by Total Factor Productivity (TFP)and its components (technological change, technical efficiency, etc.).The chapters (III, IV) discuss the relevant theoretical and methodological aspectsand develop appropriate models for the analyses. The empirical foundationof the study are sectoral production frontier analyses which are used to calculatetechnological change (TCH), technical efficiency (TE) and their trends. The determinantsof the transition process can be verified by regressing a sample ofexplanatory variables with respect to these scores.The results of the various analytical steps can be summarised as follows:The sectoral as well as regional transition paths are much more heterogeneousthan expected (see analytical step (1)). For the Russian economy (in total) aswell as for industry and service sector similar trends characteristics (commonpath but different levels) were found. The common patterns are dominated bycertain macro-economic indicators. Accordingly, four stylised phases of transitionwere extracted. These patterns have not been that clear for the constructionsector and have to be rejected for agriculture. Occasionally, the sectoral transitionpaths diverge. In analogy this is also true for the regional level.11 Almosteverywhere in Russia some regions can be found which have been more successfulin the transition process (in general or at least with respect to certain sectors)compared to the mean trends and/or related to their direct neighbours (whohad very similar initial conditions).12 Admittedly, for some regions, however, adevelopment clearly below the average trends has to be stated.13The same variety which were found with respect to the sectoral/regional transitionpaths has to be quoted regarding to the corresponding determinants. In analyticalstep (2) for a number of variables a significant influence on the transitionprocess (rather than on TCH, TE, etc.) at a general/inter-sectoral as well as atsector specific levels has been detected.The causalities of these variables14 and related policy measures have been discussedand, afterwards, along their political relevance grouped. Analytical step (3) has – based on that – a sequence of political calls for actionexposed. Some general aspects were addressed to the federal level. Indeed, themajority of the necessary actions and measures (acute needs, call for actions,open questions and discussions) have to be realised by the regions.15 As one ofthe most important tasks with Russia's regions a formulation of a decided politicalvision regarding the further transition process and the regional 'destination'has been indicated.16 This seems to be the precondition for any sustainable politicalprogramme. The questions, which measure has to be primary and howshould be the agenda accentuated have been discussed along a hierarchic structure.Furthermore, the implementation of policy measures and the potential influenceof certain Russian society groups in the upcoming reform debate havebeen reviewed. All these aspects were implemented in a conceptual guidelinewhich can be used to specify regionally adjusted reform policies.In view of the discussion about transition paths, relevant determinants, and therelated political implications it has to be summarised: the necessary preconditionsfor a successful transition in Russia are almost everywhere given.But, partly sufficient conditions and positive impulses are missing in order toinitiate substantial transition progress. The call for action and the responsibilityhave to be addressed to the regions. Hence, the configuration of the individualtransition path, the agenda setting, the political initiative and, therefore, the finalsuccess of Russia's way from a ""plan towards a market"" are basically in the responsibilityof the regions. But, the regions have to be aware of these challenges,should develop the chances actively and finally take advantage from the opportunities.If this will be successful then a substantial growth process can be expectedfor Russia's economy.";"Voigt, Peter";"";"";"AGRIS";"2004-12-31";"de";"";"";"";"RUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016212421";"http://purl.umn.edu/93021";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400158004";"Impacts of climate change on Swiss biodiversity: An indicator taxa approach";"";"We present a new indicator taxa approach to the prediction of climate change effects on biodiversity at the national level in Switzerland. As indicators, we select a set of the most widely distributed species that account for 95% of geographical variation in sampled species richness of birds, butterflies, and vascular plants. Species data come from a national program designed to monitor spatial and temporal trends in species richness. We examine some opportunities and limitations in using these data. We develop ecological niche models for the species as functions of both climate and land cover variables. We project these models to the future using climate predictions that correspond to two IPCC 3rd assessment scenarios for the development of ‘greenhouse’ gas emissions. We find that models that are calibrated with Swiss national monitoring data perform well in 10-fold cross-validation, but can fail to capture the hot-dry end of environmental gradients that constrain some species distributions. Models for indicator species in all three higher taxa predict that climate change will result in turnover in species composition even where there is little net change in predicted species richness. Indicator species from high elevations lose most areas of suitable climate even under the relatively mild B2 scenario. We project some areas to increase in the number of species for which climate conditions are suitable early in the current century, but these areas become less suitable for a majority of species by the end of the century. Selection of indicator species based on rank prevalence results in a set of models that predict observed species richness better than a similar set of species selected based on high rank of model AUC values. An indicator species approach based on selected species that are relatively common may facilitate the use of national monitoring data for predicting climate change effects on the distribution of biodiversity.";"Pearman, Peter B.

"AGRIS:US201500143333";"Watershed sediment yield reduction through soil conservation in a West-Central Oklahoma watershed";"";"Soil conservation practices on the Fort Cobb Reservoir watershed in West-Central Oklahoma were limited before the 1950s. However, extensive soil conservation measures were implemented in the second half of the 20th century to protect agriculturally fertile but erosion-prone soils. Fortuitously, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected instantaneous suspended-sediment and discharge measurements on major tributaries within the watershed in 1943 –1948 and again in 2004 – 2007, called pre- and post-conservation periods respectively. These measurements offered the opportunity to compare channel suspended-sediment yield before and after implementation of conservation practices . A separate suspended sediment-discharge rating curve was developed for the pre- and post-conservation period. Average annual suspended-sediment yield at a U.S. Geological Survey gauging station near the watershed outlet was estimated by evaluating each sediment-discharge rating curve with the 18-year long daily discharge record at that gauging station. Average annual suspended-sediment yield was estimated to be760 [Mg/yr/km2] and 108 [Mg/yr/km2] for the pre- and post-conservation periods, respectively. The substantial reduction in suspended-sediment yield was related to land use and management changes and the wide range of conservation practices implemented in the second half of the 20th century. Even though it generally is difficult to identify impacts of upstream conservation practices on sediment yield at the watershed outlet during the short time-span of a particular conservation project, targeted and widespread conservation efforts in the Fort Cobb Reservoir watershed have led, over 60 years, to a sizable and measurable reduction in watershed sediment yield.";"Garbrecht, Jurgen D.

The vast scope of hydrologic sciences requires research efforts worldwide and across a wide range of disciplines. While hydrologic processes and scientific investigations related to sustainable agricultural systems are based on universal principles, research to understand processes and evaluate management practices is often site-specific to achieve a critical mass of expertise and research infrastructure to address spatially, temporally, and ecologically complex systems. In the face of dynamic climate, market, and policy environments, long-term research is required to understand and predict risks and possible outcomes of alternative scenarios. This special section describes the USDA-ARS's long-term research (1961 to present) in the Upper Washita River basin of Oklahoma. Data papers document datasets in detail (weather, hydrology, physiography, land cover, and sediment and nutrient water quality), and associated research papers present analyses based on those data. This living history of research is presented to engage collaborative scientists across institutions and disciplines to further explore complex, interactive processes and systems. Application of scientific understanding to resolve pressing challenges to agriculture while enhancing resilience of linked land and human systems will require complex research approaches. Research areas that this watershed research program continues to address include: resilience to current and future climate pressures; sources, fate, and transport of contaminants at a watershed scale; linked atmospheric-surface-subsurface hydrologic processes; high spatiotemporal resolution analyses of linked hydrologic processes; and multiple-objective decision making across linked farm to watershed scales.";"Steiner, Jean L.

"AGRIS:US201500008230";"influence of natural and human factors in the shrinking of the Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang, China, during the 1972–2013 period";"";"The Ebinur Lake is a closed inland lake located within the arid region of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the northwestern part of China, near the Kazakhstan border. The shrinkage of the lake area is believed to be caused by ecological environmental deterioration and has become an important restraining factor for the social development of the local population. Of all the lakes in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the Ebinur Lake is the most severely impacted water body. The lake has undergone change in size naturally for over thousands of years due to natural causes. However, the authors observed the dramatic changes in the freshwater resources of this region from the aerial images from 1972 to 2013. Thus, this paper traces and analyzes the change in the Ebinur Lake surface area in the past 41 years. A set of six satellite images acquired between 1972 and 2013 was employed to map the change in the surface area of the Ebinur Lake using the water index approach. The authors applied the traditional normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) to quantify the change in the water body area of the Ebinur Lake during the study period. The results indicate that the lake area has experienced a dramatic decrease of 31.4 % from 1972 to 2013. The paper also examines the natural processes and human activities that may have contributed to the decrease in the lake area. The results show that the decrease in total lake area appears to coincide with periods of rapid land reclamation in the study area. Moreover, the uncontrolled land reclamation activities, such as irrigation, can increase the sedimentation in the Ebinur Lake thereby reducing the lake size. Reduction of the lake area has a negative ecological impact on the environment and on human life and property. The lake area is the most important factor to ensure the environment of the watershed and the key index to measure the environment balance.";"Zhang, Fei

We evaluated the effectiveness of rehabilitation on 391 ha of high-graded forest in Vermont, USA. Thirteen silvicultural scenarios were modeled over 100 years using the Forest Vegetation Simulator. Carbon offsets were quantified with the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) and American Carbon Registry (ACR) protocols and evaluated under voluntary and regulatory carbon price assumptions. Results indicate that management scenarios involving no harvest or low-intensity harvest yield the greatest incentives, yet these scenarios include a range of short-term rehabilitation options that provide flexibility for landowners. The choice of protocol also significantly influences results. Although ACR consistently generated more offsets than CAR for the same scenarios (p < 0.05), the protocols yielded similar net present values of US$121âUS$256Â·haâ»Â¹ under high offset price assumptions. These returns are comparable to those generated from timber harvest alone under more intensive management scenarios. While timber will continue to be a primary source of revenue for many landowners, carbon markets may increasingly appeal as a new incentive for restoring high-graded forests.";"Russell-Roy, Emily T.

"AGRIS:DJ2012061315";"National parks and environmental justice: Comparing access rights and ideological legacies in three countries";"";"National parks are often places where people have previously lived and worked-they have been formed by a combination of natural and human processes that embody an identifiable history of cultural and political values. Conservation of protected areas is primarily about how we perceive such landscapes, how we place differential values on different landscape components, and who gets to decide on these values. Thus, conservation has been and still is very much about issues of power and environmental justice. This paper analyses the social, political and environmental histories of three national park regimes (South Africa, Sweden and Scotland) through the lens of public access rights. We examine the evolving status of access rights-in a broad sense that includes access to land, resources and institutions of governance-as a critical indicator of the extent to which conservation policies and legislation realise the aims of environmental justice in practice. Our case studies illustrate how access rights are contingent on the historical settings and ideological contexts in which the institutions controlling national park management have evolved. Dominant cultural, political and scientific ideologies have given rise to historical precedents and institutional structures that affect the promotion of environmental justice in and around national parks today. In countries where national parks were initially created to preserve perceived wilderness, with decisions taken by powerful elites and central authorities, this historical legacy has prevented profound change in line with new policy directives. The comparative analysis of national park regimes, where historical trajectories both converge and diverge, was useful in improving our understanding of contemporary issues involving conservation, people and politics.";"Dahlberg Annika

During this time Ethiopia had only 84 hospitals, 64 health centres and fewer than 400 physicians in a country of 25 million people. In 1970 smallpox vaccination was relatively unknown in the country, and the government actually contested the fact that smallpox was present in the country. Most of the resources of the Ministry of Health were used for malaria eradication. Initial pessimism from the Ministry of Health and others was eventually overcome as the smallpox eradication campaign continued to pick up steam but many remained unenthusiastic. Ethiopia was the first country in the world to start its smallpox eradication campaign from day one with the strategy of “Surveillance and Containment”. Establishing a surveillance system in a country with a limited health infrastructure was a daunting challenge. At the end of the first year of the programme in 1971, 26,000 cases of smallpox had been registered through the growing surveillance system. Throughout revolution of 1974 the smallpox campaign was the only UN program to operate in the country; in fact it expanded with the hire of many locals leading to a “nationalized” program. This development ushered in the most successful final phase of the program. As the program progressed cases were diminishing in most regions, however transmission continued in the Ogaden desert. Over the course of the campaign approximately 14.3 million US dollars was spent. Working conditions were extremely challenging and a variety of chiefs, guerrillas, landowners and governments had to be appeased. The programme was successful due to the dedicated national and international staff on the ground and by having the full support of the WHO HQ in Geneva.";"de Quadros, Ciro A.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"landowners";"";"";"ETH";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500142540";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.10.001";"";"";"";""

This paper investigates the advantages and disadvantages of modelling soil erosion at the continental scale and suggests an operational methodology for mapping and quantifying 10-daily water runoff and soil erosion over this scale using remote sensing data in a geographical information system framework. An attempt is made to compare the estimates of this study with general data on the severity of soil erosion over Africa and with measured rates of soil loss at different locations over the continent. The results show that the measured and estimated rates of erosion are in some areas very similar and in general within the same order of magnitude. The importance and the potential of using the soil erosion estimates with simple models and easily accessible free data for various continental-scale environmental applications are also demonstrated.";"Symeonakis, Elias

We present a phytosociological description of the riparian corridor within two contiguous sites along the Mission River in Refugio County, Texas, that differ in respect to tidal influence along the river, and compare this woody riparian community to others in Texas. In summer 2009 and 2010, we established 33 transects perpendicular to the river after reviewing digital data from ArcMap 9.3.1 on elevation, edaphic characteristics, uses of land, and cover of land and wetland. We included sites above and below the tidal zone to ensure that the diversity of the community was documented. Transects traversed the edge of the river, ridge and swale topography, and up to the transitional zone between the riparian zone and upland habitat. We sampled a total of 137 plots and documented all species of trees, shrubs, and vines with diameter at breast height â¥3 cm. The important species were Ulmus crassifolia, Celtis laevigata, Ehretia anacua, Vitis mustangensis, Acer negundo, Carya illinoinensis, Fraxinus berlandieriana, and Quercus virginiana. Riparian vegetation was restricted to particular zones within the Mission River floodplain. Elevation and river flow were identified as the environmental determinants that influenced the distributional pattern of colonizing species and species of middle or late stages of succession within riparian zones. Species with the greatest importance values in this study were compared to those in other studies of the riparian vegetation in Texas using Bray-Curtis similarity indices. In general, riparian vegetation from the sites grouped within ecoregions. The riparian vegetation in the Mission River was most similar to the nearby Aransas River, and both are in the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes ecoregion.";"Davis, Nicole A.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

In New South Wales, the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1998 restricts farmers from clearing native vegetation on their own freehold land, and offers no compensation.  The Act may therefore impose opportunity costs, or losses in income, on landholders.  These opportunity costs are estimated for a case study property in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, and these results are then generalised to assess the broad trade-offs between development and preservation.  The losses in income appear to vary between 5 and 10 per cent of annual income, depending on livestock prices.  The flow of these losses over time appears to total some $26m for all properties of this kind in the immediate region.  In addition to imposition of these direct opportunity costs, the regulations hinder land sales and so hinder adjustment by landholders to changing conditions.";"Scott, Robert R.

"AGRIS:US201400138696";"Forecasts of habitat suitability improve habitat corridor efficacy in rapidly changing environments";"";"AIM: Habitat fragmentation threatens species’ persistence by increasing subpopulation isolation and vulnerability to stochastic events, and its impacts are expected to worsen under climate change. By reconnecting isolated fragments, habitat corridors should dampen the synergistic impacts of habitat and climate change on population viability. Choosing which fragments to reconnect is typically informed by past and current environmental conditions. However, habitat and climate are dynamic and change over time. Habitat suitability projections could inform fragment selection using current and future conditions, ensuring that corridors connect persistent fragments. We compare the efficacy of using current‐day and future forecasts of breeding habitat to inform corridor placement under land cover and climate‐change mitigation and no mitigation scenarios by evaluating their influence on subpopulation abundance, and connectivity and long‐term metapopulation abundance. Our case study is the threatened orangutan metapopulation in Sabah. LOCATION: Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. METHODS: Using coupled niche–population models that capture a metapopulation distribution and its major processes, we forecast the effect of current‐day and future‐informed habitat corridor implementations under two scenarios where (1) land cover and climate change continue unabated (no mitigation) and (2) local and international cooperation mitigates their synergistic impact (mitigation). RESULTS: We show that Future‐informed corridor placement maximizes long‐term metapopulation abundance when human‐driven land cover and climate change alter the spatio‐temporal composition of suitable habitat. By contrast, there is no apparent benefit in using future forecasts of breeding habitat to inform corridor placement if conditions remain comparatively stable. For the Sabah orangutan under unabated land cover and climate change, habitat corridors should connect current‐day populated eastern habitat fragments with vacant fragments in the state's west. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of habitat corridors can be improved by using habitat‐suitability model projections to inform corridor placement in rapidly changing environments, even for long‐lived, low‐fecundity, philopatric species such as orangutan.";"Gregory, Stephen D.

"AGRIS:US201300857162";"Land rights regimes in southwest Nigeria: implications for land access and livelihoods security of settled Fulani agropastoralists";"";"The need of Fulanis for secured access to land is a long time policy challenge in Nigeria but progress in achieving this is far from being made. Meanwhile, access to land, of Fulanis that are settled among the Yorubas in southwest Nigeria, is dependent on land rights regimes operating in Yoruba communities. The study examines the nature of land rights in southwest Nigeria and how these provide access to Fulanis for their livelihoods activities. The study hypothesised that land access and land rights relate significantly to livelihood security of the Fulanis. The study was conducted in three States, namely, Ogun, Oyo and Ekiti States. Two major settlements of the Fulanis were selected from each of the States and 20 Fulani households were sampled purposively from each settlement. Forty-two Yoruba farmers were also interviewed to understand the land rights regimes operating in their communities. Non-parametric Chi-square analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses. The study revealed that communal land right regime operates in most communities in the region and designates use rights to Fulanis. Fulanis in Oyo State had management rights which gave them secured access to land in their host communities than their counterparts in other States. The hypotheses tested show significant relationship between land rights and livelihood security of the Fulanis (α < 0·05). The rehabilitation of existing grazing reserves in the region is therefore recommended to grant the Fulanis ownership rights and secured access to land for the security of their livelihoods.

The abundance and the activity quality of entomophagous populations were higher in the system of crops with protective forest belts, existing since 1952, in the Cean-Bolduţ farm of A.R.D.S. in Turda. Therefore, on the farm with protective forestry belts and with field marginal herbs shelters, favorable for the development of entomophagous arthropod fauna, a real natural entomocenotic equilibrium and a natural biological control of important pests were registered. By comparison it is necessary to apply the insecticide treatments on the cereal agroecosystem in open field areas, because the development of pest population exceeds the adjusting capacity of entomophagous arthropod fauna.";"Dana Malschi

The results suggest that the profile of traders in the early and mature stages of the water allocation market differ greatly. In addition, the profile of allocation traders is significantly dissimilar from that of water entitlement traders at all stages of water market development. The decision to buy or sell water allocations was more likely to be associated with a farmer's socioeconomic characteristics and the type of farm, while the decision to buy or sell water entitlements was more likely to be associated with the extent of existing farm infrastructure and farm productivity. Finally, there was strong evidence to suggest that trading in the water allocation market has become more efficient over time, though there is no evidence to suggest the same for the water entitlement market.";"Wheeler, Sarah

"AGRIS:US201600197030";"empirical investigation of why speciesâarea relationships overestimate species losses";"";"It is generally assumed that, when natural habitat is converted to humanâdominated land cover, such habitat is lost to its native species. Most literature assumes that species richness should vary as a function of remaining natural area, following the wellâknown speciesâarea relationship (i.e., classic SAR). However, classic SARs have consistently overestimated species losses resulting from conversion of natural forested land cover to humanâdominated landscapes. Moreover, richness is sometimes a peaked function of remaining natural habitat. Recent studies propose modified SAR models based on species' utilization of multiple habitat types, yet none fully explain a peaked speciesâarea relationship. Here, we evaluate the responses of total avian richness, forest bird richness, and openâhabitat bird richness to remaining natural land cover within 991 quadrats, each 100 kmÂ², across southern Ontario, Canada. Total bird species richness peaks at roughly 50% natural land cover. Richness of forest birds varies as a classic power function of forested area. In contrast, richness of birds that prefer open habitats does not increase monotonically with either naturalâ or humanâdominated land cover. Richness of openâhabitat species can be predicted when we partition humanâdominated land cover into an âavailable humanâdominatedâ component and âlostâ habitat. Distinguishing three landâcover types (natural, available humanâdominated, and lost) can thus permit accurate predictions of species richness in landscapes with differing levels of natural habitat conversion.";"De Camargo, Rafael X.

In many cases the maintenance of agricultural activities in PLs is required to preserve landscape character. Whilst research exists on land conservation policies in general, the particular effects of PL on management and adjustment of the farms involved have not received attention in the literature. We present results from a questionnaire sent to owners of agricultural land within PLs in Norway. Whilst landowners were divided upon the effects of PLs on farm management, the economic situation of the farm was little affected. Furthermore, changes in farm management after the establishment of a PL did not seem to have been driven by the establishment of the PLs per se. Most importantly, farm management changes were related to potential options to develop the farm and its land. A statistical model showed that PL-farms did not differ significantly from farms outside PL in the development of their land use or animal husbandry. Our findings thus indicate that the establishment of PL played a minor role as a driving force of changes in farm management and farm income.";"Mittenzwei, Klaus

"AGRIS:US2016211991";"Is population growth conducive to the sustainability of cooperation?";"";"This paper asks whether population growth is conducive to the sustainability of cooperation. A simple model is developed in which farmers who live around a circular lake engage in trade with their adjacent neighbors. The payoffs from this activity are governed by a prisoner’s dilemma “rule of engagement.” Every farmer has one son when the population is not growing, or two sons when it is growing. In the former case, the son takes over the farm when his father dies. In the latter case, one son stays on his father’s farm, whereas the other son settles around another lake, along with the “other” sons of the other farmers. During his childhood, each son observes the strategies and the payoffs of his father and of the trading partners of his father, and imitates the most successful strategy when starting farming on his own. Then mutant defectors are introduced into an all-cooperator community. The defector strategy may spread. A comparison is drawn between the impact in terms of the sustainability of cooperation of the appearance of the mutants in a population that is not growing, and in one that is growing. It is shown that the ex-ante probability of sustaining the cooperation strategy is higher for a community that is growing than for a stagnant community.";"Stark, Oded

Information on the historical land use and spatial changes of natural habitats can help to explain the causes of a number of contemporary phenomena, which are important for the development of effective conservation and ecosystem management. This case study from the Czech Republic shows that archival written sources describing landscape quality, including vegetation cover, allow the reclassification of old maps to the level of natural habitat categories (sensu Natura 2000), with the aim of analyzing historic changes in land cover. Significant natural habitat decreases began by the middle of the 19th century. Over the course of 250 years, this area of formerly widespread natural wet meadows has declined by 99 %. An area of water vegetation was reduced by 95 %, willow carrs by 98 %, and a mosaic of willow carrs, wet Cirsium meadow, and alder carrs has decreased by 100 %. These decreases were caused by the conversion of meadows, pastures, and ponds into arable lands. Areas of oak-hornbeam forest, acidophilous oak forest, and thermophilous oak forest were primarily converted into monocultures of coniferous trees. Similarly, the areas with alluvial forests decreased. We conclude that old maps and other archive materials, despite their coarse accuracy, can serve as useful tools for disclosing natural habitat changes and their causes, providing a foundation for formulating biodiversity conservation strategies.";"Šantrůčková, Markéta

Thecriteria of the land selection for traditional agriculture are the economic effectiveness (measured by net income or by gross national product)and the economic efficiency (measured by the production economy). The maximum economic effectiveness is determined by the standardmethod of linear programming and the maximum economy by the method of broken linear programming. The solution of compromise canbe determined by multi-criteria programming, based on the minimum differences.The limitation groups in the mentioned variations of the model are: limitations of production quotas of agricultural products, minimumquantities of staple agricultural products, limitations of processing plants in a region (minimum and maximum), limitation of crop rotation,limitations of the needs in animal husbandry for bulky forage and limitations of agricultural land according to various types of utilization.

The main methodological aim of the current study is to generate a humidity regionalization tool to provide spatial datasets on average monthly mean, minimum and maximum RH, Specific Humidity (q) and Specific Saturation Deficit (DS) by using observation data of RH. The maps based on data of the period 1999–2009 are needed by ecological projects working on various plots where no climate station data are available. The humidity maps are generated by combining a straightforward detrending technique with a Digital Elevation Model and a satellite-based land cover classification which also provides the relative forest cover per pixel. The topical aim of the study is to investigate the humidity distribution and structure of both manifestations of our ecosystem (pastures and natural vegetation) with special considerations to the ecosystem regulation service by converting natural forest into pasture. The results reveal a clear differentiation over the year, partly triggered by the change of synoptic weather situation but also by land cover effects. Humidity amplitudes are particularly low during the main rainy season when cloudiness and rainfall are high, but markedly pronounced in the relative dry season when daily irradiance and outgoing nocturnal radiation causes distinct differences between the land cover units. Particularly the upper pasture areas gained by slash and burn of the natural forest exhibit the lowest humidity values while the humidity inside the mountain forest is significantly higher due to the regulating effects of the dense vegetation. Thus, clearing the forest clearly reduces the regulation function (regulating ecosystem services) of the ecosystem which might become problematic for reforestation under future global warming.";"Fries, Andreas

When full coverage of a region with VHR images is not affordable, a sample of images can be considered. Square grids provide a practical sampling frame for VHR images. When using a land cover map as pseudo-truth, the sampling variance is easily assessed but may be overestimated if the land cover map has a coarse resolution. To estimate the potential sampling variance of a cluster sampling scheme, we propose a method based on intra-cluster correlation (ICC) computed from a correlogram. The ‘equivalent number of points’ is a useful indicator to quantify cost-efficiency of sites of a given size. We obtained poor efficiency results for area estimation of major land cover types in the European Union (EU) with a sample of 10 km × 10 km sites, but results are more encouraging for classes with a more scattered layout or for land cover change.";"Gallego, Francisco Javier";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400107128";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2011.602993";"";"";"";"1868-1880"

It extends the land change record to 2008 using Chinese–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS)-2 and CBERS-2B data on a multi-scene level. It also establishes a methodology to correct for systematic distortion inherent in CBERS imagery without the loss of information present in Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery post-2003. Image analysis focuses on a 63 000 km² strip of land along a main highway and railroad in southeastern Bolivia named the Corredor Bioceánico. This strip of land is one of the most important agriculturally driven deforestation hotspots in Latin America. It is also located in one of the most poorly understood forest biomes in the world in terms of LULCC – Southern Hemisphere seasonally dry tropical forests – which have very high conservation values globally. Over the 33-year study period, approximately 12 000 km² of forest was lost among the three sub-regions – which is an area nearly the size of Connecticut. Evidence suggests that agriculture-driven deforestation is pushing into sensitive areas threatening globally important ecosystems such as those in the Chaco, Chiquitano and Pantanal as well as noteworthy protected areas. The results also show that imagery of CBERS-2 and CBERS-2B can help to fill the imagery gap created by Landsat ETM's Scan Line Corrector (SLC) failure in 2003.

As part of our analysis we also tested the ability of MODIS to capture inter-annual variability in yields. Our results show that the MODIS two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) provides a better basis for predicting maize yields relative to the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of information related to crop phenology derived from MODIS significantly improved model performance within and across years. Surprisingly, using moderate spatial resolution data from the MODIS Land Cover Type product to identify agricultural areas did not degrade model results relative to using higher-spatial resolution crop-type maps developed by the USDA. Correlations between vegetation indices and yield were highest 65–75 days after greenup for maize and 80 days after greenup for soybeans. EVI2 was the best index for predicting maize yield in non-semi-arid counties (R²=0.67), but the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed better in semi-arid counties (R²=0.69), probably because the NDWI is sensitive to irrigation in semi-arid areas with low-density agriculture. NDVI and EVI2 performed equally well predicting soybean yield (R²=0.69 and 0.70, respectively). In addition, EVI2 was best able to capture large negative anomalies in maize yield in 2005 (R²=0.73). Overall, our results show that using crop phenology and a combination of EVI2 and NDWI have significant benefit for remote sensing-based maize and soybean yield models.";"Bolton, Douglas K.

To determine vegetation response to fuel reduction by tree mastication (shredding) or seeding and then shredding, we measured cover for shrub and herbaceous functional groups on shredded and adjacent untreated areas on 44 sites in Utah. We used mixed model analysis of covariance to determine significant differences among ecological site type (expansion and tree climax) and treatments across a range of pretreatment tree cover as the covariate. Although expansion and tree climax sites differed in cover values for some functional groups, decreasing understory cover with increasing tree cover and increased understory cover with tree reduction was similar for both ecological site types. Shrub cover decreased by 50% when tree cover exceeded 20%. Shredding trees at â¤ 20% cover maintained a mixed shrub (18.6% cover)âperennial herbaceous (17.6% cover) community. Perennial herbaceous cover decreased by 50% when tree cover exceeded 40% but exceeded untreated cover by 11% (20.1% cover) when trees were shredded at 15â90% tree cover. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) cover also increased after tree shredding or seeding and then shredding but was much less dominant (<10% cover) where perennial herbaceous cover exceeded 42%. Sites with high cheatgrass cover on untreated plots had high cheatgrass cover on shredded and seeded-shredded plots. Seeding and then shredding decreased cheatgrass cover compared with shredding alone when implemented at tree cover â¥ 50%. Vegetation responses to shredding on expansion sites were generally similar to those for tree cutting treatments in the SageSTEP study. Shredding or seeding and then shredding should facilitate wildfire suppression, increase resistance to weed dominance, and lead toward greater resilience to disturbance by increasing perennial herbaceous cover.";"Bybee, Jordan

Land management agencies are considering translocation programs to restore populations to areas from which they have been extirpated. For these conservation efforts to be successful, long-term posttranslocation monitoring is necessary to ensure that translocated individuals behave and use habitat similarly to unmanipulated individuals. We conducted a 3-yr radiotelemetry study of a potential source population of ornate box turtles to provide baseline data on home range size and site fidelity pretranslocation. Adult males and females did not differ in minimum convex polygon home range size (mean 4.0Â ha), 95% fixed kernel home ranges (mean 2.6Â ha), or 50% fixed kernel home ranges (mean 0.4Â ha). Both sexes showed high site fidelity to annual home ranges and to previously used overwintering sites, although distance between subsequent overwintering sites was less for females than for males. At our study site, ornate box turtles have relatively small home ranges and exhibit strong site fidelity. Translocation programs for this species should closely monitor movements of translocated individuals to assess whether they are successfully establishing new home ranges or attempting to return to their site of origin. Moreover, the high site fidelity exhibited by this species suggests that newly translocated individuals may be at increased mortality risk because they are unfamiliar with suitable overwintering and/or nesting sites in their new location. The results of our study will be used to ensure that sites to which animals are translocated are comparable to the site of origin in terms of home range size requirements and important habitat features. In addition, our data serve as a critical baseline to which the habitat use and movement patterns of monitored animals posttranslocation can be directly compared to assess the success of the translocation.";"Refsnider, Jeanine M.

The energy ecological footprint is calculated in terms of the area of the land which would be used for reforestation in order to assimilate CO₂ emissions from fossil energy consumption for hydropower development. The arable land occupation footprint is calculated in terms of the area of the land to be inundated by hydropower development. The calculated energy ecological footprint was 502 422 ha in 2010 or about 0.3% of total arable land in China and the calculated inundated land was about 1.42×10⁶ ha or about 1.2% of total arable land in China. The regional power grid baseline method was used to calculate the greenhouse gas emission reduction. Results indicated that CO₂ emission reduction from hydropower development was increasing rapidly since 1949 and reached 5.02×10⁸ tons of CO₂ emission in 2010, with an accumulative total of 6.221×10⁹ tons of CO₂ emission during the period 1949–2010.";"Chunxia, Lu

"AGRIS:US201600099664";"Demographic Changes Drive Woody Plant Cover Trends—An Example from the Great Plains☆";"";"Woody plant encroachment—the conversion of grasslands to woodlands—continues to transform rangelands worldwide, yet its causes and consequences remain poorly understood. Despite this being a coupled human-ecological phenomenon, research to date has tended toward ecological aspects of the issue. In this paper, we provide new insight into the long-term relationships between human demographics and woody plant cover at the landscape scale. We used time-series aerial imagery and historical census data to quantify changes in population, land ownership patterns, and woody cover between 1937 and 2012 in three different settings in central Texas, USA. Woody cover closely paralleled population in a semi-urban watershed (R² = 0.81) and two separate clusters of rural watersheds (R² = 0.88 and 0.93), despite exhibiting very different directional trends over time in each setting. Woody cover also closely tracked average farm size in each rural watershed cluster (R² = 0.57 and 0.90). These results highlight a tight coupling between demographic trends and the extent of woody plant cover. Such human factors may explain a great deal of woody plant cover patterns in other global rangeland systems with similar historical contexts and serve as a predictive proxy of landscape trends. Accordingly, policy recommendations should consider these demographic factors, and future woody plant encroachment research should explicitly include human dimensions.";"Berg, Matthew D.

"AGRIS:US201600099667";"China's Rangeland Management Policy Debates: What Have We Learned?☆";"";"In China, three major rangeland management policies have caused dramatic social, economic, and ecological changes for pastoral regions in the past 30 yr: the Rangeland Household Contract Policy (RHCP), Rangeland Ecological Construction Projects (RECPs), and the Nomad Settlement Policy (NSP). The impacts of these policies are greatly debated. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of academic perspectives on the impacts of the three policies and the causes of ineffective and negative effects. The findings demonstrate that academics increasingly report negative impacts of RHCP on the ecosystem, animal husbandry, pastoralist livelihoods, and pastoral society. An increasing number of scholars, although not the majority, attribute the negative impacts to improper policy itself rather than incomplete implementation. Regarding the RECPs, most academics believe that policies have improved the rangeland ecosystem but with obvious negative impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and pastoral society; they attribute the problems to incomplete policy implementation. For the NSP, most academics report positive impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and animal husbandry, although recent researchers have identified negative impacts on pastoral society and the ecosystem. Although they are not in the mainstream, more and more academics attribute the negative impacts to improper policy. Finally, we apply the concept of coupled social-ecological systems (SES) to further analyze the outcomes of these three policies and propose a more flexible and inclusive land tenure policy that recognizes the diverse local institutional arrangements; an integrated RECP framework that considers coadaptation between social and ecological systems; and facilitating voluntary choice in nomad settlement and developing innovative approaches to provide social services for pastoralists who would like to remain in pastoral areas. As these three policy approaches are applied in rangeland management and pastoral development worldwide, this paper may provide useful implications for future policy development in pastoral regions on a global scale.";"Gongbuzeren

Climate change affects various aspects of human–environmental interactions, such as water stress, food security, human health, and well-being at multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, the existing protocols of vulnerability assessment fail to incorporate the multitude of scales associated with climate change processes. Changing trends in the Aral Sea basin are driven by multiple interconnected factors, such as changes in the global atmospheric circulation associated with the GHG-enhanced warming, regional hydrological and hydrometeorological changes caused by mountain-glacial melting and massive irrigation, land-use and land-cover changes, as well as hydrological, biogeochemical, and meso- and microclimatic changes in the remains of the Aral Sea and its exposed dry bottom. This review examines the role of scale in the assessment human vulnerability to climate change and offers a multi-scale approach to vulnerability assessment. In addition to the global climate change impacts, it takes into account regional and local land-use and land-cover changes, social, cultural, political, and institutional factors.";"Lioubimtseva, Elena";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2015-12-31";"en";"land cover;climate change;land use;food security";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Land & Food Security";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500183421";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3104-1";"";"";"";"719-729"
"AGRIS:US201600112641";"Effect of farming strategies on environmental impact of intensive dairy farms in Italy";"";"Agriculture and animal husbandry are important contributors to global emissions of greenhouse (GHG) and acidifying gases. Moreover, they contribute to water pollution and to consumption of non-renewable natural resources such as land and energy. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology allows evaluation of the environmental impact of a process from the production of inputs to the final product and to assess simultaneously several environmental impact categories among which GHG emissions, acidification, eutrophication, land use and energy use. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate, using the LCA methodology, the environmental impact of milk production in a sample of 41 intensive Italian dairy farms and to identify, among different farming strategies, those associated with the best environmental performances. The functional unit was 1 kg Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM). Farms showed characteristics of high production intensity: FPCM, expressed as tonnes per hectare, was 30·8±15·1. Total GHG emission per kg FPCM at farm gate was 1·30±0·19 kg CO₂ eq. The main contributors to climate change potential were emissions from barns and manure storage (50·1%) and emissions for production and transportation of purchased feeds (21·2%). Average emission of gases causing acidification to produce 1 kg FPCM was 19·7±3·6 g of SO₂ eq. Eutrophication potential was 9·01±1·78 ${\rm PO}_{\rm 4}^{{\rm 3} -} {\rm eq}.$ per kg FPCM on average. Farms from this study needed on average 5·97±1·32 MJ per kg FPCM from non-renewable energy sources. Energy consumption was mainly due to off-farm activities (58%) associated with purchased factors. Land use was 1·51±0·25 m² per kg FPCM. The farming strategy based on high conversion efficiency at animal level was identified as the most effective to mitigate the environmental impact per kg milk at farm gate, especially in terms of GHG production and non-renewable energy use per kg FPCM.";"Guerci, Matteo

"AGRIS:US201500073158";"effect of fireline intensity on woody fuel consumption in southern Australian eucalypt forest fires";"";"Summary The relationship between woody fuel consumption and fireline intensity was assessed using data collected at controlled fires and wildfires in south-western Western Australia, central Victoria and south-eastern New South Wales. The combined dataset consisted of fires in a range of dry eucalypt forests. Fire behaviour varied from slow, self-extinguishing prescribed burns to intense, fast—moving fires burning under conditions of extreme fire danger. Fireline intensity ranged from 50 kW m⁻ˡ to <31000 kW m⁻¹. Woody fuel consumption ranged from 31% to 100%, and generally increased with fire intensity. Percentage consumption was highest for small woody fuels where the diameter was between 0.6 cm and 2.5 cm. Fireline intensity had a statistically significant, positive relationship with the proportion of woody fuel consumed by both controlled fires and wildfires. Two generalised linear models (GLM) describing woody fuel consumption as a function of fireline intensity were developed, one applicable to the prescribed fire environment (with fireline intensities typically < 750 kW m⁻¹) and the other to the full range of fireline intensities. The prescribed burning model produced the best fit and lowest error statistics.The findings of this research have important practical implications for the management of fire to reduce fuel loads, maintain habitat and manage carbon stocks in fire-prone eucalypt forests. The woody fuel consumption models presented may assist the assessment of potential climate change impacts on coarse woody debris in Australian southern eucalypt forests. The results of this research suggest that predicted changes to fire regimes and fire intensity associated with climate change in southern Australia could result in greater woody fuel consumption and carbon release during bushfires and a reduction in woody fuel loads in dry eucalypt forests. Use of low-intensity prescribed fires may provide a practical way of managing woody fuel stocks to achieve particular land management objectives.";"Hollis, J. J.

Melaleuca quinquenervia (Melaleuca) is an invasive, non-native, broad-leaved tree that aggressively displaces native plant communities in south Florida. We used land-cover maps to document changes in plant communities and radio-telemetry data to compare habitat selection and mean home-range size of the endangered Puma concolor coryi (Florida Panther) within Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP) during a Melaleuca removal project's removal phase (1991â1997) and the ensuing maintenance and habitat recovery phase (1998â2006). During the removal phase, Panthers incorporated areas infested by Melaleuca as components of their home range. Following >99.9% removal of Melaleuca, we documented pronounced increases in total cover of native upland forest (227%), wetland forest (211%), and prairie (54%) communities. During the habitat recovery phase, Panther habitat selection in the study area included significantly more upland forest within home-range core areas, and mean home-range size contracted by 16%. However, similar reductions in mean home-range size were not observed during the same time period for the regional population of radio-collared Panthers occupying contiguous conservation lands in south Florida. Although our findings are correlational and do not demonstrate cause and effect, the increase in native plant community cover, the increased use of native plant communities by Panthers, and the reduction in mean home-range size following the removal of Melaleuca are consistent with what would be expected if improvements in habitat quality reduced Panther home-range size requirements. Restoration of native plant communities and particularly native forest types, therefore, may have improved habitat quality for the Florida Panther and resulted in smaller home-range sizes and a potential increase in carrying capacity within BCNP.";"Julian, Paul

"AGRIS:US201301554680";"Fire and its management in central Australia";"";"Over the last 130 years, patterns of land use in central Australia have altered dramatically, and so too have fire regimes and fire management objectives. Although Aboriginal people still have tenure over large parts of the landscape, their lifestyles have changed. Most Aboriginal people now live in towns and settlements and, although fire management is still culturally important, the opportunities for getting out on country to burn are constrained. Large parts of the landscape are now used for pastoral production. Under this land use the management objective is often one of fire exclusion. The other large-scale land use is for conservation. Here, fire management has a greater focus on conserving biodiversity using various burning strategies. In this paper we explore contemporary fire regimes in central Australia. Widespread fire events are found to be associated with two or more consecutive years of above-average rainfall. Although most of the fires linked with these high rainfall periods occur during the warmer months, in recent times these fires have exhibited increased activity during the cooler months. There has been a concomitant increase in the number and size of these fires and in the number of fires associated with roads. We also explored current fire management issues on Aboriginal, pastoral and conservation lands. Current fire management goals are not being wholly met on any of these land tenures in central Australia and social conflict sometimes emerges as a result. There are overlaps in management aims, issues and the under-achievement of desired outcomes across the land tenures which lead us to five key recommendations for improving fire management outcomes in central Australia. We finish with some comments on associated opportunities for livelihood enhancement based on the management of fire.";"Edwards, G.P.

"AGRIS:US201500199151";"Methodology for land use change scenario assessment for runoff impacts: A case study in a north-western European Loess belt region (Pays de Caux, France)";"";"Changes of agricultural land use often induce changes in hydrological behavior of watersheds. Hence, effective information regarding runoff responses to future land use scenarios provides useful support for decision-making in land use planning and management. The objective of this study is to develop a methodology to assess land use change scenario impacts on runoff at the watershed scale. This objective implies translating qualitative information from scenarios into quantitative input parameters for biophysical models. To do so, qualitative information from scenarios should be quantified and spatialized. The approach is based on the combination of 2015 local land use change scenarios (SYSPHAMM method) based on local stakeholders expertise, a model of spatio-temporal allocation of crops to fields (LandSFACTS model) and a watershed runoff model (STREAM model). The study was conducted for regions underlain by silty loamy soils scattered across Northern Europe. It was applied on the Saussay watershed in Upper Normandy (France). The approach is illustrated through runoff assessment of one of the land use change scenarios (characterized by the ending of the set-aside obligation and the disappearance of dairy farming). This scenario appeared relevant for local stakeholders. The methodology presented suggests that assessing local land use scenarios in terms of runoff requires taking into account crop allocation diversity allowed by farmers' decision rules. This requirement accounts for runoff variability at the watershed outlet since crops spatial distribution throughout the watershed, depending on farmers' specific decision rules (i.e. cropping systems), strongly condition runoff phenomenon. Besides, choices regarding scenario implementation (quantification and spatialization) should to be made according to those cropping systems. Accordingly, taking into account crop allocation diversity due to farmers' cropping systems shows that there is a variability in terms of runoff at the watershed outlet (from 19 478m³ to 35 004m³ for the winter period and a low-intensity rainfall event for example). This variability can then be explored with local decision makers with the aim of finding solutions reducing runoff risks. The proposed approach provides a useful source of information for assessing the responses of surface runoff of future land use changes. Such scenarios providing impact assessment on runoff should encourage both local policy makers and local actors to actively discuss the future of land use in Upper Normandy.";"Ronfort, C.

In doing so, we uncover areas of consensus regarding valued practices as well as tensions between employees with different roles in NEPA compliance. General consensus exists regarding the importance of the effective functioning of interdisciplinary teams, but opinions about what constitutes an effective team vary.

Soil and vegetation were randomly sampled along transects located in three ranches and adjacent communal grazing land in 2009 and 2010. Our results showed that grazing management systems did not consistently affect soil texture, organic carbon, pH and bulk density. The soil characteristics such as soil carbon and clay content were strongly associated with variation in rainfall, and contributed to improved rangeland condition characterised by high herbaceous biomass and low bush encroachment. Livestock grazing management systems do not impact soil and vegetation properties differently as indicators of degradation are observed in both grazing systems. Thus, there is a need to develop a sustainable land management model that will improve soil carbon, increase herbaceous biomass and generally improve the condition of rangelands in Botswana.";"Kgosikoma, Olaotswe E

However, many semi-arid ecoregions such as the dry Chaco are characterized by a mosaic of different land covers, including natural grasslands and woody vegetation with different degrees of transformation, frequently aimed at meat production. We analyzed the associations between avian biodiversity and meat productivity of forest, natural grasslands, three types of livestock production systems, and soybean crops in northern Argentina dry Chaco; an area of c. 19 millionha characterized by high conservation value and rapid land use change. A Generalized Lineal Model analysis of reports and publications quantified a meat productivity range in which soybean (the less diverse land cover type) doubles the most efficient livestock systems, and is eight times more productive than the widespread puestos system. A multidimensional scaling ordination identified two independent gradients of bird's response to increasing land use intensity, respectively from protected forests and from natural grasslands, to highly transformed systems. Along both gradients avian richness and density sharply declined in the transition from semi-natural land covers to planted pastures and similarity to native grasslands and protected forests decreased exponentially. Along the “grasslands gradient”, bird richness and density presented a unimodal response. Maximum likelihood-fitted curves of bird's guilds response to the productivity gradients showed that in the “forest gradient” most guilds decreased exponentially or linearly, whereas in the “grasslands gradient” most guilds peaked at intermediate levels of meat yield. Our results suggest that land sparing strategies can be more efficient to balance agriculture production with the conservation of forest avian diversity, but also that the prevailing “forest oriented” conservation schemes (e.g. Argentine Forest Law) do not capture the complexity of the system and both forests and grassland gradients should be considered in land use planning, possibly including a combination of conservation strategies.";"Macchi, Leandro

The National Department of Agriculture has set a general stocking rate of 60 ha LSU ⁻¹ as a guideline for livestock on natural veld in the Little Karoo, which equates to 22.8 ha ostrich ⁻¹. The aim of this review is to examine the scientific principles, data and assumptions the current recommended stocking rate for breeding ostriches on natural veld in the Little Karoo is based on and to investigate if there is a stocking rate (or range of stocking rates) that has been demonstrated to be ecologically and/or economically sustainable. We found no evidence that the recommended stocking rate of 22.8 ha ostrich ⁻¹ is economically or ecologically sustainable in the Little Karoo. Most studies only addressed a single dimension of sustainability, and stocking rates deemed to be economically sustainable were several times higher than ecologically based recommendations. Given that economic and ecological objectives appear irreconcilable on open veld, an industry switch from extensive to intensive breeding practices may be a solution.

Inappropriate clearing, and also the dieback of large stands of A. marina associated with pollution, have created an interest in methods for revegetation and also the need for a better understanding of the species physiological tolerances including to herbicide residue. Eco-toxicological studies have so far been exclusively on seedlings because of perceived difficulties cultivating mature plants in controlled environments. Reforestation projects are often associated with low rates of establishment, because of the susceptibility of propagules, seedlings and saplings to wind and wave erosion, as well as flooding and desiccation associated with the natural inter-tidal environment. We report on the successful excavation, and cultivation in containers with an automated irrigation system of eight mature A. marina plants. It is possible to transplant mature mangroves and achieve significant vegetative growth and also flowering and fruiting within the first year. It is difficult to compare the likely costs of transplanting a more limited number of mature plants to many propagules. However, we suggest that in situations where reforestation with young propagules, seedlings or saplings has failed because of excessive wash, drowning or smothering, the transplanting of mature mangroves could be a better option.";"Abbot, John

A majority of respondents (95%) allowed/practiced some hunting on their lands. About 55% of respondents indicated that the potential existed for developing a fee hunting market associated with in-field shelterbelts. Intangible features of hunting, such as recreation/enjoyment and better land stewardship, were ranked higher than tangible ones--additional income and provision of economic opportunities for local communities. Respondents were highly concerned with negative consequences of hunting--trespassing and hunter misconduct. On average, agricultural landowners were willing to accept (WTA) US$30 per visit per party of four hunters to allow hunting of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) on their land. About 33% would grant access to hunters free of charge. Those who lived in urban areas would require five times the monetary compensation (US$50) as those who lived in rural areas (US$10).";"Grala, Robert K.

This study evaluates the experiences of farmers participating in a native species reforestation initiative in rural Panama to identify lessons learned that can guide on-going or future tree planting efforts. Based on the results of a questionnaire administered to program participants and non-participants (n = 68), we found that trees are important to farmers for multiple reasons, primary a variety of environmental and economic benefits. No relationship between the size of landholdings or land tenure status and the desire to plant trees was found. All participants in the program considered their experience to be positive, few had problems with their plantations, and most were interested in planting more native trees. The program's frequent and ongoing technical support was an important factor for farmers. These results indicate widespread interest in, and success with, planting native species and underscore the need to systematically examine farmers' interests and perceptions when planning, implementing, and evaluating reforestation initiatives.";"Garen, Eva J.

It also examined the relationship among these soil quality indicators. Faunal density and QBS-ar were significantly higher during the post-monsoon season when compared with the pre-monsoon season. Faunal population density during both the seasons was higher on the northern rather than southern slope aspects. Faunal density was significantly higher in the forest when compared with agricultural land in both the seasons. Soil moisture was positively correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC) and population density, but negatively correlated with soil temperature during the pre-monsoon period. In the post-monsoon season, bulk density was negatively correlated with QBS-ar and population density. Season, slope aspect and land use all had significant effects on the soil quality indicators. This study suggests that high SOC, moisture content and low bulk density lead to increases in population density of soil mesofauna and the QBS-ar index. Therefore, management practices that enhance SOC contents through plant residue retention on farm land, such as farmyard manure application, crop residue mulching and reduced tillage, could increase the numbers and diversity of soil organisms while improving the fertility and productivity of the land.";"Begum, Farida

"AGRIS:US201301671962";"Abrupt change of runoff and its major driving factors in Haihe River Catchment, China";"";"Runoff in Haihe River Catchment of China is steadily declining due to climate change and human activity. Determining abrupt changes in runoff could enhance identification of the main driving factors for the sudden changes. In this study, the sequential Mann-Kendall test analysis is used to determine abrupt changes in runoff in eight sub-catchments of Haihe River Catchment, while trend analysis via the traditional Mann-Kendall test for the period 1960-1999 is used to identify the basic trend of precipitation and runoff. The results suggest an insignificant change in precipitation and a significant decline in runoff in five of the eight sub-catchments. For most of the sub-catchments, abrupt changes in runoff occurred in 1978-1985. Through correlation comparisons for precipitation and runoff for the periods prior to and after abrupt runoff changes, human activity, rather than climatic change, is identified as the main driving factor of runoff decline. It is also noted that abrupt decline in runoff was actually at the beginning of China's 1978-1985 land reform. Given that the land reform motivated farmers to productively manage their reallocated lands, agricultural water use therefore increased. Hence percent agricultural land is analyzed in relation to land use/cover pattern for the late 1970s and early 1980s. The analysis shows that when cultivated farmland exceeds 25% of a sub-catchment area, an abrupt decline in runoff occurs. It is therefore concluded that high percent agricultural land and related agricultural water use are the most probable driving factors of runoff decline in the catchment.";"Yang, Yonghui

Carbon (C) losses at the catchment scale largely depend on land use and management practices. In “Abelar” farm (A Coruña, NW Spain), swine slurry was directly discharged during a period of about 30 years onto agricultural maize fields and rangeland under cattle production. In 1998, the agricultural fields and rangeland were planted to stands of Eucalyptus globulus . The purpose of this work was to assess the concentrations and losses of total, inorganic, and organic carbon at the outlet of a small catchment (10.7 ha) in the period from March 2007 to December 2010. Nearly 190 water samples were collected; specifically eleven in 2007, sixty-eight in 2008, fifty-six in 2009, and fifty-three in 2010. Total runoff volumes from the catchment were also measured during the 3.7-year study period. Except for a peak recorded in November 2008, total carbon values (TC) ranged from 1.51 to 6.14 mg L ⁻¹, total inorganic carbon (TIC) varied between 0.54 and 3.30 mg L ⁻¹, and total organic carbon (TOC) was between 0.38 and 2.83 mg L ⁻¹; the exception was due to an occasional pig slurry discharge occurring in 2008, which drove the greatest values of the three carbon forms. The season of the year influenced concentrations of total, organic, and inorganic carbon. Total, organic, and inorganic carbon loads exported at the catchment outlet were estimated at the monthly and yearly time scales. Overall, 10 years after planting to the forest, dissolved and total carbon losses were rather small.";"Mirás-Avalos, José Manuel

We surveyed 1,093 beef cattle ranchers by mail to predict cattle rancher intentions to consider wildlife management in routine cattle management activities. We framed our survey using the theory of planned behavior, whereby attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls explain behavioral intent. Our results indicated that attitudes and subjective norms best explained rancher intentions. Wildlife agency personnel and program planners can apply these results to design new or increase participation in existing cattle rancher wildlife conservation assistance programs by fostering positive attitudes regarding the integration of wildlife management in routine cattle operations and targeting key social groups of the ranching and conservation communities.";"Willcox, Adam S.

This paper reviews three common measures used to combat and control aeolian desertification in such regions. In addition, it introduces a case study on the recovery of a degraded semi‐arid ecosystem to provide regional lessons and support theoretical and practical approaches to desertification prevention and reversal on a global scale. On the basis of the analysis and evaluation of three kinds of typical measures and one regional scale case, this study shows that human‐caused aeolian desertified land can be rehabilitated. Although the technologies and management of combating aeolian desertification in an agro‐pastoral ecotone of northern China still need further improvement through more experimentation and practical application in the future, the experience gained to date contains important lessons for the recovery of degraded land on a global scale.

The research focused on uphill skidding, as slip values measured in uphill skidding are higher than in downhill skidding. A comparisonwas made of the performance of tractors carrying equal load but equipped with mechanical and hydrostatic transmission systems. The hydrostaticdrive causes higher negative load values in downhill skidding, and slightly higher slippage. As for hydrostatic tractors, wheelslip is higher in uphill skidding than in downhill skidding. The increase in the sloping of the terrain causes wheelslip to rise progressively. When a tractor travels uphill,slip is linked to a loss of energy. Wheelslip measurements are therefore important for determining the optimum conditions for individual tractor types.";"Marence, J., Ljubljana Univ. (Slovenia). Biotechnical Fac., Forestry Dept.

"AGRIS:US201300881610";"Facilitating agroforestation of landscapes for sustainable benefits: Tradeoffs between carbon stocks and local development benefits in Indonesia according to the FALLOW model";"";"Although Indonesia has no shortage of land area that lost its forest cover before 1990 and has become the global leader in land-use based greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread expectation that the afforestation/reforestation approach to Clean Development Mechanisms (A/R CDM) could lead to sustainable development benefits has not so far materialized. The main challenges to implementation of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in (1) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM. However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization. We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51personskm⁻²) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23MgCha⁻¹ year⁻¹ over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84tCO₂ ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas. These results support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation.";"van Noordwijk, Meine

We analyzed 1458 prey items obtained from 924 pellets and 534 prey remains collected in 34 territories in west-central Korea. Diet composition differed significantly between the two habitats: diet was mainly birds (68.9% by number; 85.3% by biomass) in wetlands, but was dominated by mammals (38.7% by number; 64.7% by biomass) in non-wetlands. At the species level, ducks such as Eastern Spot-billed Ducks (Anas zonorhyncha) and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) made up 38.1% by biomass in wetlands, whereas brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were the most abundant prey by number and biomass in non-wetlands. The mean weight of prey: (a) was greater in wetlands than in non-wetlands; (b) was positively related to the density of wetlands in the study area and (c) negatively related to both the percentage of agricultural land and the density of human settlements.

"AGRIS:US201600091862";"Effect of land-use conversion on ecosystem C stock and distribution in subtropical grazing lands";"";"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Grazing lands worldwide are increasingly subjected to intensification to meet global demand for food; however, management practices intended to increase production can also affect ecosystem carbon (C) stocks. This study evaluated long-term (>22 years) ecosystem C responses to conversion of native grazing lands into more intensively managed silvopasture and sown pastures. METHODS: Above- and below-ground C pools in each land use type were evaluated. RESULTS: Silvopasture exhibited the greatest total ecosystem C stock (168 Mg ha⁻¹) compared with sown pasture and native rangeland (121 and 94 Mg ha⁻¹, respectively). This response was due to the greater aboveground biomass (59 Mg ha⁻¹ in silvopasture vs. 2.1 and 3.8 Mg ha⁻¹ in sown pasture and native rangeland, respectively), primarily from the tree component. Soil organic C (SOC) accounted for 81 and 90 % of total ecosystem C stocks in native rangeland and sown pasture, respectively, while in silvopasture SOC represented ~ 61 % of total ecosystem C. Soil organic C increased from 76 Mg ha⁻¹ in native rangeland to 110 Mg ha⁻¹ sown pasture. CONCLUSIONS: Data indicated that grazing land intensification through the adoption of proper management promoted ecosystem C primarily due to increases in SOC and the associated benefit of a greater above-ground woody biomass.";"Xu, Sutie

Callitris intratropica is a long‐lived, obligate‐seeding, fire‐sensitive overstorey conifer that typically occurs in small groves (<0.1 ha) of much higher tree densities than the surrounding, eucalypt‐dominated tropical savanna in northern Australia. We used C. intratropica groves of varying canopy cover to examine the role of feedbacks between fire and tree cover in the persistence of a fire‐sensitive tree species and the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in a highly flammable savanna. 2. We examined the population structure and floristic composition of C. intratropica groves and conducted controlled burns with Aboriginal landowners to test the prediction that groves of C. intratropica with closed canopies inhibit savanna fires by physically altering the fuel arrays below trees. We measured pre‐ and post‐burn fuel availability, the probability of burning and fire intensity along transects (55–75 m) spanning entire C. intratropica groves and extending into the surrounding savanna matrix. 3. We found that closed‐canopy groves of C. intratropica had higher densities of seedlings and saplings than open‐canopy groves and supported a distinct plant community. Closed‐canopy groves also had a lower probability of burning and less severe fires due to a lower availability of fine fuels than the surrounding savanna. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the observed regeneration within closed‐canopy C. intratropica groves within frequently burnt savanna reflects a vegetation–fire feedback. A significant, negative relationship between canopy cover and the probability of burning provides strong evidence that closed‐canopy C. intratropica groves are capable of excluding low‐intensity savanna fires, thereby enabling the persistence of patches of fire‐sensitive forest or woodland amid open, highly flammable savanna vegetation. We present our findings as evidence that alternative stable state dynamics may play a role in determining savanna diversity and structure.";"Trauernicht, Clay

"AGRIS:US2016210249";"THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY ON LIVESTOCK AND LAND-USE MANAGEMENT: THE BORANA PLATEAU, SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA";"";"The Borana people are the predominant ethnic group on the Borana Plateau in southern Ethiopia. Though traditionally transhumant pastoralists, they have recently increased their reliance on crops. Rainfall in the region averages between 353 mm to 873 mm; variability is high, with coefficients of variation ranging from .21 to .68. Anectdotal evidence implies that the vulnerability of pastoralist households to drought is increasing; stock levels increase dramatically during good rainfall years but plummet when rainfall is poor, indicating that the drought cycle is becoming more pronounced. In recent years, there has also been a dramatic increase in land allocated to crops, and land allocated to pastures that are either privatized or accessible to only a small sub-group of people. Nonetheless, the Borana are still highly dependent on access to common grazing lands, which provide the predominant source of forage and, importantly, which also provide a mechanism to reduce risk of poor rainfall in one area by allowing for mobility. Because many of the land resources are used and managed in common, it is hypothesized that one of the key determinants of the productivity and sustainability of the systems is the ability of community members to cooperate over the use and maintenance of these resources. In this paper, we develop indicators of cooperation and examine factors affecting these indicators. We then use these indicators to determine the impact of cooperation on stock densities and land allocation patterns. Results indicate that cooperation is positively related to factors that increase the profitability of livestock, but negatively related to the total number of households, the use of community pastures by non-community members, and heterogeneity of wealth within the community. Furthermore, stock densities are negatively related to the index of cooperation as we would expect. Stock densities are also lower in areas with more highly variable rainfall indicating that high variability reduces the number of livestock held, contrary to the oft- mentioned hypothesis that households build greater stockholdings in areas were rainfall is highly variable in order to survive a drought with more animals. Finally, results from the land allocation estimations give evidence to support the notion that more land is privatized - either for crops or pasture - where levels of cooperation are lower. Given the importance of mobility and the poor suitability of most land for cropping, measures to offset the increasing densities and land privatization should focus on improving the capacity of communities to cooperate and mitigate the impact of heterogeneity on that capacity, and on improving market access to improve cooperation and increase incentives to sell stock in good as well as poor rainfall years. Results also highlight the need to search for alternative policy mechanisms that mitigate the impact of drought, but that do not simultaneously increase incentives to increase herd levels in non-drought years.";"McCarthy, Nancy

This study was conducted to evaluate Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) remote sensing data as auxiliary variables for spatial estimation of surface soil texture using a limited number of soil samples taken from a site located in the city of PingduShandong ProvinceChina. Three methods of evaluating variability in surface soil texture were evaluated: (1) multiple stepwise regression (MSR) based on the relationship between surface soil sandsilt and clay contents and remote sensing data; (2) kriging of surface soil sandsilt and clay contents; (3) cokriging with remote sensing data. Correlation analysis showed that surface soil sandsilt and clay contents were significantly correlated with Landsat ETM digital number (DN) of six bands (Bands 1–5 and Band 7)and the DN of Band 7 explained most of the variability in soil sandsilt and clay contents. The DN of Band 7 was selected as auxiliary data for the estimation of surface soil texture. The cross-validation results indicated that both MSR and kriged estimates had low reliability due to the variations in landscape and the low-density sampling in the study area. Cokriging with remote sensing data significantly improves estimates of surface soil texture compared with MSR and kriging.";"Liao, Kaihua

"AGRIS:US201500217328";"Security and equity of conservation covenants: Contradictions of private protected area policies in Australia";"";"Private land conservation is becoming a popular policy approach, given the constraints of increasing public protected areas, which include reduced availability of land for purchase, insufficient budgets for acquisition, and escalating management costs of small, isolated reserves. Conservation covenants represent a common policy instrument, now prominent in the United States, Canada and Australia, employed to compliment the protected area network. When ‘topsoil’ and subsoil, or ‘mineral’ use rights are decoupled, however, the security of covenants can become threatened if the country's economic policies take priority over conservation policies and mining is permitted where covenants exist. We discuss this issue on a theoretical level, examining four potential scenarios in which use rights are decoupled or coupled. We demonstrate that decoupled use rights can create an imbalance in the costs and benefits, to landholders and the government, from conservation and mining activities on private properties. We then present a case study in Queensland, Australia, in which the discrepancy of biodiversity and mining policies is directly threatening the ecological outcomes of conservation covenants on private land. We also reflect on our own personal research with landholders in Queensland to highlight the social consequences of such a policy position on the ability of State and Federal Governments to meet their policy commitments. The conflicts we identify can be used to improve the transparency of private land conservation.";"Adams, Vanessa M.

"AGRIS:US201400056043";"Collective management on communal grazing lands: Its impact on vegetation attributes and soil erosion in the upper Blue Nile basin, northwestern Ethiopia";"";"Collective action, on communal grazing land, has evolved in the highlands of northwestern Ethiopia to mitigate the problems of feed shortage and land degradation due to overgrazing. The exercise is liked by farmers for improving the availability of natural pasture during the long dry season when other feed sources get depleted. However, large portions of the communal grazing lands are still managed under free grazing throughout the year. This study was undertaken in Maynet village in the upper Blue Nile basin, northwestern Ethiopia, to assess the impacts of three different types of grazing land management (GLM) and two slope gradients (<10%; 15–25%) on aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, ground cover, species richness, runoff, soil loss and soil bulk density of grazing lands. The GLMs include (a) freely open communal GLM, (b) restricted communal GLM – collective management of communal grazing land locally named as ‘yebere sar’ and (c) private holding GLM. Stocking density was more than carrying capacity of grazing lands across all GLMs. However, the extent of overstocking problem was exceptionally severe in freely open communal GLM. The interaction between GLM and slope was significant (P<0.05) for runoff, soil loss and runoff coefficient. The average runoff coefficient was close to 50% in freely open communal GLM on steeper slopes (15–25%). Freely open communal GLM on steeper slopes resulted in consistently highest cumulative runoff and soil loss amounting to 491mm and 32t/ha per year, respectively. Polynomial regression analysis showed that quadratic relationship (r²=0.87) existed between soil loss and runoff. But, soil loss was close to nil when runoff did not exceed 2mm per rainfall event. As expected, restricted communal GLM appeared to reduce surface runoff by more than 40% and curb the rate of soil erosion by more than 50% compared to freely open communal GLM. Its vegetation cover persisted above 70% throughout the year, meeting the threshold level recommended to keep surface runoff and soil loss to minimum. Reducing the problem of overstocking and pasture resting in August–November are important components to improve ground cover and aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, which in turn reduce land degradation on grazing lands.";"Alemayehu, Mengistu

"AGRIS:US2012210404";"LOCAL SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM - SUMMARY";"";"The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), first enacted in 1985, seeks to achieve both conservation and agricultural supply control objectives through voluntary, long-term (10 year contracts) retirement of cropland.  By fall 2000, the program had enrolled about 31.4 million acres nationwide, and North Dakota ranked third among the states, with 3.2 million contracted acres, or 11 percent of the state's total cropland.  Although long-term land retirement offers a variety of environmental benefits, as well as providing a stable income to participating landowners, large-scale land retirement can pose adverse economic impacts for nearby communities, primarily because agricultural supply and service sector businesses may be adversely affected.  This study was undertaken to examine the local socioeconomic effects of the Conservation Reserve Program in rural areas of North Dakota.

Interviews with agricultural and community leaders in six rural areas of North Dakota revealed that the CRP was perceived to have both positive and negative effects.  The program was considered a substantial benefit to landowners, providing them with a guaranteed income from some of their least productive land.  In addition, the environmental benefits of the program, including reduced soil erosion, improved water quality, and enhanced wildlife populations, were widely recognized.  Negative effects cited by the leaders focused on the adverse impacts of cropland retirement on the farm supply and service sector and the role of the CRP in declining farm numbers and rural depopulation.  

A survey of more than 1,000 CRP contract holders provided additional perspective regarding the program's effects.  Leading reasons for enrolling land in the CRP were to reduce erosion/increase soil fertility (24%), reduce income risk (23%), CRP was economically attractive (22%), and provide a transition to retirement (11%).  The contract holders also reported that the land they enrolled in the CRP had lower yields than other land in the area, by an average of 5 percent.  Forty-two percent of the respondents had enrolled 150 acres or less and only 21 percent had enrolled more than 450 acres.  Of the contract holders who had once farmed but were no longer farming, only 23 percent indicated that the CRP influenced their decision to quit farming.  On the other hand, of the respondents who were currently farming, 31 percent indicated that the CRP had been instrumental in keeping them on the farm.

When the leaders were asked for suggestions to improve the program, their responses reflected three major themes.  One group felt that the CRP should focus on highly erodible land and that recent changes in enrollment criteria have allowed too much productive farmland to be enrolled.  Another group of respondents argued for periodic haying of the CRP land (e.g., every third or fourth year), a measure they thought that would both improve the wildlife habitat value of the land and provide a feed base for livestock producers.  Finally, a number of leaders in each study area suggested options to increase recreational access to CRP land.  They believe that increased economic activity associated with recreational activities (primarily hunting) may offer their communities a means to offset some of the economic losses associated with land retirement.";"Hodur, Nancy M.

"AGRIS:US201500007017";"Integration of multi-disciplinary geospatial data for delineating agroecosystem uniform management zones";"";"Understanding agricultural ecosystems and their complex interactions with the environment is important for improving agricultural sustainability and environmental protection. Developing the necessary understanding requires approaches that integrate multi-source geospatial data and interdisciplinary relationships at different spatial scales. In order to identify and delineate landscape units representing relatively homogenous biophysical properties and eco-environmental functions at different spatial scales, a hierarchical system of uniform management zones (UMZ) is proposed. The UMZ hierarchy consists of seven levels of units at different spatial scales, namely site-specific, field, local, regional, country, continent, and globe. Relatively few studies have focused on the identification of the two middle levels of units in the hierarchy, namely the local UMZ (LUMZ) and the regional UMZ (RUMZ), which prevents true eco-environmental studies from being carried out across the full range of scales. This study presents a methodology to delineate LUMZ and RUMZ spatial units using land cover, soil, and remote sensing data. A set of objective criteria were defined and applied to evaluate the within-zone homogeneity and between-zone separation of the delineated zones. The approach was applied in a farming and forestry region in southeastern Ontario, Canada, and the methodology was shown to be objective, flexible, and applicable with commonly available spatial data. The hierarchical delineation of UMZs can be used as a tool to organize the spatial structure of agricultural landscapes, to understand spatial relationships between cropping practices and natural resources, and to target areas for application of specific environmental process models and place-based policy interventions.";"Liu, Huanjun

We evaluate the North Carolina's Ecosystem Enhancement Program (EEP), a state agency responsible for compensatory mitigation. We compare communities gaining and losing aquatic resources during mitigation, finding new types of socioeconomic disparities that contradict previous studies of mitigation program behavior. We find average distances between impact and mitigation sites for streams (43.53 km) and wetlands (50.3 km) to be larger in North Carolina than in off-site mitigation programs in other regions previously studied. We also find that aquatic resources in the State are lost from urbanized areas that are more affluent, white, and highly educated, and mitigated at sites in rural areas that are less affluent, less well educated, and have a higher percentage of minorities. We also analyze the relationship between urban growth indicators and EEP accumulation of compensation sites. Growth indicators and long-term population projections are uncorrelated with both projected transportation impacts and advance mitigation acquired by the EEP, suggesting that growth considerations can be more effectively incorporated into the EEP's planning process. We explore the possibility that spatial mismatches could develop between watersheds that are rapidly growing and those that are gaining mitigation. We make recommendations for ways that regulators incorporate growth indicators into the mitigation planning process.";"BenDor, Todd

In this study, we used GPS data points acquired at 5-min intervals from radiocollared pumas in southern California to model context-dependent point selection functions. We used mixed-effects conditional logistic regression models that incorporate a paired used/available design to examine the sensitivity of point selection functions to the scale of available habitat and to the behavioral state of individual animals. We compared parameter estimates, model performance, and resistance estimates across 37 scales of available habitat, from 250 to 10,000� m, and two behavioral states, resource use and movement. Point selection functions and resistance estimates were sensitive to the chosen scale of the analysis. Multiple characteristic scales were found across our predictor variables, indicating that pumas in the study area are responding at different scales to different landscape features and that multi-scale models may be more appropriate. Additionally, point selection functions and resistance estimates were sensitive to behavioral state; specifically, pumas engaged in resource use behavior had an opposite selection response to some land cover types than pumas engaged in movement behavior. We recommend examining a continuum of scales and behavioral states when using point selection functions to estimate resistance.";"Zeller, Katherine A.

A case study was conducted for classifying the land cover classes defined by the Environment Agency of Austria in the Land Information System Austria (LISA) project using WorldView-2 image.

Significant progress has been achieved in the understanding of soil hydrological behavior, despite the fact that most investigations were focused on the experimental plot scale. Although experimental plots allow exploring the effect of multiple biophysical and anthropogenic factors, they provide limited insights in the combined effect of all factors acting together at the landscape scale. In this study, area-specific sediment yields (SSY) have been estimated based on the volume of sediment trapped behind 36 check dams in the southeast of Spain. Low SSY-values were reported (mean=1.40tha⁻¹year⁻¹: median=0.61tha⁻¹year⁻¹). SSY variability could be explained for 67% by catchment characteristics such as drainage area, soil characteristics, land cover, average catchment slope, and annual rainfall. The low SSY values are probably caused by the agricultural abandonment that occurred over the past decades and allowed the recovery of natural vegetation. Furthermore, our results suggest that the soils have eroded in the past to such an extent that nowadays not much sediment is detached by overland flow due to residual enrichment of clay and stones. Also, sediment is to a large extent trapped locally in the catchment, as indicated by the negative relationship between SSY and catchment area.";"Bellin, N.

Canopy and ground cover vegetation provide a natural cushion against the impact energy of rainfall in headwater portions of a stream basin, increasing water filtration into the soil and reducing surface runoff, but effects of different vegetation types are not fully understood. We sought to evaluate the capacity of different vegetation communities to regulate surface runoff in an alpine landscape. We collected water samples for stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic analyses from precipitation, throughfall, soils, streams, and rivers and compared their isotopic signatures. Results indicated that different vegetation types had different capacities for water conservation. Forested vegetation types were best able to regulate surface runoff. Land use changes have dramatically affected water conservation in the study area in the past several decades; if forested land cover existed at the levels present in 1986 or 1974, the ability of the watershed to intercept surface runoff would increase by about 7% and 3%, respectively, over its capacity in 2000.";"Zhang, Wenguang

Their performance during the training phase is very good, and their ability to generalize can be improved by using regularization methods such as early stopping and cross-validation. In our research, two kinds of generic models are implemented: the feed-forward model and the recurrent model. At first glance, the feed-forward model would seem to be more effective than the recurrent one on non-stationary datasets, because measured information on the state of the system (measured discharge) is used as input, thereby implementing a kind of data assimilation. This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of data assimilation and adaptivity when implemented in both feed-forward and recurrent neural networks. Based on the IAHS Workshop held in Göteborg, Sweden (July 2013), the hydrological behaviour of two watersheds of different sizes and different kind of non-stationarity will be modelled: (a) the Fernow watershed (0.2 km ²) in the USA, affected by significant modifications in land cover during the study period, and (b) the Durance watershed (2170 km ²) in France, affected by an increase in temperature that is causing a decrease in the extent of glaciers. Two methods were applied to evaluate the ability of ANN to adapt on the test set: (i) adaptivity using observed data to adapt parameter values in real time; and (ii) data assimilation using observed data to modify inaccurate inputs in real time. The goal of the study is thus re-analysis and not forecasting. This study highlights how effective the feed-forward model is compared to the recurrent model for dealing with non-stationarity. It also shows that adaptivity and data assimilation improve the recurrent model considerably, whereas improvement is marginal for the feed-forward model in the same conditions. Finally, this study suggests that adaptivity is effective in the case of changing conditions of the watershed, whereas data assimilation is better in the case of climate change (inputs modification).";"Taver, V.

This framework is based on the fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted averaging (FLOWA) approach which integrates the analytical hierarchy procedure (AHP) and quantifier-guided OWA operators in an ArcGIS 9.2 environment. The FLOWA module proved to be highly flexible and efficient in generating and visualising a wide range of different multi-criteria decision strategies. Several scenarios were derived to show how the uncertainties involved in the suitability decision-making process can influence the outcomes.

With LCA the percentage of evapotranspiring surface is defined for each land use. Dimensions and densities of NUAs patches are assessed in FA.

The study area lies between Eastern Precordillera and Western Pampean ranges System. The need for a better knowledge of the territorial units is required for a sustainable development of the new agricultural farms in the southern part of the central valley of the San Juan river. The geomorphologic study combine field works with processing and interpretation of air stereo photographs and satellite images. The different landforms were arranged in 6 Great Landscape units (GP), twelve landscape units (P) and 7 sublandscape units (SP). The GP units are based on the morphogenesis, while the P units are based on altitude, topographic and location basin. The SP have minor extension relief features defined mainly by the land use. The twenty-five territorial units mapped are arranged in successive steplike levels, which facility a relative chronology. These Quaternary environmental units were collected in only four units: Q1, made up by colluvio-alluvial deposits, Q2, abandoned alluvial plain deposits (ca. 36,000 yr BP - 10,000 yr BP); Q3, aeolian sediments (3,500 yr BP - 1,400 yr BP) and Q4 present day fluvial deposits. These four geological quaternary environments were analyzed and applied them to land use and regional development.

En la región central de los Andes, coincidente con el sector oeste y centro de Argentina, se realizó el presente análisis y clasificación geomorfológica de unidades cuaternarias. La historia geológica del Cuaternario en el tramo del valle del río San Juan corresponde a una compleja interrelación entre tectonismo y procesos sedimentarios aluvio-fluviales.

"AGRIS:US201500198827";"Atmospheric mercury emissions in Australia from anthropogenic, natural and recycled sources";"";"The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has begun a process of developing a legally binding instrument to manage emissions of mercury from anthropogenic sources. The UNEP Governing Council has concluded that there is sufficient evidence of significant global adverse impacts from mercury to warrant further international action; and that national, regional and global actions should be initiated as soon as possible to identify populations at risk and to reduce human generated releases. This paper describes the development of, and presents results from, a comprehensive, spatially and temporally resolved inventory of atmospheric mercury emissions from the Australian landmass. Results indicate that the best estimate of total anthropogenic emissions of mercury to the atmosphere in 2006 was 15 ± 5 tonnes. Three industrial sectors contribute substantially to Australian anthropogenic emissions: gold smelting (∼50%, essentially from a single site/operation), coal combustion in power plants (∼15%) and alumina production from bauxite (∼12%). A diverse range of other sectors contribute smaller proportions of the emitted mercury, but industrial emissions account for around 90% of total anthropogenic mercury emissions. The other sectors include other industrial sources (mining, smelting, and cement production) and the use of products containing mercury. It is difficult to determine historical trends in mercury emissions given the large uncertainties in the data. Estimates for natural and re-emitted emissions from soil, water, vegetation and fires are made using meteorological models, satellite observations of land cover and soil and vegetation type, fuel loading, fire scars and emission factors which account for the effects of temperature, insolation and other environmental variables. These natural and re-emitted sources comfortably exceed the anthropogenic emissions, and comprise 4–12 tonnes per year from vegetation, 70–210 tonnes per year from soils, and 21–63 tonnes per year from fires.";"Nelson, Peter F.

The study particularly seeks to explore the local people’s perceptions of gully erosion and how it affects crop, settlement development, crop yields, land ownership and values, rural economics and private conservation investments in Dangara area of Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. It is based on analysis of data collected using questionnaires administered to 346 respondents in the area. The responses received for the various aspects considered in evaluating the respondents’ perspectives of the processes, causative factors, consequences and control measures of gully erosion in the study area were subjective to Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to detect and explore relationships between knowledge of causes of gully erosion and use of conservation measures. The results obtained indicated that the major factors causing erosion that the respondents identified in order of preference were climate, land cover, hydrology, land use and topography. For the processes, the main ones identified were slope wash and valley slope retreat, while all the other (including potholing, solution, hydraulic action, corrosion and attrition) ones were ranked with zero (0) scores indicating that the respondents were not aware of them. In the case of consequences of gully erosion, the MCA analysis indicated that livelihood, infrastructure, economy and social life were the main ones. For measures of controlling gully erosion, the analysis revealed that engineering, mechanical, land use control and agronomic measures were the ones being applied. The results obtained thus indicated that (1) the farmers were familiar with gully erosion but less aware of splash, stream bank, sheet and rill erosion; (2) the farmers did not fully understand the processes involved in gully erosion; (3) the respondents’ personal traits significantly influenced the level of their perception of the problem in the area; (4) only the uneducated among the respondents claimed to largely be unaware of gully problem in the area; (5) most of the respondents were aware of gully erosion-control measures such as sand filling, terracing, afforestation, planting of cover crops, grazing control and road construction control but could not adopt to them; and (6) the main control measures being adopted by the people include avoiding cultivating steep slopes, contour ploughing across slope, stopping land scarification, crop rotation, bush burning control, fallowing and strip cropping. These findings suggest that promoting gully erosion control in the area requires that adequate attention be given towards educating the people on the processes of gully development and the values of adopting new control measures as well as those they were aware of but have not been adopting. Since the farmers were not adopting some of the measures they are aware of largely due to lack of technical and financial base, there is the need for the development and adoption of strategies that could improve their technical and financial capabilities to enhance their capability for adopting them. In order to enhance capacity of the people of the studied community, there is the need to develop and adopt strategies that could improve technical and financial bases of the people in the area. It was further recommended that any policy aimed at comprehensively addressing gully erosion in the area must address the differences in people’s perception of the problem at the outset.";"Mashi, S.

"AGRIS:US201600111745";"method for assessing work productivity and flexibility in livestock farms";"";"Changes affecting livestock farming systems have made farm work a central concern for both the sector and for farmers themselves. Increased pressure on farms to be competitive and productive together with farmers’ demand for greater autonomy, holidays or time to spend on private activities and the family converge to underline the two key dimensions of work – productivity and flexibility – required for the assessment of work organization. This paper proposes a method called the QuaeWork (QUAlification and Evaluation of Work in livestock farms) to assess work productivity and flexibility on a farm, and its use to identify how livestock management can contribute to work organization on dairy farms. The QuaeWork method was set up through an iterative process combining surveys conducted with farmers in two regions of France, discussions with different experts and literature review. The QuaeWork was applied on a sample of seven dairy farms in the southern Massif Central in France to identify patterns of how livestock management contributes to work organization. The QuaeWork was used to analyse work organization over the year through a systemic approach to the farm, integrating interactions between herd and land management, workforce composition, equipment facilities and combinations of activities through a characterization of ‘who does what, when and for how long’. The criteria for assessing work productivity were work duration (routine work, seasonal work) and work efficiency (per livestock unit or hectare of utilized agricultural area). The criteria for assessing work flexibility were room for manoeuvre and adjustments to internal and external events. The three main patterns of livestock management practices to work organization were identified. In pattern-1, farmers used indoor stable feeding practices with delegated work, with moderate room for manoeuvre and efficiency. In pattern-3, farmers used simplified milking, reproduction and breeding practices to seasonalize work and make it efficient with consistent room for manoeuvre. The method suggests social sustainability criteria to assess work productivity and flexibility, which are important for making reasoned decisions on livestock farm changes, especially innovations. Researchers could usefully exploit the QuaeWork to integrate work objectives (productivity, flexibility) into technical and economic goals.";"Hostiou, N.

Ambiguity in wording can result in the use of information that does not necessarily reflect visitors’ true WTP.  For example, depending on the specificity of the verbiage used, respondents may answer questions on a group basis, rather than an individual basis.  To address this issue, experimental surveys were distributed with questions that specifically asked WTP on a per person basis, as compared to control surveys in which the WTP question was more generally worded.  Analyses show WTP responses for either survey type are statistically different, with non-overlapping confidence intervals.  Furthermore, approaches were conducted to correct for potential differences in interpretation, in the event that control survey respondents answered for the group as opposed to answering as an individual.   Each method yielded different results, with non-overlapping confidence intervals.  The lack of consensus between results indicates that there is a high level of variance in visitor’s interpretation of dichotomous choice questions.  Therefore, it is necessary to use specific verbiage when designing surveys, to ensure responses to WTP dichotomous choice questions can be interpreted correctly by researchers.  Specifically, if researchers want respondents to answer on an individual basis, this language needs to be explicitly stated.";"Lohman, Greta

"AGRIS:US201400158927";"Assessing biodiversity conservation conflict on military installations";"";"Conflict over endangered species conservation on military lands is becoming increasingly important as militaries attempt to balance an increased operational tempo with endangered species conservation. Successfully managing this conflict has major implications for biodiversity conservation given the US military alone manages over 12 million ha of land providing habitat to hundreds of at risk species, 24 of which are endemic to military installations. This paper provides the first assessment of this issue with a qualitative study of military trainers and civilian natural resource professionals who are employed by the Department of Defense (DoD) at the interface of endangered species conservation and troop training on installations throughout the Southeastern US. Emerging conflicts over endangered species conservation on DoD lands differed from non-military contexts because military structure forced interactions into strict protocols allowing avoidance, but not direct contention. Although all informants officially stated nothing impacted training, training area supervisors described endangered species conservation the greatest threat to training they faced. Despite pointed efforts to avoid engagement and official denial that conflict existed, interactions between the groups were characterized by deindividualization and communication breakdown, residues typically associated with highly escalated conflicts. These findings suggest suppressing conflict may create the same negative outcomes typically associated with prolonged direct conflict, by denying parties the ability to resolve differences. These negative outcomes can be addressed by both acknowledging biodiversity conservation conflict exists and allowing dissent during decision-making. Improved cooperation between TASU and NRECM can help reduce impacts of warfare on wildlife conservation, while ensuring sustainability of military training on lands critical to biodiversity conservation.";"Lee Jenni, Grace D.

"AGRIS:US201300817411";"Elevated atmospheric CO₂: a nurse plant substitute for oak seedlings establishing in old fields";"";"It has been hypothesized that elevated levels of atmospheric CO₂ (eCO₂) may facilitate the encroachment of woody plants into grasslands by reducing water stress. In east-central Minnesota, sandy soils frequently create drought conditions for plants, and water limitation inhibits the establishment of oaks into old fields situated on these soils. Some have argued that eCO₂ should slow secondary succession by favoring fast-growing early successional species. However, if oak encroachment into old fields is being inhibited by water stress, then eCO₂ could accelerate old-field succession in this region. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that eCO₂ will increase the establishment success of oak seedlings in an old field environment. The study was conducted with CO₂ levels controlled by free air CO₂ enrichment (FACE). In May 1999, four oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis) acorns were planted in each of 24 plots in each of six experimental FACE rings (n= 576), three of which received elevated levels (550 ppm) of CO₂. Half the plots in each ring were weeded during the first three summers of the experiment. In summer 2000, water input was manipulated during a 3.5-week period, during which half the plots received regular watering while the other half received no water. Summer 2001 was dry, receiving 35% less rainfall than the mean level. Under hot and dry conditions, eCO₂ increased soil water levels in unweeded plots and enhanced oak establishment (survival and growth) in weeded plots. In 2006, after the eighth growing season following planting, survival was five times greater under elevated than ambient CO₂. The results showed that under hot and dry conditions, eCO₂ can act like a nurse plant for tree seedlings growing in bare and unshaded areas, increasing seedling survival and growth, and thereby expanding the establishment window for trees encroaching into a grassland environment.";"DAVIS, MARK A.

Our review begins with examination of experimental works in tropical countries and proceeds to discussion of initiatives of Indian research institutes and Government organizations towards establishing experimental watersheds to understand the impacts of land cover changes on hydrologic regimes in the Indian sub-continent. This is followed by the review of the experimental work carried out by various authors to assess the impact of land cover changes on major water balance components such as, runoff, groundwater, evapotranspiration and sediment yield. The spatial scales of these experiments have been limited to small watersheds or field plots. This paper also describes impacts of human interventions (such as plantations of exotic forest species to restore degraded landscapes) on the water balance components in diverse hydro-geo-environmental conditions in the Indian sub-continent. We focus on identifying the research areas which require immediate attention to develop tools to assist planners and policy makers in assessing and managing the water resources in these complex environments. The review is largely based on research results reported during the last 20 to 30 years.";"Venkatesh, B.

"AGRIS:US201301796707";"Accuracy and cost of models predicting bird distribution in agricultural grasslands";"";"Numerous agro-environmental indicators have been developed to assess the impact of farming systems on biodiversity. They can be combined into logistic models for predicting the presence of species of ecological interest. In general, several models are available for a given species and their practical value depends on their accuracy and the cost of measurement of their input variables. This paper aims to assess the accuracy and cost of implementation of a wide range of models predicting the presence of two grassland bird species, the lapwing Vanellus vanellus and the redshank Tringa totanus. Some of these models were developed using stepwise selection procedures and the others were developed by Bayesian Model Averaging. Sensitivity, specificity, and probability of correctly ranking fields (AUC) were estimated for each model from observational data. The cost of implementation of each model was computed as a function of the number and types of input variables. Results showed that the presence/absence of lapwings can be predicted more accurately than the presence/absence of redshanks, probably due to the stricter ecological requirements of lapwings. For both species, the highest AUC values were obtained with models combining habitat and management variables. The most costly models were not always the most accurate. Full models and models derived by Bayesian Model Averaging were most costly and less accurate than some of the models derived using selection procedures. When large sets of candidate variables were considered, the models selected using the BIC criterion were less costly and sometimes more accurate than the models selected using the AIC criterion.";"Barbottin, A.

Agriculture plays a substantial role in the balance of the most significant greenhouse gases (CO₂, N₂O, CH₄), mostly attributed to management practices. In this study, we present data on the effects of a conversion from a cropland (Zea mays L.) to N₂-fixing grassland (Medicago sativa L.) on C cycle in an agricultural area of Northern Italy. Net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) have been followed for 2 years by mesuring CO₂ fluxes by paired eddy covariance stations (EC) and continuous soil respiration measurements (SR). Root exclusion subplot replicates were also used to estimate heterotrophic respiration (Rh). The comparison between the net primary production (NPP) inventory estimation and NPP based on measured CO₂ fluxes (EC and Rh) showed excellent agreement for both land uses. An increase in NEP was observed 2 years after conversion from corn to alfalfa (+281gCm⁻²), however, in terms of NBP, maize was a lower source of C (−96gCm⁻²) than alfalfa (−354gCm⁻²). From the present study, it appears that this type of land conversion is not an effective measure of C sequestration in the short term (1-3 years).";"Alberti, Giorgio

Personal interviews were conducted with 37 ranchers. While land use conversion occurs for a wide variety of reasons, lack of heirs and detrimental public policy were important reasons given for selling ranches. Responses showed Routt County (a rapidly developing county) ranchers were more likely to sell due to land use conversion related issues than Moffat County ranchers (p = 0.056). Ranchers with a longer legacy on their land reported that profitability, having likely heirs, and continuing tradition enhanced their reasons to stay. Groups more ""at risk"" of selling were non-homesteading ranchers close to retirement, larger ranches, and ranchers dependent on ranching for income with declining profits. Large ranch owners experiencing land use conflicts with non-ranchers and ranchers modestly dependent on public forage experiencing changes in public policy regulations and land use conflicts also indicated a higher proclivity to sell. Noting how groups of ranchers are impacted by different changes can help refine community efforts related to land use conversion and create more thoughtful policy measures.";"Rowe, H.I.

"AGRIS:US201400179249";"Sustaining protected areas: Identifying and controlling deforestation and forest degradation drivers in the Ankasa Conservation Area, Ghana";"";"Although protected areas in Africa contain possibly the highest repositories of carbon and thus can play a role in mitigating the effects of climate change through carbon sequestration, they are threatened due to increasing levels of deforestation and forest degradation (DFD). However, little information is available on the on-site causes of DFD in these areas. This paper estimates the levels of DFD and identifies the drivers in the Ankasa Conservation Area (ACA) in Ghana as a case study. A survey was used to identify both direct and underlying factors that promote the DFD. The extent of deforestation was estimated using satellite images. The survey data were analyzed using rankings and ordinal logistic regression techniques, while digital image classification and change detection were used to analyze land cover changes. The results show that DFD occurred at a higher rate in the periphery of the ACA compared to the core-protected and the farthest areas. Agricultural and wood harvesting activities were the main direct causes of DFD. Poverty and large in-migrations of people for cocoa farming were important underlying economic and population growth factors. To address these problems and enable ACA to contribute more to biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, the community resource management institutions should be fully adopted and strengthened and priority given to livelihood improvement and ecosystem services provision in the periphery of the ACA.";"Damnyag, Lawrence

Ecological suitability assessment is the key to realizing sustainability and is also significant for optimizing spatial patterns of territorial development. Especially in mountainous areas where the ecosystem is both vulnerable and important, quantitative evaluation of ecological suitability for land development is particularly important and urgent given current development strategy of urban construction in mountainous areas in China. Taking Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, a representative urban construction zone in a mountainous area in Yunnan Province, China, as a study area, and based on the fundamental theory of structural and functional dynamics from landscape ecology, this study has explored the integrated ecological resistance (IER) conceptual model and constructed an index system with aspects of ecological elements, ecological importance, and ecological resilience. The results showed that: (1) the ecological suitability level was higher in the north than in the south and higher in the east than in the west, as well as higher in the Bazi region than in mountainous areas. Dali City, Binchuan County, and Xiangyun County had large ecological suitable zones for development and construction. Foci of ecological resistance having strong ecological constraints were mainly concentrated in Heqing County and in various other places; (2) by combining the integrated ecological resistance and arable land distributions, the study area was zoned into five regions: prior development zone, moderate development zone, potential development zone, restricted development zone, and forbidden development zone. Moderate, potential, and restricted development zones occupied most of the area, accounting for 28.89%, 24.69%, and 21.40%, respectively, whereas prior development zones accounted for only 8.91%; (3) based on the areal proportions of ecological suitability zoning, the 12 counties of Dali Prefecture can be grouped into three categories: prior areas for conservation, comprehensive development areas, and prior areas for development. Xiangyun County and Binchuan County should be regarded as key areas of Dali Prefecture for urban construction in mountainous areas. This research has explored an ecological suitability evaluation system from the perspective of landscape ecology and made fully understanding of ecological suitability factors in the study area, which provided a good reference to ecological suitability evaluation for mountainous area development in the worldwide.";"Peng, Jian

This research argues that a restructuring plan for the cereal-sheep system of Castile-La Mancha may represent economic and ecological synergies. The potential implementation of a technical strategy (integrating cereal and sheep farming and increasing acreage of annual forage legumes) has been tested within a community-based research project carried out over three phases. Factual and empirical structural and social data were collected, proposal of reforms were submitted for consideration to local agricultural staff and farmers, and a set of guidance standards for restructuring developed. Results showed that both cereal and sheep farming, although carried out in the same land units, were not integrated. The agropastoral system was endangered mainly because the pastoralists (sheep owners) are land-less, while the cultivators (land owners) have a low stake in the grazing operation to enforce the law. Constraints related to the labor factor were more important than grazing land availability. Young farmers rejected the current sheep operation because of the harsh working conditions. Restructuring of the grazing system would require a new legal and institutional framework, a small land redistribution plan, and anew policy scenario that would link the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) support instrument to structural reforms.";"Caballero, Rafael";"";"Food Products Press";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"farming systems;grazing lands;grazing;farmers";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500002796";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v21n03_03";"";"";"";"9-26"

Our model incorporates planting density and the level and timing of fuel reduction treatment as landowner decisions. These factors affect, among other things, the loss a landowner incurs should fire arrive before harvesting. The value of information depends on the nature and combination of mistakes a landowner makes, the relationship between fire arrival and stand age, and on whether the landowner undertakes fuel treatment and values nontimber benefits. Information of various types is of most value to a landowner who does not undertake fuel treatment. The value of information about the magnitude of fire risk is also more than twice as high when the landowner underestimates fire risk, rather than overestimating it. For a landowner who undertakes fuel treatment but makes multiple mistakes, the asymmetry between overestimating and underestimating fire risk and efficacy of fuel reduction is even more pronounced.";"Amacher, G.S.

"AGRIS:US201500002794";"Effect of forage legume incorporation on selected soil chemical properties in the northern guinea savanna of Nigeria";"";"The Nigerian savanna soils are low in fertility, organic matter and cation exchange capacity. The traditional method of improving the fertility and productivity of soils of the savanna is through natural fallowing which typically takes three to five years. The method is no longer suitable for most farmers because of the rapid growth of population in developing countries and the resulting intensive cultivation of agricultural land. In this study, a short fallow technique was adopted using forage legumes. Selected soil chemical properties were also evaluated. Incorporation of most of the legume residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil organic carbon more than control treatment especially when 5.0t ha-1 of organic matter is incorporated. The application rate of 5.0 t ha-1 gave higher soil organic carbon content than the 2.5 t ha- 1 rates. However, the incorporation of maize stover and legume residue resulted in significantly higher soil organic carbon than the initial rate of 5.65 g kg-1. Exchangeable cations were increased by the legume incorporation more than in the control. The impacts created by legume incorporation were mostly felt at the topsoil (0-15 cm). Adoption of the technology might be hindered by the fact that these legumes do not have immediate food grain benefit like the grain legumes (i.e., cowpea and lablab). The fallow legumes and food crops could be intercropped either simultaneously or in a relay pattern with cereal (maize or sorghum) to improve productivity of the land for sustainable food crop production.";"Odunze, A.C.";"";"Food Products Press";"AGRIS";"2003-12-31";"en";"farmers";"";"";"NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500002794";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v22n01_08";"";"";"";"101-112"

"AGRIS:US201400185933";"meta-analytical global comparison of aboveground biomass accumulation between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations";"";"Secondary forests and monoculture plantations are widespread in the tropics and are the two most common forms of reforestation. To assess the value of both systems for CO₂ mitigation, we performed a systematic analysis of the two systems comparing growth rates and potential to store carbon. The increasing involvement of these forest types in carbon trading makes a pertinent issue. We used a meta-analytical approach to evaluate relative rates of aboveground growth (biomass accumulation) in secondary forests and monoculture plantations, controlling for climate and site characteristics. We find a general tendency for aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) to be marginally higher in plantations than secondary forests. Three recorded site factors were significantly associated with ABA, but differed between reforestation types. Plantation growth rates were negatively correlated with precipitation seasonality, while growth rates of secondary forest were positively correlated with surrounding tree cover and negatively correlated with duration of prior land use. It is noteworthy that poor reporting of site history such as prior land-use duration, particularly in monoculture plantations, and a strong bias in studies towards measuring young forest plots obfuscates evaluation of some ecological drivers and long-term processes. We conclude that the difference in ABA between tropical secondary forests and monoculture plantations is smaller than previously assumed, emphasising the potential of secondary forests for low-cost carbon storage and biomass production, particularly in landscapes with high existing tree cover or highly seasonal rainfall.";"Bonner, Mark T.L.

"AGRIS:US201300891202";"Identifying and quantifying uncertainty and spatial disagreement in the comparison of Global Land Cover for different applications";"";"This paper provides a methodology for comparing global land cover maps that allows for differences in legend definitions between products to be taken into account. The legends of the two maps are first reconciled by creating a legend lookup table that shows how the legends map onto one another. Where there is overlap, the specific definitions for each legend class are used to calculate the degree of overlap between legend classes. In this way, one-to-many mappings are accounted for unlike in most methods where the legend definitions are often forced into place. Another advantage over previous map comparison methods is that application-specific requirements are captured using expert input, whereby the user rates the importance of disagreement between different legend classes based on the needs of the application. This user-defined matrix in conjunction with the degree of overlap between legend classes is applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis to create maps of spatial disagreement and uncertainty. The user can then highlight the areas of highest thematic uncertainty and disagreement between the different land cover maps allowing for areas that require further detailed examination to be readily identified. It would also be possible for several users to input their knowledge into the process, leading to a potentially more robust comparison of land cover products. The methodology of map comparison is illustrated using different land cover products including Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and the MODIS land cover data set. Two diverse applications are provided including the estimation of global forest cover and monitoring of agricultural land. In the case of global forest cover, an example was provided for Columbia, which showed that the MODIS land cover map overestimates forest cover in comparison with the GLC-2000. The agricultural example, on the other hand, served to illustrate that for Sudan, MODIS tends to underestimate crop areas while GLC-2000 overestimates them.";"FRITZ, STEFFEN

It is unknown, however, how variation in stormwater infrastructure design affects the delivery of water and materials from urban watersheds. In this study, we asked: (1) How does stormwater infrastructure design vary over time and space in an arid city (Phoenix, Arizona, USA)?, and (2) How does variation in infrastructure design affect fluxes of dissolved nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and organic carbon (DOC) from urban watershed ecosystems? From 1955 to 2010, stormwater infrastructure designs shifted from pipes, to engineered channels and retention basins, to natural washes. We monitored 10 nested watersheds, where small (5–141 ha) watersheds had medium-density residential land use but differed in stormwater infrastructure, whereas larger watersheds (1,662–20,247 ha) had a variety of land uses and infrastructures. We measured rainfall in each watershed and discharge and dissolved N, P, and DOC concentrations in flow at each watershed outlet for runoff-generating rainfall events between 2010 and 2012. We used path analysis to test hypotheses about the relationships among infrastructure characteristics, land cover, storm characteristics (including antecedent conditions), and nutrient and DOC loads. We found that retention-basin density decreased and imperviousness increased runoff, which in turn increased nutrient and DOC delivery. Concentrations varied with antecedent conditions and rainfall but did not vary with watershed characteristics. We show that stormwater infrastructure creates heterogeneity in the hydrologic and biogeochemical function of urban watersheds and that stormwater management may represent a major source of ecosystem heterogeneity within and across cities.";"Hale, Rebecca L.

In the present study, a life cycle assessment framework is used to determine on-farm GHG emissions and water use, and the overall 'cradle-to-farm gate' GHG emissions and water use attributed to beef production. The total on-farm emissions for the two properties were 2984 t CO2-e/year (or 1.93 t CO2-e/livestock unit) for the 634-cow enterprise turning off weaner cattle at Gympie and 5725 t CO2-e/year (or 1.70 t CO2-e/livestock unit) for the 720-cow enterprise turning off finished steers in the Arcadia Valley. The on-farm emissions are largely attributable to enteric methane emissions from the beef herd. The overall 'cradle-to-farm gate' GHG emissions associated with enterprise products were 3145 t CO2-e/year at Gympie and 7253 t CO2-e/year in the Arcadia Valley, with the additional emissions coming from off-farm inputs (fuel for farm vehicles and earth-moving equipment, electricity, supplementary feed, agricultural chemicals, farm services) and additionally, for the Arcadia Valley enterprise, from purchased store steers. The carbon footprint of beef products at the farm gate ranged from 17.5 to 22.9 kg CO2-e/kg liveweight at Gympie, where wearers are the primary product, and from 11.6 to 15.5 kg CO2-e/kg liveweight in the Arcadia Valley, where finished steers are the primary product. Green water use ranged from 7400 to 12700 L/kg liveweight depending on class of livestock, with on-farm blue water use of 51-96 L/kg liveweight and off-farm blue water use of 0.1-59 L/kg liveweight. The ability to offset on-farm GHG emissions through reforestation varied between the two locations, with predicted biosequestration rates of 19.3-34.7 t CO2-e/ha per year at Gympie (rainfall 1200 mm/year) from eucalypt plantation and 1.5-9.8 t CO2-e/ha per year in the Arcadia Valley (rainfall 600 mm/year) through reforestation from a combination of brigalow regrowth, leucaena and environmental eucalypt plantings. The area that would need to be reforested to offset on-farm emissions (over a 30-year time horizon) would be 86-155 ha at Gympie (7-13% of the holding) and 629-4108 ha in the Arcadia Valley (9-60%). If carbon sequestration could be achieved at the higher end of the rates nominated, a significant proportion of on-farm emissions could be offset by sequestration in timber, with minimal impact on beef production.

"AGRIS:US201500003848";"Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable development planning for Lijiang City";"";"Cities are facing considerable challenges resulting from imminent climate change impacts. Urban planning to minimise adverse impacts of climate change at the city level can establish a climate-resilient city. Mitigation strategies to reduce CO₂ emissions would lead to a climate-friendly city. Integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation into sustainable city planning should not be merely added as a single level of sustainable city planning, but requires a wide range of multi-level cooperation. Lijiang City has experienced climatic change during the last half century, and its CO₂ emissions have increased faster than the GDP growth. Nearby glaciers on Yulong Snow Mountain have been retreating and losing mass since the early twentieth century. In this paper, we identify economic sectors that are vulnerable to climate change, including tourism, agriculture and water supply, and propose mitigation and adaptation strategies to cope with climate change in this tourism city. As energy use is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy has enormous CO₂ reduction potential. Land use practices, a sectoral approach and public participation are all considered adaptive in climate planning. The proposals outlined are valuable as they provide an understanding of how to implement integrated climate planning and integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation into sustainable city planning.";"Xiao, Lishan

"AGRIS:US201400133127";"Agrobiodiversity for food security, health and income";"";"By the year 2050, agriculture will have to provide the food and nutrition requirements of some 9 billion people. Moreover, to maintain that level of productivity indefinitely it must do so using environmentally sustainable production systems. This task will be profoundly complicated by the effects of climate change, increasing competition for water resources and loss of productive lands. Agricultural production methods will also need to recognize and accommodate ongoing rural to urban migration and address a host of economic, ecological and social concerns about the ‘high inputs/high outputs’ model of present-day industrial agriculture. At the same time, there is a need to confront the unacceptable levels of continuing food and nutrition insecurity, greatest in the emerging economy countries of Africa and Asia where poverty, rapid population growth and climate change present additional challenges and where agriculture is practiced primarily by small-scale farmers. Within this context, we here review science-based evidence arguing that diversification with greater use of highly valuable but presently under-valorised crops and species should be an essential element of any model for sustainable smallholder agriculture. The major points of these development opportunity crops are presented in four sections: agricultural farming systems, health and nutrition, environmental sustainability and prosperity of the populations. For each section, these crops and their associated indigenous knowledge are reported to bring benefits and services when integrated with food systems. In this paper, we conclude that not only a change in policy is needed to influence behaviours and practices but also strong leadership able to synergize the various initiatives and implement an action plan.";"Kahane, Rémi

It was proven that relatively small urban conglomerations in mid-latitudes, such as the case study region of Rostock, have undergone a considerable effect recently, noticeable particularly in the warm season. Due to climatic changes, these effects are expected to alter in intensity and/or frequency. This was investigated using a model that focuses on interactions between land use and surface temperatures and on specific air conditions in cities. The model enables urban surface temperature differences to be projected with regard to different assumptions of (future or planned) land use/land cover and its specific characteristics. In addition, 99th percentile summer days from the period 1961â1990 and scenario runs from regional climate models (RCMs) were used as an example of extreme heat events. The frequency of occurrence of extreme heat events resembling those occurring in the present day will be up to four (2041â2070) and six (2071â2100) times higher, respectively. Furthermore, the average temperature on defined extreme heat days will rise by 1.6 to 3.4Â Â°C (2041â2070) and 2.2 to 4.4Â Â°C (2071â2100), respectively. The model calculated no significant effects for differences in maximum surface temperatures between land use classes. Some parts of land use change scenarios constructed during scenario workshops in Rostock were integrated into the surface temperature model with regard to climate change adaptation. The results revealed a range of outcomes, from an enlargement of vulnerable areas to the near eradication of climate change-related heat effects in several areas.";"Richter, Michael";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land cover;climate change";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"DEU";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600180405";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-015-0508-y";"";"";"";"849-866"

"AGRIS:US201500053173";"Quantifying bias in pattern indices extracted from spatially offset landscape samples";"";"Modern ecological models often account for the influence of the surrounding environment by using landscape pattern indices (LPIs) as measures of landscape structure. Ideally, the landscape samples from which these LPIs are extracted should be centered on the locations where the response variable was measured. However, in situations where this is not possible due to a lack of adequate full-coverage landcover data, the question arises as to what degree this circumstance creates a bias in the value of the LPIs, thereby obscuring their relation with the response variable. To address this question, we extracted four representative LPIs from 30 rectangular (3 × 6 km) landscape samples evenly distributed across a 10 000 km2 boreal forest study area. These rectangles were subjected to systematic displacements across a range of distances (0.5 to 2.5 km) and directions, after which we recomputed the LPIs. We found that a 1 km spatial offset led to an average of 15% deviation of original LPI values. Unfortunately, as the offset increased, the range of resulting deviations also widened, making it difficult to predict this effect. Our findings fill a gap in the literature on landscape pattern analysis and suggest that researchers should avoid LPIs extracted from spatially offset landscape samples.";"Castilla, Guillermo

Other, non-visual data were gathered from personal interview and focus group discussions conducted in 2010 and 2011 with local elders, farmers and development (agricultural extension) agents. The results identified the presence of cultivated and rural settlement land, shrubland, woodland, bare land, grassland, urban built up area and forest. Throughout the period 1958–2006, urban built-up area, forest and cultivated and rural settlement land expanded at an average rate of 6.85%, 1.85% and 0.14% per year at the expense of shrub, wood and grasslands, which declined by 0.77%, 0.21%, 0.65% per year, respectively. The land use/cover dynamics of 1958–2006 resulted in the reduction/loss of biodiversity, occurrence of high soil erosion and ramification of gullies. The triggers for these changes were population growth, land cultivation, expansion of farmland, inappropriate land management, civil war and fuel wood demand. These led to further land degradation and more food insecurity among many farming households. Land resources have to be used according to their suitability. Thus, the exposed and steep mountains of the area have to be protected from cultivation and should be re-afforested.

This paper analyzes the influence of a newly established concession system on forest landscape change. Specifically, the paper examines whether the concession system promoted and increased land-cover changes and changed fragmentation patterns between 2001 and 2010. Classified Landsat images at 2-year intervals from 2001 to 2003 and 2006 to 2010 were used to examine trajectories in forest, non-forest and regrowth areas. Non-linear changes were found to have occurred in each of the forest classes. Changes in fragmentation varied in size, density, aggregation and configuration over the study period. Forest reforms account for changes in specific land-cover classes through pattern dynamics within timber concessions. However, not all results relate to landscape pattern metrics. Although new forest legislation has been important in reorganizing the forest sector, other causal factors including levels of technological and managerial expertise, credit availability and law enforcement structures play a decisive role in the successive implementation of forest legislation.";"Chávez, Andrea B.

Landowner personal networks are central to Diffusion of Innovations theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior, both of which are commonly invoked in the design of interventions to encourage sustainable private forest management. However, personal network data can be difficult to obtain for a large sample. We tested the effect of three different personal network name generators on estimates of Minnesota landowners’ forestry information networks: a list of generic alter categories, an open-ended written survey, and a combination of written survey and follow-up telephone survey. Generic network data provided a relatively accurate baseline. Personal network data from a written survey provided more detailed data but underestimated network diversity and failed to account for potentially influential weak ties. A combination of written and follow-up telephone survey both doubled estimated average network size from 2.8 to 5.5 alters and increased estimated network diversity from 2.3 alter categories per respondent to 3.7. Network data from the written survey revealed a bias in favor of strong ties that was largely overcome through additional prompting during the telephone survey. A combination of written surveys and telephone or in-person interviews may be the best strategy to balance the benefit of a large sample with the cost of more intensive, yet more reliable, data collection methods.";"Sagor, Eli S.

Evaluations are therefore almost infinitely variable and very dynamic. These observations are examined in two contexts, first in two case studies. One, from the southern Levant, makes use of a long and well-documented history of environmental assessment that varied greatly between communities. The other, from contemporary Niger, shows finer scale differences among villagers. Second, the dynamic and multiple assessment of futures (sustainability) is illustrated with data from the same case study in Niger. In this wider context, multiplicity and dynamicity are largely a consequence of the choice of model of the environmental or social future. The usually positive difference between large-scale and finer scale assessments of degradation is dubbed the [social delivery ratio].

In 2000, a research project was conducted in large fields of corn and soybean to evaluate MODIS leaf area index (LAI) and land cover type (MOD15 and MOD12 data products, respectively) as input to crop yield models. Our objective was to compare collections 3, 4 and 5 with the ground data to determine data product improvement. Classification of land cover type for collections 3, 4 and 5 were similar to the USDA-NASS Cropland Data Layer. The collection 5 MOD15 LAI was considerably improved over earlier collections when the quality assurance flags indicated good LAI retrievals. Land surface reflectances (MOD09) of MODIS band 2 (near-infrared, 250-m) were used as inputs to an inversion of the scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) model. Compared to the collection 5 MOD15 product, SAIL-derived LAI had approximately equal agreement with the field data and had less systematic bias in root mean square error (RMSE). MODIS data products were designed to address global scientific questions without reliance on ground data, whereas the SAIL model inversions required ground data for model inputs. The accuracy of MODIS observations was not limiting LAI accuracy for broadleaf crops; additional information from non-MODIS sources may be required for improved MOD15 LAI.";"Stern, Alan J.

In Iowa and much of the Midwestern United States (US), the typical management decision is to rotate corn and soybean crops for a single field; therefore, the land-cover changes each year even though the total area of agricultural land-use remains the same. The price for corn increased from 2001 to 2010, which increased corn production in Iowa. We tested the hypothesis that the production increase was the result of changes in crop rotation in Iowa using the annual remote sensing classification (the cropland data layer) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service. It was found that the area planted in corn increased from 4.7 million hectares in 2001 to 5.7 million hectares in 2007, which was correlated with the market price for corn. At the county level, there were differences in how the increase in corn production was accomplished. Northern and central counties had little land to expand cultivation and generally increased corn production by converting to a corn–corn rotation from the standard corn–soybean rotation. Southern counties in Iowa increased corn production by expanding into land that was not under recent cultivation. These changes affect the amount of soil carbon sequestration.";"Stern, Alan J.

One of the project's final activities was to document best-bet innovations. It was decided to make use of a questionnaire available under the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) to collect data on a selection of these technologies. Data were fed back into WOCAT's global database. Eighteen technical initiatives were recorded in this way, and the findings added to existing data and in-house knowledge. This information was analysed and a technical report produced (Mutunga and Critchley, 2001). The technologies included turning gullies into gardens, digging planting pits for millet and sorghum and harvesting water from roads. Each combined aspects of land conservation with improved plant production. While several required relatively high initial labour input, all were considered economically beneficial by the farmers. Adoption by other farmers was generally rapid, partially as a result of farmer to farmer visits under PFI. The value of the PFI-WOCAT exercise was not restricted to recording and disseminating information, however. It was also a test of the utility of WOCAT within a project. There were a number of interesting findings. Although those who filled the questionnaires found it an onerous task, they felt that they learned a good deal as they went through the process. One of the main conclusions was that the questionnaire could be a very valuable template to help guide internal monitoring and evaluation, if used from the start of a project intervention.";"Critchley, W.R.S.

This paper analyses the experimental designs and policies in early-1990s of using vetiver grass barriers (Vetiveria zizanioides L.) in microwatersheds with short-rotation tree plantations in Vinh Phu Province, Vietnam. Four different mixed tree-vetiver models on degraded Ferric-Plinthic Acrisols are discussed. It is concluded that the institutional approach of demonstrating vetiver barriers as a model had a poor cost-wise performance, and that the model itself did not address the underlying issues of land degradation due to uncontrolled harvest of organic matter from the forest floors. The institutional approach was tainted with price distortions and ‘disbursement-oriented’ actions. Alternative and more flexible on-farm approaches, using V. zizanioides or the indigenous leguminous shrub Tephrosia candida (Roxb.) DC as vegetative barriers, were found to be more cost-effective and likely to have a higher rate of adoption among farmers. The institutional changes in land allocation policies (securing long-term usufruct users and transfer rights of agricultural and forest land) that took place in Vietnam in the early 1990s, in combination with a reorientation of programme policies to support needs of individuals and farmers' households, are hypothesized to have contributed more to the ‘regreening’ of the hills, than any single approaches of technical barrier designs by the Swedish-Vietnamese Forestry Co-operation Programme (FCP) in northern Vietnam.";"Fahlén, A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2002-12-31";"en";"forestry;land degradation;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"VNM";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400064675";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.508";"";"";"";"307-329"

A limitation for determining the impacts of land use changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) is the dearth of information on SOC stocks under the predominant land uses in the region. Here we used the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model to study long-term impacts of land use changes and soil management on SOC to a depth of 50 cm during 1955–2030, in degraded agricultural lands of central east Kazakhstan. Simulated land uses were: native rangeland vegetation, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L.), and abandoned croplands. The EPIC model was initialized with soil properties obtained from a soil map of the study area. Data on crop management, fertilizer application and tillage practices were gathered from local expert knowledge. Simulations were performed for each polygon on a land use classification map, resulting in 4661 simulations. Our results showed that simulated SOC explained 50% of the variation in measured SOC. Of the 1.38 million hectares in the study area, 78% were under native vegetation, 3% cultivated to wheat, 8% on wheatgrass, and 11% were abandoned croplands in 2005. If land use remained constant, total stock of SOC would decrease at an annual rate of 723 kg C ha−1. However, if best management practices are implemented, resulting in reallocation of land use according to the land capability with abandoned croplands being converted to reduced-tillage wheat or wheatgrass, total stock of SOC would increase to an equivalent of 4700 kg C ha−1 yr−1. Combining land use classification and soil maps with EPIC, proved valid for studying impacts of land use changes and management practices on SOC; an important aspect of this approach is the ability to scale up site-specific SOC to the region. With the available data, EPIC produced relatively accurate results but more data on spatial and temporal variation in SOC are needed to improve model calibration and validation.";"Causarano, Hector J.

However, little is known about the extent to which and when different urban environments influence the extent to which children engage in MVPA. To this end, this study explores the relationship between children's MVPA and urban land use and land cover (LULC) for several temporal subdivisions of children's weekly routines (before school, after school and weekends). In particular, the location and corresponding level of physical activity of 4th grade students (n=134) was recorded using paired global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accelerometers over 33days for each student. GPS locations were temporally related to accelerometry records and then geographically related to 13 categories of LULC. Mixed linear models were fitted to evaluate the extent to which duration spent in each LULC category can explain individuals' time in MVPA before school, after school, and during the weekends. Geographic cluster analysis was also applied to assess whether any significant spatial relationships between observations of MVPA may exist. Duration of exposure to vegetated parks/open spaces, built residential, and built institutional LULC was found to significantly increase children's time spent in MVPA. Further, most observations of MVPA were found to exhibit significant geographic clustering and were predominately associated with built residential areas (particularly those near schools), indicating the importance of neighborhoods and areas in close proximity to children's households on their level of physical activity.";"Matisziw, Timothy C.

"AGRIS:US201301920455";"gendered dimensions of bushfire in changing rural landscapes in Australia";"";"This paper examines gender differences in awareness, preparedness and attitudes towards bushfire amongst landholders in rural landscapes affected by amenity-led in-migration in southeast Australia. It considers the potential of conceptualising bushfire not as a gender-neutral natural phenomenon but as an important means by which traditional gender roles and power relations within rural landscapes are maintained. Landholders were found to uphold conventional views of bushfire management as “men’s business” despite changing social circumstances. Consequently, key gender differences exist within landholders’ bushfire risk awareness, bushfire knowledge, the perceived need for bushfire preparedness measures, the willingness to perform certain tasks, and the belief in personal capacity to act. We argue that covert and less visible as well as overt gender roles and traditions are important factors in understanding landholders’ engagement with bushfire management. When gendered dimensions of bushfire are investigated in the context of hegemony, a paradox emerges between women choosing not to take control of their own bushfire safety and women being denied the opportunity to take control. The complex and contradictory actions and attitudes to bushfire that materialise through an analysis of gendered social experiences complicate attempts to create more gender-sensitive frameworks for bushfire management. The tenacious and embedded nature of gender role divisions within both public and private spheres was furthermore found to act as economic, social and political stumbling blocks for empowerment opportunities. Using a mixed-methods research approach, this paper maps out gendered dimensions of bushfire through landholders’ narratives and actions.

"AGRIS:US201301834372";"yield gap of global grain production: A spatial analysis";"";"Global grain production has increased dramatically during the past 50years, mainly as a consequence of intensified land management and introduction of new technologies. For the future, a strong increase in grain demand is expected, which may be fulfilled by further agricultural intensification rather than expansion of agricultural area. Little is known, however, about the global potential for intensification and its constraints. In the presented study, we analyze to what extent the available spatially explicit global biophysical and land management-related data are able to explain the yield gap of global grain production. We combined an econometric approach with spatial analysis to explore the maximum attainable yield, yield gap, and efficiencies of wheat, maize, and rice production. Results show that the actual grain yield in some regions is already approximating its maximum possible yields while other regions show large yield gaps and therefore tentative larger potential for intensification. Differences in grain production efficiencies are significantly correlated with irrigation, accessibility, market influence, agricultural labor, and slope. Results of regional analysis show, however, that the individual contribution of these factors to explaining production efficiencies strongly varies between world-regions.";"Neumann, Kathleen

In arid environments, however, urbanization may boost productivity by introducing highly productive plant communities and weakening the coupling of plant growth to naturally occurring cycles of water and nutrients. We tested these ideas by comparing NPP estimated for natural and anthropogenic land covers in the Phoenix metropolitan region of USA using MODIS NDVI data and a simplified parametric NPP model. Most anthropogenic land covers exhibited higher production than the natural desert. Consequently, the combined urban and agricultural areas contributed more to the regional primary production than the natural desert did in normal and dry years, whereas this pattern was reversed in wet years. Primary production of this urban landscape was only weakly correlated with rainfall, but strongly with socio-economic variables. Our productivity estimates agreed well with NPP predicted by a process-based ecosystem model for the area. Significant uncertainties, however, remain due to extremely high heterogeneity of urban vegetation. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that urbanization may not only increase regional NPP and disrupt the coupling between vegetation and precipitation, but also increase spatial heterogeneity of NPP in this arid region.";"Buyantuyev, A.

This article analyses the effectiveness of a subsidy to the use of land in forestry as a means of achieving this goal. The analysis uses a general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy characterised by explicit treatment of land use, disaggregated by industry and by region. The results of the analysis indicate that the subsidy cost of permanently reducing carbon emissions by 26 per cent is a little over US$1 per metric tonne of carbon emissions abated. This cost needs to be compared with that of alternative instruments and with the price of carbon that might be agreed under the proposed Reducing Emissions through Deforestation and Land Degradation (REDD) scheme, to be administered through the World Bank and the United Nations.";"Warr, Peter

The aim of our study was to quantify the long‐term response of two lizard species to the transformation of the matrix surrounding remnant habitat patches (from agricultural land to pine plantations). We used a large‐scale (115 sites), long‐term (16 years) fully replicated and controlled landscape scale ‘natural experiment’ (the ‘Nanangroe experiment’, Australia) to compare the response of lizard populations to plantation establishment. The study entailed detailed surveys of reptiles in 50 eucalypt patches surrounded by maturing pine Pinus radiata plantations (treatments) and populations inhabiting 55 eucalypt patches surrounded by grazing land (controls). We found that the eastern three‐toed earless skink Hemiergis talbingoensis was advantaged by the establishment of the pine plantations (increasing colonization of eucalypt patches embedded within plantations). In contrast, we found that the southern rainbow skink Carlia tetradactyla was negatively affected by surrounding areas of maturing plantations. Thus, our results show that plantations acted as a barrier for one species and increased connectivity for the other. We suggest that leaving areas of land devoid of pines between remnant eucalypt patches may enhance the connectivity for species that respond negatively to plantation establishment while maintaining the beneficial increase in connectivity for others.";"Mortelliti, A.

Each of these drivers interacts with the others, and also with the intrinsic traits of individual species, to determine species’ distribution and range dynamics. We explored the relative importance of life-history and resource-use traits, climate, habitat, and the IAS Harmonia axyridis in driving local extinction and colonisation dynamics across 25 ladybird species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).Species were classified as continually present, continually absent, extinct, or colonising in each of 4,642 1-km² grid squares. The spatial distribution of local extinction and colonisation events (in the grid squares) across all species’ ranges were related to ecological traits, overlap with H. axyridis, climate, and habitat factors within generalised linear models (GLMs). GLMs were also used to relate species’ traits, range characteristics, and niche overlap with H. axyridis to extinction and colonisation rates summarised at the species level. Bayesian model averaging was used to account for model uncertainty, and produce reduced sets of models which were well-supported by data. Species with a high degree of niche overlap with H. axyridis suffered higher extinction rates in both analyses, while at the spatial scale extinctions were more likely and colonisations less likely in areas with a high proportion of urban land cover. In the spatial analysis, polymorphic species with large range sizes were more likely to colonise and less likely to go extinct, and sunny grid squares were more likely to be colonised. Large, multivoltine species and rainy grid squares were less likely to colonise or be colonised. In conclusion for ladybirds, extinction and colonisation dynamics are influenced by several factors. The only factor that both increased the local extinction likelihood and reduced colonisation likelihood was urban land cover, while ecological overlap with H. axyridis greatly increased extinction rates. Continued spread of H. axyridis is likely to adversely affect native species and urban areas may be particularly vulnerable.";"Comont, Richard F.

Dedicated biomass crops will compete with other land uses as most high quality arable land is already used for agriculture, urban development, and biodiversity conservation. OBJECTIVE: First, we explore the trade-offs between converting land enrolled in the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to switchgrass for biofuel production or preserving it for biodiversity. Next, we examine the trade-offs between agriculture, biodiversity, and biofuel across the central and eastern U.S. METHODS: We compiled measures of biodiversity, agriculture, and biofuel from land cover classifications, species range maps, and mechanistic model output of switchgrass yield. We used a spatially-explicit optimization algorithm to analyze the impacts of small-to-large scale biomass production by identifying locations that maximize biofuel produced from switchgrass and minimize negative impacts on biodiversity and agriculture. RESULTS: Using CRP land for switchgrass production increases the land area required to meet biomass goals and the species range area altered for birds, amphibians, mammals, and reptiles. When conversion is not limited to CRP, conversion scenarios including biodiversity and agriculture trade-offs require greater than 100 % more area for switchgrass to reach the same production goals. When land conversion scenarios do not include biodiversity, twice the range area for reptiles and amphibians could be altered. CONCLUSIONS: Land-use trade-offs between biofuel production, agriculture, and biodiversity exist and alter optimum location of land conversion for low-to-high biofuel levels. This highlights the need for systematic land-use planning for the future.";"Behrman, Kathrine D.

This paper investigates the interrelationship between land use/cover (LULC) changes and land degradation using remotely sensed and ancillary data for southeastern Spain. The area of study, the Xaló River catchment situated in the north of the Alicante Province, has been subjected to a number of LULC changes during the second half of the 20th century such as agricultural abandonment, forest fires, and tourist development. Aerial photographs dating back to 1956 were used for the delineation of historic LULC types; Landsat ETM+ data were used for the analysis and mapping of current conditions. Two important indicators of land degradation, namely, susceptibility to surface runoff and soil erosion, were estimated for the two dates using easily parametrizable models. The comparison of 1956 to 2000 conditions shows an overall “recuperating” trend over the catchment and increased susceptibility to soil erosion only in 3% of the catchment area. The results also identify potential degradation hot-spots where mitigation measures should be taken to prevent further degradation. The readily implemented methodology, based on modest data requirements demonstrated by this study, is a useful tool for catchment to regional scale land use change and land degradation studies and strategic planning for environmental management.";"Symeonakis, Elias

OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether theory about the internal structure of bird species’ geographic ranges can be refined to reflect abrupt changes in distribution and abundance associated with human influences on landscapes, and whether the prevalence and diversity of bird–landscape threshold relationships may significantly complicate assemblage-level avian conservation. METHODS: For three large regions in the United States, we used the North American Breeding Bird Survey, U.S. National Land Cover Data, and multivariate adaptive regression splines to assess whether land bird species’ abundances were associated with landscape composition and configuration in a threshold fashion. RESULTS: Threshold relationships between abundance and landscape characteristics were exhibited by 42–60 % of the species studied. The relationships were evident for five land types and five habitat guilds. We observed threshold relationships for more taxonomically diverse groups of bird species, a broader set of land types, and larger geographic extents than have been considered to date. CONCLUSIONS: Avian distribution and abundance theory can be refined by articulating that characteristics of human-altered landscapes have the potential to be widespread and biologically important contributors to abrupt spatial change in species’ abundances. Our findings also expose bird–landscape threshold relationships as pervasive and diverse patterns that impose a much more complicated set of circumstances for assemblage-level conservation of birds than has been widely recognized. To cope with these complications, landscape planners and managers can use optimization analyses, multispecies frameworks, regulatory limits, and multivariate change-point analyses.";"Gutzwiller, Kevin J.

Because of long breeding cycles, tree domestication cannot be rapidly achieved through traditional genetic improvement methods alone. Integrating modern genetic and genomic techniques with conventional breeding will expedite tree domestication. Breeders will only embrace these technologies if they are cost-effective and readily accessible, and forest landowners will only adopt end-products that meet with regulatory approval and public acceptance.

The concept has been designed to allow dairy farmers to improve nature conservation on their farms. Under the scheme, no manure, fertilizer, or feed – concentrates or roughage - may be imported into farm systems from external sources. The feasibility of such a self-sustaining system and the conditions required for it to deliver the desired results, are explored with a farm-based linear programming model known as FIONA (Farm based Integrated Optimization Model for Nature and Agriculture). The model is explained and applied to ‘de Langstraat’, a region in southern Netherlands. The results show that levels of production under the ‘Farming for Nature’ regime are dependent upon soil fertility and the proportion of land that is suitable for growing arable crops. If all available land on a dairy farm in the scheme is arable land, then high production levels of up to 7,500 kg milk per hectare can be realized. If only 30% of the farm area is suitable for arable crops, then only lower production levels, of about 6,600 kg milk per hectare can be realized. The scheme has positive ecological effects. Both nature and cultural landscape values may benefit significantly from the concept. Improvement in ecological terms however, carries a price in terms of agricultural income. An average dairy farm adopting the concept of ‘Farming for Nature’ experiences an income loss of approximately € 840 per hectare in the short-run (5-10 years). More important is the observation that the scale of such farms in the short-run might be too small to earn an attractive income for its workers, even when fully compensated according to European Union regulations.";"Schrijver, R.A.M.

The United States Endangered Species Act candidate species designation represents an opportunity to implement proactive management to avoid future listing. Such efforts require substantial investments, and the challenge becomes one of optimization of limited conservation funds to maximize return. Focusing on conifer encroachment threats to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), we demonstrated an approach that links species demographics with attributes of conservation threats to inform targeting of investments. We mapped conifer stand characteristics using spatial wavelet analysis, and modeled lek activity as a function of conifer-related and additional lek site covariates using random forests. We applied modeling results to identify leks of high management potential and to estimate management costs. Results suggest sage-grouse incur population-level impacts at very low levels of encroachment, and leks were less likely to be active where smaller trees were dispersed. We estimated costs of prevention (treating active leks in jeopardy) and restoration (treating inactive leks with recolonization potential) management across the study area (2.5 millionha) at a total of US$17.5 million, which is within the scope of landscape-level conservation already implemented. An annual investment of US$8.75 million can potentially address encroachment issues near all known Oregon leks within the next decade. Investments in proactive conservation with public and private landowners can increase ecosystem health to benefit species conservation and sustainable land uses, replace top-down regulatory approaches, and prevent conservation reliance of at-risk species.";"Baruch-Mordo, Sharon

The selected combination of treatments depends on the conditions of the forest, and the objectives of the forest landowners. A two-step procedure is commonly used to derive the plan. First, treatment alternatives are generated for the stands using an automated simulation tool. Second, the optimal combination of the simulated treatment schedules is found by using mathematical programming or various heuristics. Simulation of treatment schedules requires models for stand dynamics and volume for all important tree species and stand types present in the forest. A forest planning system was described for Northeast China. The necessary models for stand dynamics and tree volume were presented for the main tree species of the region. The developed models were integrated into the simulation tool of the planning system. The simulation and the optimization tools of the planning system were described. The optimization tool was used with heuristic methods, making it possible to easily solve also spatial forest planning problems, for instance aggregate cuttings. Finally, the use of the system is illustrated with a case study, in which nonspatial and spatial management plans are developed for the Mengjiagang Forest District.";"Jin, Xingji

We analysed the occurrence of three crayfish species, Astacus astacus, Austropotamobius torrentium and Orconectes limosus, in relation to habitat degradation status (based on Directive 2000/60/ES), stream morphology, geographical characteristics and land cover. In total, we analysed 6,768 sites within the Czech Republic (Central Europe), of which 6,187 sites lacked crayfish; among the remainder, A. astacus was present in 507 sites, O. limosus occurred in 44 sites and A. torrentium was present in only 30 sites. The analysis revealed that A. astacus preferred streams of better water quality that were not surrounded by agricultural land or settlements. This species also preferentially occurred in smaller streams with stony bottom substrata that were located at higher altitudes. Austropotamobius torrentium occurrence was associated with the natural character of the water body and the presence of protected areas at higher altitudes. Conversely, the non-native crayfish species O. limosus was typically recorded at lower altitudes in downstream reaches surrounded by agricultural land and with deteriorated water quality. The degree of environmental (human) pressure besides differences in habitat characteristics at sites with ICS and NICS may be of general importance for conservation strategies aimed at central European native crayfish species, primarily because the habitat-driven co-occurrence pattern (and its possible changes in the future) may strongly influence interspecific relationships, such as direct competition and the spread of infectious diseases between crayfish species.";"Římalová, Kateřina

"AGRIS:US2016208808";"An Agent-Based Model of Multifunctional Agricultural Landscape Using Genetic Algorithms";"";"Landowner characteristics influence his/her willingness to change landuse practices to provide more or less environmental benefits. However, most studies of agricultural/environmental polices identify landowners as homogenous. And, the primary cause of failure of many environmental and other polices is the lack of knowledge on how humans may respond to polices based on changes in their behavior (Stern, 1993). From socioeconomic theory and empirical research, landowners can be identified as individuals who make agricultural landuse decisions independently based on their objectives. Identifying possible classes of landowners, assessing how each would potentially respond to policy alternatives, and the resulting pattern of land uses in a watershed or a riparian corridor would be very useful to policy makers as they evaluated alternatives. Agricultural landscapes are important producers of ecosystem services. The mix of ecosystem services and commodity outputs of an agricultural landscape depends on the spatial pattern of land uses emerging from individual land use decisions. However, many empirical studies show that the production of ecosystem services from agricultural landscapes is declining. This is consistent with research conducted over the last few decades showing there is a narrow range of social circumstances under which landowners are willing to make investments in the present to achieve public benefits in the future through investing in natural capital resulting in public goods which are frequently produced as ecosystem services.In this study an agent-based model within a watershed planning context is used to analyze the tradeoffs involved in producing a number of ecosystem services and agricultural commodities given price and policy scenarios while assuming three different types of agents in terms of their goals. The agents represent landowners who have been divided into a number of different groups based on their goals and the size of their farm operations. The multi-agent-based model is developed using a heuristic search and optimization technique called genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland), which belongs to a broader class of evolutionary algorithms. GAs exhibit three properties (1) they start with a population of solution, (2) they explore the solution space through recombination and mutation and (3) they evaluate individual solutions based on their appropriate fitness value(s), for example given profit maximizing agents this would be gross margin. A GA is a heuristic stochastic search and optimization method, which works by mimicking the evolutionary principles and chromosomal processing in natural genetics. The three economic agents that are modeled are based on variations in their objective functions and constraints. This study will help in identifying the tradeoffs associated with various agents in the provision of ecosystem services and agricultural commodities. The agent model developed here will help policy and decision maker identify the various agents within the watershed and assess various policy options based on that information.

"AGRIS:US201300771245";"Agriculture and working-class political culture: A lesson from The Grapes of Wrath";"";"John Steinbeck's 1939 novel can be given a reading that links events and the mentality of characters to mainstream schools of liberal and neo-liberal political theory: libertarianism, egalitarianism, and utilitarianism. Each of these schools is sketched in outline and applied to topics in rural political culture. While it is likely that Steinbeck himself would have identified with an egalitarian or utilitarian view, he resists the temptation to deny his Okie characters an authentic voice that matches none of these schools so well as it articulates an agrarian mentality once associated with Thomas Jefferson and today articulated by Wendell Berry. This reading of The Grapes of Wrath, in turn, can be interpreted as both a rebuke to contemporary social theorists who continue to impose an ill-fitting left-right dichotomy on working class political culture in rural America and as a roadmap suggesting ways that philosophy and rural sociology might engage one another more directly and productively with respect to contemporary rural development and environmental quality issues.";"Thompson, Paul B.";"";"Kluwer Academic Publishers";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"environment;land reform;rural development";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300771245";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-006-9050-0";"";"";"";"165-177"
"AGRIS:US2016222934";"Factors influencing adoption of agroforestry among smallholder farmers in Zambia";"";"Agroforestry technologies have been extensively researched and introduced to smallholder farmers in Zambia for over two decades. Despite the research and extension effort over this period, not many farmers have adopted these technologies. The purpose of this paper is to determine why agroforestry technologies are not being taken up by examining factors that influence the adoption of agroforestry practices. Based on data obtained from 388 farming households, statistical analysis show an association between adoption of both improved fallows and biomass transfer technologies with knowledge of the technology, availability of seed, and having the appropriate skills. In addition some household characteristics are found to be linked to the incidence of adoption. However, the strength of association between these variables is low, giving an indication that there might be other factors at play limiting agroforestry adoption. It is anticipated that these findings will point to other areas beyond the household and community level that need further exploration in order to understand factors limiting agroforestry adoption.";"Kabwe, Gillian

"AGRIS:US201301696243";"Modeling Bare Ground With Classification Trees in Northern Spain";"";"Bare ground abundance is an important rangeland health indicator and its detection is a fundamental part of range management. Remote sensing of bare ground might offer solutions for land managers but also presents challenges as modeling in semiarid environments usually involves a high frequency of spectral mixing within pixels. Classification tree analysis (CTA) and maximum likelihood classifiers were used to model bare ground in the semiarid steppes of the middle Ebro valley, Aragon, Spain using Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre 4 (SPOT 4) imagery and topographic data such as elevation, slope, aspect, and a morphometric characterization model. A total of 374 sample points of bare-ground fraction from sixteen 500-m transects were used in the classification and validation process. Overall accuracies were 85% (Kappa statistic=0.70) and 57% (Kappa statistic=0.13) from the CTA and maximum likelihood classifiers, respectively. Although spectral attributes were essential in bare-ground classification, the topographic and morphometric properties of the landscape were equally critical in this modeling effort. Although the specific layers best suited for each specific model will vary from region to region, this study provided an important insight on both bare-ground modeling and the potential advantages of CTA.";"Weber, Keith T.

"AGRIS:US201500163299";"Using algal metrics and biomass to evaluate multiple ways of defining concentration-based nutrient criteria in streams and their ecological relevance";"";"We examined the utility of nutrient criteria derived solely from total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in streams (regression models and percentile distributions) and evaluated their ecological relevance to diatom and algal biomass responses. We used a variety of statistics to characterize ecological responses and to develop concentration-based nutrient criteria (derived from ecological effects) for streams in Connecticut, USA, where urbanization is the primary cause of watershed alteration. Mean background TP concentration in the absence of anthropogenic land cover was predicted to be 0.017mg/l, which was similar to the 25th percentile of all study sites. Increased TP concentrations were significantly correlated with altered diatom community structure, decreased percent low P diatoms and diatoms sensitive to impervious cover, and increased percent high P diatoms, diatoms that increase with greater impervious cover, and chlorophyll a (P<0.01). Variance partitioning models showed that shared effects of anthropogenic land cover and chemistry (i.e., chemistry affected by land cover) represented the majority of explained variation in diatom metrics and chlorophyll a. Bootstrapped regression trees, threshold indicator taxa analysis, and boosted regression trees identified TP concentrations at which strong responses of diatom metrics and communities occurred, but these values varied among analyses. When considering ecological responses, scientifically defensible and ecologically relevant TP criteria were identified at (1) 0.020mg/l for designating highest quality streams and restoration targets, above which sensitive taxa steeply declined, tolerant taxa increased, and community structure changed, (2) 0.040mg/l, at which community level change points began to occur and sensitive diatoms were greatly reduced, (3) 0.065mg/l, above which most sensitive diatoms were lost and tolerant diatoms steeply increased to their maxima, and (4) 0.082mg/l, which appeared to be a saturated threshold, beyond which substantially altered community structure was sustained. These criteria can inform anti-degradation policies for high quality streams, discharge permit decisions, and future strategies for watershed development and managment. Our results indicated that management practices and decisions at the watershed scale will likely be important for improving degraded streams and conserving high quality streams. Results also emphasized the importance of incorporating ecological responses and considering the body of evidence from multiple conceptual approaches and statistical analyses for developing nutrient criteria, because solely relying on one approach could lead to misdirected decisions and resources.";"Smucker, Nathan J.

"AGRIS:US201400106993";"Land cover change on Mt. Pinatubo, the Philippines, monitored using ASTER VNIR";"";"Ashfall and pyroclastic flows from the large eruption of June 1991 destroyed much of the vegetation on the flanks of Mt. Pinatubo. Subsequent vegetation recovery has helped stabilize slopes and reduce debris flow hazard. In this project, visible and near-infrared (VNIR) satellite imagery from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) captured at a similar time of year in 2001, 2004 and 2008 were used to quantify vegetation recovery within 22 upland watersheds on the mountain, 10–16 years after the eruption took place. Differences in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from these images were used to measure the areal extent of losses and gains in ground cover and derive average net rates of change in ground cover. The success of this approach was dependent on post-processing ASTER imagery to correct for the effects of variation in satellite-sun geometry and vegetation reflectance and to calibrate and adjust the derived NDVI images for the influence of different atmospheric conditions at the time of image capture. All watersheds showed a variable pattern of losses and gains in vegetation and ground cover. Losses were related to shifting cultivation practices and gully and channel migration, and these amounted to 1–12% of watershed areas. Gains were related to revegetation of pyroclastic flows, recent channel terraces, abandoned gardens and areas of burnt vegetation, and these amounted to 3–45% of watershed areas. Consistent overall net gains in ground cover were observed in all watersheds, with the average NDVI increasing by up to 0.074 over each consecutive 3-year period. The rates of change in NDVI were used to derive a vegetation recovery curve from bare ground. The result showed that it will take approximately 50 years for hillslopes to regain a dense vegetative cover in this climate. This supports published findings which indicate rapid recovery of vegetation in tropical environments following such large volcanic eruptions. Results additionally showed that the trajectory of change and the speed of recovery were influenced by terrain type, geology, watershed morphology and the activity of erosion and depositional processes. Prior to 2001, revegetation had been fastest on mountain slopes that helped protect vegetation from the effects of eruption. Gains in ground cover are now greatest in areas that were most impacted by the eruption.";"De Rose, Ronald Charles

By contrast, imposing new planning provisions, such as enforced retreat strategies, on legacy or existing private assets that are exposed to erosion and sea-level rise will impact on private property rights. In many cases this will incentivise rights-holders to pursue alternative recourse pathways. It is argued here that the behaviour of the key actors in this legacy assets problem are not well described in the models commonly proposed in the literature, and a new risk-based model framework is proposed that better explains the observed behaviours.";"Gibbs, Mark T.

"AGRIS:FR2014007338";"Understanding regional dynamics of mixed crop-livestock agricultural systems to support rural development in South-western France uplands";"Comprendre la dynamique régionale des exploitations de polyculture élevage pour accompagner le développement rural dans les Coteaux de Gascogne";"The Coteaux de Gascogne region, an upland area in south-western France, is a site where studies related to the future of landscapes and the sustainability of natural resource management are well documented. The local agricultural system is induced by a “house centred” society with the particularity of passing on the inheritance and farm estate identically from one generation to the next. This system generates a mosaic landscape made up of field crops, grasslands and woodlots. Local agriculture has experienced deep changes since the 1950s in relation with modernization and farm enlargement processes. Traditional farming systems were very diversified and turned towards subsistence. Nowadays, farming systems are market-oriented mixed crop-livestock farming, in which cattle is the main species raised. We have started a participatory research with local stakeholders for prospecting the future of livestock farming in the study area. We carried out a spatially explicit and exhaustive survey of the farms in 4 adjoining villages to assess the variety of family-farms, their agricultural land-management and their changes over recent decades. In this paper we present an initial typology assessing the current variety of the family-farms structure and functioning. The types of spatial and functional organization of farm territories appear to depend on farm size and access to land resources. In current socio-economical conditions, difficulty for farm transfer at the time of a farmer’s retirement and competition between crop and animal productions appear as main topical issues that challenge the future of local livestock farming. Their impacts on the sustainability of the local livestock sector and on landscape characteristics are major issues that will be considered in the modelling and scenarios of land-use and landscape change to be worked out in a subsequent step of the participatory research project.

Les Coteaux de Gascogne constituent un des terrains de recherche sur l’avenir des paysages ruraux et la durabilité de la gestion des ressources naturelles. Cette petite région du Sud-Ouest de la France est historiquement fondée sur un système social dit « à maison » caractérisé par une permanence des patrimoines fonciers et des exploitations agricoles. Le système agraire qui lui est lié génère une mosaïque de paysages composée de grandes cultures, de prairies liées à l’élevage bovin et de bois. L’agriculture locale a connu, depuis les années 1950, de profonds changements liés à la modernisation et à l’agrandissement des exploitations. A l’origine très diversifiées et tournées vers l’autoconsommation, les exploitations s’inscrivent aujourd’hui dans l’économie de marché tout en conservant une orientation de polyculture-élevage. Dans une perspective d’élaboration de scénarios d’évolution relatifs à l’élevage, nous avons mis en place un dispositif de recherche en partenariat. Il a été convenu, avec les partenaires, que la première étape de nos travaux porte sur l’amélioration de la connaissance des changements en cours dans les exploitations et la compréhension des stratégies des familles agricoles. A partir d’une enquête exhaustive et spatialisée des exploitations utilisant le territoire de quatre communes, nous avons, en premier lieu, élaboré une typologie pour disposer d’une représentation de la diversité de leurs situations. Les modes d’organisation spatiale et fonctionnelle des territoires d’exploitation montrent des situations contrastées liées à leur dimension et à leur accès aux ressources foncières. La transmission des exploitations et l’avenir de l’élevage bovin sont des questions pressantes qui constituent des éléments à intégrer dans les modèles et scénarios à élaborer.";"Choisis , Jean Philippe

"AGRIS:US201400106999";"Extraction of training samples from time-series MODIS imagery and its utility for land cover classification";"";"A number of classification techniques to generate land cover maps from satellite imagery have been proposed but supervised classification with manual selection and delineation of training samples (TSs) continues to be the preferred technique. The current practices of field visits and manual delineation of TSs by visual recognition are highly demanding on both resources and time, with limited utility. With an increase in the number of Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) platforms and the enormous data that they generate, there is a need to process the data quickly and efficiently for creating global science products. Towards this goal, an attempt has been made in this article to develop a method for the automatic extraction of the TSs from the time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS – 250 m) vegetation index (VI), which can then be used for supervised classification to create a land cover map with any classification technique on relevant remotely sensed data. The TSs contained 1.27%, 0.09% and 1.18% of the total pixels for the forest, crop and water classes of the study region. Validation with Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS – 56 m)-derived national land use/land cover (LULC) map of India shows a complete agreement with the location of what can be considered as pure class pixels. The article also demonstrates and compares the utility of these TSs with an expert choice of TSs on MODIS time-series data using k-nearest neighbour, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and on a single-scene Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor-3 (LISS-3 – 24 m) imagery using maximum likelihood (ML) classifier.";"Gupta, S.

However, limited attempts have been undertaken to elucidate the differences in NPP between pre- and post-urban land development in China. In this paper, the terrestrial NPP after urbanization in China was assessed by using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA), toward which a calibration was conducted for adapting this model on the fine-scale application. In addition, a method of neighborhood proxy was applied to acquire the NPP in the absence of urban land development, assuming that non-urban lands can represent their nearby urban lands before they were transformed. Our analyses indicate that urban land development had overall negative effects on terrestrial NPP. They reduced the NPP at an accelerating rate of 0.31×10⁻³PgCyear⁻¹, approximately 5.88% of the annual reduction during the period of 2000–2006 in China. Furthermore, these effects of NPP variations exhibited obvious differences in the amounts and spatial distributions. However, the NPP showed a slight increase around some regions that experienced rapid urbanization, as well as the arid regions in northwest China. These were probably caused by the effects of Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Rain Island (URI), an introduction of faster growing exotics, various resource augmentations and so on.";"Pei, Fengsong

"AGRIS:US201500041939";"landscape infrastructure footprint of oil development: Venezuela's heavy oil belt";"";"Oil exploration and production activities (OEPA) and other extractive endeavors can create large-scale and permanent landscape alterations through the establishment of infrastructure features such as roads, well pads, pipelines and production facilities. These structures can lead to or increase landscape fragmentation and degradation, reduce biodiversity, disrupt important ecosystem services and attract informal settlements that further alter the landscape, deplete area resources and lead to social conflict. Aside from regulatory standards, many energy (oil and gas) companies include voluntary environmental performance as part of their sustainability reporting. However, they do not account for these site-specific alterations in a systematic, quantifiable and transparent way. This paper proposes a calculation of a modified Landscape Infrastructure Footprint (LIF) of OEPA based on landscape ecology metrics measured via GIS and remote sensing techniques. Three Venezuelan heavy oil belt (HOB) operations were examined with reference to the years 1990 and 2000. Results indicate that Ameriven displayed the smallest LIF. Newer technologies, best practices, land cover, competing economic interests and type of management may explain observed alterations. LIF methods provide four important benefits. First, they can help to reduce surface disturbances by informing planning practices in current as well as in new projects. Second, they fortify environmental reporting by providing objective measures of environmental performance tied to extractive activities. Third, by including LIF in their sustainability practices, extractive industries can improve their competitive advantage. Finally, the LIF helps create a set of transparent environmental performance standards that industry and regulators can adopt in order to measure and monitor landscape alterations resulting from extractive activities.";"Baynard, Chris W";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"VEN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500041939";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.10.005";"";"";"";"789-810"

Assessing the role of biological activity in micro-scale Zn and Pb distributions in A, B and C horizons";"";"This work assesses relationships between characteristic aggregate microstructures related to biological activity in soils under different long-term land use and the distribution and extractability of metal pollutants. We selected two neighbouring soils contaminated with comparable metal loads by past atmospheric deposition. Currently, these soils contain similar stocks, but different distributions of zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) concentrations with depth. One century of continuous land use as permanent pasture (PP) and conventional arable (CA) land, has led to the development of two soils with different macro- and micro-morphological characteristics. We studied distributions of organic matter, characteristic micro-structures and earthworm-worked soil by optical microscopy in thin sections from A, B and C horizons. Concentrations and amounts of total and EDTA-extractable Zn and Pb were determined on bulk samples from soil horizons and on size-fractions obtained by physical fractionation in water. Large amounts of Zn and Pb were found in 2–20-µm fractions, ascribed to stable organo-mineral micro-aggregates influenced by root and microbial activity, present in both soils. Unimodal distribution patterns of Zn, Pb and organic C in size-fractions were found in horizons of the CA soil. In contrast, bimodal patterns were observed in the PP soil, because large amounts of Zn and Pb were also demonstrated in stable larger micro-aggregates (50–100-µm fractions). Such differing distribution patterns characterized all those horizons markedly influenced by earthworm activity. Larger earthworm activity coincided with larger metal EDTA-extractability, particularly of Pb. Hence, land use-related biological activity leads to specific soil microstructures affecting metal distribution and extractability, both in surface and subsurface horizons.";"Fernandez, Christelle

"AGRIS:US2016212657";"Determinants of Iowa Cropland Cash Rental Rates: Testing Ricardian Rent Theory";"";"Based on the Ricardian rent theory, this study employs the variable profit function to analyze the determinants of Iowa cropland cash rental rates using county-level panel data from 1987 to 2005. Accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelations, responses of local cash rental rates to changes in output prices and other exogenous variables are estimated. We find that Iowa cash rental rates are largely determined by output/input prices, soil quality, relative location, and other county-specific factors. Cash rents go up by $79 for a $1 increase in corn price in the short run. The marginal value of cropland quality, as represented by row-crop corn suitability rating index, is about $1.05. Ethanol plants are not found to have a significant local effect on cash rental rates, impacting local rental markets mainly through the national futures price. Scale of the local livestock industry and adoption of genetically engineered crops have significant impacts on local cash rental rates. In addition, changes in crop output prices are found to have long-run effects on cash rental rates. The long-run change in cash rents is approximately $109-$114 for a $1 change in corn price and is reached in about four years. Our research may be viewed as a test of the Ricardian rent theory. We find limited support for the theory.";"Du, Xiaodong

Seventeen out of 31 Iranian provinces, which are home to approximately 70% of the total population, are affected by desertification. This study aimed to use geographic information system (GIS) and fuzzy logic for mapping environmentally sensitive areas to desertification based on Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use approach in Isfahan province, central Iran. Six desertification indicators including climate, soil, vegetation, soil erosion, groundwater, and management and policy quality were used to determine various types of environmentally sensitive areas to desertification. Seventeen desertification indices affecting the quality of each indicator were spatially mapped and assigned a value between 0 and 1 using a fuzzy logic option of ArcSDM3 software in GIS environment. Results showed that a 21·7% of the study area was classified as critical, 70% as fragile and 5·5% as potential, and 2·9% of the area was not affected by desertification. In the town of Borkhar, 64·2% of the area was classified as critical, followed by the towns of Isfahan and Nayin with 40·2% and 31·8%, respectively. Results at provincial scale indicated that the climate indicator and humidity index with a weighting mean of 0·71 and 0·77 were the most affective factors in the desertification of the study area. The developed model in this study can be used for mapping desertification status in other 16 provinces that contain desert areas. These assessments provide a GIS‐based desertification database that Iran as a member of the United Nation Convention to Combat Desertification can use to report the condition of desertification at national scale.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, land degradation assessment studies are very important for the sustainable development of the area.

Nevertheless in Mediterranean countries trees are still present in many pastoral systems, here referred to as silvopastoral systems (SPs). Trees provide products as fruits as human food, fruits or leaves as fodder, wood and firewood, environmental services like patches of soil fertility and shelter for animals, and environmental goods such as carbon sequestration, water yield and quality and reinforced biodiversity. However, most of the SPs locate in marginal areas, have low commercial profitability and are subject to two divergent trends, intensification and extensification or abandonment that compromise their long-term persistence. Here we analyzed current threats/constraints and new challenges for the future of SPs based on experience gained in Iberian dehesas. We stress the need of a comprehensive and categorized map of SPs and a database of management practices as adaptive solutions to environmental and socioeconomical contexts. We propose a set of topics for future research projects that should integrate traditional and scientific knowledge favoring innovative techniques for production of timber and non-timber forest products, livestock, and cultural and environmental values.";"G., Moreno

Initiated in 1976, the improved system consisted of integrated land management to conserve soil and water, with excess rainwater being removed in a controlled manner. This was combined with improved crop rotation (legume based) and integrated nutrient management. In the traditional system, sorghum or chickpea was grown in the post-rainy season with organic fertilizers, and in the rainy season the field was maintained as a cultivated fallow. The average grain yield of the improved system over 24 years was 4.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1), nearly a five-fold increase over the traditional system (about 1 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). There was also evidence of increased organic C, total N and P, available N, P and K, microbial biomass C and N in the soil of the improved system. A positive relationship between soil available P and soil organic C suggested that application of P to Vertisols increased carbon sequestration by 7.4 t C ha(-1) and, in turn, the productivity of the legume-based system, thus ultimately enhancing soil quality.";"Wani, S.P.

The study was undertaken in Mieso District of eastern Ethiopia where two ethnic groups experience different production systems  pastoral and agropastoral. Game theoretic approach and analytic narratives have been used as analytical tools. Results show that the historical change in land use by one of the ethnic groups, resource scarcity, violation of customary norms, power asymmetry and livestock raids are some of the factors that have contributed to the recurrence of the conflict. The role of raids in triggering conflict and restricting access to grazing area becomes particularly important. Socio-economic and political factors are responsible for power asymmetry and increasing scale of raids. The joint effect of an increase in trend of violence and a decline in capacity of customary authority in conflict management advances state role in establishing enforceable property rights institutions. This would be successful only if policies and intervention efforts are redirected at: 1) suppressing incentives for violence, 2) establishing new institutional structures, in consultation with clan elders of both parties and 3) building internal capacity to monitor conflict-escalating events.";"Beyene, Fekadu";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2007-12-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"002;ETH";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016222428";"http://purl.umn.edu/7703";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016212486";"The Dynamic Effects of Open-Space Conservation Policies on Residential Development Density";"";"Recent economic analyses emphasize that designated open-space increases the rents on neighboring residential land, and likewise, the probability of undeveloped land converting to residential uses. This paper addresses a different question: What is the effect of local open space conservation on the rate of growth in the density of existing residential land? The analysis is relevant for exurban development and also for remote lakeshore development, where shoreline development density can rapidly increase over time and open-space policies are often advocated as a way to protect ecosystems by reducing development. A discrete choice econometric model of lakeshore development is estimated with a unique parcel-level spatial-temporal dataset, using maximum simulated likelihood to account for i) the panel structure of the data, ii) unobserved spatial heterogeneity, and iii) sample selection resulting from correlated unobservables. Results indicate that, contrary to the intuition derived from the current literature, local open space conservation policies do not increase the rate of growth in residential development density, and some open space conservation policies may reduce the rate of growth in residential development density. This is consistent with land-value complementarity between local open space and parcel size. Spatially-explicit simulations at the landscape scale examine the relative effects of conservation policies on the time path of development.";"Lewis, David J.

Ningaloo Marine Park in Western Australia adjoins the coast along its entire 300 kilometre length and is accessed via several land tenure types that encapsulate a suite of attributes (i.e. services, facilities and management controls). The effect of tenure on visitor and visit characteristics, and recreational activities, was investigated using 1208 visitor surveys. Visitor origin and length of stay varied significantly among tenures, while repeat visitation and site fidelity were high, especially on pastoral leases. Although a wide range of recreational activities occurred in the marine park adjacent to all tenures, the percentage of respondents involved in activities such as fishing, sailing sports and snorkelling varied among tenures. These results highlight the influence of a mix of tenures, and accompanying attributes, on visitor use of an adjacent marine park. Although this provides a challenge for managers of marine parks with an extensive coastal interface in achieving the dual objectives of conservation and recreation, it also contributes to a diversity of visitor experiences.";"Smallwood, C.B.

"AGRIS:US201400042283";"Integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis in GIS to develop land suitability for agriculture: Application to durum wheat cultivation in the region of Mleta in Algeria";"";"Due to constant decrease in farmlands, it is important to identify the best lands useful for sustainable agriculture (productive and profitable agriculture that protects the environment and that is socially equitable). This requirement has resulted in the development of land suitability maps for agriculture by combining several factors of various natures and of differing importance. The integration of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis approaches (MCDA) in a Geographical Information System (GIS) provides a powerful spatial decision support system which offers the opportunity to efficiently produce these land suitability maps. Indeed, GIS is a powerful tool for analyzing spatial data and establishing a process for decision support. Because of their spatial aggregation functions, MCDA methods can facilitate decision making in situations where several solutions are available, various criteria have to be taken into account and decision-makers are in conflict (Dias et al., 2002). The parameters and the classification system used in this work are inspired from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) approach dedicated to a sustainable agriculture. A spatial decision support system has been developed for establishing the land suitability map for agriculture. It incorporates the multicriteria analysis method ELECTRE Tri (ELimitation Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) in a GIS (ArcGIS) within the GIS program package environment. This approach has been tested on the area of Mleta in Algeria. A land suitability map for durum wheat has been produced. Through the obtained results, it appears that ELECTRE Tri method, integrated into ArcGIS 9.2 of ESRI, is better suited to the problem of land suitability for agriculture. The time saving during the development of the land suitability map for the agriculture of the durum wheat was considerable. The coherence of the obtained maps confirms the system effectiveness.";"Mendas, Abdelkader

"AGRIS:US201301581147";"influence of traditional steep land agricultural practices on runoff and soil loss";"";"The erosion of soil from subsistence agricultures on lands with steep slopes and shallow soil is poorly documented, particularly in Brazil. This paper details the hydrological and soil loss responses to traditional agriculture (shifting agriculture) of a steeply sloped sector (32° incline) classified by FAO has having Regosol soil. This sector is in Guarapuava, Brazil and is covered by a shallow, clayed soil that originates from basalt rock. All measurements were carried out between May 2003 and April 2004. Three replicate plots were established at three randomly selected land sites, which were under different phases of the rotational cycle: burned, fallow or shrubs. A total of 76 natural rainfall events were measured throughout the study period and the accumulated precipitation was 1538.9mm. Rainstorms >=30mm were important for runoff and soil loss. The average runoff (expressed as a proportion of the total rainfall) over the 12-month investigation period for each of the three sites was determined to be 2.4%, 1.0%, and 1.4% for burned, fallow, and shrubs, respectively. The response to rainfall during the measurement period differed completely at each site. The average soil loss was as follows: for shrubs, fallow, and burned sites, average loss was 1.2t/(hayear), 5.1t/(hayear), and 6.1t/(hayear), respectively. The results suggest that fire and traditional agriculture tillage practices affected the topsoil. Shifting cultivation patterns in the steeply sloped sectors cause a succession of high, intermediate, and low soil loss regimes, which are important for understanding contemporary landscape dynamics and land degradation in the Guarapuava region.";"Thomaz, Edivaldo Lopes";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land degradation";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"BRA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301581147";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.11.009";"";"";"";"23-30"
"AGRIS:US2016215008";"Small forests, big ambitions and a hard reality - Community Forestry in Nepal";"";"Community forestry in Nepal is intended to reduce poverty by sustainable management of forests. Timber is one of the most high-value forest products, especially in the case of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the Terai region of Nepal. Despite having several advantages, including high value forests on fertile land, connection with transportation networks, and being close to regional markets, community forests in the Terai region produce little or no timber from their Sal forests. This research looks at what is affecting the production of Sal timber from community forests. Three aspects of community forest user groups (CFUG) are examined using institutional economics, transaction cost economics and micro-economics. First, the scale of CFUG operations is examined in terms of their ability to profitably carry out logging and organise market sales. Second, the capacity of CFUGs to carry out logging in terms of internal physical and human resources, and property rights is examined. Finally, barriers to vertical integration with the market in terms of contracting and cooperation with other CFUGs are investigated. To answer these questions, data was collected from 85 CFUGs and interviews were carried out with 39 key respondents from CFUGs, government agencies, and private firms. The results show that the size of the forest was not an issue for harvesting and marketing logs. However, the organisational capacity of CFUGs was found to be weak because of a lack of financial resources, limited property rights over timber, control over decisions by the District Forest Office, policy constraints, and corruption. In terms of vertical integration, a lack of legal rights to enter into contracts, a high degree of uncertainty about policy and property rights, small and irregular amounts timber harvest, and the interpretation of CFUG rules by the District Forest Office were found to be barriers for the formation of long-term contracts between CFUGs and private firms, and of cooperative developments between CFUGs.";"Rai, Chandra

"AGRIS:US201400150825";"Protected agricultural production in Kuwait";"";"In arid regions such as Kuwait, protected agriculture (PA) is a feasible option for developing the agricultural sector. In addition to protecting crops in enclosed controlled environment, PA extends the growing season and ensures high profitability and sustainability of an agricultural enterprise. In Kuwait, the protected agriculture sector has witnessed an impressive rebuilding after liberation and with sustained government support it is expected to become an important agribusiness activity with a considerable impact on the national economy. However, production expansions are limited by technical and market constraints resulting in technical and economic inefficiencies. In addition, production technologies are being adopted without considering the soil and water characteristics. This is causing a rise in the groundwater table, groundwater pollution and degradation in the productive capacity of soil as well as affecting plant productivity. Such practices present a threat to the environment and sustainability of the agriculture production activity in Kuwait. Due to low water-use efficiency, the present soil-based greenhouse production system has increased the demand for expensive desalinated water in protected agriculture. To overcome these obstacles a National Agriculture Master Plan, covering a 20-year period from 1995, was developed. This plan identified PA as a priority area for development of the agricultural sector in the country. This plan calls for two- to four-fold enhancements in the productivity levels of selected crops by the year 2015. To do this, introduction, testing and infusion of proven state-of-the-art technologies into the existing cropping system were recommended. The soil survey for the State of Kuwait showed new potential agricultural lands that can be used for expanding protected agricultural areas.

"AGRIS:US201400008657";"Landowners’ ability to leverage in negotiations over habitat conservation";"";"Voluntary conservation agreements are commonly used to stem the impact of habitat destruction and degradation on terrestrial biodiversity. Past studies that aim to inform how resources for conservation should be allocated across land parcels have assumed the costs of securing conservation on sites can be estimated solely on the basis of the value of alternative land uses. However, in a voluntary negotiation, a landowner could hold-out for a higher payment based on a conservation group or agency’s willingness-to-pay by leveraging the value of biodiversity on the property. We examine landowners’ ability to leverage and the consequences for conservation planning. To explore this, we first use an analytical approximation that simplifies the situation to one where a conservation group prioritizes one site for acquisition. Landowners’ ability to hold-out for higher payments in this situation ranges from approximately 17% to 55% of the value of alternative land uses on the site. We show that landowners’ ability to hold-out for higher payments is more sensitive to variance in the value of alternative land uses than variance in the biodiversity value across properties and is highest when the two factors negatively covary. Next, we consider multi-site selection decisions accounting for community complementarity across parcels. We find that leverage potential can be significantly higher in this context, with a maximum increase of 237% of the value of alternative land uses, and that community irreplaceability is correlated with landowners’ ability to leverage. If one landowner holds out for a higher payment, it has implications for what other parcels should be priorities for protection.";"Lennox, Gareth D.

Unless major shifts in consumptive behaviours occur, land-based production will have to increase drastically to meet future demands for food and other commodities. One approach to better understand the drivers and impacts of agricultural intensification is the identification of global, archetypical patterns of land systems. Current approaches focus on broad-scale representations of dominant land cover with limited consideration of land-use intensity. In this study, we derived a new global representation of land systems based on more than 30 high-resolution datasets on land-use intensity, environmental conditions and socioeconomic indicators. Using a self-organizing map algorithm, we identified and mapped twelve archetypes of land systems for the year 2005. Our analysis reveals similarities in land systems across the globe but the diverse pattern at sub-national scales implies that there are no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solutions to sustainable land management. Our results help to identify generic patterns of land pressures and environmental threats and provide means to target regionalized strategies to cope with the challenges of global change. Mapping global archetypes of land systems represents a first step towards better understanding the global patterns of human–environment interactions and the environmental and social outcomes of land system dynamics.";"Václavík, Tomáš

The mating system of this species is resource defense polygyny, with the resource being active termite nests, excavated by single males, which are then joined by females. We combined field observations of 14 harems during 3 years and data about the genetic structure within and between these groups, calculated with one mitochondrial locus and nine nuclear microsatellite loci. The results show that both male and female offspring disperse before maturity. In addition, we estimated life span of excavated termite nests and the duration they were occupied by the same male. Our findings suggest that long male tenure of up to 30 months is indeed a likely cause for the observed dispersal by female offspring that can reach maturity at a low age of 6 months. We suggest that dispersal by offspring of both sexes may occur quite frequently in polygynous tropical bats and thus generally may be more common in mammals than previously assumed.";"Dechmann, Dina K.

"AGRIS:US201300914494";"Soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide and methane in New Zealand terrestrial ecosystems and their mitigation options: a review";"";"The two non-CO₂ greenhouse gases (GHGs) nitrous oxide (N₂O) and methane (CH₄) comprise 54.8% of total New Zealand emissions. Nitrous oxide is mainly generated from mineral N originating from animal dung and urine, applied fertiliser N, biologically fixed N₂, and mineralisation of soil organic N. Even though about 96% of the anthropogenic CH₄ emitted in New Zealand is from ruminant animals (methanogenesis), methane uptake by aerobic soils (methanotrophy) can significantly contribute to the removal of CH₄ from the atmpsphere, as the global estimates confirm. Both the net uptake of CH₄ by soils and N₂O emissions from soils are strongly influenced by changes in land use and land management. Quantitative information on the fluxes of these two non-CO₂ GHGs is required for a range of land-use and land-management ecosystems to determine their contribution to the national emissions inventory, and for assessing the potential of mitigation options. Here we report soil N₂O fluxes and CH₄ uptake for a range of land-use and land-management systems collated from published and unpublished New Zealand studies. Nitrous oxide emissions are highest in dairy-grazed pastures (10-12 kg N₂O-N ha⁻¹ year⁻ ¹), intermediate in sheep-grazed pastures, (4-6 kg N₂O-N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹), and lowest in forest, shrubland and ungrazed pasture soils (1-2 kg N₂O-N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹). N deposited in the form of animal urine and dung, and N applied as fertiliser, are the principal sources of N₂O production. Generally, N₂O emissions from grazed pasture soils are high when the soil water-filled pore-space is above field capacity, and net CH₄ uptake is low or absent. Although nitrification inhibitors have shown some promise in reducing N₂O emissions from grazed pasture systems, their efficacy as an integral part of farm management has yet to be tested. Methane uptake was highest for a New Zealand Beech forest soil (10-11 kg CH₄ ha⁻¹ year⁻¹), intermediate in some pine forest soils (4-6 kg CH₄ ha⁻¹ year⁻¹), and lowest in most pasture (<1 kg CH₄ ha⁻¹ year⁻¹) and cropped soils (1.5 kg CH₄ ha⁻¹ year⁻¹). Afforestation /reforestation of pastures results in increases in soil CH₄ uptake, largely as a result of increases in soil aeration status and changes in the population and activities of methanotrophs. Soil CH₄ uptake is also seasonally dependent, being about two to three times higher in a dry summer and autumn than in a wet winter. There are no practical ways yet available to reduce CH₄ emissions from agricultural systems. The mitigation options to reduce gaseous emissions are discussed and future research needs identified.";"Saggar, Surinder

The biggest threat to wetlands is posed by human activities which transform wetlands, often for short-term consumptive benefits. This paper aimed to classify and map recent land cover and provide a multi-temporal analysis of changes from 2002 to 2014 in the Nakivubo wetland through which wastewater from Kampala city drains to Lake Victoria in Uganda. The paper contributes through spatially congruent change maps showing site-specific land cover conversions. In addition, it gives insight into what happened to the wetlands, why it happened, how the changes in the wetlands affect the communities living in them, and how the situation could be better managed or regulated in future. The analysis is based on very high resolution (50–62 cm) aerial photos and satellite imagery, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Overall, the analysis of losses and gains showed a 62 % loss of wetland vegetation between 2002 and 2014, mostly attributable to crop cultivation. Cultivation in the wetland buffering the lake shore makes it unstable to anchor. The 2014 data shows large portions of the wetland calved away by receding lake waves. With barely no wetland vegetation buffer around the lake, the heavily polluted wastewater streams will lower the quality of lake water. Furthermore, with increased human activities in the wetland, exposure to flooding and pollution will be likely to have a greater impact on the health and livelihoods of vulnerable communities. This calls for a multi-faceted approach, coordination of the various stakeholders and engagement of wetland-dependent communities as part of the solution, and might require zoning out the wetland and restricting certain activities to specific zones.";"Isunju, John Bosco

The methods are principal component analysis (PCA) and change vector analysis (CVA) in the Gorgan Township area, Golestn Province, Iran. A series of texture-based information was calculated mainly to separate those land use/land cover (LULC) conversions that are spectrally indistinguishable and also to provide a basis for automatic classification of S-T data space. Both methods were evaluated in terms of accuracy and the required time and expertise. Having the two-dimensional S-T data space generated, support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented to automatically extract changed pixels and the receiving operator characteristic (ROC) was employed to assess the accuracy of the output. According to the results, the study area has witnessed substantial mutual transformations between various LULCs among agricultural lands were the most dynamic category in the region. The PCA method applied to the S-T information achieved a ROC of 0.90—indicating an acceptable performance—while the S-T CVA method achieved a lower value of 0.75. The S-T PCA method was considerably less time-consuming and less expertise demanding as well as more accurate in our study area.";"Sakieh, Yousef

"AGRIS:US201500219108";"Accounting for space and time in soil carbon dynamics in timbered rangelands";"";"Employing rangelands for climate change mitigation is hindered by conflicting reports on the direction and magnitude of change in soil organic carbon (ΔSOC) following changes in woody cover. Publications on woody thickening and deforestation, which had led to uncertainty in ΔSOC, were re-evaluated, and the dimensional-dependence of their data was determined. To model the fundamentals of SOC flux, linked SOC pools were simulated with first-order kinetics. Influences from forest development timelines and location of mature trees, with a potential for deep-set roots, were considered. We show that controversy or uncertainty has arisen when ΔSOC data were not measured along sufficient lengths of the three Cartesian axes and the time axis, i.e. in 4D. Thickening and deforestation experiments have particularly neglected factors affecting the time and depth axes, and sometimes neglected all four axes. Measurements of thickening must use time-spans beyond the calculable breakeven date – when thickening just recovers the SOC lost through land degradation: then all ecosystems are likely to incur net sequestration. The similarity between half-life of carbon pools, and the half-time required for sequestration, mandates that millennial time-spans must be considered in design of SOC experiments. Spatial and temporal averaging of ΔSOC data that accounted for environmentally dependent decomposition rates, revealed that deforestation to pasture incurred a higher and longer-term net emission than earlier reported. Published reports on thickening or deforestation appear no longer contradictory when one considers that they only presented views from lengths of the 4D axes that were too limited. Adoption of this understanding into carbon accounting will allow more precise estimates of carbon fluxes for emission trading schemes and national reports.";"Dean, Christopher

"AGRIS:US201300892058";"Scaling net ecosystem production and net biome production over a heterogeneous region in the western United States";"";"Bottom-up scaling of net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) was used to generate a carbon budget for a large heterogeneous region (the state of Oregon, 2.5x10⁵ km2) in the western United States. Landsat resolution (30 m) remote sensing provided the basis for mapping land cover and disturbance history, thus allowing us to account for all major fire and logging events over the last 30 years. For NEP, a 23-year record (1980-2002) of distributed meteorology (1 km resolution) at the daily time step was used to drive a process-based carbon cycle model (Biome-BGC). For NBP, fire emissions were computed from remote sensing based estimates of area burned and our mapped biomass estimates. Our estimates for the contribution of logging and crop harvest removals to NBP were from the model simulations and were checked against public records of forest and crop harvesting. The predominately forested ecoregions within our study region had the highest NEP sinks, with ecoregion averages up to 197 gC m-2 yr-1. Agricultural ecoregions were also NEP sinks, reflecting the imbalance of NPP and decomposition of crop residues. For the period 1996-2000, mean NEP for the study area was 17.0 TgC yr-1, with strong interannual variation (SD of 10.6). The sum of forest harvest removals, crop removals, and direct fire emissions amounted to 63% of NEP, leaving a mean NBP of 6.1 TgC yr-1. Carbon sequestration was predominantly on public forestland, where the harvest rate has fallen dramatically in the recent years. Comparison of simulation results with estimates of carbon stocks, and changes in carbon stocks, based on forest inventory data showed generally good agreement. The carbon sequestered as NBP, plus accumulation of forest products in slow turnover pools, offset 51% of the annual emissions of fossil fuel CO2 for the state. State-level NBP dropped below zero in 2002 because of the combination of a dry climate year and a large (200 000 ha) fire. These results highlight the strong influence of land management and interannual variation in climate on the terrestrial carbon flux in the temperate zone.";"Turner, D.P.

Firstly, land, labour and total factor productivity indicators for pomegranate production were researched. Additionally, efficiency analyses were also done using data envelopment analysis method. As a result of the analysis, land productivity was found to be 19,696.8 kg ha-1. Labour productivity, which is defined as gross production value divided by labour cost, was estimated to be TL 5.16. Total factor productivity shows that for each production cost of TL 1 in pomegranate production, the net return of enterprises is TL 0.23, which may be said to be relatively high.

In Delta Junction, Alaska plant communities in CRP fields are transitioning from grasslands to shrub dominated plant communities, which are resulting in compliance problems with program regulations that state “fields must be maintained in a condition that permits easy conversion to cropland”. To determine plant succession and how previous land management and soils might influence the transition, we measured plant populations in 20 CRP fields throughout Delta Junction using modified-Whittaker plots. These data were combined with data on current management practices, previous farming history, soils, soil properties, diversity indices, and time since land was cleared and analyzed with nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination to determine factors that influence plant succession. Time in the CRP was the only factor consistently influencing plant succession. As time in the CRP increased, the planted introduced grasses brome grass (Bromus inermis) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) and the native pteridophyte (Equisetum arvense) decreased, whereas a native grass (Calamigrostis canadensis), five native forb, two native shrub, and three native tree species increased. Plant diversity increased at a rate of more than 2 species per 1000m² per year. Regression analyses of plant species and plant groups using time in the CRP as the dependent variable resulted in the identification of outlier CRP fields with significantly more or less than expected covers of vegetation. All fields with these outliers had reasonable explanations for the differences in cover that were unrelated to the overall rate of plant succession. Current management practices will result in incompliant fields and different management practices that result in woody vegetation control is key to maintaining CRP fields in compliance.";"Seefeldt, Steven S.

Here a theoretical model was used to examine cases where the game reserve management allocated the amount of land devoted to hunting (trophy hunting) and tourism, based on three scenarios: (1) hunting is separated from tourism but wildlife is shared; (2) hunting and tourism co-exist; and (3) hunting and tourism are separated by a fence. The consumptive and non-consumptive uses are not mutually exclusive; careful planning is needed to ensure that multiple management objectives can be met. Further, the analysis indicates that the two uses may be undertaken in the same area. Whether they are spatially, or temporally separated depends on the magnitude of the consumptive use. When consumptive use is not dominant, the two are compatible in the same shared area, provided the wildlife population is sufficiently large.";"MWAKIWA, EMMANUEL

Easements can provide a range of ecosystem services (ESs), but it is unknown whether conservation easements maintain ES capacities equivalent to public protected areas. Evaluation of the capacity of seven ESs on federal and state protected areas and conservation easements in the USA using spatially-explicit ES models and publicly available data indicated that ES capacities in easements were equal to or greater than capacities within state or federal protected areas for six of seven services and, when bundled together, conservation easements protected greater focal ES capacity than other conservation areas. Economic incentive programmes and regulatory mechanisms may be used to stimulate capacity improvements for surface water regulation, riparian filtration, erosion control, and carbon storage on conservation easements, and landscape-level conservation efforts should (1) continue to protect natural and uninhabited areas that provide ecosystem and biological diversity, (2) expand private conservation efforts close to human population centres, and (3) limit future development to areas with high regulating service capacity that can sustain new population growth.";"VILLAMAGNA, A.

How can this be determined, when land management has altered the vegetation of the landscape substantially? The answers may lie in the soil: this study synthesized the spatial distribution of soil properties derived from the state soils geographic database with empirical measurements of old-growth forest ecosystem C to yield a regional distribution of potential maximum total-ecosystem organic C stores. The region under consideration is 179,000 square kilometers extending from the southern Oregon border to the northern Washington border, and from the Pacific Ocean to the east side of the Cascade Mountains. Total ecosystem organic C (TEC) was measured in 16 diverse old-growth forests encompassing 35 stands and 79 pedons to a depth of 100 cm. The TEC ranged between 185 and 1200 Mg C ha-1. On an average, 63% of TEC was in the vegetation, 13% in woody detritus, 3% in the forest floor, 7% in the 0-20 cm mineral soil, and 13% in 20-100 cm mineral soil. The TEC was strongly related to soil organic C (SOC) in the 0-20 cm mineral soil, yielding a monotonically increasing, curvilinear relation. To apply this relation to estimate the TEC distribution throughout the region, 211 map units of the state soils geographic database (STATSGO) were used. The SOC in the 0-20 cm mineral soil of the map units was consistent with values from previously measured pedons distributed throughout the region. Resampling of 13 second-growth forests 25 years after initial sampling indicated no regional change in mineral SOC, and supported the use of a static state soils map. The SOC spatial distribution combined with the quantitative old-growth TEC-SOC relation yielded an estimate of potential TEC storage throughout the region under the hypothetical condition of old-growth forest coverage. The area-weighted TEC was 760 Mg C ha-1. This is approximately 100 Mg C ha-1 more than a previous estimate based on a coarser resolution of six physiographic provinces, and 400 Mg C ha-1 more than current regional stores. The map of potential TEC may be useful in forecasting regional C dynamics and in land-management decisions related to C sequestration.";"Homann, P.S.

To address this need, we developed a semi‐automated procedure to map the country's mining footprint (30‐m pixel) and establish a baseline to monitor changes in mine extent over time. The process uses mine seed points derived from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS), and USGS National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) and recodes patches of barren land that meet a “distance to seed” requirement and a patch area requirement before mapping a pixel as mining. Seed points derived from EIA coal points, an edited MRDS point file, and 1992 NLCD mine points were used in three separate efforts using different distance and patch area parameters for each. The three products were then merged to create a 2001 map of moderate‐to‐large mines in the United States, which was subsequently manually edited to reduce omission and commission errors. This process was replicated using NLCD 2006 barren pixels as a base layer to create a 2006 mine map and a 2001–2006 mine change map focusing on areas with surface mine expansion. In 2001, 8,324 km² of surface mines were mapped. The footprint increased to 9,181 km² in 2006, representing a 10·3% increase over 5 years. These methods exhibit merit as a timely approach to generate wall‐to‐wall, spatially explicit maps representing the recent extent of a wide range of surface mining activities across the country.

The review indicates that while the inalienation of rights of use and ownership of land under the communal or group ownership tenure system limited access to land and security of tenure, it encouraged the protection and conservation of land resources and the physical environment. The land reform (Land Use Act) of 1978 on the other hand promoted and consolidated individual rights of use and alienation, which stimulated the development of a speculative land market. The existence of a speculative land market is a disincentive to land resource conservation and environmental protection. A review of the reform, which will change or modify the conditions of tenure without changing ownership or redistributing land, is required. This will predispose landowners to conserve and protect land resources.Keywords: tenure system, environment, conservation, communal ownership, reformInternational Journal of Agricultural and Rural Development Vol. 5 2004: 86-90";"Onyebinama, UAU";"";"";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"";"environment;communal ownership";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Indigenous & Community Land Rights";"";"NGA";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AJ2013001907";"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijard/article/view/2567/11190";"";"";"";""

First, it considers why the terms of the original agrarian question no longer apply to agrarian change today. The shift in the terms corresponds to the movement from the late-nineteenth century and twentieth century, when states were the organizing principle of political-economy, to the twenty-first century, when capital has become the organizing principle. Second, and related, agrarian mobilizations are viewed here as barometers of contemporary political-economic relations. In politicizing the socio-ecological crisis of neoliberalism, they problematize extant categories of political and sociological analysis, re-centring agriculture and food as key to democratic and sustainable relations of social production.";"MCMICHAEL, PHILIP";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"en";"land reform";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300888853";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2008.00168.x";"";"";"";"205-228"

Three major problems of current research are outlined: (1) adequate diagnosis of soil salinization, (2) mapping and assessment of the areas of salt-affected soils, and (3) monitoring of the state of soil salinization. On the basis of recent publications, priority tasks and challenges for further research in this field are discussed. First, the notion of salt-affected soils should be specified with due respect for the diagnostic criteria of soil salinization. Second, in the assessment of these soils, not only the degree of salinization but also the chemistry of salts and the depth of the upper salt-bearing horizon should be taken into account. Third, to calculate the areas of salt-affected soils and to perform their monitoring, satellite images meeting specified requirements should be used. These requirements depend on the land use and cultivated crops. Modern technologies of the interpretation of satellite images should be applied for these purposes. Recent studies devoted to the monitoring of the salt status of irrigated and virgin soils of arid regions are discussed.";"Pankova, E.

Meanwhile, high quality geochemical maps are needed for better environmental management. Soil organic C (SOC) distribution maps are required for improvements in soil management and for the estimation of C stocks at regional scales. This study investigates the use of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) method for the spatial modelling of SOC in Ireland. A total of 1310 samples of SOC data were extracted from the National Soil Database of Ireland. Environmental factors of rainfall, land cover and soil type were investigated and included as the independent variables to establish the GWR model. The GWR provided comparable and reasonable results with the other chosen methods of ordinary kriging (OK), inverse distance weighted (IDW) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The SOC map produced using the GWR model showed clear spatial patterns influenced by environmental factors and the smoothing effect of spatial interpolation was reduced. This study has demonstrated that GWR provides a promising method for spatial geochemical modelling of SOC and potentially other geochemical parameters.";"Zhang, Chaosheng

Energy balance has been considered for many decades to understand the functioning of ecosystems, the biosphere or the Earth planet as a whole, but it is also possible to study our planet from a thermodynamic point of view. In this letter we analyse recent trends in solar exergy and net radiation at global scale during the period 1980–2010, distinguishing between land and ocean and between different land cover classes. Variations on the solar constant were also analysed. Results show a significant global decrease in solar exergy, in accordance also with a decrease in the solar constant.

For this reason, the adoption of conservation tillage systems has been encouraged as an alternative to preserve soil and water in this region. However, little information concerning soils on which these techniques are applied is available. The main objectives of this study were to assess the effect of long-term no tillage (NT) on water aggregate stability in five different cereal production areas of Aragon and identify the main mechanisms involved on aggregate breakdown. The study was conducted under on-farm conditions where pairs of adjacent fields under NT and conventional tillage (CT) were compared. In all cases, a nearby undisturbed soil under native vegetation was included. Soils were slightly to highly calcareous with medium textures ranging from sandy loam to silty clay loam. Results indicate that NT increased surface aggregate stability with respect to CT systems through lower soil disturbance and higher organic carbon (OC) content at the soil surface (0–5cm depth). Slaking was the dominant disaggregation process of the cultivated soils, representing 40–80% of total soil disruption, and was strongly and negatively affected by aggregate-associated OC. This soil property together with the silt content (weak and positive effect) explained more than 80% of the slaking variation. Swelling and clay dispersion were less frequent processes and their occurrence seemed to be associated with high silt and CaCO₃ contents. This study shows that, under the rainfed conditions of semiarid Aragon, NT reduces the susceptibility of soil surface to crusting and water erosion as compared to CT systems.";"Blanco-Moure, Nuria

Natural, semi-natural, or managed ecosystems had been able to provide ecosystem services to meet the needs of social development. Four agricultural ecosystem services (net primary production (NPP), carbon sequestration and oxygen production (CSOP), water interception, soil conservation and agriculture production) were quantified in Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region. Estimates of ecosystem services were obtained from the analysis of satellite imagery and the use of well-known models. Based on the ecological services in Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region, this study mainly analysed the driving mechanism of the changes from the two aspects of natural drivers and human drivers. Natural drivers (climate, soil, elevation, land cover) had incentive to the ecological services. Human activity was quantified by an integrated human activity index (HAI) based on population density, farmland ratio, and the influence of road networks and residential areas. We found relationships between ecosystem services, human activities and many natural factors, however these varied according to the service studied. Human activities were mostly negatively related to each ecosystem services, while population and residential land ware positively related to agricultural production. Land use change had made a contribution to ecosystem services. Based on the selected ecosystem services and HAI, we provided sustainable ecosystem management suggestions.";"Li, Jing

During spring 2010 and 2011, we investigated habitat selection by territorial rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta helvetica males in a protected area of the western Italian Alps. We located males from 30 randomly selected survey points, and we measured the proportions of cover-type categories found within a 37-ha area surrounding each observed bird using three classification maps of differing information and resolution. We also evaluated physical variables (altitude, slope and solar radiation) associated with the birds using a 75-m digital terrain model. We modelled land cover and physical attributes under these three alternative land-classification maps. The lowest resolution map, based on the Corine land-cover map, did not have high predictive value because only orographic variables described the presence of birds; in our case, we found a negative effect of slope and a positive effect of altitude on presence of ptarmigan. The next higher resolution map, a local forest resource map, showed that slope had a negative effect and rocky grasslands had a positive effect on ptarmigan presence. Finally, using the highest resolution map, a phytosociological map of our Natural Park study area, the best-ranked models were those having only cover-type variables, with alpenrose Rhododendron ferrugineum and blueberry Vaccinium myrtillus scrubland and pioneer vegetation negatively correlated with the presence of rock ptarmigan. We concluded that a staged approach that uses maps of differing detail was successful for obtaining useful information on rock ptarmigan habitat selection, but the most interesting results about rock ptarmigan habitat selection at the scale of breeding territories were obtained only using a very detailed vegetation map. Because such detailed information is difficult to obtain on larger scales, we suggest wildlife managers cooperate to build similar mapping tools that allow analyses similar to ours.";"Nelli, Luca

"AGRIS:US201400181931";"carbon budget of a winter wheat field: An eddy covariance analysis of seasonal and inter-annual variability";"";"Arable land occupies large areas of global land surface and hence plays an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Therefore agro-ecosystems show a high potential of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while optimizing agricultural management. Hence, there is a growing interest in analyzing and understanding carbon fluxes from arable land as affected by regional environmental as well as management conditions. The major goal of this study is to use a two year data set of eddy covariance measurements (October 2007 to October 2009) on a winter wheat field located in Western Germany to assess the seasonal and inter-annual variability of carbon fluxes as affected by meteorological variables and land management. During the study period, which was comprised of two full growing seasons, eddy covariance measurements together with measurements of various soil, plant, and meteorological data were performed. Flux partitioning and gap filling methods including uncertainty estimates were applied to derive complete time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Rₑcₒ). Despite different management dates and slightly different meteorological conditions, annual NEE resulted in 270gCm⁻² in both years. Although the period from sowing to harvesting was more than 20 days shorter in the first year, due to the later start of senescence, GPP was higher by 220gCm⁻². In the annual carbon budget this was compensated by a stronger heterotrophic respiration after the harvest of sugar beet grown on the field before the study period. Taking into account the carbon losses due to removal of biomass during harvest, the winter wheat field acts as a carbon source with respective net biome productivities (NBP) of 246 and 201gCm⁻²a⁻¹. To complete the carbon balance, releases due to energy consumption associated with crop production are taken into account. However, the relatively large carbon loss was probably, to a large extent, compensated by carbon input from plant residues left on the field after preceding sugar beet harvest. This underlines the importance of multi-annual measurements taking full crop rotations into account.";"Schmidt, M.

The project was not sufficiently resourced to undertake replicated field-drainage measurements and relied on expert field drainage estimates at ~930 sites (260 of these for independent validation) to spatially predict soil drainage for both areas using various terrain-based and remotely sensed covariates, using three approaches: (a) decision tree spatial modelling of discrete drainage classes; (b) regression-tree spatial modelling of a continuous drainage index; (c) regression kriging (random-forests with residual-kriging) spatial modelling of a continuous drainage index. Method b was chosen as the best approach in terms of interpretation, and model training and validation, with a concordance coefficient of 0.86 and 0.57, respectively. A classified soil drainage map produced from the ‘index’ showed good agreement, with a linearly weighted kappa coefficient of 0.72 for training, and 0.37 for validation. The index mapping was incorporated into the overall land suitability model and proved an important consideration for the suitability of most enterprises.";"Kidd, D. B.

"AGRIS:US201500070813";"Soil erosion prediction in dry field using computational fluid dynamics simulation";"";"The purpose of this study was to predict wind erosion in dry field in order to alleviate the wind-blown soil problems thereafter. A well-known computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was utilized to predict soil erodibility under changeable wind flows over complex terrain by coupling the erosion mechanism. The erosion mechanism was investigated by field measurements and derived as a modified form of the WEQ (wind erosion equation) to represent short-term wind erosion. The multiple linear regression analysis of repetitive experimental data derived the wind erosion equation, which showed a good agreement with the measured data with R2 = 0.61. For CFD modeling of topographical effects, the land cover data was linked to the CFD simulation by mapping the virtual porosity and using user-defined functions. The CFD simulation coupled with the regression model produced useful results concerning spatial distributions of soil erodibility, erodible area and soil erosion over complex terrain according to various wind directions. In target area, north wind generated the largest wind erosion, followed by east, south and west winds, while the largest erodible area was shown when the wind came from the west, followed by east, south and north winds. The largest wind erosion under the north wind was 32.7 kg min-1 which was 1.7 times larger than the smallest in the west wind. Therefore the north wind generated strong wind erodibility over the small areas while the west wind generated weak wind erosion over wide area. This study also expects that the CFD simulation coupled with the wind erosion equation will be a valuable tool to evaluate and design various wind erosion prevention measures by simulating their performances as well as to establish effective and economical plans and decisions for crop production.";"Hwang, H.

It is aimed to examine the applicability of Multi Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods in site selection process. Accordingly, the ecological resources of the watershed were initially identified. To specify the criteria required for agricultural land evaluation, Delphi method was applied. After selecting the criteria, they were weighted using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method. Weighted Overlay (WO) Method was also used to overlay the map layers in the GIS environment. Afterwards, sensitivity analysis was performed using Weights Sensitivity Analysis (WSA) method to show the impressibility rate of the results against a certain changes in the inputs. The results revealed that out of 6591.2 ha of the total watershed area, 50.8 % has unsuitable potentiality while 27.32 % has a poor suitability for irrigated agriculture. It was also determined that only 6.96 % of the whole study area has a suitable potential for this purpose. Besides, the findings indicated that 23.38 % of the total watershed area is unsuitable for rain-fed farming. the results also showed that 31.78 % and 19.12 % of the entire study area has moderate and high potentials for rain-fed agriculture, respectively.

Although woody encroachment is often accompanied by increased annual net primary production (ANPP) and increased inputs of litter, mesic ecosystems may become sources for C after woody encroachment because stimulation of soil CO₂ efflux releases stored soil carbon. Our objective was to determine if young, sandy soils on a barrier island became a sink for C after encroachment of the nitrogen-fixing shrub Morella cerifera, or if associated stimulation of soil CO₂ efflux mitigated increased litterfall. We monitored variations in litterfall in shrub thickets across a chronosequence of shrub expansion and compared those data to previous measurements of ANPP in adjacent grasslands. In the final year, we quantified standing litter C and N pools in shrub thickets and soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil CO₂ efflux in shrub thickets and adjacent grasslands. Heavy litterfall resulted in a dense litter layer storing an average of 809 g C m⁻² and 36 g N m⁻². Although soil CO₂ efflux was stimulated by shrub encroachment in younger soils, soil CO₂ efflux did not vary between shrub thickets and grasslands in the oldest soils and increases in CO₂ efflux in shrub thickets did not offset contributions of increased litterfall to SOC. SOC was 3.6-9.8 times higher beneath shrub thickets than in grassland soils and soil TN was 2.5-7.7 times higher under shrub thickets. Accumulation rates of soil and litter C were highest in the youngest thicket at 101 g m⁻² yr⁻¹ and declined with increasing thicket age. Expansion of shrubs on barrier islands, which have low levels of soil carbon and high potential for ANPP, has the potential to significantly increase ecosystem C sequestration.";"BRANTLEY, STEVEN T.

The diagnosis and Design D&D methodology was used and meetings with producers and technicians of Corpoica, Cordeagropaz and Umata. With the active participation were generates and implemented mixed production systems under complete random blocks with three blocks and three treatments, the plots corresponded to an area of 1.5 ha. One year after of established the experiments, the behavior of the components to the applied treatments was good, like it is the case of cocoa and laurel with a 100% survival, these were sowed in cespedón; on the other hand the banana was 20% mortality, due to the high humidity of the soil when it was sowed. In spite of the short time of evaluation, the laurel presented significant statistical differences growth, reporting the highest values the treatment T1 (sowing distance 8 m x 4 m) with 2,03 m and the smallest value registred in the treatment T3 (sowing distance 8 m x 16 m). The variables evaluated in the banana like yield, number of fingers, weight of clusters and hijuelos for plant didn't present significant statistical differences during the first year of evaluation, what indicates that the banana plants had the same behavior in the different treatments. The establishment cost per hectare oscillated among of $6.630.000 and $6.829.000, these costs are low if we compare them with those reported by FEDECACAO (2005) in Agrocadenas, of $9.305.000.

Most corncrakes (58%) on meadows were found in unmanaged areas without subsidies to the farmers (i.e. areas with tall vegetation). Several corncrakes (62%) were found in restored areas, managed for less than 10 of the last 40 years, fewer (38%) in areas under continuous management. Vegetation height was negatively associated with number of years of management the last 40 years, and the continuously managed areas were avoided by corncrakes. Sites where corncrake territories occur regularly should be managed to maintain tall vegetation suitable for the species, which requires increased use of mowing. However, the results from our study also suggest that yearly mowing might result in a vegetation structure that is avoided by corncrakes. To achieve a balance between tall grassy vegetation and prevention of succession to scrub a possible management regime would therefore be mowing at intervals of a few years.";"Berg, A.

"AGRIS:US201400056900";"Potential Impacts and Management Implications of Climate Change on Tampa Bay Estuary Critical Coastal Habitats";"";"The Tampa Bay estuary is a unique and valued ecosystem that currently thrives between subtropical and temperate climates along Florida’s west-central coast. The watershed is considered urbanized (42� % lands developed); however, a suite of critical coastal habitats still persists. Current management efforts are focused toward restoring the historic balance of these habitat types to a benchmark 1950s period. We have modeled the anticipated changes to a suite of habitats within the Tampa Bay estuary using the sea level affecting marshes model under various sea level rise (SLR) scenarios. Modeled changes to the distribution and coverage of mangrove habitats within the estuary are expected to dominate the overall proportions of future critical coastal habitats. Modeled losses in salt marsh, salt barren, and coastal freshwater wetlands by 2100 will significantly affect the progress achieved in “Restoring the Balance” of these habitat types over recent periods. Future land management and acquisition priorities within the Tampa Bay estuary should consider the impending effects of both continued urbanization within the watershed and climate change. This requires the recognition that: (1) the Tampa Bay estuary is trending towards a mangrove-dominated system; (2) the current management paradigm of “Restoring the Balance” may no longer provide realistic, attainable goals; (3) restoration that creates habitat mosaics will prove more resilient in the future; and (4) establishing subtidal and upslope “refugia” may be a future strategy in this urbanized estuary to allow sensitive habitat types (e.g., seagrass and salt barren) to persist under anticipated climate change and SLR impacts.";"Sherwood, Edward T.

Here, we analyzed the patterns of species richness from amphibians, reptiles and mammals at the EU level. We used two different data sources for each taxon: expert-drawn species range maps, and presence/absence atlases. As environmental drivers, we considered climate and land cover. Land cover is increasingly the focus of research, but there still is no consensus on how to classify land cover to distinct habitat classes, so we analyzed the CORINE land cover data with three different levels of thematic resolution (resolution of classification scheme Ë less to more detailed). We found that the two types of species richness data explored in this study yielded different richness maps. Although, we expected expert-drawn range based estimates of species richness to exceed those from atlas data (due to the assumption that species are present in all locations throughout their region), we found that in many cases the opposite is true (the extreme case is the reptiles where more than half of the atlas based estimates were greater than the expert-drawn range based estimates). Also, we detected contrasting information on the richness drivers of biodiversity patterns depending on the dataset used. For atlas based richness estimates, landscape attributes played more important role than climate while for expert-drawn range based richness estimates climatic variables were more important (for the ectothermic amphibians and reptiles). Finally we found that the thematic resolution of the land cover classification scheme, also played a role in quantifying the effect of land cover diversity, with more detailed thematic resolution increasing the relative contribution of landscape attributes in predicting species richness.";"Tsianou, Mariana A.

"AGRIS:US201500200228";"Probabilistic uncertainty specification: Overview, elaboration techniques and their application to a mechanistic model of carbon flux";"";"It is widely recognised that the appropriate representation for expert judgements of uncertainty is as a probability distribution for the unknown quantity of interest. However, formal elicitation of probability distributions is a non-trivial task. We provide an overview of this field, including an outline of the process of eliciting knowledge from experts in probabilistic form. We explore approaches to probabilistic uncertainty specification including direct elicitation and Bayesian analysis. In particular, we introduce the generic technique of elaboration and present a variety of forms of elaboration, illustrated with a series of examples. The methods are applied to the expression of uncertainty in a case study. Mechanistic models are built in just about every area of science and technology, to represent complex physical processes. They are used to predict, understand and control those processes, and increasingly play a role in national and international policy making. As such models gain higher prominence, recipients of their forecasts are increasingly demanding to know how accurate they are. There is therefore a growing interest in quantifying the uncertainties in model predictions. Uncertainty in model outputs, as representations of reality, arise from uncertainty about model inputs (such as initial conditions, external forcing variables and parameters in model equations) and from uncertainty about model structure. Our case study is based on the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM), which is used to estimate the combined carbon flux from vegetation in England and Wales in a given year. The extent to which vegetation acts as a carbon sink is an important component of the debate about climate change. We show how different approaches were used to characterise uncertainty in vegetation model parameters, soil conditions and land cover.";"O’Hagan, Anthony";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"land cover;climate change";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500200228";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2011.03.003";"";"";"";"35-48"

We asked specifically whether the reassignment of the commonage for the use of historically disadvantaged town residents after 1994 has impacted negatively on the vegetation of the commonage. Analysis of land cover change using aerial photography time series revealed that the most significant human impacts on the Bathurst commonage occurred prior to 1942 due to heavy and uncontrolled communal land use. Vegetation change since then has been characterised by a recovery of thicket vegetation and an encroachment of woody species into grassland. Additional field sampling of the species composition and age class distributions of trees and shrubs in thicket and broken thicket vegetation showed these units to be of high veld condition status. Thornveld and old lands have both been encroached upon by woody species, particularly by Acacia karroo, and possessed the lowest veld condition scores. There is little evidence, however, that recent land-use activities have impacted negatively on commonage vegetation. We discuss these results in terms of the vegetation's potential to provide for the diverse needs of commonage users, and the implications for commonage management and policy.";"Puttick, J R

The purpose of this study is to provide policy inputs, examine the sustainability of rice production, and determine major policy areas. A requisite set of 12 indicators of three dimensions of SD, namely economic, was generated by employing an assemblage of top–down and bottom–up approaches. The data were gathered from farm households’ survey as well as in-depth discussion with stakeholders from the regions that represent irrigated, rain-fed lowland, rain-fed upland, flood-prone, and saline-prone rice-growing ecosystems in Bangladesh. By constructing composite indicators, the results revealed that 44 % of rice growers were economically viable, environmentally sound, and socially developed. The irrigated rice production system was found to be the most sustainable. The path analysis measured the contribution of the indicators to the index, and results highlighted that rice growers’ knowledge, skills, and social networks development, improving land productivity, and integrated nutrient management were essential for promoting sustainable rice production. However, the study findings suggest that pluralistic (i.e., government and non-government) agricultural advisory services can serve as an engine of transition to rice production sustainability in which a multi-year planning and strategy formulation are crucial besides investing in the modernization of extension services.

How do changes in climate and land‐use drivers relate to long‐term changes in vegetation? What are the implications of these findings for land degradation hypotheses and future climate change projections for the region? LOCATION: The biogeographically complex semi‐arid, Karoo Midlands region of the southeastern part of South Africa. METHODS: We re‐photographed 65 historical landscape photographs, the majority of which dated from 1950 to 1970, to measure long‐term changes in the cover of grasses, dwarf shrubs, tall shrubs and alien plants. The cover of each growth form as well as total vegetation cover was estimated from matched photograph pairs with the aid of detailed cover estimates recorded in the field. The change in cover was relativized between sites by dividing the difference in cover between the two time steps by the number of years between photographs, expressed as the percentage change in cover per decade. Significant changes in mean annual rainfall and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) from 27 climate stations were assessed using a Mann‐Kendall test for trend. This non‐parametric test was also used to assess the significance of long‐term trends in the number of cattle, sheep and goats in each of the biomes over the period 1911–1996. RESULTS: Grass cover and total vegetation cover had increased by between 1.0% to 4.5% per decade and 2.0% to 4.5% per decade, respectively, in all biomes investigated. In contrast, the cover of dwarf shrubs had decreased significantly by between 0.25% and 3.0% per decade, although not significantly so in the Nama‐karoo biome. The change in tall shrub cover varied between different biomes but had generally increased in the study area. Alien plants were absent in the historical photographs and had increased significantly but only in Azonal habitats, where increases of 1.5% per decade were recorded. For the majority of climate stations no significant trend in mean annual rainfall and SPI values was recorded, while stocking rate had declined significantly in all biomes by between 36% and 48% from 1911 to 1996. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the hypothesis that vegetation cover and condition has improved in the semi‐arid regions of South Africa. These findings are discussed in light of future projections for the region.";"Masubelele, Mmoto L.

In Puerto Rico, agricultural abandonment has given way to novel forests dominated by the introduced African tulip tree Spathodea campanulata Beauv. (Bignoniaceae). In this study, I characterized the tree species composition of S. campanulata forests in Puerto Rico as means to evaluate if biotic homogenization is occurring. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to examine what variables were related to the large (≥10 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]), small (≥2.5 to <10 cm DBH), and juvenile (<2.5 cm DBH) tree species composition of 20 sites. Species composition was strongly related to substrate properties, less related to land use history, and unrelated to spatial attributes. The introduced species component was low (mean = 17%, S.E. = 1.8) and compositional differences were mostly due to native tree species of secondary to old growth forests on equivalent substrates. Animals appear to disperse most species (86%) into these forests yet because of this some introduced species will persist. Although uncommon species were largely absent, recent species establishment is shaped by substrate properties making biotic homogenization in these forests unlikely. The S. campanulata forests of Puerto Rico facilitate native tree species establishment in lands where poor management practices extirpated the original forest.

Biological N2 Fixation (BNF) is a process of great importance in crop production systems, to enhance sustainability and prevent land degradation in modern agriculture. The impact of the biofertilizer (NPKB) produced from PK rock biofertilizer mixed with earthworm compound enriched in N by free living diazotrophic bacteria and of the bioprotector (NPKP) with chitosan from Cunninghamella elegans were investigated in a field experiment with melon. The study compared the influence of biofertilizers with soluble fertilizers (NPKF) on the melon characteristics and nutrient uptake. The experiment was conducted (February - April 2012) in the Bahia state, Brazil, and the treatments were NPKP (4thaâ1); NPKP (8thaâ1); NPKP (12thaâ1); NPKB (8thaâ1); NPKB (12thaâ1); and NPKF (soluble mineral fertilizers) at the recommended rate for irrigated melon. A control with an earthworm compound (20thaâ1) that was not inoculated with diazotrophic bacteria was added as a comparison. The results demonstrated a positive effect of NPKP and NPKB, especially when applied at a higher rate (12thaâ1), which increased the commercial characteristics of melon compared with the soluble fertilizer applied in the recommended rate. Nutrient uptake in the melon fruits indicated a significant difference among the different fertilizer sources and the best results were displayed with NPKB and NPKP applied at the highest rate (12thaâ1), especially for total S-SO4â2. Therefore, NPKP and the NPKB are potential alternatives to soluble fertilizers (NPKF).";"Stamford, Newton P.

In this study, vulnerability of groundwater to nonpoint source pollution was assessed using GIS techniques and employing both Generic and Pesticide DRASTIC models. Calculated vulnerability indices ranged between 68–206 and 69–236 for Generic and Pesticide DRASTIC, respectively. Areas lying between “moderately high” to “high” vulnerability categories extend along the coastline in areas covered by the recent Eolian sand dunes where saltwater intrusion is prevalent. The “low” vulnerability category is restricted to a small portion of the area in the NW, and it is represented by poorly drained soils with topographic gradients above 18%. A sizeable portion of the area was classified into “moderately low” to “moderate” vulnerability category, which is typified by low topographic gradients (<2%) and fairly uniform distributions of hydraulic conductivity, net recharge and depth to water table. The validation of the DRASTIC models was accomplished through pairwise comparison of DRASTIC vulnerability maps (using Pearson's r correlation coefficient) with a total of 18 raster layers representing original DRASTIC input data, land use/land cover (LULC) features, and groundwater Cl⁻ and NO₃ ⁻ data. Results from the correlation analysis indicate a significant association between high groundwater NO₃ ⁻ concentrations and distances from certain LULC types, including open-field farms, citrus orchards, industrial complexes, and residential buildings.";"Güler, Cüneyt

Firstly, there is no guarantee of ecological compensation system in desertification control. On the basis of knowing land desertification connotation, the western region is taken as an example to analyze the serious consequence brought by land desertification, besides, the connotation and importance of ecological compensation are summarized, as well as the views related to resolve the benefit compensation of ecological environment in the world are introduced. The ecological compensation is mainly based on the compensation theory of public goods and the value theory of ecological environment, besides, it emphasizes using tax to realize internalization of resources external benefit. Secondly, lack of current ecological compensation system caused the low enthusiasm of people to take part in land desertification control, besides; the current relevant regulations of ecological benefit compensation in China are introduced. At present, the systematic and complete management method and relevant regulations related to ecological compensation of land desertification control have not been published yet, so the interest of governing subject is hard to be protected and the enthusiasm of controlling land desertification in forest and farm is seriously damaged. Based on this view, it is proposed that the desertification control should closely be combined with local economic development to construct the long-term mechanism for mutually promoting desertification control and economic development. Finally, some suggestions of constructing ecological compensation system in the process of controlling desertification are explored. Firstly, scientific development view is taken as guidance to enhance the strength of ecological compensation legislation; Secondly, the ecological compensation mechanism  is carried out  approaches innovation; Thirdly, policy innovation of ecological compensation mechanism  is realized; Fourthly, the law of China for desert defense and control is modified and the concrete regulations of ecological compensation is added to make the  legalization  and embodiment of  encouraging measures for land desertification control.";"Lu, Zhixiang

A year long coyote howl survey combined with geospatial information systems (GIS) was applied to locate populations within a metropolitan region, to determine the habitats where coyotes most frequently occur, and to estimate group sizes within this urbanized region. Surveys were conducted along the perimeters of natural areas and urban-residential communities. Coyote response rates varied among parks, they increased during the dispersal season relative to the breeding and pup-rearing seasons, and responses increased when broadcasts were performed closer to sunset and/or later at night as well as when temperatures were low and the moon more visible. Group sizes were estimated to be between five and 13 individuals within the parks studied, although almost half of all responses originated from outside park boundaries. In the residential areas, natural land cover was present and the areas from which coyotes were predicted to have called contained a greater proportion of natural cover than the region as a whole but variation in land cover was much greater outside parks. Overall, howl surveys allowed for an inexpensive monitoring of coyotes over large areas in urban-park environments.";"Kenaga, Beth A.

For refuge planners and managers tasked with maintaining ecological integrity and wildlife habitat, many uncertainties exist. In forests in the Upper Midwest, for instance, exotic earthworms are impacting ecosystem structure and function, but their community composition and effects on refuges is unknown. We examined the association of earthworm functional group abundance and community composition within upland forests of refuges with broad scale patterns of anthropogenic land use and local scale differences in forest characteristics. Patterns of anthropogenic land cover, including proportion of the land, mean patch area, and largest patch index, were strongly correlated with the biomass of epi-endogeic earthworms. Earthworm community diversity, however, was inversely related to patterns of dominating anthropogenic land cover, and increased under high ratios of natural to anthropogenic lands in the surrounding ecoregion. Within forests, earthworm community composition could be partially explained by variables representing both dispersal opportunities and habitat suitability. In general, heavily-invaded forests had low conifer dominance, high silt content, high basal area, greater amounts of anthropogenic cover within 500 m, and were closer to roads and farther from agriculture. However, the relationship between local forest characteristics and biomass differed greatly among earthworm functional groups and between refuges dominated by natural lands and those dominated by anthropogenic lands. For refuges with high earthworm loads and well developed earthworm communities, managers may be confounded in restoring historic conditions and may need to look at multiple tools, including artificial regeneration, to mitigate for current earthworm effects. In refuges seemingly in earlier stages of earthworm invasion, future planning and management should be tempered by potential effects observed in those refuges in more anthropogenic landscapes.";"Shartell, Lindsey M.

In North Africa and the Middle East (MENA), agricultural land covers about 5 per cent; in Egypt and Algeria, it occupies less than 4 per cent and, in Libya, less than 2 per cent of the total national land area. Across the Mediterranean region land use divides between natural pastures/rangelands (ca. 15 per cent), forests and woodlands (ca. 8 per cent), with the ca. 63 per cent remaining desert sands, shallow, rocky, saline, sodic soils and areas effectively sealed by urbanisation. Land degradation is a severe problem in most Mediterranean countries. Estimates for the period 1961 to 2020 show that although the Mediterranean population is likely to more than double, ca. 8.3 million ha of agricultural land (7 per cent) may be lost as a result of continued urbanisation and land degradation. If these estimates are correct, agricultural land per capita would more than halve from ca. 0.48 ha (1961) to ca. 0.21 ha in 2020.

However, up to now, compare with plenty knowledge information on winter soil efflux of forest ecosystems in mid-latitude ecosystems, winter soil efflux of arid areas at mid-latitude ecosystems is scare, Ebinur Lake Area, which is the study area of the present study, is located in arid regions of Northern China, with a vulnerable ecological environment suffering from extreme weather and climate. The objectives of this study were: (1) measure the winter soil respiration rate in our study area and determine its major environmental factors; (2) determine the winter soil CO₂ efflux and its contribution to annual soil CO₂ efflux in different ecosystems; and (3) discuss the estimated method of soil respiration that is most suitable to arid areas. We measured winter soil CO₂ efflux and the associated environment factors in a farmland ecosystem (50a and 9a cotton fields), an abandoned land ecosystem (7a and 3a abandoned lands) and desert ecosystem (Populus euphratica, Phragmites australis communities and sandy desert) in Ebinur Lake Area, China. The average winter soil respiration rate in the arid areas in the mid-latitude was 0.063 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ to 0.730 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. Specifically, the average winter soil respiration rate in the farmland ecosystems, abandoned land ecosystems and desert ecosystems were 0.686 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹, 0.443 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ and 0.276 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹, respectively. Range of annual Q ₁₀ (known as the increase in soil respiration rate per 10°C increase in temperature) in the three ecosystems were 0.989 to 4.962, 1.971 to 2.096 and 0.947 to 5.173, respectively. The relatively higher Q ₁₀ values in the different ecosystems were all obtained in winter. We found that water (in the form of soil moisture or atmospheric humidity) was the primary factor that affected the change of soil respiration rate in the winter. Winter soil CO₂ efflux were 9 g C m⁻² to 132 g C m⁻² and 19 g C m⁻² to 130 g C m⁻² by the observed and modelled method for soil respiration, respectively. The average winter soil CO₂ efflux were 79.4 and 78.7 g C m⁻², reLspectively. The contributions of winter soil CO₂ efflux to annual one were 4% to 31% and 4% to 30%. In the study area, the model using the observed ecosystem-specific response equations between soil respiration and water-temperature simulated the soil respiration rate was the most suitable ones.";"Qin, L.

"AGRIS:US201500196872";"Recreational boaters' perceptions of scenic value in Rhode Island coastal waters";"";"Scenic value has long been recognized as an important feature in land use planning and management. In the US, several states have included scenic value provisions in their coastal zone legislation and required that reviews of project proposals consider scenic or aesthetic effects. In Rhode Island, all permitting decisions must take into account the effect of a proposed activity in the coastal zone, such as a new dock or expanded aquaculture facility, on scenic or aesthetic value. However, there is limited guidance for how the terms scenic value or aesthetic value should be interpreted. A mail survey of 500 recreational boaters registered in Rhode Island was conducted to investigate: (1) what scenic value of the coastal zone means to RI recreational boaters; (2) how different factors, including characteristics of boat owners, features of boats, and presence of boats in the landscape, relate to perceptions of scenic value; and (3) the relationship between perceptions of scenic value and destination choices of RI boaters. Findings indicate that RI recreational boaters preferred settings with less human influence and more natural features, but scenic value did not necessarily mean no human influence for participants. There were no strong relationships between scenic value ratings and respondent characteristics or boat features, yet there was a strong positive relationship between scenic value ratings of certain types of settings and the frequency with which respondents visited those types of settings. Coastal zone managers, land use planners, and local decision makers can use results from this study to better understand the meaning of scenic value, to guide planning and permitting in the coastal zone, and to help anticipate public response to proposed activities that could affect scenic or aesthetic value of the shoreline and adjacent coastal waters.";"Dalton, Tracey

Following an extensive control program, the disease was eradicated within 4 months, after infecting more than 75 000 horses on over 10 000 properties. In Queensland, examination of land use patterns revealed that the majority of infected premises (89.5%) were located in one of three land use classes viz. rural residential, residential-unspecified or grazing natural vegetation. All nine clusters of infection in Queensland were surrounded to some degree by parcels of land whose designated use precluded the presence of horses. In four clusters, these horse-free areas completely enclosed the cluster and spread was limited to a relatively small area whereas the remaining five clusters were not completely surrounded by horse-free buffers and spread was much more extensive. The cumulative incidence of infection with EI dropped from 41% of properties in rural-residential areas to 4% of properties located further than 5 km from rural-residential areas. This decrease was associated with a 10-fold increase in the median size of properties and a 5-fold decrease in the density of horses on those premises. There was a strong negative correlation between the cumulative incidence of infection and the median property size (R = -0.91, P < 0.05) and a positive correlation with the horse density on those properties (R = 0.93, P < 0.01).";"East, I.J.";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"land use;grazing lands;rural areas;zoning";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"AUS";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301677705";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01080.x";"";"";"";"292-302"

For modelling purposes, we considered eight predictors related to vegetation, topography, human influence and heterogeneity. We obtained vegetation and ecological predictors from land use/land cover maps derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images (acquired at the same time as the field data) and calculated vegetation indices by using a supervised classification method. We obtained topographical predictors from a Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) and used a generalized linear model to describe the occurrence of the European wild rabbit. The overall accuracy of the Landsat-derived map in Baixa Limia was 87.51� %, and the kappa coefficient was 0.85. The most parsimonious model included “grassland and crops”, “mean slope”, “distance to roads”, “urban settlements” and “ecotone scrubland-forest”.

"AGRIS:US201500003301";"use of detailed biotope data for linking biodiversity with ecosystem services in Finland";"";"It has been widely accepted that ecosystem services (ESs) should be taken into account in natural resource management decisions. Hence, there is an increasing need for innovative quantification methods and tools to evaluate ESs on different landscape scales, and under varying land-use forms. Integrating biodiversity protection with the provision of ESs is a key element for sustainable land-use planning. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis, together with various environmental data, provide a suitable foundation for ESs evaluations. Recent advances in earth observation technologies have supported land-cover-based ESs mapping on global, regional and local scales. Global and regional land-cover maps can help in coarse assessments of some biophysical characteristics of the environment, but they cannot provide exact information about local biodiversity and biotope types that form the base of ESs supply. Therefore, more detailed tools such as aerial photographs and field surveys are needed. High-quality biotope data are usually fragmentary or absent for private land in Finland, but are available for most state-owned commercial forests and protection areas. We tested the use of biotope data derived from aerial photographs and an extensive field inventory to map ESs in natural protection areas in northern Finland. We argue that protection areas, where large and long-term databases have been collected, offer excellent study sites to develop further the methodology for integrating coarse-scale remote-sensing data, such as CORINE, with more detailed ecological and structural data collected from aerial photographs and ground surveys. In addition, the use of detailed biotope data supports the linkage of biodiversity information with landscapes' capacities to provide ESs. Different data sources will improve the management of protection areas, thereby optimizing multiple land-use objectives.";"Vihervaara, Petteri

Peri-urban forests are under strong anthropic pressure. Any activity needs a previous identification of stakeholders, landscape perception, socio-economic trends in local communities and their relationships with land and natural resources. Kinshasa (capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC) is a 10 millions inhabitants city with rapid growth and increasing impacts on surrounding villages linked with forest natural resources. This paper describes the relationship amongst local communities stakeholders and their relations with land areas and wood resources. Two areas surrounding Kinshasa (Bas-Congo and Bateke Plateaux) are considered as major fuel-wood and charcoal supply zones for the city. Those two areas are different in terms of land pressure (very high in Bas-Congo and focused on riparian forests on Bateke Plateaux), but show the same pattern of overuse of the forest and woody natural resources. In both areas, local management of forest resources by the traditional authorities (heads of village or lineage) has failed. Local population willingness for reforestation and forest restoration activities is much more important in Bas-Congo than on Bateke Plateaux. In both areas, shifting cultivation due to slash and burn practices for agricultural and charcoal practices are more and more quick. This has strong negative impact on the potential of regeneration process with local forest species. Sustainability of forest natural resources management by communities is discussed in regard to the on going negotiations on community based forest management regulations.";"Vermeulen, C.

Plant density was significantly higher under charcoal production (7131 ± 755 plants/ha) and cultivation (6612 ± 665 plants/ha) compared with the grazing lands (4152 ± 525 plants/ha). At the plot level, species richness and Fisher's alpha diversity (α) were relatively low, ranging 2–31 species and 0.34–6.34, respectively, but both were significantly higher under charcoal production and cultivation compared with grazing. Similarly, cumulative species richness and Fisher's alpha diversity were higher under charcoal production and cultivation compared with grazing. Community species composition differed significantly (Global RANOSIM = 0.14, p = 0.001; ANOSIM, ANalysis Of SIMilarity) among land uses. However, the distance of sampling plots away from households, the assumed source of human disturbance to woodlands, accounts for a very small fraction (<14.2%) of the variation in woody species diversity within this multiple-use savanna. Beta diversity was highest under grazing, followed by cultivation and charcoal production, suggesting a more heterogeneous spatial distribution of species under grazing. Within each land use, mean similarities were low, ranging 25–31%. Mean pairwise dissimilarities between land uses were relatively high, ranging 73–81%. This suggests that variations in species composition and diversity are to a great extent influenced by land-use and anthropogenic disturbances. The relatively low woody species diversity and richness in this savanna indicates woodland degradation, fragmentation and local species loss resulting from unsustainable harvesting for charcoal, and short interval shifting cultivation.";"Kalema, Vettes Neckemiah

Given that urban habitats introduce novel benefits (e.g., anthropogenic resources) and pressures (e.g., mortality risks), conflicting mechanisms have been hypothesized to drive the dynamics of urban bird populations. Topâdown processes such as predation predict reduced survivorship in suburban and urban habitats, whereas bottomâup processes, such as increased resource availability, predict peak survival in suburban habitats. In this study, we use markârecapture data of seven focal species encountered between 2000 and 2012 to test hypotheses about the processes that regulate avian survival along an urbanization gradient in greater Washington, D.C., USA. American Robin, Gray Catbird, Northern Cardinal, and Song Sparrow exhibited peak survival at intermediate and upper portions of the ruralâtoâurban gradient; this pattern supports the hypothesis that bottomâup processes (e.g., resource availability) can drive patterns of avian survival in some species. In contrast, Carolina Chickadee showed no response and Carolina and House Wren showed a slightly negative response to urban land cover. These contrasting results underscore the need for comparative studies documenting the mechanisms that drive demography and how those factors differentially affect urban adapted and urban avoiding species.";"Evans, Brian S.

The greatest species diversity and abundance was recorded in relatively less human impacted areas, than in more disturbed sites. Of the seven species recorded to chorus during cooler months, only Limnodynastes peronii successfully breed and only in disturbed sites. The species was also more abundant in such areas than more pristine habitat. Oviposition time influenced larval growth rate, although there was no defined trend over time. Intra-clutch variation in weight achieved (over 10 weeks) was greater than among clutches. Ability to take advantage of breeding habitat that is sub-optimal for other species, the ability to breed year around and larval growth plasticity have apparently pre-adapted this species to thrive in urban impacted habitat, in contrast to most local endemic species.";"Schell, C.

We develop and parameterize a spatially explicit two-dimensional model of species spread that allows for differential control across space and time, and we solve for optimal control strategies. We find that the qualitative nature of optimal strategies depend in interesting ways on aspects of landscape and invasion geometry. For example, we show that reducing the extent of exposed invasion edge, through spread, removal, or strategically employing landscape features, can be an optimal strategy because it reduces long-term containment costs. We also show that optimal invasion control is spatially and temporally “forward-looking” in the sense that strategies should be targeted to slow the spread of an invasion in the direction of greatest potential long-term damages. These and other novel findings contribute to the largely nonspatial literature on optimally controlling invasions and to understanding control of spatial-dynamic processes in general.";"Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca S.

Yet, integrative thinking and action often remain problematic due to the competing interests and ambitions involved in coastal zone planning and management and the legacy of established development on the coast. This paper presents a developmental timeline to critically consider institutional responses to coastal development and seeks to locate contemporary challenges, such as climate change, in the context of a new environmental determinism. The argument is put forward that securing a shared understanding of development conditions and risks needs to be predicated on creating more robust conditions for interaction and fostering a sounder appreciation of the inter-dependencies of natural processes and governance. The concept of resilience is critically explored in order to consider a normative analytical framework for facilitating social learning and developing a reciprocal understanding of social–ecological dynamics that offers a spectrum of resilience options.

However, the existing literature has been slow to assess the impacts of proposed REDD projects on the livelihoods of forest communities in the developing world, or the implications of these local realities for the success of REDD+ initiatives in general. This study presents ethnographic research conducted with communities within the April-Salomei pilot REDD+ Project in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Several cases of institutional biases and uneven power relationships have been exploited by local elites to prevent landowners from making free and informed choices about their involvement in the project, although landowners and local communities are well positioned to capture forthcoming project benefits. By underestimating the scale and impact of traditional shifting cultivation practices, the credibility of the REDD+ project design and the value of any future carbon credits are critically undermined. Based on the actual practices found in PNG, the authors' radical proposal is to call for a halt on REDD development in PNG while institutional enabling conditions are improved, comprehensive landowner consultations conducted, and detailed mapping and genealogical surveys of landowners completed. Without these developments, future REDD+ projects in PNG are unlikely to benefit either the global climate or local development.";"Leggett, Matthew

We develop a dynamic nested optimal control model of carbon sequestration associated with the decision to afforest a tract of land given there are uncertainties associated with fire and insect/disease hazards.  Conceptually, these potential hazards are similar in that their occurrence at any time t is uncertain and landowners can take specific actions – although generally different actions - in any time period t to reduce the probability of sustaining losses related to them. The hazards differ, however, in that fire represents a large loss in carbon at a moment in time, while insect/disease infestations are more likely to be reflected in a period of significant slowing of the rate of carbon accumulation than was anticipated followed by a sustained period of slowly decreasing carbon losses. The nature of these losses will influence the design of incentives under GHG mitigation frameworks that require carbon losses to be replaced as well as the strategies farmers adopt to deal with the uncertainties associated with these events occurring.";"Kim, C.S.

Such systems based on apple (Malus spp.), peach (Prunus spp.), and pear (Pyrus spp.) are common in northwest Guatemala as low intensity homegardens and are known to increase total farm productivity in communities where farm size is a limiting factor. This study investigated the potential for adoption of fruit-tree-based agroforestry by resource-limited farmers using ethnographic investigation and linear programming simulations of farm activities at the household level. Two communities with differing demographics, infrastructure, and access to regional markets were selected based on the presence of extensive fruit-tree-based agroforestry. The influences of family size, land holdings, and tree and crop yields on the optimal adoption levels of fruit trees were evaluated through a comparative study of the varying social and physical infrastructure present in the two communities. Fruit-tree-based agroforestry was potentially more attractive to relatively prosperous families or those with larger land holdings. Improvements in fruit-tree productivity and interspecies competition were of greater importance where family land holdings were smaller. The inability of families to produce sufficient food to meet annual needs, poor fruit quality, and lack of market infrastructure were identified as constraints that limit adoption. The complementarity of production with the dominant maize (Zea mays) crop, home consumption of fruit, and the potential to generate additional cash on limited land holdings were identified as factors promoting adoption of fruit-tree-based agroforestry.";"Bellow, J.

The presence of intraspecific competition is expected to negatively affect inter-tree spacing, individual size distributions and plant physiology as well as survival/mortality. In this field removal experiment on Acacia mellifera, one of South Africa's most common encroachers on nutrient-poor soils, the growth, water relations and mortalities of shrubs where all neighbouring woody competitors were removed (target) were monitored three times during each of three growing seasons. After 3 years, the nitrogen and carbon isotopic ratios of the study plants were analysed. Target shrubs benefitted from removal of neighbours, resulting in greater growth, less water stress, a relatively small degree of canopy dieback and reduced reliance on N₂ fixation. Target shrubs grew by 25 ± 4% in height relative to 7 ± 4% for controls, with the targets suffering a maximum of <15% canopy dieback compared to up to 60% in the controls. Severe environmental stress is known to affect neighbour interactions among shrubs and competition may constrain shrub sizes and avoid density-dependent mortality. In contrast, release from competition in our study may have allowed greater growth of target plants, increasing their total evapo-transpirational leaf surface areas and leaving them vulnerable to drought and water stress. Intratree competition on shallow nutrient-poor soils in savannas may thus aid the persistence of bush encroachment by regulating the sizes of individual shrubs below the threshold of drought vulnerability.";"Kambatuku, Jack R.

It makes sense, therefore, to expect the proposed introduction of the SPS support system in Hungary to have a much deeper impact on income, land prices and rental fees than that experienced by the family farms to the west of us. At the same time, it can also be assumed that this regulatory element will be significant beyond itself; that is, that following fundamental change in the EU market’s rules and regulations, it will leave its mark on the structure of ownership through its effect on arable land prices. The main cause of the uncertainties surrounding introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in Hungary can be traced to the backwardness of land redistribution and farming regulations. For this reason, government measures are needed in these areas as quickly as possible. The redistribution of landed property would have a stimulating effect on land turnover and would also bring land prices more in line with value. Improved opportunities for environmentally- friendly agricultural production can also be highlighted as a further favourable effect of land redistribution. Determining the aims and toolkit of agricultural policy and, within this, determining the guiding principles of ownership policy as well as the land redistribution and farming regulations that serve it, are strongly interdependent tasks requiring swift resolution. It would be possible with such help to increase the international competitiveness of agriculture, positively influencing the agricultural sectors’ population sustaining abilities and, not least, promoting more environmentally-friendly farming than is currently practiced.";"Alvincz, Jozsef";"";"";"AGRIS";"2008-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016207347";"http://purl.umn.edu/57739";"";"";"";""

After reviewing the results, we consider how new owners may be managing water resources differently than longtime owners and what the ecological implications of this shift in management might be for Montana's prized wild fisheries. Uses more closely associated with new owners than with longtime owners include water reallocation to instream uses, aquatic and riparian ecosystem restoration, and fish pond construction. These uses have both positive and negative impacts on the region's fisheries.

This phenomenon is examined through the theoretical lens of financialization. On the surface the trend resembles a sort of financialization in reverse – many new investments involve agricultural production in addition to land ownership. Farmland also fits well into current financial discourses, which emphasize getting the right kind of exposure to long-term agricultural trends and ‘value investing’ in genuinely productive companies. However, capital markets' current affinity for farmland also represents significant continuity with the financialization era, particularly in the treatment of land as a financial asset. Capital gains are central to current farmland investments, both as a source of inflation hedging growth and of potentially large speculative profits. New types of farmland investment management organizations (FIMOs) are emerging, including from among large farmland operators that formerly valued land primarily as a productive asset. Finally, the first tentative steps toward the securitization of farmland demonstrate the potential for a much more complete financialization of farmland in the future.";"Fairbairn, Madeleine";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land ownership";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001800";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2013.873977";"";"";"";"777-795"
"AGRIS:US201600001803";"problem of property in industrial fisheries";"";"Fisheries systems are widely considered to be ‘in crisis’ in both economic and ecological terms, a considerable concern given their global significance to food security, international trade and employment. The most common explanation for the crisis suggests that it is caused by weak and illiberal property regimes. It follows that correcting the crisis involves the creation of private property rights that will restore equilibrium between the profitable, productive function of fishing firms and fish stocks in order to maximize ‘rent’. In this approach, coastal states are seen as passive, weak, failed and/or corrupted observers and facilitators of the fisheries crisis, unless they institute private property relations. This paper offers an alternative analysis by using the perspective of historical materialism to re-examine longstanding debates over the problem of property and its relation to ground-rent in industrial fisheries. It identifies coastal states as modern landed property, enabling an exploration of the existence of and struggles over surplus value, and drawing attention to the role of the state and the significance of the environmental conditions of production in understanding political-ecological conditions in fisheries. As on land, property in the sea is a site of social struggle and will always remain so under capitalism, no matter which juridical interest holds the property rights.";"Campling, Liam

It is not until the mid-Holocene (after 7000 cal BP) that persistent and widespread forest loss occurs, with burning and the transplanting of Musa banana into an open grassland environment, which is contemporary with local archaeological features representing cultivation practices. Multi-proxy palaeoecological evidence at Kuk provides a robust vegetation history and land use chronology for the Upper Wahgi Valley for the late Pleistocene and Holocene, including the emergence of an agricultural landscape by 7000 cal BP. Subsequent agricultural developments in the highlands of New Guinea can be seen as a series of continuing indigenous innovations in agricultural technology in the face of increased land degradation, climate change and external influences.";"Haberle, Simon G.

In the early twentieth century, scholars first began to examine the role of the environment in the rise and collapse of the great southern Maya polities of the Classic period, proposing that deforestation was an important factor in their political fragmentation and depopulation between the eighth and tenth centuries. In the last twenty-five years, this hypothesis has gained broad acceptance largely due to research at the ancient city of Copan, Honduras. At Copan, scholars claim to have demonstrated that the Maya failed to sustainably manage their forests in the face of rising populations, and that they consequently destroyed vital natural resources. In spite of the popularity of the deforestation hypothesis, evidence in support of it is scant. New research at Copan, described here, rejects deforestation as a cause of that polity’s collapse. Instead, it shows that human populations at that site, as in many parts of the lowland Maya region, adapted to diverse environmental contexts and produced food, building materials, and fuel without destroying the landscape’s potential to support large populations over the long term.";"McNeil, Cameron L.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2012-12-31";"en";"sustainable land management;deforestation";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Forest Tenure";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"HND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500210193";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.06.055";"";"";"";"19-30"

"AGRIS:US201500217411";"Why community ownership? Understanding land reform in Scotland";"";"In 1999 the Scottish Parliament convened for the first time in almost 300 years and in response to long-standing popular discontent about highly concentrated land ownership passed the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Quite in contrast to the emphasis that much of the international development literature and policy have placed on the importance of individual private ownership, Scotland's land reform promotes community ownership. Rather than breaking up large private estates, land reformers aim to keep these estates whole while transferring ownership of them to local communities. This study uses historical analysis and in-depth interviews to understand why this is being pursued as a rural development strategy in Scotland today. It finds that community ownership is intended not only to encourage the development of resources that private investors might otherwise ignore; but also to enable local communities to guide the development process. Whereas unfettered, market-driven entrepreneurship might generate increased wealth, but not necessarily benefit the local community, community ownership aims to make sure that wealth generated from the land remains within the community; that the benefits of development are evenly spread; that needed services are provided; that the population is maintained; and that resources are managed for the long-term benefit of the community. In this way the Scottish land reform represents a shift (or rather a broadening) of emphasis, from a focus on wealth creation to a recognition of the importance of effective local democratic governance.";"Hoffman, Matthew";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land reform;rural development;private ownership";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217411";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.07.013";"";"";"";"289-297"

A GIS-based Multi Criteria Decision Making land suitability analysis was performed. Hereby, several suitability factors including soils, climatic conditions, and water availability were evaluated, based on expert knowledge from stakeholders at various levels. An Analytical Hierarchical Process was used to rank the various suitability factors and the resulting weights were used to construct the suitability map layers. In doing so, the derived weights were used, and subsequently land suitability maps for irrigated and dry-farm agriculture were created. Finally, a synthesized land suitability map was generated by combining these maps and by comparing the product with current land use SPOT 5 satellite images. The resulting suitability maps indicate the areas, in which the intensity of land use for agriculture should increase, decrease or remain unchanged. Our investigations have revealed that 65676 hectares may be suitable for irrigation and 120872 hectares may be suitable for dry-farm agriculture. This indicates a substantial potential to satisfy the significantly increasing regional demand for agricultural products. The results of our research have been provided to the regional authorities and will be used in strategic land use planning.";"Feizizadeh, Bakhtiar

In this paper, we detected land-cover changes in the Qaidam Area between 1990 and 2003 in attempt to depict its spatial variability. The land-cover changes were categorized into two trends: degradation and amelioration, and their spatial patterns were examined. Then we estimated the correlation coefficients between growing-season NDVI and several climatic factors with the consideration of duration and lagging effects. The results show that the inter-annual NDVI variations are positively correlated with May to July precipitations, but not significantly correlated with sunshine duration. We observed no obvious trend in precipitation or sunshine duration from 1990 to 2003. Thus, the authors suggest that their slight fluctuations may not be responsible to the decade-scaled land-cover changes. However, our results indicate a good positive relationship between the NDVI trend and climate warming in the ameliorated areas, but a negative one in the degraded areas. By statistical analyses, we found that degradations mainly occurred at the oasis boundaries and at lower elevations in the non-oasis regions where effective soil moisture might have been reduced by the warming-caused increase in evapotranspiration. At higher elevations where thermal condition acts as a major limiting factor, ameliorations were unequivocally detected, which is attributable to the direct facilitation by temperature increases. We suggest that the impacts of the observed climate warming on vegetation are spatially heterogeneous, depending on the combinations of thermal condition and moisture availability.";"Zeng, Biao

"AGRIS:US2016212404";"Effect of decoupling and agri-environmental policy on biodiversity in the uplands in UK";"";"Recent decades have witnessed substantial losses in biodiversity in Europe, principally driven by the ecological changes associated with intensification of agricultural production. These changes especially affected the biodiversity in the marginal areas, such as the uplands in UK, since the habitat change was greater than in lowland zones. Livestock farming is the main land use in these areas, and economic viability of these farmers substantially relies on income coming from agricultural subsidies and different agri-environmental payments. The production decisions are influenced by these incentives and those have a subsequent effect on biodiversity. In order to address the problem of economic viability of farmers together with its impact on biodiversity conservation, we developed ecological-economic models for four typical farm types in the Peak District National Park in UK. We analyse the effect of policies on upland avian densities, focusing on decoupling and agri-environment schemes. The results show that the impact of these policies individually, which sometimes opposite, differs from their aggregated effect. It also shows that the effect differs across farm types. This means that from a biodiversity point of view whatever future policy options are chosen will result in winners and losers.";"Acs, Szvetlana

"AGRIS:US201301635210";"Land Manager and Researcher Perspectives on Invasive Plant Research Needs in the Midwestern United States";"";"In 2006, the Midwest Invasive Plant Network's Research Committee conducted a web-based survey to help identify research needs and interactions between land managers and researchers working to manage invasive plants in the Midwest. Of 192 responses, 30% identified themselves as researchers and 70% identified themselves as managers. Researchers and managers rated working together on invasive plant issues as high or medium in importance, but neither group rated the current level of cooperation as high, with over 90% describing current cooperation as low or medium. Both groups self-associate, with 89% of researchers working with other researchers and 77% of managers working with other managers. “Lack of time” and “lack of money” were the main issues limiting researchers and land managers from working more closely together: money was a greater constraint for researchers and time was more important for land managers. To help researchers and land managers work more effectively together, both groups favored opportunities to develop research-based projects at land managers' sites, with funding from a cooperative grant program. Open-ended responses suggest that on-site experiments and demonstrations of management methods could help researchers and land managers interact more effectively. Researchers rated basic biology as more important than land managers did, but neither group judged testing theories of invasion as a high priority. “Social/political factors” and “risk assessment” were viewed as less important despite their clear relevance in the introduction and spread of invasive plants.";"Renz, Mark

"AGRIS:US201300809671";"Tracking the effects of one century of habitat lossand fragmentation on calcareous grassland butterfly communities";"";"Habitat loss and fragmentation are known to reduce patch sizes and increase their isolation, consequently leading to modifications in species richness and community structure. Calcareous grasslands are among the richest ecosystems in Europe for insect species. About 10% (1,150 ha) of the total area of a calcareous ridge region (Calestienne, Belgium) and its butterfly community was analysed over a timeframe of about 100 years. Since 1905 to present day (2005), the Calestienne region has undergone both calcareous grassland loss and fragmentation: not only did calcareous grassland size decrease and isolation increase, but also, the number of calcareous grassland patches within the landscape increased until 1965, and subsequently decreased, clearly reflecting the effects of fragmentation. These processes have had a profound effect on the butterfly community: extinction and rarefaction affected significantly more often specialist species, which means that generalist species are more and more overrepresented. This ecological drift, i.e. the replacement of specialists by generalists in species assemblages is likely to be a general effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on natural communities.";"Polus, Emmanuelle

"AGRIS:US2012209705";"Introducing Different Land Uses (Irrigated and Non-Irrigated) in Policy Analysis Modelling for Mediterranean Countries";"";"The arable crop sector in Spain is highly dependent of the Community subsidies and account for 33% of total transfers received by the Community.  Then, it is expected that the introduction of the Single Farm Payment (SFP) will drive important changes in the arable crop production in Spain.  The quantitative assessment of the SFP impacts on the arable crop sector in Spain is the overall objective of this paper.  To achieve this goal, an econometric, dynamic, multi-product and partial equilibrium commodity model has been built disaggregating between irrigated and non-irrigated land use for cereals called Spanish Econometric Simulation of Agricultural Policies (SESAP).  Results indicated that the introduction of the SFP has only induced considerable changes from the Agenda 2000 in the supply side, having found only small changes in imports and exports, and insignificant or null changes in domestic use.  Cereals and oilseeds production is expected higher decreases under the SFP scenario than under the Agenda 2000.  The main differences between irrigated and non-irrigated production of the different cereals are two.  Wheat and barley are mainly produced in non-irrigated land where production shows less dependence on policy changes in the case of wheat and have a positive impact in the case of barley. However, barely and maize irrigated production would have remained constant under the Agenda 2000 but a decrease of 25% is predicted under the SFP scenario.  In addition, maize is mainly produced in irrigated land, and the non-irrigated production will enormously decrease until almost disappear in the near future.";"Casado, Jose Maria

"AGRIS:LV2016001744";"La gestion fourragère dans les élevages laitiers des Andes sèches : rationalité et performances";"";"For some fifteen years, dairy cattle farming has been considerably developing in various parts of the Andes. Milk is transformed into cheese or sold fresh, giving rural families a regular income which secures their food supply. The stock-rearing practices in these Andean dairying systems are unrecognized and are often considered, wrongly, as underperforming and inadequate. Eight families, belonging to a rural community in the dry parts of the Peruvian Andes (in Sinto), were monitored during a whole season; the analysis of their stock-rearing practices constituted the basis of this paper’s assessment of the forage management in use in these dairy farms subject to severe constraints. The allotment of cattle heads, the rotational grazing of irrigated lucerne pastures by the cows in milk, the availability of huge rangelands, and the swapping of foggage make it possible for the Sinto farmers to produce milk all the year round, in spite of their very dry climate. The amount of milk produced in each family and its regularity during the year depend narrowly however on the area of irrigated land to which they have access. The low milk performances per cow are no obstacle to a good output per hectare of lucerne, which corresponds to both an optimal use of the main limiting factor and to a good risk management.

Le suivi de 8 familles d’une communauté paysanne des Andes péruviennes sèches (Sinto) et l’analyse de leurs pratiques d’élevage constituent le support de la réflexion menée sur la cohérence de la gestion fourragère de ces élevages laitiers soumis à de fortes contraintes. L’allotement des bovins, le pâturage tournant des luzernières irriguées par les vaches laitières, le recours aux parcours et les échanges de fourrages sur pied permettent de produire du lait toute l’année dans un climat très sec. Le volume de lait produit par une famille et sa régularité sur une campagne sont liés à la superficie de foncier irrigué à laquelle elle a accès. Les faibles performances par vache n’empêchent pas l’obtention de bons rendements laitiers par hectare de luzerne, principal facteur limitant, et une gestion des risques.";"Aubron, Claire

How do the woody plant communities we describe, based on representative sampling, compare to those of previous New Zealand classifications? Methods: We used cluster analysis to classify data from 1177 systematically located vegetation plots, calculated spatial extent and ecological statistics for each alliance defined, and combined forest alliances into groups to assess correspondence with earlier mapped classifications. We used plot-based data on vegetation structure to infer potential community changes. Results: Twenty-four alliances were recognized, each of 19 to 105 plots, with estimated extents of 144 000-794 000 ha. Stand structure data suggest that 15 alliances are largely stable whereas nine may undergo compositional change. Among alliances, the proportion of exotic species ranged from 0 to 50%. Our forest and shrubland classification is another stage in progressively revising such classifications (i.e. forest class maps, vegetative cover map, ECOSAT woody classification and land cover database) produced over the last five decades. Conclusions: Compared to the previous classifications, our new classification incorporates alliances in disturbed landscapes, as well as those that are compositionally dynamic and which are also invaded by exotic species. It also provides greater partitioning within Nothofagus forests, but fails to distinguish some rare forest types, such as those dominated by Agathis australis. Our classification can contribute to a framework for national reporting of ecological indicators and management of woody vegetation.";"Wiser, Susan K.

However, the survey was based largely on field survey and was conducted over several decades, before being completed in 1997. Given that resources for a repeat survey were limited, this study has used an object-orientated rule-based classification implemented within eCognition of multi-temporal satellite sensor data acquired between 2003 and 2006 to map semi-natural habitats and agricultural land across Wales, thereby allowing a progressive update of the Phase 1 Survey. The classification of objects to Phase 1 habitat classes was undertaken in two steps; firstly the landscape of Wales was divided into objects using orthorectified SPOT-5 High Resolution Geometric (HRG) reflectance data (10 m spatial resolution) and Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) boundaries. A rule-base was then developed to progressively discriminate and map the distribution of 105 sub-habitats across Wales based on time-series of SPOT HRG, Terra-1 Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) LISS-3 data, derived datasets (e.g., vegetation indices, fractional images) and ancillary information (e.g., topography). The rules coupled knowledge of ecology and the information content of these remote sensing data using a combination of thresholds, Boolean operations and fuzzy membership functions. A second rule-base was then developed to translate the more detailed sub-habitat classification to Phase 1 habitat classes. Indicative accuracies of the revised Phase 1 mapping, based on comparisons with the later Phase 2 survey (for selected habitats), were >80% overall and typically between 70% and 90% for many classes. Through this exercise, Wales has become the first country in Europe to produce a national map of habitats (as opposed to land cover) through object-orientated classification of satellite sensor data. Furthermore, the approach can be adapted to allow continual monitoring of the extent and condition of habitats and agricultural land.";"Lucas, Richard

"AGRIS:US201600007951";"Land cover classification of VHR airborne images for citrus grove identification";"";"Managing land resources using remote sensing techniques is becoming a common practice. However, data analysis procedures should satisfy the high accuracy levels demanded by users (public or private companies and governments) in order to be extensively used. This paper presents a multi-stage classification scheme to update the citrus Geographical Information System (GIS) of the Comunidad Valenciana region (Spain). Spain is the first citrus fruit producer in Europe and the fourth in the world. In particular, citrus fruits represent 67% of the agricultural production in this region, with a total production of 4.24 million tons (campaign 2006–2007). The citrus GIS inventory, created in 2001, needs to be regularly updated in order to monitor changes quickly enough, and allow appropriate policy making and citrus production forecasting. Automatic methods are proposed in this work to facilitate this update, whose processing scheme is summarized as follows. First, an object-oriented feature extraction process is carried out for each cadastral parcel from very high spatial resolution aerial images (0.5 m). Next, several automatic classifiers (decision trees, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines) are trained and combined to improve the final classification accuracy. Finally, the citrus GIS is automatically updated if a high enough level of confidence, based on the agreement between classifiers, is achieved. This is the case for 85% of the parcels and accuracy results exceed 94%. The remaining parcels are classified by expert photo-interpreters in order to guarantee the high accuracy demanded by policy makers.";"Amorós López, J.

"AGRIS:US201400107107";"Comparison of landscape patterns between metropolises and small-sized cities: a gradient analysis with changing grain size in Shanghai and Zhangjiagang, China";"";"Quantifying the urban landscape pattern and its change is fundamental for monitoring and assessing the ecological and socio-economic consequences of urbanization. Using Indian Remote Sensing Panchromatic (IRS-PAN) imagery of 2002 and combining gradient analysis with landscape metrics, we compared the landscape patterns between metropolises and small-sized cities with increasing grain size. Landscape metrics were computed along a 51 × 9 km transect cutting across Shanghai and a 16 × 2 km transect cutting across Zhangjiagang with a moving window. The results showed that fragmentation indices (patch density (PD), total edge (TE), landscape division (LD)) in land use transects of the two cities had many similarities, indicating the common characteristics of urbanization in different-sized cities. There were, however, some striking dissimilarities between the two cities, which did not support the hypothesis that PD increases exponentially along a landscape modification gradient. These differences may have three explanations: the proportion of urban roads area, the width of urban roads and land use change in suburban and rural areas. The proportion of urban road area and the width of urban roads, which should be considered in future research, are two main factors that have been identified to influence the landscape pattern analysis. In younger and smaller cities, spatial competition between local interest groups and imperfect land managerial systems result in an increase in fragmentation in the suburbs, and policymakers should pay more attention to future city planning and management. A bridge linking the urbanization landscape pattern and the process of urban fragmentation will be a key to urban landscape studies and planning.";"Yang, Qi

Critical elements in the formulation of TOA shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes are (1) the transformation from narrowband to broadband values (n/b) and (2) the application of angular distribution models (ADMs) to correct for anisotropy. In this article, the n/b transformations are based on theoretical simulations with a radiative transfer model Moderate Resolution Atmospheric Transmission (MODTRAN) 3.7 using land classification types based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) scheme and a range of realistic atmospheric conditions. The newly developed ADMs are a combination of MODTRAN-3.7 simulations and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)-observed ADMs. To evaluate the impact of the proposed corrections, they are implemented with observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on the Meteorological Satellite (METEOSAT) 8 to derive TOA fluxes and compared to similar quantities from CERES. It is shown that the estimated TOA radiative fluxes have –3% bias and 7% root mean square error (RMSE) when compared with CERES observations at a monthly timescale.";"Niu, Xiaolei

Thus, the planning of land use for agriculture requires new tools to identify the capability of current cultivars to adapt to growth restrictions under new ambient conditions. We hypothesized that salinity stress may produce a specific pattern of carbon isotopic composition (δ¹³C) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) at elevated CO₂ concentration ([CO₂]) that could be used in the breeding of salinity tolerance in a near-future climate scenario. Five commercial tomato cultivars were evaluated at elevated (800μmolmol⁻¹) or standard (400μmolmol⁻¹) [CO₂], being irrigated with a nutrient solution containing 0, 60 or 120mM NaCl. The biomass enhanced ratio, leaf net CO₂ assimilation and stomatal conductance, leaf NO₃ ⁻ and Cl⁻ concentrations and leaf free amino acid profile were analyzed in relation to the pattern of δ¹³C, under different saline stress conditions. The results indicate that at high [CO₂]: (i) salinity tolerance was enhanced, but the response was strongly cultivar dependent, (ii) leaf NO₃ ⁻ concentration was increased whilst Cl⁻ and proline concentrations decreased, and (iii) leaf δ¹³C was highly correlated with plant dry matter accumulation and with leaf proline concentration, leaf gas exchange and ion concentrations. This study shows that δ¹³C is a useful tool for the determination of the salinity tolerance of tomato at high [CO₂], as an integrative parameter of the stress period, and was validated by traditional physiological plant stress traits.";"del Amor, Francisco M.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"land use planning";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500018339";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2012.10.019";"";"";"";"283-290"
"AGRIS:US2016219716";"Agricultural Efficiency Gains and Trade Liberalization in Sudan";"";"The traditional agriculture in Sudan occupies 60% of the total cultivated land and employs 65% of the agricultural population. Nevertheless, it is characterized by its low crop productivity, which is mainly driven by low technical efficiency, while drought and civil conflicts threaten most of its areas countrywide.  Therefore, it has contributed only an average of 16% to the total agricultural GDP during the last decade. This paper addresses from an empirical point of view the sectoral and macroeconomic implications of agricultural efficiency improvement in Sudan and assesses the efficiency gains under the assumption of trade liberalization. Efficiency improvement experiments are implemented by augmenting the efficiency parameters of labor, capital, and land in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) framework. The CGE model of the study relies on the newly produced Sudanese Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), which provides data on 10 agricultural sectors, 10 industrial sectors and 13 service sectors. Results show that improving the agricultural efficiency would lead to improvements in GDP, welfare level, and trade balance. In addition it would also improve the output and competitiveness of the Sudanese agricultural exports and increase their strength to face the challenges of liberalization.";"Siddig, Khalid H.A.

"AGRIS:US201600197059";"What can forest values tell us about human well-being? Insights from two biosphere reserves in Madagascar";"";"The article discusses the relationship between conceptions of forest values among local people in Madagascar and human capabilities. According to Amartya Sen's capability approach, capabilities include both the means of maintaining a livelihood and intangible elements that are necessary to achieve overall well-being. In a qualitative case study in Madagascar's Mananara-Nord and Sahamalaza Biosphere Reserves, we investigated local peoplesâ conceptions of forest values. Our analysis revealed that forest-value categories fall under a range of ecosystem services and are therefore clustered accordingly. The distinction between instrumental and intrinsic values indicates the broad spectrum on which local people conceive the benefits they derive from the forest. This article discusses the interconnection between instrumental and intrinsic forms of forest value and the important role played by intrinsic values in promoting well-being and conservation. It also addresses the nature of the capabilities that are based on the perceived forest values. Two conclusions are drawn. First, local population's views on valuable natural elements serve to indicate what they consider important for the achievement of well-being. Second, capabilities based on such natural values are vital for their collective sense of sustainable development and need to be given greater consideration in sustainable natural resource and land management.";"Fritz-Vietta, Nadine V.M.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land management;sustainable development";"Socio-Economic & Institutional Context";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"MDG";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600197059";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.11.006";"";"";"";"28-37"

The results suggest that these mandates may cause an additional 23-26 million hectares of forestland losses globally, but additional carbon emissions of 1.2 – 1.6 billion t CO2.  The estimates are found to be sensitive to the elasticity parameter on the land supply function in the model, with the higher elasticity estimates associated with larger carbon losses.  The regional analysis turns out to be quite important, because some regions end up gaining forestland and increasing carbon stocks. The regional and dynamic effects have been missed by most other noteworthy analyses of the induced land use effects of biofuel policies, potentially leading the authors to overstate the impacts by 3-6 times.";"Kim, Yoon Hyung

"AGRIS:US201500217177";"Crop diversification in Thailand: Status, determinants, and effects on income and use of inputs";"";"Following the national policy, the Department of Agriculture of Thailand has implemented a crop diversification program in several provinces of the country. This study, which was conducted in Nakhon Pathom Province, analyzed the extent of crop diversification and its determinants using primary information collected from 245 farm households using a structured questionnaire, and from selected farmer leaders and agricultural development officials. The study also assessed the effects of crop diversification on income and the inputs used. The findings of the study revealed that nearly three fourths of the land is still being used for rice mono-cropping, indicating little success in the promotion of the crop diversification program. Paddy fields, including farms for cultivating rice under mono-cropping and diversified system, still account for 90% of the total farmland in the country. The limited impact of the program on the farming sector is attributed primarily to the variation in land and labor resources available at the farmers’ disposal as well as soil suitability. The farmers’ attendance in training and interaction with farmer groups are the other influential factors. Although cropping diversification has provided attractive financial return particularly to the small farmers, it has also accelerated the use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. Broad policy instruments are therefore suggested for the effective implementation of future crop diversification programs in Thailand and perhaps elsewhere in Southeast Asia.";"Kasem, Sukallaya

The main objective of this work was to apply and evaluate the efficacy of a BN for land-cover classification using gap-filled and terrain-corrected Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery acquired on 15 May 2007. The posterior probabilities (parameters) were estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) and conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithms. A comparison of the results obtained from the algorithms indicates similar and excellent overall classification accuracies of 93.01%, and kappa coefficient values of 0.9143. The main result obtained in this study is that both algorithms considered here provide relatively similar and accurate solutions for the classification of the multispectral image although the EM algorithm is marginally competitive relative to CGD algorithm when measured in terms of the Brier score and the logarithmic loss.";"Dlamini, Wisdom M.";"";"Taylor & Francis Group";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"SWZ";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400106853";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.512934";"";"";"";"6569-6586"
"AGRIS:US201400106854";"Land-cover changes and potential impacts on soil erosion in the Nan watershed, Thailand";"";"The expansion of built environments and agriculture land in the Nan watershed, Thailand, to support the rapid increase of the national population has resulted in deforestation, thus affecting the ecological balance. This deforestation, especially in high mountainous areas, has led to serious environmental degradation. Recent reports reveal an increasing soil-erosion problem in the watershed. This study analyses land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their potential impact on soil erosion during a study period between 1995 and 2005. The 1995, 2000 and 2005 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were acquired and classified using hybrid classification methods. Cross-tabulation methods and the Markov Chain model were then used to analyse current and future LC changes. A soil risk-assessment model was formulated to identify potential risk areas of soil erosion. The LULC data show that the watershed was predominately covered by 40% closed-canopy forests, 25% paddy fields and 10% croplands. There was a major conversion of forests to agricultural lands and urban areas. The predictive model shows that forests are most likely to convert into paddy fields and croplands. The northern and eastern regions of the watershed have a high potential risk of soil erosion. These findings can be a basis for the design and implementation of sustainable resource management plans and geographically targeted conservation measures.";"Paiboonvorachat, Chamaporn

Suitable land-use maps often either do not exist or are not readily available. This article presents a novel method to compile spatial and temporal land-use data sets using multi-temporal remote sensing in combination with existing data sources. Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-Vegetation 10-day composite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images (1998–2002) at 1km² resolution for a part of the Nizamabad district, Andhra Pradesh, India, were linked with available crop calendars and information about cropping patterns. The NDVI images were used to stratify the study area into map units represented by 11 distinct NDVI classes. These were then related to an existing land-cover map compiled from high resolution Indian Remote Sensing (IRS)-images (Liss-III on IRS-1C), reported crop areas by sub-district and practised crop calendar information. This resulted in an improved map containing baseline information on both land cover and land use. It is concluded that each defined NDVI class represents a varying but distinct mix of land-cover classes and that the existing land-cover map consists of too many detailed ‘year-specific’ features. Four groups of the NDVI classes present in agricultural areas match well with four categories of practised crop calendars. Differences within a group of NDVI classes reveal area specific variations in cropping intensities. The remaining groups of NDVI classes represent other land-cover complexes. The method illustrated in this article has the potential to be incorporated into remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS)-based drought monitoring systems.";"de Bie, C. A. J. M.

Measuring wealth inequality to aid understanding of socioeconomic contexts for conservation: a case-study from the Solomon Islands";"";"Understanding the local socioeconomic context is important for the design of appropriate conservation initiatives and associated monitoring strategies, especially in areas with high degrees of inequality, to ensure conservation interventions do not inadvertently further disadvantage vulnerable people. Typical assessments of wealth inequality in remote rural areas are constrained by limited engagement with a cash economy, complex family and tribal ties, and an absence of basic infrastructure. This paper presents a simple participatory approach to measure wealth inequality that does not predefine indicators, such as income or assets, but allows the local people choose the most appropriate indicators. A case study from the Solomon Islands revealed poor households in Kahua were characterized by fewer members, fewer members of working age, and fewer male members than wealthier households. The poor also owned fewer of the locally defined indicators of wealth that were collectively correlated with limited land tenure, and, consequently, conservation or development initiatives that are tied to land in Kahua will be less likely to assist the poorest. Adopting this participatory approach could improve the effectiveness of community-based conservation, through facilitating opportunities to explore local poverty and routes for alleviation.";"DAVIES, TAMMY E.

The paper presents an original method dealing with the forest site types delineation. The suggested method consists in integrating a typological key in a GIS aiming at producing a thematic map that describes forest site types. Data used are the soil map of Belgium (digitized at the scale 1:20,000) and a digital elevation model built from a topographic map (scale 1:10,000). The typological key is mainly based on the methodology used by Thill et al. (1988) in the site types system for central Ardenne, the potential vegetation map of Sougnez and Dethioux (1975) and the ecoregion map of Delvaux and Galoux (1962). In that respect, site types are closely linked to the soil map and the phytosociological classification. So, they can be connected to the afforestation guide and different phytosociological and autecological studies concerning forest species. It is then possible to map the potential habitats or the site potentialities related to tree species. The key is valid for the Ardenne ecoregion located in Southern Belgium (elevation higher than 300 m). It has to be validated through an intensive use in the field, taking into account its imprecision linked to the types of collected data, chieffly those being digitized. The integration of such a tool in a SIG can be considered as an original way in terms of integrated forest management or forest sites description in the context of the project """"Natura 2000"""" launched by the European Union.

It considers not only technically modern equipment and computer-related problems but also social and economic feasibility. In Albania, the immovable property registration system is necessary in order to face successfully the new conditions of the free market-oriented economy. For about 50 years, property ownership in Albania was restricted to the State. The 1991 land reform in Albania advanced quickly, and at present over 90 percent of agricultural land is distributed to farmers, though in highly fragmented holdings (totaling an average area average of 2 hectares), creating about 1.8 million new parcels registered in the cadastral district offices. In urban areas, housing privatization was also completed quickly, creating about 300,000 new properties in cities, which are being registered in the Hipoteka (deed registry) district offices. Although market transactions in agriculture land are not yet allowed (though enabling legislation is expected to be passed soon), many land transactions have taken place. The housing market is already very active. Conflicts exist, especially in urban areas, between ex-owners of the land and buildings, and the state or present occupants. Therefore, it is highly desirable to establish a property registration system in Albania quickly and yet with careful planning.

The impetus behind these actions was the belief that a new legal and regulatory framework was necessary to reduce the frequency of land conflicts between largeholders and smallholders while simultaneously promoting much-needed investment in the agricultural sector. With empirical evidence presented in this report, based on smallholder survey data collected from 1994 to 1996, we challenge widely held beliefs about land tenure and access in the smallholder sector in Mozambique. Although the new land law may improve tenure security for smallholders who experience conflicts with largeholders, two key areas of policy concern have been neglected. First, while provisions in the new legal framework to safeguard local community land-use rights vis-à-vis outsiders are important, they will not be sufficient to eliminate and/or adjudicate land conflicts between smallholders themselves. Second, while much attention has been devoted to the legal and regulatory component of land tenure in Mozambique, research results reveal significant variation in the size of household landholdings even when controlling for household size. Further, land access was found to be closely linked to key welfare indicators such as income and calorie availability; a weak nonfarm economy heightens the importance of land for the welfare of rural families. These results are surprising and contradict views held by many in the policy community in Mozambique that land access is unconstrained for smallholders.";"Strasberg, Paul J.

Nevertheless, the government has been largely silent on the issue of land tenure reform, while some of the recommendations regarding land-policy reform that have been proposed are simplistic, uninformed, and fail to reflect the present political reality in Mozambique. This report shows the need to initiate a comprehensive discussion on land policy reform, natural resource management, and decentralized control over resources. The discussion must address fundamental questions about what types of land rights will exist or, more specifically, what types of property rights will be permitted; who will have the power to distribute land rights; and how and by whom land disputes will be settled. At the heart of these questions lie profound issues relating to the role and nature of the state and other political institutions, the relationships of these institutions with the citizens, and the form and nature of governance in Mozambique.

Serbian legislation and international conventions protect new plant varieties, either through sui generis protection or by patent rights. However, International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, also signed by Serbia, has endangered the rights of plant breeders in Serbia, because the greatest number of plant varieties in Serbia is not protected as intellectual property. On the other hand, the Treaty offers the possibility to natural and legal persons from other signatory countries to use new plant varieties of Serbian plant breeders. Seeing as the varieties are not protected, there is a possibility for the plant breeders’ rights to be endangered. The goal of this paper is to try and consider the legal consequences, answering certain open questions regarding the protection of intellectual property in this field. A method of parallel comparison was used.";"Veselinović, Janko (Faculty of Agriculture, Novi Sad (Serbia))

"AGRIS:US201600127061";"Estimation of Groundwater Recharge from the Rainfall and Irrigation in an Arid Environment Using Inverse Modeling Approach and RS";"";"Quantifying recharge from agricultural areas is important to sustain long-term groundwater use, make intelligent groundwater allocation decisions, and develop on-farm water management strategies. The scarcity of data in many arid regions, especially in the Middle East, has necessitated the use of combined mathematical models and field observations to estimate groundwater recharge. This study was designed to assess the recharge contribution to groundwater from rainfall and irrigation return flow in the Mosian plain, west of Iran. The Inverse modeling approach and remote sensing technology (RS) were used to quantify the groundwater recharge. The recharge for steady–state conditions was estimated using the Recharge Package of MODFLOW. The land-use map for the research area was produced using remote sensing and satellite images technology. According to results, groundwater recharge from the rainfall and irrigation return flow was at the rate of 0.15 mm/day. The recharge to the groundwater from rainfall was about 0.08 mm/day (10.8 % of total rainfall). The average of groundwater recharge contribution in the study area was about 0.39 mm/day that include 15.2 % of the total water used in the irrigated fields. We can conclude that irrigation water is the most important resource of groundwater recharge in this area, consequently, it should be integrated into relevant hydrological models as the main source of groundwater recharge.";"Ebrahimi, Hydar

As a renewable energy, biodiesel has been receiving increasing attention because of the relevance it gains from the rising petroleum price and its environmental advantages. This review highlights some of the perspectives for the biodiesel industry to thrive as an alternative fuel, while discussing opportunities and challenges of biodiesel. This review is divided in three parts. First overview is given on developments of biodiesel in past and present, especially for the different feedstocks and the conversion technologies of biodiesel industry. More specifically, an overview is given on possible environmental and social impacts associated with biodiesel production, such as food security, land change and water source. Further emphasis is given on the need for government’s incentives and public awareness for the use and benefits of biodiesel, while promoting policies that will not only endorse the industry, but also promote effective land management.";"Lin, Lin

"AGRIS:US201600190222";"GIS-based integrated evaluation of environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) for land use planning in Langkawi, Malaysia";"";"Extensive economic growth, tourism activities and over-exploitation of resources have become the common causes of environmental degradation in Langkawi. The sudden development leap resulting from UNESCO's recognition of Langkawi Archipelago as a Global Geopark in 2007, leads to continuous conflicts between enhancing environmental protection and meeting tourism and development needs. Environmental sensitivity evaluation is a basis upon which the concept of environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) can be practised in order to protect the environment, regulate development activities and promote sustainable land use planning. This study embarks on evaluating and classifying environmental sensitivity as well as comparing different ESA approaches applicable for land use planning in Langkawi. A GIS-based integrated evaluation model was performed on two assessment sets (Set A and Set B) using a standard grading system and weights determined with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Of these sets, the former consists of selected indicators from the Malaysian integrated ESA instrument while the latter are derived from previous eco-environmental studies conducted in China. The projected final ESA maps of Langkawi indicate spatial distribution of four environmental sensitivity classes. More highly and moderately sensitive areas are observed in Set A, accounting for 339.15km2 or 72.24% of the total land area compared to Set B with only 259.04km2 or 55.18% respectively. The results also reveal large proportion of low sensitivity areas in Set A, covering areas of 117.42km2 (25.01%). In contrast, more areas with non-sensitivity are widely distributed in Set B, occupying areas of 123.02km2 (26.20%). Taking into consideration the natural and cultural characteristics of the islands, it is suggested that Set A is a better approach to portray current environmental concerns and to coordinate future land use planning as well as fits Langkawi's aspiration in becoming a sustainable, world-class Global Geopark. This study provides beneficial information and opportunity for reasonable rearrangement of zoning and development guidelines and strategies within sensitivity areas. It promotes effective utilization of the natural resources, minimizes negative tourism impacts and adequately highlights ecosystem functions to prosper local socio-economic growth. It also represents an early step for the design of universal ESA instruments to regulate local development activities and promote sustainable land use planning in vulnerable areas at global levels.";"Leman, Nazren

Launched by a group of ecologists and a farming cooperative, this project is aimed at reconciling agriculture and environment by reintroducing alfalfa in a cereal farming area. The parties involved did not have the same outlook on the project. The agro-ecological and territorial innovation process was based on a participative approach: a participative workshop was organized and was attended by thirty participants. Alfalfa was discussed as a relatively unknown constitutive element of the agroecosystem. The workshop focused on i) the interdependence of the different players and the advantage of coordinating alfalfa crop farming, plus ii) the conditions of a collective approach for driving the agroecosystem. Possible regulations were reviewed for promoting a collective approach rather than an individual profit-oriented strategy

Watersheds in the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and the southern Appalachian highlands of western North Carolina were studied to address two questions: (1) Does landscape pattern vary among federal, state, and private lands? (2) Do landâcover changes differ among owners, and if so, what variables explain the propensity of land to undergo change on federal, state, and private lands? Landscape changes were studied between 1975 and 1991 by using spatial databases and a time series of remotely sensed imagery. Differences in landscape pattern were observed between the two study regions and between different categories of land ownership. The proportion of the landscape in forest cover was greatest in the southern Appalachians for both U.S. National Forest and private lands, compared to any landâownership category on the Olympic Peninsula. Greater variability in landscape structure through time and between ownership categories was observed on the Olympic Peninsula. On the Olympic Peninsula, landscape patterns did not differ substantially between commercial forest and state Department of Natural Resources lands, both of which are managed for timber, but differed between U.S. National Forest and noncommercial private land ownerships. In both regions, private lands contained less forest cover but a greater number of small forest patches than did public lands. Analyses of landâcover change based on multinomial logit models revealed differences in landâcover transitions through time, between ownerships, and between the two study regions. Differences in landâcover transitions between time intervals suggested that additional factors (e.g., changes in wood products or agricultural prices, or changes in laws or policies) cause individuals or institutions to change land management. The importance of independent variables (slope, elevation, distance to roads and markets, and population density) in explaining landâcover change varied between ownerships. This methodology for analyzing landâcover dynamics across land units that encompass multiple owner types should be widely applicable to other landscapes.";"Turner, Monica G.

Nem létezett valójában földpiac sem. A magántulajdon körében hagyott kis parcellák esetenkénti adásvétele még csak jelzőértékként sem volt értelmezhető a föld árára vonatkozóan. Az elmúlt két évtized agrárpolitikai koncepciótlansága, és ebből eredően a birtokpolitika, valamint a mezőgazdasági üzemszabályozás elmaradása következtében a hazai földtulajdon-, valamint a birtokviszonyok a kárpótlási folyamat eredményét, illetve annak tovább torzult módosulásait tükrözik.A bemerevedett birtokszerkezeten nehéz változtatni.

In the previous decades – according to the prevailing Marxist work value ideology – agricultural land, one of the main factors in agricultural production, was not assigned any value as it was not created through work. There was no real land market either. The ad hoc sale of the small plots left in private ownership cannot be considered, even remotely, an indication of the price of land. Due to the lack of clear agricultural policy in the preceding decades and therefore the missing land policy and farm regulation, the situation of land ownership and farm sizes in Hungary reflects the results of the indemnification programme and its distortions. The land ownership has solidified and is difficult to change. The advocacy groups – MAGOSZ, MOSZ and the Chamber of Agriculture – as well as the local communities could act as catalysts promoting the clearing up of land ownership issues, one form of which is land exchange.The legal institution of agricultural farm regime should be introduced. (A similar system exists in seven Member States as well as Norway and Switzerland.)In addition to prolonging the land purchase moratorium applicable to foreigners and domestic legal persons, funds should be requested from the EU for land ownership restructuring, or funds should be reassigned within the current aid envelope.EU-compatible measures would need to be introduced or revived in order to provide priority aid to family farms.";"Alvincz, Jozsef";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"hu";"";"";"";"HUN;CHE;NOR";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016209693";"http://purl.umn.edu/99187";"";"";"";""

Since then both countries have experienced rapid economic growth, falling poverty rates and significant rises in per capita income. At the same time, substantial restructuring of their economies has occurred, a feature of which has been a decline in the relative contribution of agriculture to total employment and output. These changes are outlined. Significant changes have also occurred in the agricultural sectors of China and Vietnam and these are reviewed. In both countries, the livestock sector has grown in relative importance. Households are the main contributors to agricultural production but their individual holdings of land are small and households keeping livestock mostly only hold a few head. Given the exit of farmers from agriculture, pressures are mounting for increasing the size of agricultural units. This exit can add to economic efficiency and growth. Policies to facilitate movements from farm to non-farm employment are discussed and analysed. Property rights and the marketability of agricultural land can facilitate such movements and contribute to economic efficiency. In recent times, China and Vietnam have extended property rights in agricultural land and have increased its marketability. These measures are outlined. With further economic development and transition, it is predicted that these rights and the marketability of agricultural land will be further extended";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-05-31";"en";"land rights";"";"Access to Land & Tenure Security";"VNM;142;CHN";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016209345";"http://purl.umn.edu/90629";"";"";"";""

Despite considerable investment of resources into conservation over the last three decades, biodiversity is dwindling and protected area systems remain inadequate. This lack of success is caused by important differences in cultural, economic, landownership, and social factors in developing Pacific Island countries, compared to developed nations that often fund conservation programs and plans. Despite the obvious need for capacity building and information exchange among stakeholders, little collaboration and development has eventuated. A coordinated and integrated approach, focusing conservation resources on national priorities, is essential to achieve efficient conservation. This will need to include active involvement of landowners, a good sociocultural understanding of target communities, improved collaboration between the various stakeholders, provision of sustainable alternative economic activities, and a commitment to long funding cycles for projects.";"Keppel, Gunnar

"AGRIS:US201500205368";"model to predict stream water temperature across the conterminous USA";"";"Stream water temperature (tₛ) is a critical water quality parameter for aquatic ecosystems. However, tₛrecords are sparse or nonexistent in many river systems. In this work, we present an empirical model to predict tₛat the site scale across the USA. The model, derived using data from 171 reference sites selected from the Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow database, describes the linear relationship between monthly mean air temperature (tₐ) and tₛ. Multiple linear regression models are used to predict the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the tₐ–tₛlinear relation as a function of climatic, hydrologic and land cover characteristics. Model performance to predict tₛresulted in a mean Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.78 across all sites. Application of the model to predict tₛat additional 89 nonreference sites with a higher human alteration yielded a mean Nash–Sutcliffe value of 0.45. We also analysed seasonal thermal sensitivity (m) and found strong hysteresis in the tₐ–tₛrelation. Drainage area exerts a strong control on m in all seasons, whereas the cooling effect of groundwater was only evident for the spring and fall seasons. However, groundwater contributions are negatively related to mean tₛin all seasons. Finally, we found that elevation and mean basin slope are negatively related to mean tₛin all seasons, indicating that steep basins tend to stay cooler because of shorter residence times to gain heat from their surroundings. This model can potentially be used to predict climate change impacts on tₛacross the USA. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Segura, Catalina

"AGRIS:US2012210080";"World Food Needs and the Optimal Allocations of Lands";"";"In order to assess the future world food demand/supply balance for the next century, in relation to the land uses, we develop a model in which the society has to supply two types of food demand, namely, processed crop products and meat and dairy products. From the supply side, the society can resort to different classes of land. Each class of land can be allocated wholly or partially either to crop cultivation or to pasture or last to be lain
fallow. Primary crop production can be transformed either into processed crop products to satisfy final needs, or into intermediate livestock products used as inputs within the intensive industrial farming system. The livestock products can also be obtained from the extensive grazing system. The increase in world population together with the increase in the per capita income boost the final demand for food products. In order to meet the future food demands, the structure of the livestock production system should be modified, the share of the intensive production system having to be increased. With respect to the optimal allocation of land, we have established different degrees of land scarcity. More precisely, as the land is getting scarcer, the share of the livestock products stemming from the intensive production system is steadily increasing. Thus, the cropland is rising at the expense of pastureland. The shadow value assigned to the different land classes is steadily increasing throughout the next century.";"Hubert, Marie-Helene

"AGRIS:US201600054892";"Watershed-Scale AMC Selection for Hydrologic Modeling";"";"The Natural Resources Conservation Service curve–number (CN) method commonly uses three discrete levels (1, 2, and 3) of antecedent moisture condition (AMC) to describe soil moisture at the time of a runoff event. However, this may not adequately represent soil water conditions for watershed modeling purposes. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the use of individual–event watershed–scale AMC values to adjust field–scale CN, and to assess which hydrologic parameters would provide the best estimate of individual–event AMC. Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 1997 and 1998 were used to obtain 10 landcover classes for Red Rock Creek watershed, Kansas. The canopy growth of crops was used to provide temporal adjustment of CNs in the watershed. Stream–flow data for 1997–1999 was collected from a U.S. Geological Survey gaging station near the watershed outlet, and base flow was separated to obtain surface–runoff amounts. Watershed–average AMC factors were estimated from measured rainfall and surface runoff amounts for each of 23 events and used to adjust CNs in the AGNPS watershed model. For individual runoff events, calibration was achieved with AMCs that averaged 1.5 and ranged from 0.9 to 2.4. Therefore, an AMC of 2, as used in many hydrologic models, would overestimate the surface runoff amounts in this sub–humid Kansas watershed. Generally, AMC increased with 5-day antecedent rainfall above 5 mm. Soil moisture and 5–day antecedent rain were found to be significantly correlated to AMC.";"Bhuyan, S. J.

We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with 50 key stakeholders in four communities in New York State that experienced collective stakeholder interactions in the contexts of waterfowl hunting or wildlife trapping. Our results revealed that collective action coordinators and brokers, representing local/in-state regional organizations, were not initially involved in the disputes but became involved over time. These individuals reframed the public issue from original concerns over personal safety, private property rights, and spatial proximity to include concerns about humaneness of wildlife harvest activities and regulations. Stakeholder engagement strategies for managing the impacts from these initial interactions should consider the temporal element of how the social construction of each issue changes over time.";"Triezenberg, Heather A.

"AGRIS:US2016210001";"'Individual' versus 'Household' in Recreational Demand Models";"";"This study proposes a novel approach to estimating a recreationaldemand model that accounts for intra-household resource allocation. Thetechnique is based on an analogy borrowed from the literature of collectivehousehold behavior and, in particular, on Browning, Chiappori and Lewbel(2006)’s model. We formulate a collective recreational demand model that takesinto account the role of each member’s preferences for consumption choices andthat depends on how disposable income is divided within the household. Thismodel identifies the Consumer Surplus for each household member and theallocation of resources within a household by a consumption technologyfunction, which summarizes all of the technological economies of scale andscope that result from living together, and by using information about theconsumption of individuals living alone as if they were living in a household.Finally, we show that husbands and wives have significantly differentrecreational demands. This implies that observations for husbands and wivesmay not be treated as identical as in the traditional recreational demand model(unless one spouse is the dictator) and that the collective setting is a plausiblenext step to take in the analysis of recreational demand models.";"Veronesi, Marcella";"";"";"AGRIS";"2007-05-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016210001";"http://purl.umn.edu/98551";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201500073282";"influence of land cover composition and groundwater on thermal habitat availability for brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations in the United States of America";"";"- Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) is a sentinel fish species that requires clean, cold water habitats generally resulting from landscapes that allow for surface water flows devoid of sediment and contaminants and high groundwater discharge of cold water. As such, brook charr are impacted by land cover changes that alter stream temperature regimes. We evaluated brook charr populations across their eastern and midwestern range in the United States with reference to thermal habitat availability in relationship to land cover and per cent baseflow. We found that while forest cover does protect brook charr thermal habitat, high levels of groundwater discharge can allow for increased levels of agriculture within a watershed by keeping the water cold in spite of warm ambient summer temperatures. Our study concludes that with enhanced communication among land, water and fisheries managers, society can provide for sustainable stream salmonid populations despite increased threats on cold water resources.";"Siitari, Kiira J.

The ecosystem may need external inputs to recover its composition and function as soils are often impoverished and vegetal key stone species lost. We evaluated the effects of the application of fresh and air-dried biosolids in the establishment and morphological and physiological performance of seedlings of Pinus halepensis and Quercus ilex under dry Mediterranean field conditions. Seedling survival was not affected by biosolid treatments in any of the studied species both two and ten years after planting. During the first two years, growth was enhanced by the two biosolid treatments in relation to control, although the change in the biomass allocation pattern differed between species. Rooting depth was significantly enhanced by liquid biosolid in Q. ilex and marginally reduced in P. halepensis as well as the exploration of soil. As a consequence, root-to-shoot ratio reduced significantly with dry and liquid sludge due to promoted aboveground growth while maintaining and even reducing belowground fractions. An improvement of the nutritional status, of fertilized seedlings especially of phosphorus, is the explanation for the better field performance. Vector analysis revealed an important phosphorus limitation for both species that was overcome with the application of liquid (both species) and air-dried biosolid (pine). The higher growth of pine seedlings attained in the liquid biosolid treatment was coupled with a significant decrease in foliar δ¹³C, suggesting lower water use efficiency. The significant increase in foliar δ¹⁵N in the biosolid treatments in both species suggested that a large proportion of the total nitrogen uptake came from the applied biosolids. Instead, with regard to the low biosolid application rate used in the study, treatments had an overall positive effect as a restoration tool by improving nutritional status and promoting growth of planted seedlings.";"Valdecantos, Alejandro

"AGRIS:US2016205446";"Agriculture in the Face of Changing Markets, Institutions and Policies: Challenges and Strategies";"";"Since the late 1980s, agriculture in Central and Eastern European Countries(CEECs) has been under considerable adjustment pressure due to changingpolitical, economic and institutional environments. These changes have been linkedto the transition process, as well as the ongoing integration into the European Unionand the world market. Reduced subsidies, increased environmental and food qualitydemands, as well as structural changes in the supply, processing and food retailingsector call for major structural adjustments and the improvement of farmers’managerial abilities. Though such changes always carry significant threats to farms,they also offer new opportunities for the farms' entrepreneurial engagement.Upcoming changes in the agricultural environment and their possibleconsequences for farm structures across Europe are thus still timely subjects.The objective of the IAMO Forum 2006 is to contribute to the success ofagriculture in the CEECs, as well as their neighboring countries, in today’sincreasingly competitive environment. Concrete questions the conference focuseson are: What are the most suitable farm organizations, cooperative arrangementsand contractual forms? How to improve efficiency and productivity? Where domarket niches lie and what are the new product demands?This book contains 33 invited and selected contributions. These papers will bepresented at the IAMO Forum 2006 in order to offer a platform for scientists,practitioners and policy-makers to discuss challenges and potential strategies atthe farm, value chain, rural society and policy levels in order to cope with theupcoming challenges.IAMO Forum 2006, as well as this book, would not have been possible withoutthe engagement of many people and institutions.

"AGRIS:US201301671900";"Expansion of the global terrestrial protected area system";"";"Under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the world's governments set a goal of protecting 10% of all ecological regions by 2010. We evaluated progress toward that goal for the world's major terrestrial biomes, realms, and ecoregions. Total land area under any legal protection has increased from previous estimates to 12.9%, a notable achievement, although only 5.8% has strict protection for biodiversity. For biomes, protection ranges from 4% to 25%, with six of 14 biomes still below the 10% level. Geographic patterns of protection have a distinct bias, with higher rates of protection in New World realms than Old World realms. Of the world's terrestrial ecoregions, half do not meet the 2010 Target and 76% have less than 10% of their area strictly protected. Approximately 13% of ecoregions have no strict protected areas. Recent years have seen an expansion of the protected area network, with an average of 0.13% of the global land area added per year. Most of the expansion since 2003 though has been in Brazil, particularly the Amazon. Without major investments in conservation, spread across the world's ecosystems, the world will likely miss the 2010 target.";"Jenkins, Clinton N.

One such method is the use of effective microbes or Useful Microbes (UM) for worm control. Therefore, a preliminary study was conducted to evaluate the anthelmintic effect of UM on nematode parasites of goat in a government farm. Fifteen Boer goats were randomly selected and fed with UM Bokashi mix (effective microbes in the form of granules) with commercial goatpellets and UM fluid in drinking water. UM used in this study was produced by Department of Veterinary Services Penang by fermenting UM stock culture with a fruit base and molasses. Faecal egg counts(FEC) using the modified McMaster technique was carried out weekly for 5 weeks. The results show that the UM used for animal feeding (5% Bokashi with commercial goat pellet) and ad lib UM fluid in drinking water, fed over a period of 1 month showed Faecal Egg Countreduction from 3240 e.p.g. to 677 e.p.g.

Varieties were seeded in December 2007 and evaluated in 2008 and 2009 at two sites. Conditions were dry with Qurain receiving 110 mm and 73 mm and Tal Rimah receiving 58 mm and 43 mm of annual precipitation during the winters of 2007/2008 and 2008/2009, respectively. Plants were more abundant and taller (P<0.001) at Qurain than Tal Rimah in 2008. Forage kochia frequency was 48% and 30% in 2008 at Qurain and Tal Rimah, respectively. However, no seeded plants were observed at Tal Rimah in 2009, suggesting that 58 mm and 43 mm of annual precipitation are insufficient to allow plants to persist over multiple years. At the wetter site, forage kochia abundance in 2009 was similar (P=0.90) to that observed in 2008 and plant height increased (P<0.001) from 2008 (14.4 cm±1.1 SE) to 2009 (38.4 cm±1.1 SE). Sahro-select and Otavny-select were the most abundant forage kochia varieties (P<0.05), suggesting that these experimental lines could be more adapted to the environmental conditions of Jordan than the commercially available cultivar Immigrant. Frequency of perennial grass varieties declined (P<0.001) at Qurain from 82%±4 SE to 39%±4 SE between 2008 and 2009, respectively. Among grasses, Siberian wheatgrass had better stands than crested wheatgrass, with Russian wildrye being intermediate. Based on this study, forage kochia appears to have great potential for establishing palatable perennial shrubs in arid rangeland conditions in Jordan if annual precipitation is at least 70 mm. Arid-adapted perennial grass varieties might also be useful in rangeland restoration if annual precipitation is over 100 mm.";"Bailey, Derek W.

"AGRIS:US201400103733";"Erosion effects on soil properties of the unique red soil hilly region of the economic development zone in southern China";"";"Erosion can have a significant impact on soil properties in areas characterized by undulating topography. The spatial trends of soil properties and the availability of soil nutrients change with land use conversion. Most studies on these changes in China, however, focus on the natural or agricultural ecosystems. Little attention has been paid to unique changes, such as the conversion of natural or agricultural land to economic development zones. To this end, it has been determined that the properties of the surface soil in an economic development zone with unique topography characterized by large mounds of earth and stones in the red soil hilly region in China. The aim of this study is to characterize the overall level and spatial patterns of the concentrations of topsoil selected soil properties, including pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), bulk density, soil moisture, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nitrogen (N), soil phosphorus (P), and soil potassium (K). Results show that the mean pH and CEC of soils is as low as 5.35 and 6.47 cmol kg−1, and the mean value of soil moisture is 0.30 g g−1, and the mean level of bulk density is 1.45 g cm−3. SOC and total P are as low as 5.89 and 0.35 g kg−1, while total N and total K have a high level of 8.44 and 25.2 g kg−1. The mean level of alkali-hydrolyzable N, Olsen P, and available K is 54.33, 6.35, and 120.33 mg kg−1, respectively, all at intermediate or low levels according to the Second National Soil Survey. All selected soil properties and nutrients have overall similar spatial patterns with the highest value on the lower slope positions except for alkali-hydrolyzable N. The results are most likely governed by the native properties of red soil, zonal climate, agricultural history for all the soils, and different degrees of soil erosion, and the probable impact of human activity like construction among different slope positions. Results indicate that (1) topography influences soil properties, as evidenced by the different spatial trends of the soil nutrients, and (2) human activity, especially construction, affects the soil properties of economic development zones. This study aims to provide valuable insights for the evaluation of soil quality as a prerequisite for land use planning in economic development zones.";"Zhang, Xue

In this study, C cycling was evaluated in soils along a gradient of land use, from native forest (NF), reforested sites (secondary forest – SF, Araucaria angustifolia – AR, Pinus elliottii – PI), clear-cut P. elliottii stands (CT) to farmland (AG). NF, AR, and SF sites had lower litter C:N ratios than PI, CT, and AG sites. Soils under forests had more organic C than CT and AG soils, whereas soils with native species had more microbial biomass C than PI, CT and AG soils. Both metabolic quotient (qCO₂) and dehydrogenase activity increased with land use. Multivariate analysis revealed that soils of AR and SF were similar to NF and differed from CT and AG, which had higher qCO₂ and dehydrogenase activity, suggesting microbial stress. Litter C:N ratios and soil microbial biomass C, moisture, CO₂ evolution, and cellulase activity discriminated most effectively between land uses. Reforestation with native species restored soil properties to levels similar to those in NF, being more sustainable, whereas reforestation with the exotic P. elliottii made soils more similar to AG soils.";"Bini, Daniel

An evolutionary model of disturbance (pyric-herbivory) suggests that grazing and fire interact through a series of feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation patterns across the landscape and has potential to serve as a model for management of grasslands with an evolutionary history of grazing. Our study demonstrates that the spatially controlled interaction of fire and grazing can be used to create heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems and the resulting heterogeneity in vegetation is expressed through other trophic levels, specifically small mammals in this study. Discrete fires were applied to patches, and patchy grazing by herbivores promoted a shifting vegetation mosaic across the landscape that created unique habitat structures for various small mammal species. Peromyscus maniculatus was about 10 times more abundant on recently burned patches (1–2 mo) than the uniform treatment or unburned patches within the shifting mosaic treatment. Chaetodipus hispidus was about 10 times greater in patches that were 15–20 mo post-fire in the shifting mosaic treatment than in the uniform treatment. Sigmodon hispidus, Microtus ochrogaster, and Reithrodontomys fluvescens became dominant in the shifting mosaic in patches that were more than 2 yr post-fire. This study, along with others, suggests that by managing transient focal patches, heterogeneity has the potential to be a new central paradigm for conservation of rangeland ecosystems and can enhance biological diversity and maintain livestock production across broad scales.";"Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.

Scale-dependent relations of vegetation dynamics are investigated in this study by using emergent biophysical characteristics obtained through a predictive multidimensional model of vegetation anomalies derived from remote-sensing observations. In particular, the analysis is focused on the spatial organization of some phenological parameters including deterministic variations (seasonal range, interannual variability, jump discontinuities) and stochastic components (plant memory, spatial correlations). The analysis is performed using MODIS-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 16-day composites for the period from March 2000 to December 2006 over Italy at different levels of spatial aggregation (1–8km). Scale-dependences of the statistical moments of the phenological parameters are quantified through simple power laws for five distinct vegetated land covers. Results suggest that some biophysical characteristics, especially deterministic components, show no preferential spatial scale for important coverage. In particular, broad-leaved forests and natural grasslands are characterized by deterministic and low-distance spatial components well explained by scale relationships, which are modulated by possible spatiotemporal dynamics of climatic drivers. Agricultural lands show high scale-dependent relations on short-term biophysical memory sources and low-distance spatial components of phenology likely related to hierarchical interactions of anthropogenic and ecological processes; whereas mixed patterns of croplands and natural areas generally present no consistent scaling relations.";"Forzieri, Giovanni

This is done in three steps. First, a quantitative assessment is made of the impact of market liberalization policies on the economic environment of farm households in Jiangxi province. Econometric analyses based on provincial, national and world market data are used to explain changes in rice and fertilizer prices in Jiangxi province over time. Next, the impact of China's recent income support policy and latest price trends on farm household choices with respect to activity choice (particularly rice and livestock) and input use (fertilizers, pesticides, manure) is assessed for two villages with different degrees of market access in north-east Jiangxi province. Two village-level general equilibrium models are used to analyse household decision-making and interactions between households within these villages. The parameters are estimated and calibrated from an extensive survey held in these villages in the year 2000. Finally, the impact of land tenure policy on farm management decisions (labour, manure and chemical input use), soil quality (available P and K and total N and C) and rice yields is analysed through an econometric analysis of plot-level data for three villages. Two-stage least squares (2SLS) is used to control for interactions with yields and for feedbacks towards input use. The paper ends with a number of suggestions for policy adjustments that would reduce the problem of natural soil compaction in the research area.";"Heerink, N.

In data-sparse regions, i.e. northwest Morocco studies are limited by the availability of comprehensive information on precipitation. We extracted precipitation data of high spatiotemporal resolution (2 km, 1 day) from the Northwest Africa Reanalysis (NwAR) and gridded Normalized Difference Negetation Index (NDVI) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that cover northwest Morocco over ten hydrological years (September 2000 to August 2010). The results are based on a sequence of linear regression analyses. The mean precipitation of different input timeframes is systematically applied as the predicting variables to the mean NDVI of the growing seasons. Results show that 73 % of the variance in mean NDVI is explained by the variance in mean precipitation at the beginning of the growing season (November to the end of December). The results also show that 75 % of the variance in the mean NDVI of agriculturally used areas is explained by the variance in mean precipitation of beginning September to the end of December. Potentially irrigated land cover of low to medium explained variance but of a high seasonal range in NDVI cover about 14 % of the study region. We conclude that a considerable part of agricultural used areas are still potentially rain-fed. The applied methods and especially the re-analysed precipitation data of high spatiotemporal resolution open a new quality of analysis valuable for, e.g. monitoring aspects, policy decisions or regulatory actions.";"Otto, M.

Results indicated that the average topsoil SOC concentrations of the study area increased from 1.24% in the 1980s to 1.47% in 2005. Spatial distributions of SOC in the two separate evaluations showed greater SOC concentrations in the middle part of the study area and lower SOC concentrations in the remaining areas. From the 1980s to 2005, SOC concentrations in the central part increased, whereas those in the northeastern and southwestern parts decreased.

In South Africa, renewed interest in development-oriented cooperatives saw the introduction of a new Cooperatives Act in 2005, along with support measures dedicated to ‘emerging’ cooperatives. This paper contends that the architects of the new Act discounted important trends in international legislation that would have made development-oriented cooperatives more versatile and given their members better access to capital and expertise through equity partnerships with private agribusiness firms. It is concluded that the new Act should be amended to admit non-patron investors as members, and to allow for non-redeemable and hence appreciable and tradable shares.

The large spectral variance and spatial heterogeneity within the ‘buildings’ land cover class, as well as the similar spectral properties between buildings and other urban structures, make building change detection a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a set of novel building change indices (BCIs) by combining morphological building index (MBI) and slow feature analysis (SFA) for building change detection from high-resolution imagery. MBI is a recently developed automatic building detector for high-resolution imagery, which is able to highlight building components but simultaneously suppress other urban structures. SFA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can discriminate the changed components from the unchanged ones for multitemporal images. By effectively integrating the information from MBI and SFA, the building change components can be automatically generated. Experiments conducted on the QuickBird 2002–2005 data-set are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed building change detection framework.";"Huang, Xin

"AGRIS:US2012210424";"RURAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM IN NORTH DAKOTA (SUMMARY)";"";"The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), enacted in 1985, provides conservation benefits and agricultural supply control through voluntary, long-term retirement of crop land.  Large-scale, long-term land retirement programs produce, in varying degrees, negative effects on those businesses and economic sectors that provide agricultural inputs and services.  While the effects of the CRP on agriculture are well understood, economic assessments of the market-value of conservation benefits from the program accruing to rural economies remains largely undocumented.  One of the conservation benefits of the program is wildlife habitat, which has bolstered upland bird, waterfowl, and big game populations.  Growing wildlife populations have contributed to increased consumptive and non-consumptive wildlife-based recreation.  This study addressed the net economic effects of decreased agricultural activity and increased recreational activity associated with the CRP in six rural areas of North Dakota from 1996 through 2000.

	The negative effects of the CRP on agricultural revenues were based on the level of economic activity that would have occurred in the absence of the program.  The net change in revenues from CRP land returning to agricultural production in the six study areas was estimated at $76 million or about $56 per CRP-acre.  However, returning CRP lands to agricultural production was estimated to lower commodity prices and reduce agricultural revenues on non-CRP lands by $25.9 million.  The combined effect was estimated at $50.2 million annually or $37 per CRP-acre in the study areas.

	The CRP affects many types of outdoor recreation; however, hunting was identified as the most influenced type of recreation in North Dakota.  Recreational impacts were determined by comparing pheasant, waterfowl, and deer hunter numbers before and after the CRP, assigning the relative role the CRP has played in the change in hunter numbers, allocating a percentage of the change in hunter numbers to each study area, and applying seasonal hunter expenditure patterns to the change in hunter numbers.  Average annual CRP-related hunter expenditures in the six study areas were estimated at $12.8 million or $9.45 per CRP-acre.  Overall, recreational revenues averaged 26 percent of the agricultural losses. 

	The degree to which CRP-based hunting revenues in rural areas offset agricultural losses varied throughout the state.  In several cases, hunting expenditures offset a substantial portion of the agricultural losses, while in other areas, the net economic loss from the program remains high.  The net economic effects of the program in western and central North Dakota were the most favorable, whereas the effects were least favorable in eastern areas of the state.  In North Dakota, the net economic effect of losses in agricultural revenues and gains in hunting-based recreational expenditures indicated that several areas of the state are not as economically burdened by the CRP as previous research has suggested.";"Bangsund, Dean A.

In texture classification, window size is an important factor influencing classification accuracy, but selecting the optimal window size is difficult. In this paper, we propose an optimized window size texture classification method which can solve the window size selection problem. In order to validate the new method, we designed four classification experiments with different input features based on SPOT-5 imagery: (1) spectral features, (2) spectral features and single window size texture features, (3) spectral features and multiple window size texture features and (4) spectral features and optimized window size texture features based on posterior probabilities. Overall, the highest accuracy was obtained using the optimized window size texture classification, which does not require window size selection before classification. Furthermore, the results imply that optimized window size varies with land cover type.";"Liu, Jinxiu

Originally viewed as a supply control program it rapidly evolved into a program that met many environmental objectives.In 2007 SD had 729,397 acres of CRP contracts expired, which was nearly 47% of the 1.56 million acres enrolled. The policy environment in late 2006 and most of 2007 consisted of CRP program offers for renewals or extensions (2-5 years) of many CRP contracts against a backdrop of escalating crop prices and economic incentives to return expiring contract acres to agricultural production. Overall there was a net reduction of 263.7 thousand acres (17%) of CRP land in SD. Economic conditions in 2008 are markedly different. Commodity prices are nearly double that of a year ago and many producers view putting CRP acres back into production as a viable, profitable option. Approximately 508,000 acres of CRP contract will be expiring from 2008-2010, 420,700 from 2011-2013, and an additional 364,600 acres between 2014-2023 (FSA).In 2006 and 2007, the FSA made enrollment offers for 10-15 years or contract extension offers of 2–5 years for many CRP contracts expiring from 2007–2010. For SD contracts expiring in 2007, a total of 52.7 thousand CRP acres were re-enrolled and 370.6 thousand acres were accepted in contract extensions. The remaining 306 thousand acres of expired contracts were not re-enrolled or extended and likely converted to crop or forage production. In addition, there were 38.8 thousand CRP acres added through new enrollments.Just as enrolling these acres into the program had significant negative impacts on revenue generation in the farm and rural economy in SD, putting these acres back into production will also have significant positive impacts on the economy of the state. The objective of this study is to estimate the economic impacts that could occur as some of these CRP acres are converted back to production for three different regions within the state. The effect of converting some of the CRP land to grazing is not examined in this analysis. Only the effects of converting CRP land to crop production is analyzed here.";"Taylor, Gary

"AGRIS:US201302926388";"Economics and demographics constrain investment in Utah private grazing lands";"";"In Utah during the early 1990s it was theorized that substantive change was under way in the management of private grazing land. Change was thought to be spearheaded by grazing permittees who feared losing access to public forage and thus wanted to increase carrying capacity of private grazing land as a hedging tactic. We synthesized results from socioeconomic surveys conducted among a target population of 5,067 grazing livestock producers during 1993, 1996, and 1997. This population was evenly divided between permittees and operators wholly dependent on private grazing (e.g., private operators). Our primary objectives were to: (1) test the hypothesis that a sustained upswing in management change was occurring; (2) identify factors associated with operations that ""actively"" invested in their properties versus those that were ""passive""; and (3) identify producer priorities for applied research. Mail and phone surveys were used. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Compared to private operators, permittees controlled far more private land and livestock and were more profit-oriented and dependent on live-stock-derived income. Managers of both groups were aged--37% of the population was >65 years old. Eighty percent of 393 managers surveyed in 1996-7 classified their operations as passive and ranked factors related to aging and economics as main reasons for passivity. Logistic regression and ranking exercises revealed that the active minority was most associated with higher gross annual incomes, more stewardship values, greater willingness to incur debt, and being a permittee. Permittees were more inclined to be active managers because of a greater entrepreneurial orientation compared to private operators, who tended to be hobby ranchers. Our work supported an alternative hypothesis that passivity in land management has been maintained in Utah during the 1990s, largely because incentives were lacking for most of the population to do otherwise. A wealthier minority, however, could still make large investments in their operations because of a superior risk tolerance. We concluded that demographic and economic factors exert the most control over producer behavior today, not access to information or new technology. One consequence is that demand for information and technology can be episodic due to coincident economic, demographic, and policy factors, which also implies that applied research, extension, and policy formulation need to be more opportunistic in response to change. Producers felt that forage improvements, policy, and economics were top research priorities. A looming crest of retirements among traditional landowners bodes for substantive and rapid change in the use of Utah private grazing land. Nearly one-third of those planning retirement hope to sell property to land developers.";"Peterson, R.

The water supply situation is expected to become more severe in the future because of continued unsustainable water use and projected change in hydrometeorological parameters due to climate change. This study is based on the integrated approach of remote sensing, geographical information system and multicriteria decision‐making techniques to determine the most important contributing factors that affect the groundwater resources and to delineate the groundwater potential zones. Ten thematic layers, namely, geomorphology, geology, soil, topographic elevation (digital elevation model), land use/land cover, drainage density, lineament density, proximity of surface water bodies, surface temperature and post‐monsoon groundwater depth, were considered for the present study. These thematic layers were selected for groundwater prospecting based on the literature; discussion with the experts of the Central Ground Water Board, Government of India; field observations; geophysical investigation; and multivariate techniques. The thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on Saaty's scale according to their relative significance for groundwater occurrence. The assigned weights of the layers and their features were normalized by using the analytic hierarchy process and eigenvector method. Finally, the selected thematic maps were integrated using a weighted linear combination method to create the final groundwater potential zone map. The final output map shows different zones of groundwater potential, namely, very good (16%), good (35%), moderate (28%) low (17%) and very low (2.1%). The groundwater potential zone map was finally validated using the discharge and groundwater depth data from 28 and 98 pumping wells, respectively, which showed good correlation.

"AGRIS:US201400154904";"Nitrogen isotope tracer acquisition in low and tall birch tundra plant communities: a 2� year test of the snow–shrub hypothesis";"";"Deciduous shrub density and landcover are increasing across many areas of the Arctic. Shrub growth may be promoted by a snow–shrub feedback whereby relatively tall shrubs accumulate deeper snow, raising winter soil temperature minima, increasing microbial activity, and enhancing soil solution nitrogen (N). Although there is good evidence for the above components of the hypothesis, it has not yet been determined if shrubs can access the elevated N pool generated by deepened snow. We added isotopic N tracer (¹⁵N) in late summer to control and snowfenced low birch hummock tundra to test the influence of deepened snow on N cycling. Furthermore, tracer was added to tall birch tundra to compare N cycling in low and tall shrub ecosystems that have the same species composition. Experimentally deepened snow in low birch tundra did not significantly affect ¹⁵N uptake by shrubs or any other species 2� years after the tracer addition. However, there were strong differences between the low and tall birch ecosystems, with the deciduous shrubs and graminoids accumulating more ¹⁵N than the evergreen shrubs in the relatively productive tall shrub site, and vice versa in the relatively infertile low birch site. The greater ¹⁵N acquisition by birch in the more fertile site, together with the absence of a deepened snow effect on ¹⁵N acquisition by any species in the low birch hummock ecosystem, suggest that climate-change induced increases in birch shrub growth and expansion across the landscape will tend to occur most rapidly in and around existing tall birch shrub patches.";"Vankoughnett, Mathew R.

"AGRIS:US201300848701";"changing relationships between forestry and the local community in rural northwestern Ireland";"";"Following centuries of deforestation, Ireland has undergone a substantial afforestation programme in the last 40 years. This paper presents the results of a case study undertaken to examine local response to afforestation. The study is set in Arigna, a region in northwestern Ireland that has traditionally depended on agriculture but has experienced relatively high rates of afforestation in recent decades. Relying on documentary evidence and in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with local stakeholders, the results suggest more local resistance to afforestation than one might expect in a country that has historically experienced such massive deforestation. Among the reasons uncovered for this resistance is the history of land tenure in rural Ireland, the institutional means by which afforestation has been conducted, the tree species used, and the aesthetic appearance of the forest stands once established. Underlying all of this is an apparently widespread local perception that forestry has benefited outsiders more than locals. Yet, the study also documents local perceptions that those responsible for afforestation have responded to concerns and that resistance to afforestation may be declining, as well as the reasons for this decline. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance of local history and community involvement in developing socially acceptable forestry.";"Flechard, M.C.

"AGRIS:US201500162848";"Can remote sensing estimate fine-scale quality indicators of natural habitats?";"";"Efficient management and conservation of natural habitats requires a thorough knowledge and sustained monitoring of their ecological quality. In recent years, several methods have been developed to assess the local conservation status in the field. These typically combine estimates of coarse-scale indicators, such as tree and grass encroachments, with very fine-scale indicators that require precise fieldwork, such as the number of key species present. We first tested whether coarse-scale field characteristics can provide information on fine-scale indicators. Then, this idea was extended to remote sensing techniques to derive estimates of fine-scale properties that cannot be derived directly by the sensors. The method was elaborated for two Natura 2000 heathland areas, combining field conservation status assessments of over 650 locations with remote sensing information derived from an airborne hyperspectral scanner image. Boosted regression trees using field estimates of coarse-scale parameters as predictors were able to explain up to 43% of the variation in the fine-scale indicators. When using remote sensing data, models performed only slightly less. Up to 35% of the variation was explained using remote sensing estimates of coarse-scale parameters as predictors, and up to 39% was explained when additional remotely sensed land cover data were included in the models. Although these rates are not high in absolute terms, model predictions for certain parameters were more precise than field estimates, especially for criteria with a high between-observer variability. These results clearly illustrate the potential of remote sensing imagery to derive information on the conservation status of habitats, even for fine-scale elements that are too small to be derived directly.";"Spanhove, Toon

"AGRIS:US201600188231";"impacts of historical land-use and landscape variables on hollow-bearing trees along an urbanisation gradient";"";"Hollow-bearing trees provide habitat for diverse taxonomic groups and as such they are recognised for their importance globally. There is, however scant reference to this resource relative within urban forest patches. The functional ecology of habitat remnants along an urbanisation gradient plays an important ecological, social and economic role within urban landscapes. Here we quantify the impacts of urbanisation, landscape, environmental, disturbance (past and present) and stand variables on hollow-bearing tree density within urban forest patches. This was undertaken by surveying 45 forest patches on the Gold Coast, south-east Queensland, Australia. Sites were categorised as; urban, peri-urban or rural along an urbanisation gradient, with an additional five control sites. Historical logging practices were found to be the driving factor influencing hollow-bearing tree density along the urbanisation gradient; while the impacts of urbanisation itself are not as yet discernible. These findings highlight the significance of incorporating historical land use practise into current and future urban planning, as these will have continuing impacts on remaining urban biodiversity values. These findings, will benefit natural resource managers and urban planners when making decisions about where and how best to manage for hollow-bearing trees along urbanisation gradients.";"Treby, Donna Louise

One of the information needs expressed by landowners and the broader forest community in eastern Ontario was an assessment of the effect of past management on degree of damage in hardwood stands. Ice storm damage was assessed in managed and unmanaged permanent sample plots established prior to the ice storm. In addition, 1587 temporary sample plots established after the 1998 ice storm were used to examine the effect of basal area, stand composition, stand location and tree size on degree of ice damage. Permanent sample plot results showed no significant difference in degree of damage between managed and unmanaged hardwood stands that experienced light to moderate damage in eastern Ontario. Chi-square analysis of temporary sample plots showed that the damage varied with location (township). There was some association with stand type (intolerant hardwood, tolerant hardwood, mixed hardwood/conifer and conifer), stand basal area and tree size.

"AGRIS:US201301704199";"Climate impacts on net primary productivity trends in natural and managed ecosystems of the central and eastern United States";"";"The central and eastern United States is an important food and timber production region and could potentially be a large-scale carbon sink. These characteristics are functions of the human management of the landscape and favorable soil and climate conditions. Large-scale assessments of carbon uptake and trends in net primary productivity (NPP) have been previously reported for this region using satellite observations, but they cannot quantify the contributions from changes in management and technology independently from climate effects. To address this shortcoming, we used the Agro-IBIS dynamic ecosystem model to examine the relationship of temperature and precipitation trends to NPP changes from 1950 to 2002 and 1982 to 2002 over both natural and managed ecosystems. In order to isolate the vegetation growth response to climate trends, we minimized the representation of management for agroecosystems and forested ecosystems by removing nitrogen stress and irrigation from the model. Simulated NPP trends were larger during 1982-2002 than during 1950-2002 and were positive across most of the domain. For the 1982-2002 period, corn had the largest NPP trend of 6.43gCm⁻² year⁻² (p =0.22), followed by soybean, spring wheat, deciduous forest, and grassland with 4.06 (p =0.30), 4.05 (p =0.42), 1.98 (p =0.17), and 0.84gCm⁻² year⁻² (p =0.73), respectively. Winter wheat had a trend of −0.64gCm⁻² year⁻² (p =0.55) and evergreen needleleaf forest had a negligible NPP trend. Trends in NPP in grasslands, deciduous forest, spring wheat, and winter wheat were associated with trends in precipitation, while trends in corn and soybean were attributed to a combination of longer growing periods, decreased summer average temperatures, and increased precipitation. We found that 19% of corn and 11% of soybean NPP trends could be explained by temperature trends while 23% of corn and 44% of soybean trends could be explained by precipitation trends. Our results provide further evidence supporting observational results that suggest 20-25% of recent crop yield trends can be explained by changing climate, and suggest that over the past several decades climate changes have favored increased crop productivity in most agroecosystems of the central United States with the exception of winter wheat.";"Twine, Tracy E.

"AGRIS:US201600195284";"Constructing globalized spaces of tourism and leisure: Political ecologies of the Salta Wine Route (NW-Argentina)";"";"This study contributes to a growing body of literature examining tourism and amenity-led residential development in an emerging global countryside. It does so by analyzing the public-private efforts to nationally and globally position the Salta Wine Region as a premier tourism and leisure destination. A marketing effort highlighting the exceptional natural setting coupled with high-quality viticulture effectively seeks to reposition a peripheral Andean valley as âthe world's highest wine routeâ. Enabled by neoliberal policies, a variety of actors such as national and international wineries, real estate developers and hotel companies have produced new spaces for leisurely consumption. This paper analyzes the discursive and material restructuring of societyânature relations through a political ecology lens. Drawing on long-term ethnographic fieldwork it provides a grounded, micro-political account of the way in which distinct actors engage in and experience tourism and amenity-led development. Findings show that the current boom benefits the land-holding elite and new investors while escalating costs of living and unequal access to resources have deepened historically inherited socio-ecological inequalities. In contrast to findings from places in the Global North that have experienced a similar tourism and amenity boom, conflicts over landscape aesthetics and environmental protection are virtually absent in the study area. Socio-ecological conflicts concentrate on access to resources, affordable living, and livelihood improvement. Despite an increasing importance of tourism, amenity migration and related speculative investment in the Global South, studies have primarily focused on the Global North. Given the uneven geographies that such developments produce, augmenting the broader literature on tourism and amenity-led rural restructuring with a political ecology perspective comes at a timely moment.";"Rainer, Gerhard";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land ownership";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600195284";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.11.007";"";"";"";"104-117"
"AGRIS:US2016201763";"Wildland Fire Hazard and Urban Development Pattern: Why California Civil Code 1103 Fails to Protect Households from Wildfires";"";"Recent years have seen mass casualties and severe property damage caused by wildland fires. With increasing housing development in natural-amenity-rich fire-prone areas, human activities not only exert intense pressures on local ecosystems, but also increase difficulties for wildland fire suppression. To cope with wildland fire threats and protect life and property from wildfire, a new California Natural Hazard Disclosure Law (California Civil Code Sec. 1103) went into effect in 1998. Information disclosure required by Sec. 1103 and its related laws is expected to enhance the efficiency of market allocation of land and developments in hazardous areas, making land price and development pattern better reflect the benefit and risk of living in the natural hazard zones. However, Troy and Romm (2004) suggested that the California Natural Hazard Disclosure Law had no effect for the overall population of fire-zone houses and did not stop overdevelopment in wildfire hazardous areas. In this paper, we expand a classic urban economics model to explore the impact of wildland fire-zone designations on housing development patterns in both a general equilibrium framework and a quantifiable manner. We conduct simulation studies to characterize the changes in urban development patterns and spatial profiles in response to the dynamics of wildland fire regimes. Our model and simulation results reveal the behaviors of residents and local governments and help us understand why Sec. 1103 and its related laws fail to stop over-development in wildfire hazardous areas.";"Xu, Wenchao

In recent years efforts has been made among the three East African countries, towards forging economic and regional co-operation by establishing the East African Community (EAC). The premise for economic and regional co-operation has been underpinned for the need for a common market and boost regional trade. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to achieve one of the international development objectives of increasing growth to 7% a year that is required to reduce income poverty. One of the challenges that East African countries need to tackle in the face of globalisation is the ability to participate in international markets. East African countries have to make serious consideration with regards to changing the composition of their exports away from primary products to manufactured exports. Value addition to both agricultural and industrial products is vital to improving the EA economies. This paper examines the composition of East Africa’s economic structure.

Analysis of the assessment of Landsat satellite data showed it was possible to process data in a few days. However, it lasted 44 days to obtain the data. The results of the classification as well as other outputs (biomass growth model, expense-to-revenue ratio of measures, route network, LPIS database parcel structure, etc.) serve as a basis for the modelling of potential agricultural production contamination.

Accurately quantifying carbon sequestration by these forests can provide insight for strategic planning to mitigate greenhouse gas effects on climate change. This study provides a new methodology to estimate net forest carbon sequestration (FCS) in urban and community lands of northern New England using ground based forest growth rates, housing density data, satellite derived land cover and tree canopy cover maps at the county level. We estimated that the region's urban and community forests sequestered 603,200tC/yr ($38.7million/yr value), contributing 8.2% of regional net forest ecosystem carbon sequestration. The contributions at the state level varied from 2.3% in Vermont to 16.6% in New Hampshire with substantial variation at the county level up to 73.3%. Spatially, contribution rates from urban and community forests at the county level were much higher and concentrated in southeast portion of NH and southwest portion of ME along the coast, and decreased toward inland areas. Our estimated net FCS compared reasonably with gross FCS in the region reported by a previous study. On average, the net FCS was 34.2% lower (varying from 41.9% lower in Vermont to 28.1% lower in Maine) than the corresponding gross FCS mainly because of a lower regional average net growth rate used in this study, compared to the national average gross carbon sequestration rate used in the previous study.";"Zheng, Daolan

The model comprises a set of fuzzy classification rules, which resemble the reasoning employed by humans. Fuzzy rules are generated in an iterative fashion, incrementally covering subspaces of the feature space, as directed by a boosting algorithm. Each rule is able to select the required features, further improving the interpretability of the obtained model. After the rule generation stage, a genetic tuning stage is employed, aiming at improving the cooperation among the fuzzy rules, thus increasing the classification performance attained after the first stage. The BGFC is tested using an IKONOS multispectral VHR image, in a lake–wetland ecosystem of international importance. For effective classification, we consider advanced feature sets, containing spectral and textural feature types. Comparative results with well-known classifiers, commonly employed in remote sensing tasks, indicate that the proposed system is able to handle multi-dimensional feature spaces more efficiently, effectively exploiting information from different feature sources.";"Stavrakoudis, D.G.

The impact of climate change was manifested by an increase in stream temperature by 1.15°C over 28 years. The selected water quality parameters were dependent on flow, with up to 10-fold increases in the concentrations of ammonia, phosphorus and chlorophyll- a at minimum flow levels. In river catchments with point source pollution predominating, significant pollution with ammonia nitrogen was observed. The influence of increased water temperature compared to flow rates was generally less marked and, with the exception of chlorophyll- a , rather positive. For existing land management and utilization of these river catchments, extreme changes in flow rates will influence the water quality more substantially than the water temperature itself.

"AGRIS:US201400139307";"Identifying Major Factors Controlling Groundwater Quality in Semiarid Area Using Advanced Statistical Techniques";"";"There are many factors controlling groundwater pollution and vulnerability. However, the factors’ weights are still not reasonably investigated. In order to assess groundwater quality and the controlling factors in semiarid region, 178 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for salinity and nitrate content. New statistical techniques of prediction profiler and hierarchical cluster combined with geographic information systems (GIS) were used to assess the groundwater quality based on three categorical controlling factors; landuse/ land cover (LULC), soil texture, and aquifer type. It is hypothesized these factors are controlling groundwater quality with various weights. Groundwater salinity across the study area varied from 327.0 to 9110.0� mg/L, while nitrate ranged from 0.2� mg/L to 339.6� mg/L. Both prediction profiler and cluster analyses provided excellent tools for quantifying the pollution magnitudes, weighing the controlling factors, and visualizing the pollution zones. Prediction profiler showed high capability to predict groundwater pollution (P < 0.0001 and 0.0038 for salinity and nitrate, respectively) where LULC was the most effective factor, followed by aquifer type and soil texture class. According to desirability function analysis, maximum salinity and nitrate pollution was predicted to be associated with irrigated agriculture lands at shallow aquifers with silty clay loam soils. Hierarchical cluster analysis combined with GIS mapping was able to group the controlling factors into six vulnerability zones. The generated groundwater spatial pollution map allowed for potential pollution sources identification (e.g. fertilizer use, treated waste water, overdrafting). This paper also offers detailed mapping for decision makers to allow further ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation planning.";"Salahat, M.

"AGRIS:US2012201114";"On-farm Costs of Soil Salinisation: a Case Study for the Liverpool Plains in New South Wales";"";"Land affected by a high water table displays waterlogging and salinity effects. This causes costs to farmers through additional land management problems, loss of soil productivity and results in a decline of the farm's capital value. A multi-period mathematical model is developed to investigate best land and financial management strategies for such farms. Water tables rise mainly due to ground water import caused by high recharge in the surrounding parts of the catchment. The hydrological connection between model farm and catchment is established through the variable ""condition of the upper aquifer"". This paper analyses the effects of different levels of ground water import in terms of progress of soil salinisation, associated farm management responses and farm income development. The condition of the upper aquifer is shown to be decisive for the advance of salinisation and for the financial viability of the model farm. If the upper aquifer is draining or if it causes only minor rise of the water table, then the farming enterprise remains viable and long-term sustainable. If the aquifer condition causes high rates of upward leakage, then salinisation erodes farm productivity to an extent where no financially viable land management strategy is available.";"Greiner, Romy";"";"";"AGRIS";"1996-04-31";"en";"land economics";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012201114";"http://purl.umn.edu/12301";"";"";"";""

As a result, the directionality of these LST products limits their further application in many fields. Accurate correction of the angular problem of LST products requires explicit understanding of the angular effects of emissivity at the pixel scale. Currently, nearly ten years of global emissivity products of MODIS are available. However, the pixel-scale directionality of emissivity has never been analyzed. By performing a statistical analysis of 5-year MODIS emissivity products over most of East Asia, we generated the empirical relationships between the directional emissivity, land cover, and seasonal variations. Two look-up tables (LUTs) of directional emissivity were created for typical land cover types and applied to the generalized split-window algorithm to modify the MODIS LST. The results showed that the angular effect of emissivity could introduce a significant bias of −1–3 K to the 1 km resolution LST. Finally, the spatial scale effects of emissivity were analyzed, and it was found that the temperature differences caused by scale effects fell within +/−0.5 K for most pixels if 5 km emissivity was used in 1 km LST retrieval. Therefore, wide use of the LUTs can be expected.";"Ren, Huazhong

The Quetta Valley is the largest population center in Balochistan province in western Pakistan. This area is arid and groundwater is the main water source for domestic and agricultural use. This work presents global positioning system (GPS) data and assessment of spatial and temporal variations in water levels. GPS data from two stations from mid-2006 to the beginning of 2009 show subsidence rate of 10� cm\year. Nine satellite images from 1975 to 2009 were classified and processed to quantify land cover and land use changes, which highlight an increase in agricultural areas in the central region of the Quetta Valley, as well as reduced vegetation on mountains. These data correspond to gradual temporal changes in water volumes in streams and lakes. Average temperatures have also increased and mean precipitation has decreased during this period. However, the greatest change in this area has been in population growth, which rose from 260,000 in 1975 to 1.2 million in 2010, mainly due to migration of refugees from war-torn neighboring Afghanistan. The Quetta Valley provides a good example for studying the impact of urbanization on water resources.";"Khan, Abdul S.

However, the quality of the biodiversity of these habitats has undergone little assessment. Terrestrial gastropods are suitable indicators of forest quality and long-term stability because of their strict dependence on microhabitat conditions and their slow dispersal rate. We sampled the gastropod population in a protected Mediterranean area in order to compare the species richness in seven main habitats. Holm oak wood and mixed-pine forests were the habitats with the lowest species density, and areas with a high level of heterogeneity exhibited� the richest communities. In recent decades however, land abandonment and pine reforestation are leading to landscape homogeneity, which is perhaps the cause of the extinction of six open-habitat gastropod species in the Park. These results provide park authorities with insights into how to adapt management plans to enhance habitat quality for land snail and slug assemblages. More specifically, our results stress the need to create habitat heterogeneity to increase land mollusc diversity in large and continuous areas of mixed-pine forests.";"Torre, Ignasi

The order of per hectare subsidies to farmers in specific subject of the Russian Federation is fixed on regional legislative level. In addition, each region has the right to establish its own criteria for budget allocation. The main conditions of the subsidy per hectare in the Krasnodar region are sown area under crops, the area sown to perennial grasses, and the area on which organic fertilizers have ever been put.This approach will contribute to the unjustified expansion of acreage by land users in the conditions of extensive production in violation of the science-based zonal technologies of field crops cultivation and, consequently, a violation of the process of soil fertility reproduction.

"AGRIS:US2012203849";"LAND CONSOLIDATION AS A FACTOR FOR SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN MOLDOVA";"";"Since 1991, Moldova has carried out a wide range of radical reforms affecting its social and economic system. The land reform, which was practically completed in 2000, created over 1 million landowners among the rural population. Many of them entrusted their land to managers of newly created corporate farms. Others used their privately owned land to establish independent family farms. The creation of independent family farms (so-called ""peasant farms"") was one of the primary goals of the land reform. More than 280,000 peasant farms have been created, averaging 1,86 hectares in size. The small size of the peasant farms, whose holdings are furthermore split into 3-4 parcels, raises considerable concerns about their long-term viability and has led to an intense public debate regarding the impacts of fragmentation. In this paper, we use the data from several recent surveys in Moldova to support the case for land consolidation. We show that, in the individual sector, larger farms produce higher family incomes and thus farm augmentation makes a positive contribution to the well-being of the rural population. We also show that, for farms of a given size, productivity increases as the number of parcels decreases. After demonstrating the economic advantages of consolidation, we proceed to discuss the actual use of various market mechanisms for land consolidation, including leasing as well as buying and selling of land. We then show that, in our surveys, farms with leased land are in fact larger than farms that rely on owned land only. This completes the logical circle of our argument: land consolidation leads to better economic performance, while land leasing is actually used as a market mechanism for consolidation, which benefits both lessees (through increased farm incomes) and lessors (through income from lease payments for their land).";"Lerman, Zvi

In other words, lack of proper information on land capability and rational and irrational use of land leads to destruction of land resources. This paper discusses the findings of ecological and socioeconomic resource issues for Minoo Island and the surrounded zone. The study covers an area of about 172km² in southwest Iran. To establish environmental unit maps, digital layer maps of the soil texture were overlapped. The study empirically established that the area has the capability to accommodate ‘levels two’ urban and industrial development.

"AGRIS:US201500003792";"Informal institutions as mechanisms to address challenges in communal grazing land management in Tigray, Ethiopia";"";"The role of institutions providing rules, norms and regulations, in addressing challenges in communal resources management has been debated for several decades. This article analyses the role of informal institutions for addressing shortage of grazing land, conflicts among users of communal grazing land and resistance among users to shift from free grazing to zero grazing in Tigray, Ethiopia. We used in depth interviews and focus group discussions for data collection. We argue that informal institutions are important mechanisms for addressing the challenges in communal grazing land management. The contributions of informal institutions for addressing challenges in communal grazing lands varied with type of challenge and were influenced by distances from markets and Wereda towns. Although the informal institutions were crucial in reversing the shortage of grazing land by regulating access to communal grazing land and enhancing controlled use of grass, they did not contribute to resolving conflicts that arose from unequal allocation of benefits in the village far from a market and Wereda town. Incorporating zero-grazing practices in informal institutions was hindered by disagreements among users and the top-down approach used by development agents when introducing zero grazing. To enhance effectiveness of informal institutions, the increasing grazing pressure should be addressed using more efficient schemes for harvesting grass. Moreover, creating awareness of the need for fewer but more productive cattle breeds is crucial. Consideration of well-performing informal institutions in policy and development interventions is essential to maximise the benefits of communal grazing lands to improve livelihoods of users.";"Yami, Mastewal

The analysis focused on four areas in the continental part of Croatia (Danube and Drava River alluvium, Pokupsko depression, Sava River basin, Upper Drava River basin) and four areas in the Mediterranean part (Neretva River estuary, NW part of North Dalmatia, Paško field, Lake Vrana). For the classified habitat types, changes in Corine land cover databases in 1990 and 2000 were analysed. The greatest changes in habitat were detected along the Danube and Drava River alluvium, where more than 8% of the total area changed habitat type, as well along the Sava River basin, where approximately 5% of the total area and the greatest absolute area changed habitat type. The most pronounced changes were detected in forest habitats, where forest degradation prevents the maturation of forest stands. The authors discuss which bird species listed in the Red Data Book of Birds of Croatia may be most impacted by the detected changes in habitat. Special attention was given to a comparison of habitat changes in the Nature Park Lonjsko polje between two raptor species, Aquila pomarina and Haliaeetus albicilla, according to the suitability of habitats where changes occurred.";"Radović, Andreja

The urban expansion of Rome (Italy) during the last 50 years and the related LCCs were investigated as a paradigmatic example of compact versus dispersed urban development. LCCs were assessed over 5 years (1960, 1974, 1990, 2000, 2006) by analysing diachronically the distribution of 12 land cover categories derived from digital land cover maps covering the entire Nuts-3 prefecture of Rome (5353 km²). LCRs were studied using multi-way data analysis. LCCs were found to have relative differences during ‘growth’ (1960–1990) and ‘sprawl’ (1990–2006) phases. Conversion to urban land uses concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s at the urban fringe, while expanding progressively far from the city in the 1990s and 2000s. During the ‘growth’ phase, the land cover classes with the highest probability of being converted to urban uses were arable lands, annual crops, vineyards and pastures. During the ‘sprawl’ phase, olive groves, orchards and forest surfaces also decreased due to the development of low-density built-up areas and infrastructure. Planning suggestions aimed at mitigating the alteration of the rural landscape through sprawl conditions are discussed.";"Salvati, Luca

Increasing population and the demand for food, fodder and fuelwood have threatened the sustainability of the land resources. Without understanding farmers' perceptions on land-related issues, sustainable management of land resources is impossible because they have intimate knowledge of their land. Besides technical solutions to land-related problems, socio-economic appraisal also plays an important role for solutions to these problems. Therefore, the objectives of this article are to find farmers' perceptions on land degradation and to examine the socio-economic determinants of land degradation in the study area. In this study, a structured questionnaire was used to collect information on different socio-economic parameters affecting land degradation and farmers' perceptions on the status of land degradation in Pishin sub-basin, Pakistan. Farmers' perceptions are presented using simple descriptive statistics, whereas socio-economic determinants of land degradation in the study area were investigated using a binary logistic regression technique.

"AGRIS:DJ2012089947";"National parks and environmental justice: Comparing access rights and ideological legacies in three countries";"";"National parks are often places where people have previously lived and worked-they have been formed by a combination of natural and human processes that embody an identifiable history of cultural and political values. Conservation of protected areas is primarily about how we perceive such landscapes, how we place differential values on different landscape components, and who gets to decide on these values. Thus, conservation has been and still is very much about issues of power and environmental justice. This paper analyses the social, political and environmental histories of three national park regimes (South Africa, Sweden and Scotland) through the lens of public access rights. We examine the evolving status of access rights-in a broad sense that includes access to land, resources and institutions of governance-as a critical indicator of the extent to which conservation policies and legislation realise the aims of environmental justice in practice. Our case studies illustrate how access rights are contingent on the historical settings and ideological contexts in which the institutions controlling national park management have evolved. Dominant cultural, political and scientific ideologies have given rise to historical precedents and institutional structures that affect the promotion of environmental justice in and around national parks today. In countries where national parks were initially created to preserve perceived wilderness, with decisions taken by powerful elites and central authorities, this historical legacy has prevented profound change in line with new policy directives. The comparative analysis of national park regimes, where historical trajectories both converge and diverge, was useful in improving our understanding of contemporary issues involving conservation, people and politics.";"Dahlberg Annika

"AGRIS:US201301624474";"What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An inter-disciplinary approach";"";"1. Modern farmed landscapes have witnessed substantial losses in biodiversity principally driven by the ecological changes associated with agricultural intensification. The causes of declines are often well described, but current management practices seem unlikely to deliver the EU-wide policy objective of halting biodiversity losses. 2. Available evidence suggests that property-scale factors can be influential in shaping patterns of biodiversity; however, they are rarely included in studies. Using 44 upland farms in the Peak District, northern England, we investigate the roles of ecological, agricultural and socio-economic factors in determining avian species richness, for the first time incorporating information from all three influences. 3. Although we might expect that habitat quality would be the main factor affecting species richness, these variables had little influence. The landscape context of each property was unimportant in explaining any of the three measures of species richness (Total, Upland and Conservation Concern) used here. Within-property habitat quality did explain 42% of the variation in richness of upland specialist species, but had no influence on Total or Conservation Concern Richness. 4. Socio-economic circumstances of farms alone accounted for 24% of the variation in Total Richness, with land tenure and labour inputs important predictors of avian diversity. However, net income, rental value and the level of Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) payments did not play a role in predicting species richness. 5. Farm management variables, including many of the main prescriptions outlined in AES, accounted for 23% of the variation in the richness of species of Conservation Concern, but less than 10% for Total Richness. However, no farm management variable alone was shown to offer better predictive power of avian species richness than random. 6. Synthesis and applications. The agricultural landscape is managed by a mosaic of landowners, all of whom can influence biodiversity conservation. We demonstrate that variation at the property-scale in habitat, management and socio-economics can feed into determining patterns of biodiversity. Currently, farmland conservation policy largely assumes that socio-economic barriers and financial costs of implementing conservation measures are constant. Incorporating a consideration of the varying circumstances of individual properties into policy design is likely to result in substantial biodiversity gains.";"Dallimer, Martin

Using a Tobit model, the results suggest that in general food expenditure allocations suffer due to cash cropping in Kenya as the lump-sum income flows from this may be used for purchases other than food. Food expenditure also suffers when remittances are irregular. On the other hand, earnings from outside employment for married women living with husbands are positively associated with food expenditure allocations. Amounts of non-cash food output as well as ownership of livestock are negatively associated with food expenditure allocations. These findings indicate that lump sum income may not lead to improved welfare of women and children. Thus, there may be social reasons for increasing non-cash food production especially by women, instead of over emphasising cash cropping as now seems to be so in public policy.";"Kiriti, Tabitha

The aim of this article was based on factors affecting wheat quality and setting realistic spatial models in each part of the land for assessment of land suitability potentials in Beijing, China. The study employed artificial neural network (ANN) analysis to select factors and evaluate the relative importance of selected environment factors on wheat grain quality. The spatial models were developed and demonstrated their use in selecting the most suitable areas for the winter wheat cultivation. The strategy overcomes the non-accurate traditional statistical methods. Satellite images, toposheet, and ancillary data of the study area were used to find tillable land. These categories were formed by integrating the various layers with corresponding weights in geographical information system (GIS). An integrated land suitability potential (LSP) index was computed considering the contribution of various parameters of land suitability. The study demonstrated that the tillable land could be categorized into spatially distributed agriculture potential zones based on soil nutrient and assembled weather factors using RS and GIS as not suitable, marginally suitable, moderately suitable, suitable, and highly suitable by adopting the logical criteria.

This article combines an econometric model of land use choice with models of watershed health indicators to examine the effects of land use policies on watershed ecosystems through their effect on land use. Our results suggest that incentive-based land use policies and property acquisition programs can have relatively large positive impacts on watershed health, while policies that change the returns to land use are less effective. The results suggest that there is potential for targeting these policies because their impacts vary across watersheds with different land use mixes.";"Langpap, Christian

Unlike many countries, which approach the development of policies for geologic storage (GS) of carbon dioxide (CO₂) with nearly a blank slate, the U.S. already has a mature policy regime devoted to the injection of CO₂ into deep geologic formations. However, the existing governance of CO₂ injection is designed to manage enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and policy changes would be needed to manage the risks and benefits of CO₂ injection for the purpose of avoiding GHG emissions. We review GS policy developments at both the U.S. federal and state levels, including original research on state GS policy development. By applying advocacy coalition framework theory, we identify two competing coalitions defined by their beliefs about the primary purpose of CO₂ injection: energy supply or greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. The established energy coalition is the beneficiary of the current policy regime. Their vision of GS policy is protective: to minimize harm to fossil energy industries if climate policy were to be enacted. In contrast, the newly formed climate coalition seeks to change existing GS policy to support their proactive vision: to maximize GHG reductions using CCS when climate policy is enacted. We explore where and at what scale legislation emerges and examine which institutions gain prominence as drivers of policy change. Through a detailed textual analysis of the content of state GS legislation, we find that the energy coalition has had greater success than the climate coalition in shaping state laws to align with its policy preferences. It has enshrined its view of the purpose of CO₂ injection in state legislation, delegated authority for GS to state agencies aligned with the existing policy regime, and protected the EOR status quo, while creating new opportunities for EOR operators to profit from the storage of CO₂ The climate coalition's objective of proactively putting GS policy in place has been furthered, and important progress has been made on commonly held concerns, such as the resolution of property rights issues, but the net result is policy change that does not significantly revise the existing policy regime.";"Pollak, Melisa

"AGRIS:US201301682999";"Conflicting rationalities, knowledge and values in scarred landscapes";"";"Incorporating public or local preferences in landscape planning is often discussed with respect to the difficulties associated with accurate representation, stimulating interest and overcoming barriers to participation. Incorporating sectoral and professional preferences may also have the same degree of difficulty where conflicts can arise. Planning theory calls for inclusiveness and collaboration, ideally egalitarian, and analysis of the process often uses case study scenarios that may offer examples for practice and further research. Much of the literature takes case studies in urban landscapes as the starting point for discussion and little is known of the collaborative process in rural landscapes, especially damaged landscapes such as those that may occur after extreme resource extraction. In this paper, we use industrially mined, or 'cutaway', peatlands as illustrative examples of the remaining 'scarred' landscapes. Using narratives of 'knowledge-holders' as iterative examples, we explore the perspectives of key actors within scarred landscape after-use planning. It is shown that though there is agreement that community 'stakes' are important, there are conflicts relating to the exact level of collaboration or to the extent that it is necessary at all. Traditional sectoral approaches predominate with community level narratives following established pathways. The prevailing rationalities revolve around protectionism and differing opinions of knowledge. Where a policy vacuum exists in relation to after-use of damaged landscapes, the resulting conflict may be an impediment to non-tokenistic stakeholder collaboration.";"Collier, Marcus J.

"AGRIS:US201600090150";"Potential Land Use Implications of a Global Biofuels Industry";"";"In this paper we investigate the potential production and implications of a global biofuels industry. We develop alternative approaches to consistently introduce land as an economic factor input and in physical terms into a computable general equilibrium framework. The approach allows us to parameterize biomass production consistent with agro-engineering information on yields and a ""second generation"" cellulosic biomass conversion technology. We explicitly model land conversion from natural areas to agricultural use in two different ways: in one approach we introduced a land supply elasticity based on observed land supply responses and in the other approach we considered only the direct cost of conversion. We estimate biofuels production at the end of the century could reach 221 to 267 EJ in a reference scenario and 319 to 368 EJ under a global effort to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The version with the land supply elasticity allowed much less conversion of land from natural areas, forcing intensification of production, especially on pasture and grazing land, whereas the pure conversion cost model led to significant deforestation. These different approaches emphasize the importance of somehow reflecting the non-market value of land more fully in the conversion decision. The observed land conversion response we estimate may be a short turn response that does not fully reflect the effect of long run pressure to convert land if rent differentials are sustained over 100 years.";"Gurgel, Angelo

"AGRIS:US201500200282";"Evaluation of potential irrigation expansion using a spatial fuzzy multi-criteria decision framework";"";"This paper presents a spatial framework which can be used to perform multi-criteria assessments for different purposes. We tested the framework on a case study of evaluating potential expansion for irrigated pasture in the Limestone Coast of South Australia. The core of the framework is the fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted averaging (FLOWA) model which integrates and implements fuzzy quantifiers, Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in the ArcGIS environment. Fifteen criteria were chosen, including groundwater, topography, landscape and soil attributes which significantly affect irrigated landuse. Criterion weights were determined at both objective and attribute levels using the AHP, and several scenarios were derived using the OWA operator for selected values of fuzzy quantifiers. The resultant evaluation map from the weighted linear combination (WLC) approach was then compared with regional present landuse map. Most currently irrigated areas are contained within the area predicted to be suitable for irrigated agriculture. Relatively large additional areas are also predicted to be suitable, suggesting potential expansion, or that factors including total regional water availability and enterprise-specific economics are at play. The framework provides a useful tool with flexibility and efficiency. It enhances the existing AHP and OWA methods in the spatial context, and incorporates the uncertainty mechanism for guiding the multi-criteria decision making. It is particularly valuable given its capability to generate and visualise a wide range of multi-criteria decision scenarios, which can facilitate a better understanding of the spatial patterns of alternative landuse suitability potentials for future regional-scale landuse planning and water resource management.";"Chen, Y.

"AGRIS:US201600190509";"Spatiotemporal mapping of the dry season vegetation response of sagebrush steppe";"";"The vegetation dynamics of semi-arid and arid landscapes are temporally and spatially heterogeneous and subject to various disturbance regimes that act on decadal scales. Traditional field-based monitoring methods have failed to sample adequately in time and space in order to capture this heterogeneity and thus lack the spatial extent and the long-term continuous time series of data necessary to detect anomalous dynamics in landscape behavior. Time series of ecological indicators of land degradation that are collected synoptically from local to global spatial scales can be derived from the 33-year and continuing Landsat satellite archive. Consequently, a retrospective study was conducted on a commercially grazed sagebrush steppe dominated Utah landscape using a time series of standardized Landsat imagery for the period 1972 to 1997. The study had the objectives to (1) characterize and map the historical trends of a remotely-sensed index of vegetation response, a correlate of vegetation cover or phytomass, and (2) to retrospectively infer the cause of this response to historical records of grazing and wet and drought periods. A time series of dry season vegetation index maps were statistically clustered to generate a spatio-temporal map of three coarse trends of vegetation response, i.e., declining, stable, and increasing trends. This study showed that 71% of the landscape's locations had an increasing trend and 29% had a stable trend over the 26-year period. The increasing trend locations were positively correlated with site water balance [the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)], i.e., vegetation response increased during wet periods and decreased during drought. The increasing trend was positively and negatively (non-linearly) correlated with grazing in individual paddocks from 1980 to 1997.";"Washington-Allen, R.A.

When coupled with image analysis software, the usefulness of digital cameras can be increased to advance the field of micropedology. The determination of a representative elementary area (REA) still remains a critical information need for soil scientists so that field measurements are independent of sample size and account for spatial heterogeneity. An objective of this study was to define and determine an REA for Low Chroma and High Chroma soil redoximorphic features (SRFs) present in claypan soils of northeastern Missouri, USA using a digital camera and image classification techniques. An additional objective was to examine REA differences between these two SRF types, soil depths, and landscape positions to highlight sampling considerations when quantifying SRFs in the field. Three metrics were chosen to quantify SRF heterogeneity, including percent occurrence, mean Euclidean distance, and the Interspersion/Juxtaposition Index. The relative change in these metrics was determined for 16 image sizes ranging from 2.5cm² to 40 cm² and used to identify an REA. Results showed REAs (mean±SE) for Low Chroma (17.7cm²±0.4) and High Chroma (25.4cm²±0.7) were significantly different (α=0.05). Further review of REAs indicated large sampling diameters (>8cm) are necessary to simultaneously capture REAs of Low Chroma and High Chroma SRFs. When SRFs were considered separately, a ≥5cm diameter core is recommended to reach an REA for Low Chroma, allowing accurate quantification for soil classification purposes and hydric soil determinations. Federal and state agencies requiring quantifiable SRF measures for land management decisions may greatly benefit from determining these minimum measurement scales, ensuring appropriate data collection methods in the future.";"O'Donnell, T.

The pixel-based method (maximum likelihood classifier for pixel-level method (MLCPL)) and two object-oriented methods (maximum likelihood classifier for object-level method (MLCOL) and a hybrid method combining image segmentation with the use of a maximum likelihood classifier at the pixel level (MLCPL)) were compared. An extension of the watershed segmentation method was used in this article. After experimenting, we chose an optimum segmentation scale. Classification results showed that the hybrid method outperformed MLCOL, with an overall accuracy of 90.53%, compared with the overall accuracy of 77.53% for MLCOL. Jeffries–Matusita distance analysis revealed that the hybrid method could maintain spectral separability between different classes, which explained the high classification accuracy in mixed-cover types compared with MLCOL. The classification result of the hybrid model is preferred over MLCPL in geographical or landscape ecological research for its accordance with patches in landscape ecology, and for continuity of results. The hybrid of image segmentation and pixel-based classification provides a new way to classify land-cover types, especially mixed land-cover types, using medium-resolution images on a regional, national, or global basis.";"Li, Xiaojiang

VSDI is defined as , where ρ represents the reflectance of shortwave infrared (SWIR) red and blue channels, respectively. VSDI is theoretically based on the difference between moisture-sensitive bands (SWIR and red) and moisture reference band (blue), and is expected to be efficient for agricultural drought monitoring over different land-cover types during the plant-growing season. The fractional water index (FWI) derived from 49 Mesonet stations over nine climate divisions (CDs) across Oklahoma are used as ground truth data and VSDI is compared with three other drought indices. The results show that VSDI generally presents the highest correlation with FWI among the four indices, either for whole sites or for individual CDs. The NDVI threshold method is applied to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of VSDI over different land-cover types. A time-lag analysis is also conducted and suggests that VSDI can be used as a real-time drought indicator with a time lag of less than 8 days. The VSDI drought maps are produced and compared with the US Drought Monitor (USDM) maps. A good agreement has been observed between the two products, and finer spatial information is also found in VSDI. In conclusion, VSDI appears to be a real-time drought indicator that is applicable over different land-cover types and is suitable for drought monitoring through the plant-growing season.";"Zhang, Ning

The study is based on a complex methodology implying use of remote sensing, Geographical Information Systhems (GIS), climatic data, topographic and pedologic maps. Research reveal the low ecological potential of Bucium area, specialized, traditionally, in white table wines, sparkling wines and white quality wines. Data analysis shows that 30% of Bucium vineyard (281 ha of 928 ha) is  inappropriate, in terms of climatic suitability, for vinifera varieties culture; 34% of the area (316 ha) has limited ecological potential, enough to produce white table wines and sparkling wines; 36% of the area (331 ha) is suitable for quality white wines. In the vineyard area was not registered suitable conditions for quality red wines production. Huglins heliothermal index values shows that the vineyard has climatic characteristics that allow culture of wine varieties with early and medium ripening. In terms of ecological suitability, it appears that the most favorable conditions offer Cetatuia wine land, the eastern slope of the Doi Peri hill, eastern slope of Visani hill, south-western slope of Bucium hill and southern slope of Pietraria wine land.

Crop rotation on hop fields that has already been analyzed on 22 hop growing and livestock farms in Spodnja Savinjska dolina in 2008 show that the maize monoculture has been supplemented by some other crops like wheat, barley, lucerne, clover-grass mixtures and high beans; compared to the conventional production in the past, the crop rotation is now longer. Phytosanitary adequacy of two- and three-year rotation could be improved with supplementary crops, that is with fodder crucifers (fodder rapeseed and rape, forage kale), green manure (white mustard, oil radish), legume crops (soya, peas, vetch, field bean, white lupin, crimson clover, Persian clover, Egyptian clover) and compound fodders like Landsberger mixture and mixtures of vetch with oat or barley. Prohibition to sow broad-leafed plants in the quarantine rotation due to hop wilting limits the selection of crops to grasses (Italian rye-grass) and fodder grains (maize, barley), but the farmers could increase the selection of grains with oats, rye, triticale, mixture of wheat and rye, millet, sorghum and Sudan grass.

Local (independent) traders still constitute a major market for coffee producers. Yet, cooperatives also accept the produce from non-members and pay them the same price. Our objective in this paper is to analyse the importance of this phenomenon of double side-selling. We collected data from a sample of 170 coffee farmers. We use a probit model to analyse characteristics linked to cooperative membership and to study double side-selling. We describe the trade relationships between farmers and the cooperative on the one hand, and between farmers and traders on the other by the attributes of transaction costs involved in the trade of coffee. Membership characteristics include easy access to labour, land tenure, risk aversion, and mutual trust between farmers and cooperatives’ management. Preference to sell to traders can be explained by the trust farmers seem to have in them after the repeated transactions in credit and basic consumption items and by long-term relationships in the community.";"Mujawamariya, Gaudiose

A number of diverse manipulations were completed under the direction of federal agency and university scientists, and abundant remote sensing imagery is available to assist in relocating the treatments and evaluating their success. This is particularly important because few of the treatments were maintained following the loss of scientific personnel coinciding with the start of World War II, and most records of Civilian Conservation Corps scientific work were lost with the disbanding of the agency in 1942. Aerial photography, which was systematically used to image the United States beginning in the 1930s, can be used to identify types of treatments, measure areal coverage, estimate longevity, and help plan locations for new experiments. No long-lasting vegetation response could be determined for contour terraces, brush water spreaders, strips grubbed free of shrubs (despite the fact that these strips have remained visible for 65 years), and mechanical rootplowing and seeding. Distinct positive, long-term vegetation responses could be seen in aerial photos for water retention dikes, certain fenced exclosures, and some boundaries where different land management practices meet. It appears from both aerial photos and existing conventional records that experimental manipulation of rangelands has often been ineffective on the landscape scale because treatments are not performed over large enough contiguous areas and hydrological and ecological processes overwhelm the treatments. In addition, treatments are not maintained over time, treatment evaluation periods are sometimes too short, multi-purpose treatments are not used to maximize effects, and treatments are often not located in appropriate sites.";"Rango, Albert

We conducted a study to determine if woody plant species composition and abundance along headwater streams were correlated with categorical and continuous LULC and environmental variables along an urban-to-rural gradient. These variables were calculated at different spatial scales (subcatchment level and within 0.5 and 1 km radii of plots) and used % impervious surface cover (ISC) and finer scale LULC classification levels to determine their ability to explain species composition, diversity, abundance, non-native provenance and wetland indicator status of four plant strata—canopy tree, tree sapling, tree seedling and shrub. At all scales, we found distinct riparian woody communities within land-use categories, with significant differences among shrub species. Fine-scale land-cover variables correlated with species composition of shrub, tree sapling and tree seedling strata, but not the canopy tree stratum. Celtis occidentalis and Acer negundo were ubiquitous but dominated riparian areas surrounded by development, while Asimina triloba was associated with forested rural riparian banks. Non-native shrubs, Lonicera maackii and Euonymus alatus, were indicative of areas surrounded by development, while the native shrub, Lindera benzoin, was associated with deciduous forest. Negative factor-ceiling relationships between canopy tree, sapling and tree seedling densities and % ISC were found, with abrupt declines above approximately 30 % ISC. Facultative wetland shrubs were not found above 30 % ISC. Streambank height, which was strongly negatively correlated with depth to the water table and positively correlated with cumulative catchment area, was negatively correlated with facultative wetland tree and shrub species. In addition, riparian tree sapling and seedling densities declined as the abundance of Lonicera maackii increased.";"White, R. Jonathan

Using descriptive, correlation and multivariate statistics, the study demonstrates that fringe fires significantly differ in size and frequency from peri-urban and rural fires, with the highest values recorded in the peri-urban belt (7.8 events/ha/year with an average size of 30.5 ha). Fringe fires are medium-sized (8 ha on average) and affected primarily forests, woodlands and high shrub lands. Totalizing 57 % of total events, rural fires affected primarily pastures and agricultural areas and are the smallest in size (1.5 ha) showing also the lowest density (7.3 events/ha). Fire distribution in Athens reflects the transition from a mono-centric and compact city expanding along the fringe to a more dispersed agglomeration. Results point out the increased pressure on peri-urban land due to settlement sprawl and real estate speculation and highlight the urgent need of specific forest and land management measures separately for the urban fringe and peri-urban areas.";"Salvati, Luca";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"land management";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"GRC";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500082465";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-014-0359-y";"";"";"";"1175-1189"
"AGRIS:US201600006415";"Natural Regeneration Processes in Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)";"";"Big sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata Nuttall (Asteraceae), is the dominant plant species of large portions of semiarid western North America. However, much of historical big sagebrush vegetation has been removed or modified. Thus, regeneration is recognized as an important component for land management. Limited knowledge about key regeneration processes, however, represents an obstacle to identifying successful management practices and to gaining greater insight into the consequences of increasing disturbance frequency and global change. Therefore, our objective is to synthesize knowledge about natural big sagebrush regeneration. We identified and characterized the controls of big sagebrush seed production, germination, and establishment. The largest knowledge gaps and associated research needs include quiescence and dormancy of embryos and seedlings; variation in seed production and germination percentages; wet-thermal time model of germination; responses to frost events (including freezing/thawing of soils), CO₂ concentration, and nutrients in combination with water availability; suitability of microsite vs. site conditions; competitive ability as well as seedling growth responses; and differences among subspecies and ecoregions. Potential impacts of climate change on big sagebrush regeneration could include that temperature increases may not have a large direct influence on regeneration due to the broad temperature optimum for regeneration, whereas indirect effects could include selection for populations with less stringent seed dormancy. Drier conditions will have direct negative effects on germination and seedling survival and could also lead to lighter seeds, which lowers germination success further. The short seed dispersal distance of big sagebrush may limit its tracking of suitable climate; whereas, the low competitive ability of big sagebrush seedlings may limit successful competition with species that track climate. An improved understanding of the ecology of big sagebrush regeneration should benefit resource management activities and increase the ability of land managers to anticipate global change impacts.";"Schlaepfer, Daniel R.

The watersheds are those of the House Rock Run and the Brubaker Run located in the Pennsylvania Appalachian Piedmont, USA. These two watersheds are nearly identical with respect to bedrock, regolith, climate, geomorphology, morphometry, baseflow hydrology, and type and successional stage of forest vegetation. They only differ by the percentage of deciduous forest cover, with House Rock Run having 59% and Brubaker Run having 76%. From differences in their stream chemistries the biomass nutrient uptake stoichiometry of K₁.₀Mg₁.₀Ca₁.₄ was determined. This stoichiometry applies to an aggrading deciduous biomass and differs from those previously used which were derived from net primary production (NPP) data. The difference may reflect that macronutrients in plant tissue may also originate from atmospheric inputs and/or decomposing biomass. Although this stoichiometry may not be applied to all deciduous forest-covered watersheds, it is likely an improvement over a stoichiometry determined from NPP data. Mass-balance calculations of mineral weathering rates often suffer from the number of unknowns exceeding the number of equations. To add equations to the mass-balance matrices two methods are introduced. The first method employs Zr-normalized bulk chemical compositions of bedrock and soil to calculate a mass transfer coefficient for chemical weathering. The second approach uses chemical formulae and modal abundances of primary minerals undergoing complete dissolution during weathering. Both methods allow for calculation of weathering rate constraints without biomass and cation exchange influences. These constraints serve as additional equations in the mass-balance matrix. This study finds that the watershed with the higher percentage of recently abandoned agricultural fields previously used for growing row crops has the higher chemical weathering rate. The higher chemical weathering rate reflects greater runoff resulting from reduced evapotranspiration.";"Price, Jason R.

Drought monitoring techniques using remote sensing-based drought indices assume that vegetation conditions vary year-to-year due to prevailing weather conditions (e.g., precipitation and temperature), and current conditions are evaluated based on the deviation from the long-term statistics such as mean, minimum, or maximum. However, the rotation between agricultural crops (e.g., corn and soybeans) implies that this assumption may not hold, as each crop type may have distinct phenological variability across the growing season. In this study, the effect of crop rotation between corn and soybeans on the accuracy of the NDVI-based agricultural drought monitoring was investigated in Iowa, USA. The vegetation condition index (VCI), which is derived from NDVI, was selected to demonstrate the impact of crop rotation. The standard precipitation index (SPI) and official crop yield statistics were used as independent validation of the drought information acquired by these indices. The results suggested that the NDVI alone was not able to distinguish drought-related vegetation stress from vegetation changes caused by crop rotation between corn and soybeans. It was found that the integration of land cover with NDVI greatly improved the agricultural drought information obtained by the VCI over the crop-rotated agricultural fields in Iowa.";"Yagci, Ali Levent

For this use they require parameterisation to represent a heterogeneous region or are site specific and scaled upwards. This requires information on inputs such as climate, soil, land-use and land management. However, each input has an associated uncertainty, which propagates through the model to create an uncertainty in the modelled outputs. To have confidence in model projections, an assessment of how the uncertainty in inputs propagated through the model and its impact on modelled outputs is required. To achieve this, we used a pre-defined uncertainty range of key inputs; temperature, precipitation, clay content, bulk density and soil pH, and performed a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, using Monte Carlo simulations. This allowed the effect of measurement uncertainty on the modelled annual N₂O emissions and crop yields at the Grange field experimental site to be quantified. Overall the range of model estimates simulated was relatively high and while the model was sensitive to each input parameter, uncertainty was driven by the sensitivity to soil pH. This decreased as the N fertiliser application rate increased, as at lower N application rates the model becomes more sensitive to other drivers of N mineralisation such as soil and climate inputs. Therefore, while our results indicate that DDC can provide a good estimate of annual N₂O emissions and crop yields under UK conditions, reducing the uncertainty in the input parameters will lead to more accurate simulations.";"Fitton, N.

In frame of administrative procedure in public interest, the law enables to re-parcel lands and ownership relations to them in order to create conditions for consequential management. A property right to newly defined parcels is acquired by a decision of the appropriate land office which is an administrative authority. By means of reparcelling, also „modern“ ecological problems are solved. Reparcelling is necessary for renewal of statutory land registration, clearing and delimitation of borders in the landscape, and so it is a significant contribution for renewal of peace in land ownership in the CR shaken in 1948 – 1989.

In addition to analyzing the extent of vegetation, monitoring the dynamics of vegetation pattern within restoring wetlands can offer valuable information about the restoration process. Pattern metrics, derived from classified remotely sensed imagery, have been used to measure composition and configuration of patches and landscapes, but they can be unpredictable across scales, and inconsistent across time. We sought to identify pattern metrics that are consistent across spatial scale and time – and thus robust measures of vegetation and habitat configuration – for a restored tidal marsh in the San Francisco Bay, CA, USA. We used high-resolution (20cm) remotely sensed color infrared imagery to map vegetation pattern over 2 years, and performed a multi-scale analysis of derived vegetation pattern metrics. We looked at the influence on metrics of changes in grain size through resampling and changes in minimum mapping unit (MMU) through smoothing. We examined composition, complexity, connectivity and heterogeneity metrics, focusing on perennial pickleweed (Sarcocornia pacifica), a dominant marsh plant. At our site, pickleweed patches grew larger, more irregularly shaped, and closely spaced over time, while the overall landscape became more diverse. Of the two scale factors examined, grain size was more consistent than MMU in terms of identifying relative change in composition and configuration of wetland marsh vegetation over time. Most metrics exhibited unstable behavior with larger MMUs. With small MMUs, most metrics were consistent across grain sizes, from fine (e.g. 0.16m²) to relatively large (e.g. 16m²) pixel sizes. Scale relationships were more variable at the landcover class level than at the landscape level (across all classes). This information may be useful to applied restoration practitioners, and adds to our general understanding of vegetation change in a restoring marsh.";"Kelly, Maggi

While detailed ecological or biophysical field studies are needed to quantify the exact amount of ecosystem service supply at local scales, such a monitoring might be unfeasible at the regional scale. Since field scale monitoring schemes for ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning are missing, proxy based indicators can help to assess the historic development of ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning at the regional scale. We show at the example of the historic development (1964–2004) in the district of Leipzig/Germany how land use/land cover data can be used to derive regional scale indicators for ecosystem functions. We focus thereby on two hypotheses: (1) the ecosystem functioning has degraded over time and (2) changes in land use configuration play an important role in this degradation. The study focuses on indicators for ecosystem functions related to (i) water purification by riparian buffer strips, (ii) pollination, (iii) food production and (iv) outdoor recreation. Each indicator builds on the analysis of land use configuration and land use composition information and is tested on sensitivity/robustness with respect to parameters which had to be estimated based on expert knowledge. We show that land use composition is an important aspect in our ecosystem service assessment. Although our study region is faced with a maximum land use change of 11% in the major land use classes between 1964 and 2004, we see a decrease of ecosystem function indicators up to 23%. The regional assessment shows an overall trend for degradation of ecosystem functioning from 1964 to 1984. This trend is reversed between 1984 and 1994 but the process slowed down until 2004 without reaching the level of 1964.";"Lautenbach, Sven

Based on 2005 point count data (two types) from 178 sites at 22 farms, we calculated bird species richness, abundance, Shannon index, and Inverse Simpson index. The 50m radius data produced species richness and abundance measures about half the size as those produced by the unlimited radius data. The bird diversity measures were consistent across habitat types. The 50m radius data showed differences among 3–5 habitat types, whereas the unlimited radius data showed differences between only two habitat types. Using any bird diversity measure, the wetland/riparian habitat scored highest, followed by homestead, upland forest, native prairie, tame pasture, and cultivated land habitats. Bird monitoring methods should favor fixed over unlimited radius point counts, because of the former's greater discriminating ability.

Relative to mark‐recapture studies, using detection–nondetection surveys is more cost‐effective, and recent advances in statistical analyses allow the incorporation of detection probability, covariates, and multiple seasons. We examined the efficacy of using detection–nondetection data (relative to mark‐recapture data) for monitoring population trends of a territorial species, the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). We estimated and compared the finite annual rates of population change (λₜ) and the resulting realized population change (Δₜ) from both occupancy and mark‐recapture data collected over 18 years (1993–2010). We used multiseason, robust‐design occupancy models to estimate that territory occupancy declined during our study (Δₜ = 0.702, 95% CI 0.552–0.852) due to increasing territory extinction rates (ɛ̂1993 = 0.019 [SE 0.012]; ɛ̂2009 = 0.134 [SE 0.043]) and decreasing colonization rates (γ̂1993 = 0.323 [SE 0.124]; γ̂2009 = 0.242 [SE 0.058]). We used Pradel's temporal‐symmetry model for mark‐recapture data to estimate that the population trajectory closely matched the trends in territory occupancy (Δₜ = 0.725, 95% CI 0.445–1.004). Individual survival was constant during our study (ϕ̂1993 = 0.816 [SE 0.020]; ϕ̂2009 = 0.815 [SE 0.019]), whereas recruitment declined slightly (f̂1993 = 0.195 [SE 0.032]; f̂2009 = 0.160 [SE 0.023]).

An observation that has emerged from these discussions is that management of non-point or diffuse sources of phosphorus will be more important in the future in order to address symptoms of eutrophication in the nearshore. This paper provides context for this renewed focus on managing non-point source tributary loads and is based primarily on materials and discussions from the Great Lakes P Forum. There are changes that have occurred in the lakes and tributaries in the past 15 yr that indicate a greater need to focus on non-point sources, whether urban or rural. Changes have also occurred in land management to reduce non-point P losses from agriculture. While these changes have reduced sediment and particulate P loading in some Ohio tributaries, the more bioavailable, dissolved P forms have increased. As there is incomplete knowledge about the mechanisms that are influencing algal growth, it could be a challenge to demonstrate, in the near term, improvements in water quality with further P reductions from agriculture alone. Regardless, there appears to be a desire for improved accountability and transparency for agricultural non-point source P management.";"Joosse, P.J.

(leafy spurge) is an invasive weed that is a major problem in much of the Upper Great Plains region, including parts of Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Infestations in North Dakota alone have had a serious economic impact, estimated at $87 million annually in 1991, to the state's wildlife, tourism, and agricultural economy. Leafy spurge degrades prairie and badland ecosystems by displacing native grasses and forbs. It is a major threat to protected ecosystems in many national parks, national wild lands, and state recreational areas in the region. This study explores the use of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat) imagery and derived products as a management tool for mapping leafy spurge in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in southwestern North Dakota. An unsupervised clustering approach was used to map leafy spurge classes and resulted in overall classification accuracies of approximately 63%. The uses of Landsat imagery did not provide the accuracy required for detailed mapping of small patches of the weed. However, it demonstrated the potential for mapping broad-scale (regional) leafy spurge occurrence. This paper offers recommendations on the suitability of Landsat imagery as a tool for use by resource managers to map and monitor leafy spurge populations over large areas.";"Mladinich, C.S.

This paper investigates impacts of grazing (intensity) and bush encroachment on herbaceous species and rangeland conditions in Borana, southern Ethiopia. Herbaceous species richness and the abundance of each species were greater in the light‐ and moderate‐grazed areas than heavy‐grazed sampling plots. Similarly, herbaceous species richness was highest at an intermediate level of biomass and seems to decline as biomass increases. Among a total of 40 herbaceous species recorded, 20 per cent were tolerant of grazing, whereas the remaining 80 per cent were highly susceptible to heavy grazing. In both encroached and non‐encroached sampling plots, species richness varied from three to six species 0·25 m⁻². Overall, herbaceous species richness and abundance, in relation to grazing gradient, might disclose a better picture of the effect of grazing on individual herbaceous species. As species richness seems to decline under heavy grazing intensity, low to intermediate grazing levels may promote and conserve key forage species in savanna grazing lands.

"AGRIS:US2016216590";"LINKAGES BETWEEN POVERTY AND LAND MANAGEMENT IN RURAL  UGANDA: EVIDENCE FROM THE UGANDA NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD  SURVEY, 1999/00";"";"This study investigates the impacts of rural poverty on farmers' land managementdecisions, crop production and incomes, based upon analysis of data from the 1999/2000Uganda National Household Survey. We find that the impacts of rural poverty on landmanagement, crop production and income depend upon the type of poverty (i.e., what assetor access factor is constrained) and the type of land management considered.Ugandan households that are poorer in terms of access to land use labor moreintensively and are less likely to use several land management practices and inputs, thoughamong households that do use non-labor inputs, land-poor households use many of theseinputs more intensively. As a result, land-poor households obtain higher value of cropproduction per acre, though they have substantially lower incomes per capita than land rich households. Thus, access to land is a key factor affecting intensity of land management andrural poverty.Households with access to poorer quality land use less labor and most non-laborinputs, and obtain lower crop production and income. To the extent that land quality isdeclining as a result of soil nutrient depletion and other land degradation problems, theseresults suggest a downward spiral of land degradation! declining land quality -- lowerinvestment in land management -- further land degradation.Households that are poorer in terms of ownership of physical assets are less apt toadopt most land management practices and non-labor inputs. Households with less livestockobtain lower crop yields, and households with less of other assets obtain lower income. Thissuggests another negative cycle: low assets -- low investment in land management and lowincome -- continued land degradation and low assets.Households who are poorer in terms of males' access to education invest less in mostinputs and land management technologies, and obtain lower incomes. Households in whichfemales lack education use labor more intensively in agriculture but also obtain lowerincomes. These households may be locked into a similar cycle of low education -- lowinvestment in land management and low incomes -- land degradation and continued lowassets.Households in communities with lower wage rates use labor more intensively inagriculture, but use several non-labor inputs less intensively, and obtain lower value of cropproduction and incomes. Thus lack of off-farm opportunities may contribute to keeping poorhouseholds in a poverty and land degradation trap.Households without access to extension, market information or credit are less apt touse several modern non-labor inputs, likely resulting in lower crop production. Householdswith poor access to roads use less organic or inorganic fertilizer, which can contribute to landdegradation. Poorer road access is also associated with lower value of crop production peracre in the Eastern and Western regions and lower income in the Central region. Thus lackof access to infrastructure and services also may prevent households from exiting thepoverty-land degradation trap, though the impacts may be location specific. Our results suggest that improvement in smallholders' access to land, other assets,education, extension, market information, credit, roads, and off-farm opportunities can helpto break the downward cycle of poverty and land degradation, and put farmers on a moresustainable development pathway. Access to land (area and quality), other assets, educationand off-farm opportunities appear to be particularly important in addressing poverty directly,while other interventions are likely to have more indirect impacts, as they influence landmanagement, crop choice, and other livelihood decisions. Given the importance of land asthe major asset owned by poor rural households in Uganda, investing in land qualitymaintenance and improvement is a critical need. However, we found low marginal returns toinvestments in organic or inorganic fertilizer and other land management practices,suggesting that it will be difficult to get farmers to make such investments in the presentenvironment. Improvements in the market environment as well as development of moreprofitable land management technologies appears essential to address this need.";"Pender, John L.

Utilising knowledge gained from ‘learn as we go’ and combining it with the integration of sectarian agendas and establishment of a central government EEZ agency empowered by an Act of Parliament will ensure future food and energy security is met. To achieve this integration of environmental effects management with security of access and stakeholder buy in is needed. Government hierarchies should not limit integration under EEM, policy should be non-separatist, and regions should be defined using ocean zoning. Future food and energy security can then be thought of in terms of environmental carrying capacity, moving away from regimes overly focussed on regulating for development. Ocean zoning could be used to assign property rights, with all activities subject to EEM regulation and enforcement of adaptive environmental standards through a central government EEZ Ocean Affairs agency. An overarching strategy to provide a framework guiding the development of New Zealand’s EEZ organisational infrastructure and decision making is needed to achieve this.";"Morgan, Andrew David";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"property rights;zoning";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"NZL";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500193205";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2011.06.014";"";"";"";"652-657"

However, adoption rates for conservation agriculture in many regions of the world remain below expected levels. This paper looks at the effect of organic markets in providing incentives for farmers to adopt soil conservation practices based on the willingness of consumers to pay a price premium for the use of sustainable production technologies. Farmer-based organizations may help farmers overcome information deficiencies with respect to production processes as well as consumer preferences. Based on original survey data from 241 small-scale farm households in Honduras, we find that both participation in organic markets as well as in farmer-based groups have positive effects on the number of soil conservation practices adopted on the farm. The results indicate that besides supply-oriented policy measures, such as the provision of technical assistance and extension, demand-related factors are likely to play an important role in sustainable soil management. Demand-oriented policy measures can include support for labeling initiatives and consumer education to facilitate value-added product differentiation and market segmentation.";"Wollni, Meike

Based on geographical information system technology and remote sensing data related to land use and land cover of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai (Jiang-Zhe-Hu area), we analyzed patterns of landscape change and predicted land use dynamics using the CA-MARKOV model. We also analyzed the conversion rate and area among landscape classes using the CA-Markov model. We found that from 1980 to 2005, there was a significant decrease in the area of farmland, and much of this landscape was transformed into settlements. Most of the landscape classes have become fragmented and isolated. The areas of farmland, settlement land and water tend to be complex in their shape and spatial clustering. The shapes of other land class patches have become simpler, and overall landscape fragmentation has increased. Landscape diversity and heterogeneity have increased. The CAMARKOV model predicted that settlement land will continue to grow from 2005 to 2015, but the speed of conversion will be reduced. The speed of the reduction in farmland and forest has increased, and increased settlement areas are clustered along the Yangtze River. Land use dynamics and change in the landscape pattern have affected land productivity and made the ecosystem more sensitive and fragile in this study region.";"Ruishan, Hu

A ""food first"" paradigm was applied in the estimations of land potentially available for the production of biofuel feedstocks, without putting at risk food supply or nature conservation. Three land conversion scenarios were formulated: (i) A base scenario, that reflects developments under current policy settings and respects current trends in nature conservation and organic farming practices, by assuming moderate overall yield increases; (ii) an environment oriented scenario with higher emphasis on sustainable farming practices and maintenance of biodiversity; and (iii) an energy oriented scenario considering more substantial land use conversions including the use of pasture land. By 2030 some 44-53 million hectares of cultivated land could be used for bioenergy feedstock production. The energy oriented scenario includes an extra 19 million hectares pasture land for feedstocks for second-generation biofuel production chains. Available land is foremost to be found in Eastern Europe, where substantial cultivated areas can be freed up through sustainable gains in yield in the food and feed sector. Agricultural residues of food and feed crops may provide an additional source for biofuel production. When assuming that up to 50% of crop residues can be used without risks for agricultural sustainability, we estimate that up to 246 Mt agricultural residues could be available for biofuel production, comparable to feedstock plantations of some 15-20 million hectares.";"Fischer, Günther

It aims to explain the role forestry enterprises have for bioenergy provision in this area. The 'Institutions of Sustainability' framework is used as an analytical tool to investigate the role of private and public actors in these transactions, respectively, in the governance structures they are subject to. Empirical evidence was gathered by in-depth interviews with actors from forestry and bioenergy practice. Triggered by favorable governance structures, i.e. strong support by national and regional policies, rising prices for fossil energy sources, and co-operation of committed individuals and groups, a new bioenergy industry has been successfully established. However, the forestry sector has so far been just a marginal fuel supplier for this industry. The study identifies pitfalls impeding a broad implementation of wood-energy supply in forestry: not cost-covering prices offered by the bioenergy sector, lacking market transparency and security of supply, lacking mobilization of forest wood, and a preference among forest managers to sell products to the wood-processing industry. In terms of the Institutions of Sustainability the properties of transactions (asset specificities, uncertainties, separability), characteristics of actors (values, rationality) and governance structures (long-term contractual obligations elsewhere) are decisive in explaining the current form of transaction.";"Plieninger, Tobias

Remarkable levels of acquisition have been replaced by extraordinary levels of land loss in the past half-century or so. Today, African American farm owner-operators on little more than 2 million acres of land in the United States. Land loss in rural African American communities far exceeds farmland lost by white farmers. Even American Indian landowners-a group whose current land base represents but a fraction of its ancestral landholdings-have fared better than rural African American landowners over the past 50 to 60 years. This paper focuses on one of the primary causes of involuntary black land loss in recent times-partition sales of black-owned land held under tenancies in common. Our society has a clear moral obligation to reverse the processes that have stripped black landowners of their land. This paper advocates government intervention to promote enhanced landownership-both quantitatively and qualitatively-for African Americans. This paper maintains that the problem of fractionated heir property within the rural, African American community justifies more fundamental reform of common property law and the creation of government institutions that would have the capacity to help those who own heir property restructure their ownership in a way that the ownership could be stabilized and the property could be used productively.";"Mitchell, Thomas W.";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2000-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"USA";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016215028";"http://purl.umn.edu/12753";"";"";"";""

In certain parts of NRW, highly specialisedintensive farming creates a high environmental burden. Althoughorganic agriculture clearly has a lower negative environmentalimpact, the number of organic farms in regions with specialisedintensive production is low. The inherent needs of these specialisedintensive systems restrict the options to simplify and to adoptorganic farming systems, and some products (e.g., pork, sugar beet)only have access to a very small organic market. Therefore, theopportunity for increasing the rate of transition (conversion) ofspecialised conventional farms to organic farming is very limitedwithin the current agro-political framework.

Total and percent bioavailable DOC and total and carbon-specific trihalomethane (THM) formation potential (TTHMFP and STHMFP, respectively) were determined for shallow ground water samples from beneath a dairy farm in the San Joaquin Valley, California. Sixteen wells influenced by specific land management areas were sampled over 3 yr. Measured DOC concentrations were significantly elevated over the background as measured at an upgradient monitoring well, ranging from 13 to 55 mg L-1 in wells downgradient from wastewater ponds, 8 to 30 mg L-1 in corral wells, 5 to 12 mg L-1 in tile drains, and 4 to 15 mg L-1 in wells associated with manured fields. These DOC concentrations were at the upper range or greatly exceeded concentrations in most surface water bodies used as drinking water sources in California. DOC concentrations in individual wells varied by up to a factor of two over the duration of this study, indicating a dynamic system of sources and degradation. DOC bioavailability over 21 d ranged from 3 to 10%, comparable to surface water systems and demonstrating the potential for dairy-derived DOC to influence dissolved oxygen concentrations (nearly all wells were hypoxic to anoxic) and denitrification. TTHMFP measurements across all management units ranged from 141 to 1731 μg L-1, well in excess of the maximum contaminant level of 80 μg L-1 established by the Environmental Protection Agency. STHMFP measurements demonstrated over twofold variation (4 to 8 mmol total THM/mol DOC) across the management areas, indicating the dependence of reactivity on DOC composition. The results indicate that land management strongly controls the quantity and quality of DOC to reach shallow ground water and hence should be considered when managing ground water resources and in any efforts to mitigate contamination of ground water with carbon-based contaminants, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals.";"Chomycia, J.C.

In these forests, common production functions of sustainable forest management (SFM), and functions of profitability were elaborated for two conditions of harvesting during a cutting cycle. The result ofthese forest values shows that any current scheme for sustainable forest management and/or payments for environmental services can’t compete when compared to land values paid by the market with high demand and accumulation of land by highly profitable crops. Complementary, it was analyzed the compatibility between sustainable forest management and payments for environmental services with local farmer’s perceptions, which together with forest values explain their preferences for determined land uses.

Se evaluó el comportamiento financiero de tres formatos de pago por servicios ambientales (PSA) sobre el valor del bosque (VB), a partir de una primera cosecha forestal en bosques clasificados en dos tipos, de acuerdo con la dominancia de Pentaclethra macroloba en combinación con palmas (Bosque Pp) o en combinación con Carapa guianensis (Bosque Pc). En estos bosques se construyeron funciones de producción típicas del manejo forestal sostenible (MFS) y de la rentabilidad para dos condiciones de cosecha durante un ciclo de corta. El resultado de estos valores del bosque demostró que ningún esquema actual de manejo forestal sostenible y/o de pago por servicios ambientales puede competir con los precios de los terrenos propuestos en el mercado ni con la elevada demanda y acumulación de tierras dedicadas a cultivos muy rentables. Complementariamente, se consideró la percepción de los productores locales hacia la compatibilidad del manejo forestal sostenible y el pago por servicios ambientales, junto con el valor del bosque, para establecer sus preferencias sobre determinados usos del suelo.";"Meza, Víctor

"AGRIS:US201500007435";"case of urban sprawl in Spain as an active and irreversible driving force for desertification";"";"The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) does not distinguish between natural and human drivers, and between active and inherited desertification. Partly as a result of these ambiguities the UNCCD has attracted a low level of international attention. As the Spanish case study shows, this vagueness hinders the implementation of effective strategies to combat this global challenge. Unsustainable agricultural land management is the most blamed desertification agent in Spain but as land use changes trends demonstrate, desertification phenomena are fueled by a push–pull dynamics. Our data indicate that agriculture, rather than being a desertification agent, is a victim of a set of social and economic conditions leading to its abandonment and/or transformation in urban land, becoming irreversibly degraded by soil sealing. From 1975 to 2008, half a million ha of former agricultural land has been made available for development. Urban sprawl has become the most active desertification agent in Spain.";"Barbero-Sierra, C.

The mesoscale atmospheric Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) uses Global Land Cover Characteristics (GLCC) data created from NOAA-AVHRR satellite images from 1992 and 1993. However, from 1990 to 2010 the population of the country grew 29%, which represents an important increase in the extension of urban areas, particularly in the central part of the country, where the population in places like State of Mexico and Tlaxcala has grown around 34 and 33%, respectively. Due to the above, using the 2009 land use map of the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI, by its abbreviation in Spanish), in this study an update of the 30” resolution urban coverage data used by the WRF model is performed. A sensitivity study is carried out for Mexico City and its suburbs, and for the cities of Puebla and Tlaxcala. Eight sites are analyzed where changes from vegetation cover to urban cover occur and temperature increases between 0.5 and 5.0 ºC. The average of the maximum differences in temperature throughout the diurnal cycle is 2.61 ºC and the mean of the differences in the whole period is 0.66 ºC. The maximum difference in temperature is registered between the 10:00 and 15:00 hours (local time). The average maximum temperature using new urban data is 26.96 ºC, whereas using GLCC-1993 urban data is 25.63 ºC. The average increase in daily maximum temperature is 1.33 ºC, and for the daily minimum temperature is 0.12 ºC. The maximum temperature is reached between 13:00 and 15:00 hours, whereas the minimum temperature is reached between 4:00 and 6:00 hours. The mean daily range using new urban data is 16.0 ºC whereas using GLCC-1993 data is 14.9 ºC. Results show that the change from vegetal cover to urban increased the temperature in the study area.";"E. D. LÓPEZ-ESPINOZA

"AGRIS:US201500205558";"Impact of Land Use and Land Cover Changes on Organic Carbon Stocks in Mediterranean Soils (1956–2007)";"";"During the last few decades, land use changes have largely affected the global warming process through emissions of CO₂. However, C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems could contribute to the decrease of atmospheric CO₂rates. Although Mediterranean areas show a high potential for C sequestration, only a few studies have been carried out in these systems. In this study, we propose a methodology to assess the impact of land use and land cover change dynamics on soil organic C stocks at different depths. Soil C sequestration rates are provided for different land cover changes and soil types in Andalusia (southern Spain). Our research is based on the analysis of detailed soil databases containing data from 1357 soil profiles, the Soil Map of Andalusia and the Land Use and Land Cover Map of Andalusia. Land use and land cover changes between 1956 and 2007 implied soil organic C losses in all soil groups, resulting in a total loss of 16·8 Tg (approximately 0·33 Tg y⁻¹). Afforestation increased soil organic C mostly in the topsoil, and forest contributed to sequestration of 8·62 Mg ha⁻¹of soil organic C (25·4 per cent). Deforestation processes implied important C losses, particularly in Cambisols, Luvisols and Vertisols. The information generated in this study will be a useful basis for designing management strategies for stabilizing the increasing atmospheric CO₂concentrations by preservation of C stocks and C sequestration.

"AGRIS:US201500208877";"Seasonal landslide mapping and estimation of landslide mobilization rates using aerial and satellite images";"";"We tested the possibility of using digital, color aerial ortho-photographs and monoscopic, panchromatic satellite images of comparable spatial and radiometric resolution, to map recent landslides in Italy and to update existing measures of landslide mobilization. In a 90-km² area in Umbria, central Apennines, rainfall resulted in abundant landslides in the period from September 2004 to June 2005. Analysis of the rainfall record determined the approximate dates of landslide occurrence and revealed that the slope failures occurred in response to moderately wet rainfall periods. The slope failures occurred primarily in cultivated terrain and left subtle morphological and land cover signatures, making the recognition and mapping of the individual landslides problematic. Despite the difficulty with the identification of the landslides without the use of stereoscopic visualization, visual analysis of the aerial and satellite images allowed mapping 457 new landslides, ranging in area 3.0×10¹<AL<2.5×10⁴ m², for a total landslide area ALT=6.92×10⁵ m². To identify the landslides, the investigators adopted the interpretation criteria commonly used to identify and map landslides on aerial photography. The result confirms that monoscopic, very high resolution images taken by airborne and satellite sensors can be used to prepare landslide maps even where slope failures are difficult to detect, provided the imagery has sufficient geometric and radiometric resolutions. The different dates of the aerial (March 2005) and the satellite (June–July 2005) images allowed the temporal segmentation of the landslide information, and studying the statistics of landslide area and volume for different periods. Compared to pre-existing information on the abundance and size of the landslides in the area, the inventory obtained by studying the aerial and satellite images proved more complete. The new mapping showed 145% more landslides and 85% more landslide area than a pre-existing reconnaissance inventory. As a result of the improved mapping, the rate of landslide mobilization for the 2004–2005 landslide season was determined to be φL=27.1mm year⁻¹, 30% higher than a previous estimate for the same period. This seasonal rate of landslide mobilization is significantly larger than the long-term regional erosion rate in the central Apennines. The accelerated rate is attributed to agricultural practices that favor slope instability.";"Fiorucci, F.

Some areas of Sri Lanka are also periodically subject to cyclones that occur due to climatic conditions and geographical locations.Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair productivity of land. This occurs mainly through soil erosion, loss of organic matter and nutrients in the soil; salinization and large scale land degradation in Sri Lanka. Its manifestations today are heavy loss of soil, siltation in the water bodies, reservoirs and coastal waters, unplanned settlements, loss of arable land leading to declining productivity in agricultural lands and intensification of impacts of natural hazards such as flooding and landslides. Land degradation is a major problem in Eastern Coastal Area from Kalmunai MC, Karaitivu andNintavur Divisional Secretariat Divisions (DSDs) ofAmpara District. However, there is a considerable spatial heterogeneity exists within this area in terms of land use, topography, land management and socio-economic conditions.

"AGRIS:US201500208704";"relationship between precipitation anomalies and satellite-derived vegetation activity in Central Asia";"";"In Central Asia, water is a particularly scarce and valuable good. In many ecosystems of this region, the vegetation development during the growing season is dependent on water provided by rainfall. With climate change, alterations of the seasonal distribution of precipitation patterns and a higher frequency of extreme events are expected. Vegetation dynamics are likely to respond to these changes and thus ecosystem services will be affected. However, there is still a lack in understanding the response of vegetation to precipitation anomalies, especially for dryland regions such as Central Asia. This study aims to contribute to an improved understanding of vegetation sensitivity to precipitation anomalies and corresponding temporal reaction patterns at regional scale. The presented analyses are based on time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and gridded precipitation datasets (GPCC Full Data Reanalysis) for the years 1982–2006. Time-series correlation analyses show that vegetation development is sensitive to precipitation anomalies for nearly 80% of the Central Asian land surface. Results indicate a particularly strong sensitivity of vegetation in areas with 100–400mm of annual rainfall. Temporal rainfall–NDVI response patterns show a temporal lag between precipitation anomalies and vegetation activity of 1–3months. The reaction of vegetation was found to be strongest for precipitation anomalies integrated over periods of 2–4months. The observed delayed response of vegetation to precipitation anomalies reveals potential for drought prediction in Central Asia. The spatial patterns of vegetation reactions are discussed with focus on the role of precipitation amount and seasonality, land use and land cover.";"Gessner, Ursula

This article analyzes the anthropogenic driving forces of KRD at two scales: rural locality and its macro socio‐economic circumstances. At the rural locality scale, the intensive human pressure on land because of a large and fast growing population and unsustainable land use are identified to be the reason for KRD. However, more radical driving forces lie in the farmers' disadvantages in social‐economic circumstances, which compel them to overuse rural land. Hukou system, coastal development strategy, and household responsibility system are verified as three important factors in social‐economic circumstances. At last, a two‐scale framework is constructed to explain how anthropogenic driving forces lead to KRD in southwest China. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";"Yan, X.

"AGRIS:US201500201395";"Mediterranean water resources in a global change scenario";"";"Mediterranean areas of both southern Europe and North Africa are subject to dramatic changes that will affect the sustainability, quantity, quality, and management of water resources. Most climate models forecast an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation at the end of the 21st century. This will enhance stress on natural forests and shrubs, and will result in more water consumption, evapotranspiration, and probably interception, which will affect the surface water balance and the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater flow. As a consequence, soil water content will decline, saturation conditions will be increasingly rare and restricted to periods in winter and spring, and snow accumulation and melting will change, especially in the mid-mountain areas. Future land management will be characterized by forest and shrub expansion in most Mediterranean mountain areas, as a consequence of farmland and grazing abandonment, with increasing human pressure localized only in some places (ski resort and urbanized of valley floors). In the lowlands, particularly in the coastal fringe, increasing water demand will occur as a consequence of expansion of irrigated lands, as well as the growth of urban and industrial areas, and tourist resorts. Future scenarios for water resources in the Mediterranean region suggest (1) a progressive decline in the average streamflow (already observed in many rivers since the 1980s), including a decline in the frequency and magnitude of the most frequent floods due to the expansion of forests; (2) changes in important river regime characteristics, including an earlier decline in high flows from snowmelt in spring, an intensification of low flows in summer, and more irregular discharges in winter; (3) changes in reservoir inputs and management, including lower available discharges from dams to meet the water demand from irrigated and urban areas. Most reservoirs in mountain areas will be subject to increasing water resource uncertainty, because of the reduced influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes. Besides, reservoir capacity is naturally reduced due to increasing sedimentation and, in some cases, is also decreased to improve the safety control of floods, leading to a reduction in efficiency for agriculture. And (4) hydrological and population changes in coastal areas, particularly in the delta zones, affected by water depletion, groundwater reduction and saline water intrusion. These scenarios enhance the necessity of improving water management, water prizing and water recycling policies, in order to ensure water supply and to reduce tensions among regions and countries.";"García-Ruiz, José M.

"AGRIS:US201500201396";"Post-wildfire soil erosion in the Mediterranean: Review and future research directions";"";"Wildfires increased dramatically in frequency and extent in the European Mediterranean region from the 1960s, aided by a general warming and drying trend, but driven primarily by socio-economic changes, including rural depopulation, land abandonment and afforestation with flammable species. Published research into post-wildfire hydrology and soil erosion, beginning during the 1980s in Spain, has been followed by studies in other European Mediterranean countries together with Israel and has now attained a sufficiently large critical mass to warrant a major review. Although variations in climate, vegetation, soil, topography and fire severity cause differences in Mediterranean post-wildfire erosion, the long history of human landscape impact up to the present day is responsible for some its distinctive characteristics. This paper highlights these characteristics in reviewing wildfire impacts on hydrology, soil properties and soil erosion by water. The ‘mosaic’ nature of many Mediterranean landscapes (e.g. an intricate land-use pattern, abandoned terraces and tracks interrupting slopes) may explain sometimes conflicting post-fire hydrological and erosional responses at different sites and spatial scales. First-year post-wildfire soil losses at point- (average, 45–56tha⁻¹) and plot-scales (many <1tha⁻¹ and the majority <10tha⁻¹ in the first year) are similar to or even lower than those reported for fire-affected land elsewhere or other disturbed (e.g. cultivated) and natural poorly-vegetated (e.g. badlands, rangeland) land in the Mediterranean. The few published losses at larger-scales (hillslope and catchment) are variable. Thin soil and high stone content can explain supply-limited erosion preceding significant protection by recovering vegetation. Peak erosion can sometimes be delayed for years, largely through slow vegetation recovery and temporal variability of erosive storms. Preferential removal of organic matter and nutrients in the commonly thin, degraded soils is arguably just as if not more important than the total soil loss. Aspect is important, with more erosion reported for south- than north-facing slopes, which is attributed to greater fire frequency, slower vegetation recovery on the former and with soil characteristics more prone to erosion (e.g. lower aggregate stability). Post-fire wind erosion is a potentially important but largely neglected process. Gauging the degradational significance of wildfires has relied on comparison with unburnt land, but the focus for comparison should be switched to other agents of soil disturbance and/or currently poorly understood soil renewal rates. Human impact on land use and vegetation may alter expected effects (increased fire activity and post-wildfire erosion) arising from future climatic change. Different future wildfire mitigation responses and likely erosional consequences are outlined. Research gaps are identified, and more research effort is suggested to: (1) improve assessment of post-wildfire erosion impact on soil fertility, through further quantification of soil nutrient depletion resulting from single and multiple fire cycles, and on soil longevity; (2) investigate prescribed fire impacts on carbon release, air pollution and nutrient losses as well as on soil loss; (3) isolate hillslope- and catchment-scale impacts of soil water repellency under Mediterranean post-wildfire conditions; (4) test and refine application of cosmogenic radionuclides to post-wildfire hillslope-scale soil redistribution at different temporal scales; (5) use better temporal resolution of sedimentary sequences to understand palaeofire-erosion–sedimentation links; (6) quantify post-wildfire wind erosion; (7) improve the integration of wildfire into an overall assessment of the processes and impacts of land degradation in the Mediterranean; and (8) raise public awareness of wildfire impact on soil degradation.";"Shakesby, R.A.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"climate change;land use;land degradation;rangelands";"Land, Climate change & Environment;Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ISR;ESP";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500201396";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.01.001";"";"";"";"71-100"

The main income of the country is agriculture and agriculture based industry. However, the prime soils cover only 17.5% of the total land surface and the productivity of the rest of the soils is limited by topographical, chemical (e.g. high calcium carbonate content, alkalinity and low organic matter), and physical (e.g. water logging, texture) attributes. The diverse topography along with deforestation and unsuitable tillage and irrigation management has been inducing the rate of erosion in the country for centuries. The majority of the countrys soils (76.5%) are prone to erosion risk due to the dominant steep slopes (6%), and 72% of the soils are more or less affected from water and wind erosion. Alongside these unsuitable conditions, the misuse of lands, i.e. soil sealing, soil exploitation, over use of fertilizers and irrigation, improper use of indigenous environmental friendly, agro-ecosystems, constantly degrade the soils of the country. Soils with high production capacity and with a wide range of agricultural uses, cover 7% (about 5 million ha) of the total land area (77.9 million ha) of Turkey. This proportion is equal to about 1/5 of the potential agricultural soils of the country. The highly to moderately productive soils (soils of Land Capability Class I, II, III) comprising an area of 19.1 million ha, with none Tekirdağ Ziraat Fakültesi Dergisi Cangir ve Boyraz, 2008 5(2) Journal of Tekirdag Agricultural Faculty 170 (LCC I) to one or more moderate to severe limitations (LCC II and III) for some uses, require some kind of conservation practices to assure stability and sustainability of production as the essential part of the management system. Permanent limitations as water logged conditions as well as salinity would demand expensive investments in land management particularly for LCC III soils. This is almost equal to 1/4 (25%) of the country's land. However, there are 7.4 million ha land which is marginally productive (LCC IV), where parts of this is currently used for cultivation, pastures, forests and settlement areas, which cover about 4.9 million ha. About 573 000 ha of land is occupied by various industries and urban settlements, most of which is of Prime Quality (LCC I) and larger than the cultivated soils of many townships. Land with increased erosion due to misuse -unplanned- is about 6.2 million ha and the total non-arable (unsuitable for cultivation) (LCC V, VI, VII) land is 6.3 million ha Land/soil degradation and natural resources degradation should be included in the concept of desertification. In this framework, there are three major causes for the occurrence of desertification, these are namely the natural, technical, and socio- economic, administrative and legal causes. Erosion is the major impact of desertification, which is caused by the mismanagement of the land. It is a land degradation phenomenon accelerated by unplanned land management- the human impact- rather than natural causes. Deforestation, an on-going process for centuries in Anatolia, is the major driving force of land degradation reached by the unplanned and illegal cutting of forests to provide materials or fuel for heating, along with improper settling policies and overgrazing.

To assess the environmental determinants of the distribution and trophic dynamics of riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae, we characterised riparian habitat, collected emergent aquatic insects, and surveyed spiders in developed and rural landscapes of the Scioto River system, Ohio, USA, which provided a range of riparian land cover, nearshore vegetation types and habitat complexity. We also estimated the trophic position (TP) of Tetragnathidae and the proportion of energetic and nutritional subsidies derived from benthic algae (EBA) using naturally abundant carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes. Model-selection results revealed that tetragnathid spider density (1.57–3.80individualsm-1) was more sensitive to differences in overhanging vegetation than to those in aquatic food resources (i.e. emergent aquatic insects). Tetragnathidae TP, which averaged 3.16 across all 12 study reaches (range: 2.35–3.98), was largely driven by canopy density, shoreline shape, percentage overhanging vegetation and emergent-insect density. Emergent-insect density was the strongest driver of tetragnathid spider EBA (0.04–0.54, µ=0.24). Our study reinforced the notion that riparian spiders ecologically link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, our results further current understanding of the mechanisms affecting riparian spider distribution and trophic dynamics, particularly in the context of larger stream and river systems, given that the propensity of related research has occurred in small streams.";"Tagwireyi, Paradzayi

Nevertheless, even large areas may still suffer from less “visible” impacts such as loss of ecological processes. Because mapping ecological processes over large scales is not practical, an alternative is to map surrogate species that are key for those processes. In this study, we chose four species of Neotropical large mammals (the largest apex predator: jaguar – Panthera onca; the largest herbivore: tapir – Tapirus terrestris; the largest seed predator: white-lipped peccary – Tayassu pecari; and the largest arboreal seed disperser: muriqui – Brachyteles spp.) in an ecosystem with an old history of human impact (the Atlantic Forest) to test whether areas with native forest still harbor ecological processes that may guarantee long-term ecosystem maintenance. We gathered 94 locations with recent presence of the four species to map current ranges and model suitable areas. Our results reveal that 96% of the remaining Atlantic Forest is depleted of at least one of the four surrogate species and 88% is completely depleted of all four surrogate species. We also found that only 16% is still environmentally suitable for all four, and 55% is completely unsuitable to all four of them. Our study highlights the importance of looking beyond land cover to fully depict intactness of natural areas, and suggests that ecosystems with a long history of human impact (such as the Atlantic Forest) may be suffering from ecological impacts not seen at a first glance.";"Jorge, Maria Luisa S.P.

Numerous trials have been done on plant species compositions and biomass, but little testing has been done on the TEK of plant productivity and nutrient values, which are important for proper rangeland management. In this study, we tested the TEK of pastoralists living in Bulgan, northern Mongolia, regarding plant productivity and nutrient values. We examined biomass, growth form, plant productivity, and crude protein amounts along grazing gradients. The results showed that biomass declined and the number of erect-form plants decreased as grazing intensity increased, although plant productivity and crude protein amounts did not differ along the grazing gradient. This indicates that the pastoralists' evaluation of pastures dominated by narrow plants (Mongolian: nariin ovs) accurately reflects the productivity of the land, suggesting that their evaluation is reasonable in terms of the carrying capacity. This assessment of the ecological status of Mongolian rangelands provides a foundation for ecologically sound and culturally appropriate rangeland management.";"Kakinuma, Kaoru

Land use regression (LUR) has been widely used in predicting spatiotemporal variation of ambient air-pollutant concentrations, though restricted to the European and North American context. We aimed to estimate spatiotemporal variations of PM₂.₅by building separate LUR models in Beijing. Hourly routine PM₂.₅measurements were collected at 35 sites from 4th March 2013 to 5th March 2014. Seventy-seven predictor variables were generated in GIS, including street network, land cover, population density, catering services distribution, bus stop density, intersection density, and others. Eight LUR models were developed on annual, seasonal, peak/non-peak, and incremental concentration subsets. The annual mean concentration across all sites is 90.7 μg/m³(SD = 13.7). PM₂.₅shows more temporal variation than spatial variation, indicating the necessity of building different models to capture spatiotemporal trends. The adjusted R²of these models range between 0.43 and 0.65. Most LUR models are driven by significant predictors including major road length, vegetation, and water land use. Annual outdoor exposure in Beijing is as high as 96.5 μg/m³. This is among the first LUR studies implemented in a seriously air-polluted Chinese context, which generally produce acceptable results and reliable spatial air-pollution maps. Apart from the models for winter and incremental concentration, LUR models are driven by similar variables, suggesting that the spatial variations of PM₂.₅remain steady for most of the time. Temporal variations are explained by the intercepts, and spatial variations in the measurements determine the strength of variable coefficients in our models.";"Wu, Jiansheng

However, in the last decade, the profitability of VFSs has been challenged by several issues including lower productivity, higher domestic prices, various export barriers, an increase in the volume of imported vegetables and environmental deterioration. This study was an attempt in part, to investigate the reasons for the decrease in the competitiveness of VFSs in upland areas of Java and Sumatra, in particular the social and gender circumstances. The present study was conducted in the three main upland vegetable producing centres in Pangalengan, Kejajar and Berastagi-Simpang Empat by distributing 150 questionnaires to farmers. Significant differences in social circumstances between Javanese (Pangalengan and Kejajar) and Sumatran farmers (BSE) were observed in the VFS practices in terms of the cultural and economic situation of households, farm size, education level, labour and wages, land ownership and investment, as well as the type of cultivation and cropping patterns. The VFSs in the three regions were also compared with regard to resource and labour inputs. Pangalengan could be categorized as a high-input system while BSE was a low-input system. Many farmers in Pangalengan rented land while this was less prevalent in the other two regions. Differences were also found with regard to the number of women in the work force, in particular for different cultivation activities. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the VFSs in Pangalengan and Kejajar have improved their competitiveness through the more intensive use of inputs and high intensive farming practices. Social factors were observed to have less impact.";"Arsanti, I.W.

Yet few studies have considered these risks and the ways in which restoration can increase competition for land. Here, we address this issue by examining whether largeâscale restoration of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could displace cattle production, as a result of land shortages. Although the risks of displacement are indeed high when reforestation is planned in areas with high cattle productivity, we discuss how these risks can be minimized through a combination of productivity increases, a regional restoration planning framework, and the prioritization of marginal agricultural land for restoration. We also consider how restoration can, in some circumstances, be made more economically sustainable by incorporating incomeâgenerating activities such as exploitation of timber and nonâtimber forest products, certification, and payments for ecosystem services.";"Latawiec, Agnieszka E

It has an important practical value on urban construction land use planning and management from the angle of methodology. As a widely used technique, traditional multi-criteria evaluation based on GIS (MCE-GIS), is not suitable for UCLSE. This study develops an improved MCE-GIS method which could be more suitable for UCLSE based on urban complex ecological system theory and the summary of the shortcomings of traditional MCE-GIS. The improvements include three aspects: a composite evaluation index system rather than natural indexes alone, an index weight calculated by using fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method rather than the common AHP method, and the integrated overlay rule, which includes selecting the minimum value, weighted linear combination (WLC) and simple summation. The main advantage of this improved technique is that it can make UCLSE more comprehensive, more operational and more reasonable. It can provide a scientific basis for decision making in the planning and management of urban construction land use. The improved MCE-GIS system has been adopted in the New Hefei City, Anhui Province, China. Based on the results of UCLSE in New Hefei, three functional areas including construction-appropriate areas, construction-restricted areas and construction-forbidden areas could be worked out, in which 36.90% of the total study area could be developed as urban construction land and the remaining 63.10% should be protected as reserves land or as ecological land. Furthermore, the results can provide scientific decision support for spatial planning and eco-environment protection in New Hefei.";"Zhang, Xiaorui

"AGRIS:US201400189513";"Soil degradation and food security coupled with global climate change in northeastern China";"";"The northeastern China is an important commodity grain region in China, as well as a notable corn belt and major soybean producing area. It thus plays a significant role in the national food security system. However, large-scale land reclamation and non-optimum farming practices give rise to soil degradation in the region. This study analyzed the food security issues coupled with global climate change in the northeastern China during 1980–2000, which is the period of modern agriculture. The results of statistical data show that the arable land area shrank markedly in 1992, and then increased slowly, while food production generally continually increased. The stable grain yield was due to the increase of applied fertilizer and irrigated areas. Soil degradation in the northeastern China includes severe soil erosion, reduced soil nutrients, a thinner black soil layer, and deterioration of soil physical properties. The sustainable development of the northeastern China is influenced by natural-artificial binary disturbance factors which consist of meteorological conditions, climate changes, and terrain factors as well as soil physical and chemical properties. Interactions between the increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation in the region led to reduced accumulation of soil organic matter, which results in poor soil fertility. Human-induced factors, such as large-scale land reclamation and non-optimum farming practices, unsuitable cultivation systems, dredging, road building, illegal land occupation, and extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides, have led to increasingly severe soil erosion and destruction. Solutions to several problems of soil degradation in this region requiring urgent settlement are proposed. A need for clear and systematic recognition and recording of land use changes, land degradation, food production and climate change conditions is suggested, which would provide a reference for food security studies in the northeastern China.";"Gong, Huili

The spectral signatures of each land cover were extracted separately and then classified into clusters with the unsupervised classification method. Expert rules were finally used to modify the classified image. This research indicates that the hybrid approach employing sub-pixel information, an analyst's knowledge and characteristics of coastal wetland vegetation distribution shows promise in successfully distinguishing coastal vegetation classes, which are difficult to separate with a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC).

Farms as providers of biomass for electricity generation and small users of electricity are liable to benefit from the MRET scheme, with the extent of benefit depending on the price offered for biomass. By contrast, the CPRS is liable to more profoundly affect farming systems, especially if agriculture is included in the scheme. The impacts of the CPRS on agriculture are mostly conditional on: the amount of free permits allocated to agriculture, the value of trees as carbon sinks, the extent of pass-throughof CPRS-related costs onto agriculture and emission permit prices. Dependent on these factors, farm profits can increase by up to 20 percent or decrease by over 30 percent, relative to the ‘no CPRS’ or ‘business-as-usual’ case. If agriculture is covered by the CPRS, and emission permits and tree growth rates are sufficiently high then optimal farm plans typically involve a combination of reduced livestock numbers, the planting of permanent stands of trees on marginal farmland and other changes to the enterprise mix on farms that reduce emissions.";"Kingwell, Ross S.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-08-31";"en";"agriculture";"";"";"AUS";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016200483";"http://purl.umn.edu/97169";"";"";"";""

"AGRIS:US201400186731";"Eliciting expert knowledge to inform landscape modeling of conservation scenarios";"";"Conservation and land management organizations such as The Nature Conservancy are developing strategies to distribute conservation efforts over larger areas. Relative to fee-simple protection efforts, strategies that allow ecologically sustainable timber harvest and recreation activities, such as working forest conservation easements, should yield greater socioeconomic benefits (ecosystem services) with less investment per area without significantly compromising the conservation of biodiversity (ecological targets). At the same time, climate change may profoundly influence forest resilience to management strategies in the coming century. As a result, there are many possible scenarios for the future of our forests and significant uncertainty for practitioners and decision makers. Yet, monitoring efforts aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies span decades or longer, leading to a lag in knowledge transfer and delayed adaptive management. To explore potential outcomes for biodiversity, provisioning of ecosystem services, and resilience of our forests resulting from various management strategies and climate change projections, we developed an approach that integrates quantitative, spatially explicit landscape modeling with scenario-building informed by expert knowledge. In this paper, we present our experiences applying this approach to two conservation project areas in the western Great Lakes region of the U.S. For each project area, spatially explicit landscape simulations were performed using the VDDT©/TELSA© software suite (ESSA Technologies, Ltd.). At key points in the process, we infused the modeling efforts with expert knowledge via interactive in-person or web-based workshops and an online collaborative tool. Here, we capture our experiences applying the scenario building and modeling approach to forests in the western Great Lakes region and our efforts to make the process transparent and responsive to local and regional experts. It is our intent that this approach be transferable and implemented in future landscape scale conservation projects.";"Price, Jessica

Surface (0-0.15 m) soils from three land clearing methods (slash and burn, bulldozed non-windrowed and bulldozed windrowed) and each with two cropping systems (5-and 4-year cropping/2-year cassava fallow) were collected in the humid forest ecosystem of Nigeria. The soils were analysed for total C and N, microbial biomass C and N (SMB C and N), particulate organic matter C and N (POM C and N), water-soluble C, potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and mineral N. The size of the labile C and N and their relative contributions to the organic C and total N differed significantly among land clearing methods, irrespective of the cropping system. Soils under slash and burn had a significantly (p > 0.05) higher particulate organic matter C, N (10.80 and 0.16 g kg-1, respectively) and microbial biomass C and N (1.07 and 0.12 g kg-1) compared to the bulldozed windrow, regardless of the cropping system. Four years cropping/2-year cassava fallow resulted in a significant higher labile C and N, relative to 5-year cropped plots across the land clearing methods. Effect of the treatments on the concentration of PMN and mineral N mirrored the SMB N and POM N. However, the quantity of most of the labile C and N pool and crop yield obtained from the slash and burn and bulldozed non-windrowed treatment did not differ significantly. Hence, bulldozed non-windrowed clearing could be a viable alternative to slash and burn in the case of large-scale farming in ensuring reduced losses of soil organic matter and nutrient during land clearing in the humid tropics.";"Okore, I.K.

Plant cover and variety differ between the plots, being highest in the non-grazed to lowest in the over-grazed plots. A total of 19 AM fungal taxa belonging to six genera were found based on spores isolated from field samples and trap cultures. One belonged to Acaulospora, one to Archaeospora, one to Entrophospora, one to Gigaspora, 12 to Glomus and three to Scutellospora. Glomus was the dominant genus in all plots, and Glomus geosporum was the dominant species, whilst G. albidum and G. etunicatum were dominant in the restored plot. Scutellospora was the second dominant genus in the non-grazed plot with Scutellospora calospora being the dominant species. The mean spore density and mean species richness of AM fungi were significantly decreased by long-term over-grazing. The Sorenson's similarity coefficients of AM fungal community composition ranged from 0.5 to 0.64 among the three types of plot management. The results suggest that the AM fungal diversity is greatly affected by long-term over-grazing and that fencing of degraded areas partly restores plant cover and AM fungal diversity in grassland ecosystems.";"Su, Yuan-Ying

One of the stated purposes of these reforms was to remove ideology from both water management and electricity generation and ensure the neutrality of the state.

"AGRIS:US201400056928";"causes, effects and challenges of Sahelian droughts: a critical review";"";"This paper is a critical synthesis of the causes, effects and challenges of the Sahelian droughts. The results show that the four main causes of the Sahelian droughts are as follows: sea surface temperature changes, vegetation and land degradation, dust feedbacks and human-induced climate change. However, human-induced climate change is seen as the major drought-determining factor because it controls sea surface temperatures, dust feedbacks and vegetation degradation. Increase rainfall and greening have been observed in the Sahel since the 1990s; yet, food yields remain low while tree mortality rates are high. The implication of this is that the rainfall is not available for agriculture since various human-induced climate change processes such as deforestation and the expansions of arable farms do not make the moisture available for agriculture. The increase in tree mortality has also been found to increase atmospheric CO₂ in the study area. However, this study hypothesizes that the increase in CO₂ might be responsible for the increase in greening and rainfall observed. This can be explained by an increased aerial fertilization effect of CO₂ that triggers plant productivity and water management efficiency through reduced transpiration. Also, the increase greening can be attributed to rural–urban migration which reduces the pressure of the population on the land. The remittances from migrant urban workers may make farming more sustainable in the rural areas, thus enhancing greening. The principal challenges in overcoming the effects of the droughts are HIV/AIDS and Malaria, political instability, data availability, proliferation of extensive non-mechanized farms and lack of adequate observations.";"Epule, Epule Terence

"AGRIS:US201301906879";"approach to GIS-based multiple criteria decision analysis that integrates exploration and evaluation phases: Case study in a forest-dominated landscape";"";"The increasing importance and complexity of land and natural resource management are creating a need for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) combined with geographic information systems (GIS) can integrate factors related to the triple bottom line of ecological, economic, and social perspectives required by EBM. However, GIS-based MCDA is limited in this role because (i) it rarely integrates or encourages an exploration phase in preparation for structured evaluation and (ii) inexperienced users may find MCDA methods and GIS software difficult to use. This paper presents a novel approach for (i) supporting an exploration phase to help structure a problem and (ii) integrating the exploration and evaluation phases in an easy-to-use software system. The approach was validated through a land-management case study in a forest-dominated landscape with a variety of stakeholders. Case-study participants used the approach to rate areas within a timber harvest plan based on their potential for conflict with conservation values. The case-study decision analysis determined that between 1.3% and 6.6% of the harvest plan area had a conservation rating of 0.30 or higher on a scale of 0-1. The system was made available to the forest industry and other stakeholders to support harvest plan adjustments, demonstrating how such tools can be used to improve and integrate our knowledge of forest ecology and management. Assessment of participant feedback reveals that an exploration phase is effective in helping understand a problem and prepare for multiple criteria evaluation (MCE).";"Greene, Randal

How woody plants interact with rainfall to influence patterns of soil moisture through time, at different depths in the soil profile and between neighboring landscape patches is poorly known. In a semi-arid mesquite savanna, we deployed a paired array of sensors beneath a mesquite canopy and in an adjacent open area to measure volumetric soil water content (theta) every 30 min at several depths between 2004 and 2007. In addition, to quantify temporally dynamic variation in soil moisture between the two microsites and across soil depths we analysed theta time-series using fast Fourier transforms (FFT). FFT analyses were consistent with the prediction that by reducing evaporative losses through shade and reducing rainfall inputs through canopy interception of small rainfall events, the mesquite canopy was associated with a decline in high-frequency (hour-to-hour and day-to-day) variation in shallow theta. Finally, we found that, in both microsites, high-frequency theta variation declined with increasing soil depth as the influence of evaporative losses and inputs associated with smaller rainfall events declined. In this case, we argue that the buffering of shallow soil moisture against high-frequency variations can enhance nutrient cycling and alter the carbon cycle in dryland ecosystems.";"Potts, Daniel L.

"AGRIS:US201600072726";"Policy options to address global land use change from biofuels";"";"The use of biofuels can increase land competition, leading to global land use change (LUC). LUC poses risks such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and food prices. The magnitude of the risk is uncertain, but could be significant. Given these uncertainties and risks, we suggest that policymakers pursue a mix of the following three strategies: (1) promote feedstocks that rely less on land; (2) reduce LUC risk for land-using feedstocks; and (3) stimulate investments that increase land productivity and environmental protection. To realize these three strategies, we recommend that policymakers distinguish among feedstocks based on LUC risk; explore certifying production that avoids land competition; and adopt policy mechanisms that encourage investments in LUC-prone areas. We favor including feedstock-specific LUC emissions estimates in policies despite relatively large scientific uncertainty. While misleadingly precise, point estimates can be selected from science-based ranges to directly link LUC policy to emissions and provide strong transparent signals to biofuel investors. LUC emissions estimates can be updated regularly (∼3–5 years) to reflect improvements in scientific understanding, and global changes in policy and economic environments. With or without LUC emissions point estimates, additional policies, some outside the biofuel sector, will be needed to pursue the three strategies above.";"Witcover, Julie

This study quantifies the epistemic uncertainty in the species distribution modeling, which is generated by spatio-temporal gaps between the biogeographical data, model selection and model complexity. Epistemic uncertainty is generally given by the sum of subjective and objective uncertainty. The subjective uncertainty generated by the modeler-choice in the manipulation of the environmental variables was analyzed. The Snowy Plover in Florida (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus, SP), a residential shorebird whose geographic range is extended along the Panhandle-Big Bend-Peninsula Gulf coast was considered as case-study. The first fundamental step for studying the species distribution and how it will be affected by climate change is to obtain an accurate description of the shorebird coastal habitat. The land-cover was translated into ecosystem classes using a land-cover model that predicts the evolution of coastal ecosystems affected by sea-level rise scenarios. The best land-cover map decreased the objective uncertainty (intrinsically present in data or models) in representing the spatial structure of the coastal ecosystem, reduced the temporal gaps with the occurrence data, and diminished the subjective uncertainty due to the conversion from land-cover to model-classes. Multimodeling was performed to reduce the uncertainty in the prediction of the species distribution related to model uncertainty. The best representation of the species distribution was performed by MaxEnt. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the omission/commission test, the similarity index of the response curves, and the jackknife test were used simultaneously as indicators of the predictability of each species distribution model. The availability of updated high-resolution biogeoclimatological data was proven to be necessary in order to properly predict the species ranges for conservation purposes.";"Convertino, Matteo

Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and multitemporal comparison techniques (change vector analysis) were applied to estimate the long-term desertification/re-growing of vegetation cover over time and in space. Site-specific interactions between natural processes and human activity played a pivotal role in desertification. Over the last 21 years, desertification significantly prevailed over vegetation re-growth, particularly in areas around rural villages. Changes in land use and mismanagement of natural resources were the main driving factors affecting degradation. More than 120,000 km² were estimated as being subjected to a medium-high desertification rate. Conversely, the reforestation measures, adopted by the Government in the last decade and sustained by higher rainfall, resulted in low-medium re-growth conditions over an area of about 20,000 km². Site-specific strategies which take into account the interactions of the driving factors at local scale are thus necessary to combat desertification, avoiding any implementation of untargeted measures. In order to identify the soundest strategies, high-resolution tools must be applied. In this study the application of spectral mixture analysis to Landsat data appeared to be a consistent, accurate and low-cost technique to identify risk areas.";"Dawelbait, M.

"AGRIS:US201301845392";"Assessment of Land Conservation Patterns in Maine Based on Spatial Analysis of Ecological and Socioeconomic Indicators";"";"Given the nature of modern conservation acquisitions, which often result from gifts and opportunistic purchases of full or partial property rights, there is a risk that the resulting mosaic of conserved resources may not represent a coherent set of public values and benefits. With different public and private entities engaged in land conservation, one would further expect that each organization would apply separate goals and criteria to the selection and acquisition of its conservation portfolio. This set of circumstances raises an important question: what is the aggregate outcome of this land conservation process? Retrospective assessments provide a means of reviewing cumulative historical decisions and elucidating lessons for improving future conservation strategies. This study used GIS-based spatial analysis to examine the relationships of private and public conservation lands in Maine to a variety of landscape metrics in order to determine the degree to which these lands represent core ecological and socioeconomic values that are meaningful to a wide cross-section of citizens. Results revealed that the gains of past conservation efforts in Maine are counter-balanced to some extent by apparent gaps in the existing fabric of conservation holdings. Conservation lands capture a representative sample of diverse habitat, provide a large measure of protection for multiple conservation values and indicators, and offer an unusual mix of outdoor recreational opportunities for residents and visitors alike. Yet, the majority of parcels are relatively small and isolated, and thus do not provide contiguous habitat blocks that offset ongoing processes of landscape fragmentation. Furthermore, the majority of area associated with many of the ecological metrics examined in this report is located outside the boundaries of current conservation holdings. The under-represented metrics identified in this investigation can be viewed as potential targets for new strategic conservation initiatives.";"Cronan, Christopher S.

With the exponential growth in urban areas over the past three decades, changes in land use and land cover to cater for the growth of cities has been a conspicuous spectacle in urban spaces. The main goal of this study was to assess the impacts of land cover change on runoff and surface water quality using a partial area hydrology framework. The study employed ArcHydro GIS extension and a modified version of Long-Term Hydrologic and Nonpoint Source Pollution model (L-THIA-NPS) in estimating runoff and nonpoint source pollutant concentration around Lake Calumet between 1992 and 2001. Data employed include National Land Cover Data set, rainfall data, digital elevation model (DEM), Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data, and The United States Environmental Protection Agency's STORET (storage and retrieval) water quality data. The model was able to predict surface water quality reasonably well over the study period. Sensitivity analysis facilitated a manual calibration of the model. Model validation was executed by comparing simulated results following calibration and observed water quality data for the study area. The study demonstrates that the level of concentration of nonpoint source pollutants in surface water within an urban watershed heavily depends on the spatiotemporal variations in areas that contribute towards runoff compared to the spatial extent of change in major land use/land cover.";"Wilson, Cyril

There was marked the increased understanding of land use planning problems in the context of increasing its intensity and important problem of stable development of rural areas in modern world. There were established the problems of increasing ecological-economic efficiency of land use. It was also established that efficient land relations should provide a balance between preserving natural resources potential, including land, and progressive social-economic development of society. It was shown that the economic conception has considerably transformed the views on the land as the most important natural factor of development of society. Progress of views on land resources was transforming from recognition them as almost single source of national wealth which needs to be operated intensively, up to their multilateral consideration not only as a source of development of such key branch as agriculture but also as the most important object of steady environmental management.";"Gridyushko, A.N., Belarus State Academy of Agriculture, Gorki (Belarus)";"";"";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"ru";"land use;land policies;land economics";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Land Use, Management & Investment";"BLR";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=BY2013000449";"http://elc.baa.by/vestnik2013-1/%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%E2%84%9612013%D0%B3.rar";"";"";"";"16-23"

"AGRIS:US201301600702";"Common waters and private lands: Distributional impacts of floodplain aquaculture in Bangladesh";"";"Aquaculture continues to diversify and develop rapidly in Bangladesh. A major change has taken place in parts of Bangladesh due to the growth of floodplain aquaculture (FPA) projects. FPA involves the enclosure by the landholders of parts of the floodplain through the creation of embankments and sluice gates. The enclosed water body is stocked with fish seed and the benefits are distributed amongst those who own land in the impounded area. This study has found that FPA tends to exclude a large number of poor households and adversely affects them through the attenuation of their common property rights over the floodplains, besides skewing the distribution of benefits amongst those who directly benefit from it. They have been further marginalised in project institutions that are captured by rural elites. This paper suggests a more precautionary approach to the growth of the FPA and compensation to, or inclusion of the losers.";"Toufique, Kazi Ali

However, a paucity of information exists that is specific to public perceptions of smoke. This study used conjoint analysis, a multivariate technique, to evaluate how four situational factors (i.e., smoke origin, smoke duration, health impact, and advanced warning) influence public tolerance of smoke in the northern Rocky Mountains and south-central United States. Separate analyses were performed for subgroups, based on community type, level of fire preparedness, demographics, and smoke experience, to explore potential differences among managerially relevant populations. Origin of the smoke and advanced public warning were commonly the most important factors influencing public tolerance of smoke. A comparison of our conjoint approach with a univariate rating technique is also discussed. Findings from this research will help fire managers understand public tolerance of smoke from forest fires, inform forest management, and enhance public communication strategies.";"Blades, Jarod J.

In a long-term experiment (1992-2008) we examined the effects of various tillage intensities: no-tillage (NT), minimum tillage with chisel plow (MT), and conventional tillage with mouldboard plow (CT), on the topsoil profile distribution (0-30cm) of SOC, on a semi-arid loamy soil from Central Spain. The crop sequence established was cheap pea (Cicer arietinun L.) cv. Inmaculada/barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Volley. Soil organic carbon in the various tillage treatments was expressed on a content bases and the equivalent soil mass approach. Measurements made at the end of 17 years showed that in the 0-30cm depth, stocks of SOC had increased under NT compared with MT and CT. Most dramatic changes occurred within the 0-5cm layer where plots under NT had 5.8 and 7.6Mgha⁻¹ more SOC than under MT or CT respectively. No-tillage plots, however, exhibited strong vertical gradients of SOC with concentrations decreasing from 0-5 to 20-30cm. Stratification ratios of SOC in 1992 showed no significant differences between tillage systems. On the contrary, from 1993 onwards all stratification ratios were significantly higher in NT than in the other two tillage systems. In addition, since 2003 stratification ratios of SOC obtained under NT were systematically >2 and more than 2-fold those obtained under MT and CT. Stratification ratios >2 are uncommon under degraded conditions and could suggest that NT management system may have the most benefits to soil quality in semi arid regions with low native soil organic matter.";"López-Fando, C.

"AGRIS:US2016206505";"Embedding Landfill Diversion in Economic, Geographical and Policy Settings Panel based evidence from Italy";"";"This paper analyses the process of delinking for landfilling trends embedding the dynamics in a frame where economic, geographical and policy variables enter the arena We aim at investigating in depth what main drivers may be responsible for such a phenomenon, and whether differences may be observed focusing the lens on a decentralised provincial based setting. We exploit a rich panel dataset stemming from Official sources (APAT, Italian environmental agency) merged with other provincial and regional based information, covering all the 103 Italian provinces over 1999-2005. The case study on Italy is worth being considered given that Italy is a main country in the EU. Thus it offers important pieces on information on the evaluation of policies. Evidence shows that the observed decoupling between economic growth and landfilling is driven by a mix of structural factors, as population density and other waste management opportunity: local opportunity costs and landfill externalities matter in shaping waste policies and local commitment to landfill diversion. But not only structural factors are relevant. If on the one hand landfill taxation is a significant driver of the phenomenon, even at the more coherent regional level, where the tax is implemented, waste management instruments, when we exploit the provincial dataset, are associated to high significant negative effect on landfilled waste. A good performance on managing waste according to economic rationales helps reducing the amount that is landfilled. In association to the features of the tariff system, we also underline the key role played by the share of separated collection. Both the evolution of collection and tariff system are joint factors that may drive a wedge between the comparative waste performances of northern and southern regions. We finally note that lock in effects linked to the intensity of incinerator sites in the area are relevant for landfilling: past investments in incineration lock in the region in this technological path, which may be associated to less opportunity cost and lower external effects. Summing up, landfill diversion is stronger where the economic cost deriving from high population density, a structural factor, are higher, and waste management collection systems and economic instruments are associated with higher performances.";"Mazzanti, Massimiliano

"AGRIS:US201500200074";"integrated approach to modelling land-use change on continental and global scales";"";"Land-use and land-cover change are important drivers of global environmental change, affecting the state of biodiversity, the global carbon cycle, and other aspects of the earth system. In this article we describe the development of the land-use model LandSHIFT, which aims to simulate land-use and land-cover change on the continental and global scale. The model is based on a “land-use systems” approach, which describes the interplay between anthropogenic and environmental system components as drivers of land-use change. LandSHIFT’s modular structure facilitates the integration of different components that cover key parts of land-use systems. The model prototype combines a module for the simulation of land-use change dynamics with a module for calculating crop yields and net primary productivity of grassland. LandSHIFT is driven by country-level model inputs including time-series of socio-economic variables as well as agricultural production data. This information is regionalized to land-use grid maps with a cell size of 5 arc-minutes. Here, the model clearly differentiates between the land-use activities settlement, crop cultivation and grazing. By using standardized input–output formats, LandSHIFT can be combined with other models for conducting complex simulation studies.";"Schaldach, Rüdiger

"AGRIS:US201500200073";"integrative model of human-influenced fire regimes and landscape dynamics";"";"Fire regimes depend on climate, vegetation structure and human influences. Climate determines the water content in fuel and, in the longer term, the amount of biomass. Humans alter fire regimes through increased ignition frequency and by hindering the spread of fire through fire suppression and fuel fragmentation. Here, we present FIRE LADY (FIre REgime and LAndscape DYnamics), a spatially explicit fire regime model that takes into account daily weather data, topography, vegetation growth, fire behaviour, fire suppression and land use changes. In this model, vegetation growth depends on water availability, and stem diameter and stand density are the fundamental parameters. Fire behaviour is modelled using the Rothermel equations and taking into account both crown fire and spotting. Human influences on fire regime, such as ignition frequency, fire suppression and land use changes, are explicitly modelled. The model was calibrated for three regions in NE Spain and reproduces fire regimes, changes in land cover distribution and tree biomass with promising accuracy. The explicit modelling of human influences makes the model a useful and unique tool for assessing the impacts of climate change and informing local fire regime management strategies.";"Loepfe, Lasse

The study encompasses 21 river basins with 32 000 Km² area, located in the Chugoku district in West Japan. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Suspended Solid (SS), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP) were considered as water quality variables of the stream. Satellite data was used to generate the land cover map of the study area. MLR models were developed using the compositional (%) and spatial attributes (landscape metrics) of the land cover at watershed and class levels for representing the land cover-stream water quality linkage. The results of the MLR modeling using the land cover data at the class level revealed that 92%, 74% and 62% of the total variations in concentration of DO, pH and TP were explained by changes in the measure of the spatial attributes of the land cover at the class level in the study area.

Leakage is lowest in remote and poorly integrated localities where declining wages foster local food production while discouraging consumption. Since leakage is tied to consumption, there is a trade-off between the program’s effectiveness and an equitable outcome. • CONCLUSION : An ideal strategy could target those localities with few remaining forests, where a program might lead to agricultural intensification rather than expanding the agricultural frontier. Alternatively, the scheme could incorporate remaining forests to avoid deforestation while encouraging reforestation. An uneven distribution of costs and benefits, where some stakeholders may draw benefits from others’ losses, could nevertheless set the stage for conflict. Acknowledging these trade-offs should help design a politically feasible program that is effective, efficient, and equitable.";"Dyer, George A.

"AGRIS:US201400104348";"Stakeholders’ Responses to the Use of Innovative Water Trading Systems in East Anglia, England";"";"It is widely recognised that the current abstraction licensing system in England needs to be reformed to meet the challenges of future environmental flow requirements, likely increases in water demands and climate change. The UK Government has committed to the reform of the abstraction regime in England and work is underway, including the Welsh Government, to assess the impacts of different reform options, working closely with stakeholders. International experience reveals that the complexity of water management at a national level lends itself to common principles but ultimately that local solutions are required at a catchment-level to manage such challenges. Historically the number of abstraction licences traded in England is negligible. In the future the trading of abstraction licences and derivative water rights, for example water quotas, could play a key role in improving water use efficiency. This paper describes research that was carried out to add to this evidence base in the Upper Ouse and Bedford Ouse catchment in East Anglia with a number of stakeholders to document their response to two innovative water trading systems which have been termed “improved pair-wise” trading and the “common pool” approach. Improved pair-wise trading would allow for a hierarchy of types of short-term abstraction licence trades. Some trades between specific points in a catchment might be pre-approved if the risks to the environment were deemed acceptable. The common pool approach is based on the trading of water quotas, using “smart market” methods, which enable economic optimisation of market outcomes based on abstractors’ bids subject to realistic hydrological constraints. This method would allow all abstractors to bid into a common pool on a weekly basis to obtain their water. Both methods were demonstrated via two workshops to investigate the barriers and facilitators to water trading in practice. Participants were cautiously interested in the benefits offered by both methods, especially the ability to trade water at short notice. However, for these trading methods to play a key role in the reform of abstraction licensing the abstractors must have sufficient confidence that the underlying methods are sufficiently equitable, reliable and accurate.";"Lumbroso, D.

This study employed multivariate factorial kriging (MFK) to determine the multiscale changes in the distribution of five commonly observed bird species to urban environmental change. Areas of metropolitan Taipei were analyzed to determine the extent and effect of land cover. A digital elevation model and normalized difference vegetation index were also constructed. Spatial patterns of variation in bird populations were analyzed by MFK at a regional scale (16 km) and local scale (2 km). Comparison of MFK results with those obtained by conventional principal component analysis (PCA) and correspondence analysis (CA) showed that the conventional PCA results were comparable to the MFK results at the local scale, and the CA results were comparable to MFK results at the regional scale. The MFK indicated that local-scale variation accounts for a larger proportion of the total variation than regional-scale variation, and local-scale variation is affected by more factors than regional scale variation. The MFK results also showed that heterogeneous elevation exerts a geographical influence on bird populations at the regional scale whereas the land cover of urban meadows in densely populated urban areas of Taipei exerts a local influence. The suburban trees and meadows in belt regions between suburbs have local and regional influences on bird distributions, respectively. The spatial patterns of bird populations in response to urban environments can be adequately explained by their diet categories and body sizes. The MFK, which simultaneously provides descriptive variations and spatial patterns in species at determinate scales, facilitates environmental interpretations of ordination results and identification of determinants for conservation efforts at multiple scales.";"Lin, Yun-Bin

In the United States, a consistent, seamless irrigated agricultural lands map was not available until the development of the 250-m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) irrigated agriculture data-set (MIrAD), which was developed from time-series MODIS normalized difference vegetation index, county-level crop area statistics, and land use/land cover (LULC) data using an automated county-level classification approach. This study performed a detailed multi-scale assessment of the MIrAD over the state of Nebraska, which is extensively irrigated, to determine the thematic accuracy of classified irrigation patterns at various spatial scales (i.e., landscape, field, and subfield) and over various crop types. The MIrAD was found to map comparable irrigated cropland patterns to a Landsat-derived LULC map (82% pixel-level thematic agreement) over Nebraska, with most areas of disagreement occurring in transitional mixed pixel locations between adjacent LULC types. Classification accuracy was found to have little variation by general field size and crop type, but accuracies were lower for pixel locations at the field’s edges.

Salt marshes are complex ecosystems that are not well mapped and understood. This research was conducted to assess the potential of high-spatial and high-spectral resolution satellite data to map and monitor salt-marsh vegetation communities of Micalo Island of New South Wales, Australia. The aim of the study was to determine whether different salt-marsh vegetation species could be differentiated using high-spectral and high-spatial resolution imagery and whether these could be linked to wetland condition. To compare sensor capabilities in discriminating salt-marsh vegetation, high-spatial data sets from Quickbird and high-spectral data sets from Hyperion were used. A hybrid unsupervised and supervised classification procedure was used to assess the wetland mapping potential of the Quickbird and Hyperion data. The supervised classification results had greater overall and within-class accuracies and showed greater promise. Most of the vegetation species were identified and mapped correctly. One area of concern was the misclassification of Sporobolus into grass categories while using Quickbird imagery, mainly where the Sporobolus was tall and dry. They look very similar to the tall reedy grass. The mapping results can be useful in establishing baseline information for subsequent studies involving change detection of salt-marsh ecosystems.";"Kumar, Lalit

Socio Bosque consists of the transfer of a direct monetary incentive per hectare of native forest and other native ecosystems to individual landowners and local and indigenous communities who protect these ecosystems, through voluntary conservation agreements that are monitored on a regular basis for compliance. Two years after its creation, the program now includes more than half a million hectares of natural ecosystems and has over 60,000 beneficiaries. The characteristics of Socio Bosque make it a good example of a national conservation agreement scheme from which important lessons can be drawn: it is part of a clear government policy, combines ecosystem conservation with poverty alleviation, incentivizes and monitors local socio-economic investment, is transparent and straightforward, and has generated nation-wide participation of local and indigenous communities and farmer households. Socio Bosque furthermore sheds light on how benefit sharing mechanisms for national REDD+ strategies could work in practice.";"de Koning, Free

"AGRIS:US2016202087";"Is Posner's  Principle of Justice an Adequate Basis for Environmental Law?";"";"Posner adopted the economic principle of wealth maximization as a guiding principle for the dispensation of justice. This resulted in his endorsing the Kaldor-Hicks principle (also known as the potential Paretian improvement principle) as a basis for just laws. This article explores whether this principle is an adequate basis for environmental law. As can be deduced from Fleming, the legal approach adopted by Posner is by no means new because early British tort law was applied in a manner intended to foster economic growth. Nevertheless, the wealth maximization principle is not adequate as a basis for just environmental laws because for one thing it ignores questions involving changes in income distribution. Consequently, Rawls’ principle of justice is examined and compared with that of Posner. The role of property rights in relation to the state of the environment is assessed in the light of Posner’s principle of justice, as is Coase’s theorem supporting a clear definite allocation of private property rights as a solution to environmental problems. Furthermore, in this context, the justification for the taking of private property by the state is examined. It is argued that additional factors to wealth maximization and income distribution must be taken into account in determining whether laws are just. In addition, it is suggested that it is not the sole purpose of the law to dispense justice.";"Tisdell, Clement A.";"";"";"AGRIS";"2009-06-31";"en";"property rights";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Policy Papers & Briefs";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016202087";"http://purl.umn.edu/55337";"";"";"";""

Farmers of the region have traditionally produced maize and pulses for subsistence and vegetables and timber as cash crops. Different pasture and forest fallow rotations are used along catena production sites. The system is labour-intensive and uses animal traction. LP problems were formulated and solved for a baseline land-use alternative, improved diet alternative and maximal timber production alternative. All three problem formulations included constraints that guaranteed sufficient food and firewood production and sufficient pasture area for animals while being feasible in terms of human labour and animal traction consumption. Of the alternative production systems, cash crops with forest fallow had the highest land expectation value (LEV), while cereals under short grazing fallow showed even negative LEVs. Changing the diet by diversifying carbohydrate and protein sources increased LEV and reduced the need for women labour during the peak season. When timber production was maximised the optimal share of land devoted to pure forestry was 57%, and less labour was required.";"Delgado-Matas, Cristobal

First, it ranks environmental performance per 25 administrative districts based on multidimensional clustering of 10 diagnostic indicators. Second, it examines land-use and land-cover (LULC) patterns in nine western administrative districts by classifying Landsat imagery and quantifying surface disturbance for the year 2001. Spatial analysis and descriptive statistics help identify the most disturbed administrative units. Findings from the diagnostic indicators suggest that older fields in the western units showed the greatest amount of disturbance due to the age of the fields and related infrastructure, lack of maintenance, and the use of older technologies. These fields were also linked to declining production. Operations in the middle zone, which were younger, showed fewer disturbances, while the youngest southern fields showed the least. Findings from the landscape study showed that agricultural activity is a major driver of LULC patterns in the western region, with oil and gas activities serving a much smaller role. Methods and findings can be applied toward making extractive activities more sustainable during the various phases of expansion, new development and reclamation.";"Mjachina, Ksenya V.

Over a total area of about 7000 m2, detailed measurements of woody biomass were conducted using structural information such as diameter at breast height (dbh), total height, and stem height. At the same time, the wet weight of herbaceous, shrubs, and litter was registered within that area. Soil samples were also collected to determine parameters such as bulk density and organic carbon. The above-ground tree biomass (AGB) was quantified by two non-destructive methods. This biomass was expressed from each reservoir studied in t.ha−1 and the carbon content was then calculated using a factor of 0.5. Carbon stocks in the ecosystems studied were 162, 92, and 48 tC.ha−1 for Yungas, Chaco, and shrublands, respectively. Our results show that carbon is concentrated in the soil or as AGB. The latter is the most important reservoir in Yungas, while the soil plays this role in the other two, drier environments. In the province of Salta, native forests play a significant role in the mitigation of greenhouse gases. Our results reveal the magnitude of carbon stocks in some characteristic regional native forests, and estimate their carbon sequestration potential. These results could be useful to inform policy makers in charge of negotiations related to conservation and sustainable management of native forests, and be a relevant input for the formulation of more comprehensive land use planning processes in the region.";"Manrique, Silvina

This has stimulated a rapid growth in research investigating the links between land-cover change and biotic interactions, but to date no study has evaluated the progress towards achieving this scientific goal. With the aim of identifying gaps in current knowledge and challenging research areas for the future, we reviewed the scientific literature published during the last decade (1998–2010) investigating land-cover change effects on trophically-mediated biotic interactions. Our results reveal a disproportionate focus on particular trophic interactions and ecosystem types. Furthermore, in most cases, the measurement of trophic interactions is carried out neglecting the identity of the interacting species and the interrelation between the type of land-cover change effects. Finally, inappropriate temporal scales are applied to cope with spatiotemporal resource fluctuations for the interacting species. We suggest that the ongoing patterns and trends of research hamper efforts to achieve a truly comprehensive understanding of the effects of land-cover alterations on trophic interactions, and hence on ecosystem functioning in human-impacted landscapes. We therefore recommend alternative research trends and indicate gaps in current knowledge that need to be filled. Furthermore, we highlight that these biases could also limit the effectiveness of management actions aimed at ensuring the resilience and long-term conservation of natural habitats worldwide.";"Herrera, José M.

"AGRIS:US201500217478";"impact of mediterranean land degradation on agricultural income: A short-term scenario";"";"The present study estimates the potential costs of land degradation (LD) in agriculture at the national scale in Italy during 2000–2006 and provides a medium-term scenario for 2015 based on changes in climate conditions and human pressure. According to the user cost approach, a depletion factor (S) to agricultural income has been derived from the observed changes in a composite index of land sensitivity to degradation. Based on S figures, the investigated area has been classified into five risk categories from ‘negligible’ to ‘high’. Surface land classified as ‘high LD risk’ increased slightly from 1.1 per cent in 2000 to 4.4 per cent in 2006 ranging from 2.9 to 8.6 per cent in 2015. Eleven indicators have been used to identify the socioeconomic conditions which possibly discriminate districts in ‘high’ and ‘low’ LD risk in agriculture. The gap in LD risk observed in 2000 between developed and disadvantaged regions in Italy reduced significantly in 2006. This suggests that agriculture is sensitive to LD in both economically marginal and affluent areas where climate and soil conditions are turning towards the worse. These results support strategies improving sustainable agriculture–environment relationships and protecting the soil resource base at the local scale.";"Salvati, Luca

This paper presents a multi-criteria spatial decision analysis approach using geographic information system (GIS) technique for evaluating the suitability of rural buildings site selection with a case study in Hervás (northern Extremadura region), Spain. The aim of the methodology is to evaluate the suitability of the study region in order to optimally site a new single dispersed tourism-related commercial building with landscapes. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to generate the alternative decisions using the multi-criteria evaluation techniques standardised by fuzzy membership functions. The parameters are categorised into three criteria groups, namely physical, environmental and economic criteria and then the weights are verified by a group discussion with the experts for final weight consensus making them more objective. With the aid of the simple additive weighting (SAW) method, the calculation of final grading values in multiple criteria problem is evaluated for the study region. The resulting land suitability is reported on a grading scale of 0–10, which is, respectively, from least to most suitable areas. Combination of a spatial clustering process reveals the most suitable areas for rural buildings siting with their landscapes. The proposed methodology is intended to solve the rural building integration problem with its landscape and to facilitate the flexible methodology implementation from decision alternatives involved in the decision making process.";"Jeong, Jin Su

This paper evaluates a new government-led scheme in Wales, which is intended to increase woodland cover from 14% to 20% by 2030 to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. As the scheme is primarily intended to promote woodland creation on farms, the analysis of the paper focusses upon the question of how to incentivise farmers, and the reasons why difficulties have been experienced engaging land owners in the scheme. Whilst a number of recommendations are made from this policy evaluation, the paper also demonstrates that key lessons have not been applied from existing literature on farmers’ behaviour and environmental scheme uptake, and that policy makers are not integrating practice across departmental divisions. As such, the paper suggests that the new focus on carbon sequestration has acted as a distraction to the development of a more robust governance strategy that builds on previous successes and failures in agri-environment policy.";"Wynne-Jones, S.";"";"Elsevier";"AGRIS";"2013-12-31";"en";"climate change;land ownership;farmers";"Land, Climate change & Environment";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201500217471";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2012.10.012";"";"";"";"250-260"
"AGRIS:US201300738027";"Challenges to estimating carbon emissions from tropical deforestation";"";"An accurate estimate of carbon fluxes associated with tropical deforestation from the last two decades is needed to balance the global carbon budget. Several studies have already estimated carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, but the estimates vary greatly and are difficult to compare due to differences in data sources, assumptions, and methodologies. In this paper, we review the different estimates and datasets, and the various challenges associated with comparing them and with accurately estimating carbon emissions from deforestation. We performed a simulation study over legal Amazonia to illustrate some of these major issues. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of considering land-cover dynamics following deforestation, including the fluxes from reclearing of secondary vegetation, the decay of product and slash pools, and the fluxes from regrowing forest. It also suggests that accurate carbon-flux estimates will need to consider historical land-cover changes for at least the previous 20 years. However, this result is highly sensitive to estimates of the partitioning of cleared carbon into instantaneous burning vs. long-timescale slash pools. We also show that carbon flux estimates based on 'committed flux' calculations, as used by a few studies, are not comparable with the 'annual balance' calculation method used by other studies.";"RAMANKUTTY, NAVIN

This agreement signalled a major policy change in the region by increasing the protection of old growth forests from 9% to 33% of the total planning area and by promoting more environmentally friendly logging practices though the establishment of ecosystem-based management. It also gave rise to new land use planning relationships between the Province and First Nations. Our analysis shows that ‘success’ in reaching agreement in land use conflicts can be better understood when political science's work on policy regimes and their background conditions is combined with planning theory's work on deliberative processes. We suggest that collaborative planning theory can complement the policy regime approach by highlighting how process design and the interactions that occur within policy arenas provide the physical and organisational spaces for dialogue, collaboration and policy change. The policy regime approach, on the other hand, helps draws attention to the dynamics of policy processes and consequent changes in governance relations that motivate actors to work together, instead of against each other.";"Saarikoski, Heli

"AGRIS:US201500217474";"Contested institutions? Traditional leaders and land access and control in communal areas of Eastern Cape Province, South Africa";"";"The South African government has endeavoured to strengthen property rights in communal areas and develop civil society institutions for community-led development and natural resource management. However, the effectiveness of this remains unclear as the emergence and operation of civil society institutions in these areas is potentially constrained by the persistence of traditional authorities. Focusing on the former Transkei region of Eastern Cape Province, three case study communities are used examine the extent to which local institutions overlap in issues of land access and control. Within these communities, traditional leaders (chiefs and headmen) continue to exercise complete and sole authority over land allocation and use this to entrench their own positions. However, in the absence of effective state support, traditional authorities have only limited power over how land is used and in enforcing land rights, particularly over communal resources such as rangeland. This diminishes their local legitimacy and encourages some groups to contest their authority by cutting fences, ignoring collective grazing decisions and refusing to pay ‘fees’ levied on them. They are encouraged in such activities by the presence of democratically elected local civil society institutions such as ward councillors and farmers’ organisations, which have broad appeal and are increasingly responsible for much of the agrarian development that takes place, despite having no direct mandate over land. Where it occurs at all, interaction between these different institutions is generally restricted to approval being required from traditional leaders for land allocated to development projects. On this basis it is argued that a more radical approach to land reform in communal areas is required, which transfers all powers over land to elected and accountable local institutions and integrates land allocation, land management and agrarian development more effectively.";"Bennett, James

"AGRIS:US201500217385";"Maintaining the contract responsibility system of forest land distribution in China: Evidence from a novel financial compensation scheme in Daxi Village of Anji County, Zhejiang";"";"Guaranteeing households’ equal access to land has long been advocated as paramount to implement development policies in Rural China. Given the chronic land scarcity in densely populated regions of China, finding a compromise between private and collective land rights has been important to protect livelihood safety nets and to address poverty issues in rural areas, especially in the initial stages of reform. In this sense, land reallocations in a context of demographic changes within households used to be a common practice in the agricultural sector as a way to protect the equal-per-capita land access right, whereas other mechanisms were required for longer-rotation forest resources. In this case study, we present the Inter-household Forest Compensation Scheme (IFCS), a local innovation in forest management that originated spontaneously in Anji county, in which households that have gained disproportionately large per capita forest resources due to a decrease in household members compensate households that have smaller per capita endowments due to expanding household size. Based on field interviews and household and village socioeconomic data from Daxi village, we analyze the effects of population, economic, household and opinion dynamics on the IFCS as well as its evolution and implementation problems. The compensation, which represents between 7% and 9% of household forest income and less than 2% of current total household income, has allowed for a significant increase in land productivity. The IFCS has proven to be an effective instrument to adjust a system based on a per-capita land allocation without resorting to potentially unsustainable forest reallocations, thus achieving a valuable compromise between equity and efficiency during a major transition from a planned to market economy. Increased population, off-farm income growth and differences in household structure bring new challenges to the policy.";"Gutiérrez Rodríguez, Lucas

"AGRIS:US201500217387";"Territorialisation and marginalisation in the forested landscapes of Orissa, India";"";"Internal territorialisation or the formalisation of forest rights has led to increased state ownership in many countries, often ignoring traditional or customary tenure and land use. Because of its roots in a formal government process, the disjuncture between formal rights and local practices may be seen as unproblematic to policymakers, even though it harms the livelihoods of marginalised forest dwellers. In India in 2006, this situation was sought to be addressed by the passage of the Forest Rights Act, which acknowledged the injustices of the territorialisation process and aimed to restore some rights over forest use to forest-dwelling people. In this paper we examine the history of the territorialisation process in forested areas in the state of Orissa, India, and its implications for local inhabitants’ land rights and livelihoods. We use archival research and case studies to examine how imposition of formal land tenure in forested areas failed to recognise rights and led to exclusion, contestation and conflict. The archival research and the case studies were among the evidence presented in the Indian Parliament in support of passage of the 2006 law. They demonstrate the important role that researchers can play in the political process through careful documentation targeted at policymakers.";"Kumar, Kundan

The goal of our study was to identify the determinants of agricultural land abandonment in post-Soviet Russia during the first decade of transition from a state-controlled economy to a market-driven economy (1990–2000). We analyzed the determinants of agricultural land abandonment for approximately 150,550km² of land area in the provinces (oblasts) of Kaluga, Rjazan, Smolensk, Tula and Vladimir in European Russia. Based on the economic assumptions of profit maximization, we integrated maps of abandoned agricultural land from five ∼185km×185km Landsat TM/ETM+ footprints with socio-economic, environmental and geographic variables, and we estimated logistic regressions at the pixel level to identify the determinants of agricultural land abandonment. Our results showed that a higher likelihood of agricultural land abandonment was significantly associated with lower average grain yields in the late 1980s and with higher distances from the nearest settlements, municipality centers, and settlements with more than 500 citizens. Hierarchical partitioning showed that the average grain yields in the late 1980s had the greatest power to explain agricultural land abandonment in our models, followed by the locational attributes of the agricultural land. We hypothesize that the termination of 90% of state subsidies for agriculture from 1990 to 2000 was an important underlying cause for the decrease of cultivation in economically and environmentally marginal agriculture areas. Thus, whereas the spatial patterns corresponded to the land rent theory of von Thünen, it was primarily the macro-scale driving forces that fostered agricultural abandonment. Our study highlighted the value of spatially explicit statistical models for studying the determinants of land-use and land-cover change in large areas.";"Prishchepov, Alexander V.

We examined how native and invasive species occurring in arid coastal sage scrub communities in southern California responded to water and high-light stress. We also examined how plants responded to irrigation following short-term water stress. While species responded differently to water and light treatments, no general pattern emerged between native and invasive species. Photosynthetic function of Ricinus communis (invasive) and Salvia mellifera (native) was most robust to water stress and most responsive to irrigation following water stress. Leaf transpiration data suggested that Ricinus and Salvia maintained photosynthetic function by high water use efficiency rather than higher water status via large root biomass. Brassica nigra (invasive) and Encelia californica (native) were more resistant to photoinhibition in response to high-light stress than Ricinus, Salvia, Artemesia californica (native) or Nicotiana glauca (invasive). Our data suggest that native and invasive species in these arid systems display a range of physiological responses to stress and that strategies for invasive species control or native ecosystem restoration based on plant responses to stress may require species-specific approaches.";"Funk, Jennifer L.

"AGRIS:US201500217383";"On recognizing land administration as critical, public good infrastructure";"";"Failure to recognize land administration systems as infrastructure creates potential funding and maintenance problems. Wider economic, social, and environmental benefits of effective land administration are consequently put at risk. Land administration must be recognized as critical, public good infrastructure. An evaluation method for testing land administration as an infrastructure is developed and applied. The method utilizes tools for defining and classifying infrastructure, public goods, and critical infrastructures. Arguments for land administration as infrastructure are revealed to reside within the land administration discipline: mainstream views regularly fail to recognize the argument. Reasons include the internal focus of scientific disciplines, the failure of land administrators to engage across disciplines, the global disparity of approaches to land administration, and the lack of visible or physical presence for land administration infrastructure. The results of three empirical studies support the notion that land administration is a critical, public good infrastructure. It concluded that infrastructure funding and maintenance regimes need to be depoliticized, potentially through the development of evidence based metrics, that land administrators must continue to promote land administration outwardly, and that the evaluation approach be extended and enhanced for use in directed land administration projects and studies.";"Bennett, Rohan

Inputs included remotely-sensed 1992 reflectance data and land-cover map (University of Maryland) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and 2001 products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 1-km resolution for the region; and 30-m resolution land-cover maps from the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) for a subarea to conduct nine simulations to address our questions. Sensitivity analysis showed that (1) AVHRR data tended to underestimate AGB density by 11%, on average, compared to that estimated using MODIS data; (2) regional mean AGB density increased slightly from 124 (1992) to 126 Mg ha⁻¹ (2001) by 1.6%; (3) a substantial decrease in total forest AGB across the region was detected, from 2,507 (1992) to 1,961 Tg (2001), an annual rate of -2.4%; and (4) in the subarea, while NLCD-based estimates suggested a 26% decrease in total AGB from 1992 to 2001, AVHRR/MODIS-based estimates indicated a 36% increase. The major source of uncertainty in change detection of total forest AGB over large areas was due to area differences from using land-cover maps produced by different sources. Scaling up 30-m land-cover map to 1-km resolution caused a mean difference of 8% (in absolute value) in forest area estimates at the county-level ranging from 0 to 17% within a 95% confidence interval.";"Zheng, Daolan

Oil-palm expansion contributes to biodiversity declines and carbon emissions in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitudes of these impacts remain largely unquantified until now. We produce a 250-m spatial resolution map of closed canopy oil-palm plantations in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia (2 million ha), Borneo (2.4 million ha), and Sumatra (3.9 million ha). We demonstrate that 6% (or [almost equal to]880,000 ha) of tropical peatlands in the region had been converted to oil-palm plantations by the early 2000s. Conversion of peatswamp forests to oil palm led to biodiversity declines of 1% in Borneo (equivalent to four species of forest-dwelling birds), 3.4% in Sumatra (16 species), and 12.1% in Peninsular Malaysia (46 species). This land-use change also contributed to the loss of [almost equal to]140 million Mg of aboveground biomass carbon, and annual emissions of [almost equal to]4.6 million Mg of belowground carbon from peat oxidation. Additionally, the loss of peatswamp forests implies the loss of carbon sequestration service through peat accumulation, which amounts to [almost equal to]660,000 Mg of carbon annually. By 2010, 2.3 million ha of peatswamp forests were clear-felled, and currently occur as degraded lands. Reforestation of these clearings could enhance biodiversity by up to [almost equal to]20%, whereas oil-palm establishment would exacerbate species losses by up to [almost equal to]12%. To safeguard the region's biodiversity and carbon stocks, conservation and reforestation efforts should target Central Kalimantan, Riau, and West Kalimantan, which retain three-quarters (3.9 million ha) of the remaining peatswamp forests in Southeast Asia.";"Koh, Lian Pin

"AGRIS:US201400185740";"Revitalisation of Common Use in Management of Modern Multifunctional Landscapes";"";"Land areas in collective ownership or use are traditionally referred to as commons. Through history, the common use and ownership has been a widespread means of regulating the use of natural resources. Changing economic conditions and technology spawned a process however where land use rights and landowner rights aggregated into the modern form of private ownership of individual farms with full management and owner rights. This process had obvious rationales in terms of production of marketable agricultural products. However, in the twentieth century increasing awareness of the supply of externalities such as clean groundwater and recreational opportunities from landscapes turned the attention once again to commons as an instrument for managing natural resources. Using groundwater and coastal landscapes as case examples, we pinpoint problems where outputs from the landscape are multiple consisting of a mix of public and private goods. In some instances central intervention is needed to ensure provision of public goods. In situations where transaction costs are too high to justify the guaranteed supply of goods, local initiatives, cooperatives and networks may be suitable regulatory alternatives to the predominant private and individualised ownership. It is concluded that the management regimes chosen should reflect the dominant functionality of the area in question.";"Vejre, Henrik

While deforestation in Bangladesh is obviously a complex issue, one important aspect emerges from previous research findings in explaining deforestation: industrialization. This study focuses on the causes of deforestation in Bangladesh, particularly in tropical moist deciduous Sal forests, using multi levels factor analysis framework. Data were collected through questionnaire surveys, formal and informal discussions with local people, expert interviews and literature reviews. The main findings of defore­station framework show that illegal logging and forest land conversion were the ultimate causes of Sal forests deforestation in Bangladesh. Illegal logging is a complex phenomenon and is being patronized by a local syndicate, functio­ning from behind the scenes. On the other hand, land conversion into different commercial activities has direct influence on national policy and the predispo­sing conditions of this country. Therefore, the immediate task of the nation would be to stop illegal logging and land conversion of Sal forests. This can be done by involving all relevant stakeholders in the form of effective forest policy formulation and execution of strict environmental protection law.";"Islam K

Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest. The accuracy was lower in open mixed forest, and sal mixed forest. Results revealed that density of different forest types varied from 324 to 733 trees ha-1, basal area from 8.13 to 28.87 m²·ha⁻¹ and number of species from 20 to 40. Similarly, the diversity ranged from 1.36 to 2.98, concentration of dominance from 0.06 to 0.49, species richness from 3.88 to 6.86, and beta diversity from 1.29 to 2.21. The sal mixed forest type recorded the highest basal area, diversity was highest in the dense mixed forest, and the teak forest recorded maximum density, which was poor in degraded mixed forests.

A sealed bid green auction is used to promote an agri-environmental program with two environmental targets, nutrient runoff reduction and biodiversity provision. A score index comprising of environmental performance and the monetary size of bid is developed to rank the farmers’ applications. The green auction is analyzed analytically and then empirically by using Finnish data. An auction that screens according to the environmental score and another one with an additional cost-saving component are simulated in the context of two different conservation options based on whether enlarged field edges are located in whichever edge of a parcel, providing only biodiversity benefits or are located on the waterfront (buffer strip) providing joint benefits in terms of promoting biodiversity and reducing nitrogen runoff. Empirical results show that independently of whether the auction program supports simple enlargement of field edges or buffer strips, the green auction with the cost saving component has the highest social welfare performance, followed by the flat rate payment, followed in turn by the green auction ranking by environmental score. When environmental benefits are jointly produced by a practice the dominance, in welfare terms, of the green auction with cost-saving is further enhanced.";"Cattaneo, Andrea

Despite this, the mechanisms of bush encroachment in response to protection and the time of protection compared with continuous grazing are rarely investigated. In this study, we used the state-and-transitional model (STT) to investigate the mechanisms of bush encroachment using six traditional enclosures along age chronosequences of 12-14, 17-24 and 26-30 years compared with open grazed system immediately adjacent to each enclosure (as control). The woody vegetation was sampled by randomly locating 10 plots (5 x 5 m) in each of the six enclosures and the adjacent open grazed areas. We compared the enclosure management with the open grazed system in terms of densities of mature trees, saplings and seedlings, bush cover, woody species composition, and the invasive woody species ratio (IWSR). The IWSR is the ratio of density of invasive woody species to non-invasive woody species (i.e. a ratio of >1.0 represents a high invasive threat, while <1.0 represents a lesser threat). We considered the future responses of invasive species by increasing the age of enclosures. We identified five vegetation states and ten transitions described in terms of densities of mature trees, saplings and seedlings, bush cover, woody species composition, and the IWSR. Greater densities of invasive woody species and higher IWSR were found in the enclosures than in the open grazed system, but this was not true for bush cover. Doubling the age of enclosures had a negative impact on the majority of invasive woody species, the decline probably being related to self-thinning mortality. The evidence that regeneration of invasive woody species is nonlinear in relation to age chronosequence suggests that bush encroachment is probably controlled more by stochastic rainfall events than by livestock grazing alone. Vegetation states differed in terms of tree density, IWSR and species composition, suggesting that the threat of invasive woody species is greater in the enclosures than in the open grazed areas.";"Angassa, Ayana

We investigated factors associated with avian electrocutions so poles that are likely to electrocute a bird can be identified and retrofitted prior to causing avian mortality. We used historical data from southern California to identify patterns of avian electrocution by voltage, month, and year to identify species most often killed by electrocution in our study area and to develop a predictive model that compared poles where an avian electrocution was known to have occurred (electrocution poles) with poles where no known electrocution occurred (comparison poles). We chose variables that could be quantified by personnel with little training in ornithology or electric systems. Electrocutions were more common at distribution voltages (≤33 kV) and during breeding seasons and were more commonly reported after a retrofitting program began. Red‐tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) (n = 265) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) (n = 258) were the most commonly electrocuted species. In the predictive model, 4 of 14 candidate variables were required to distinguish electrocution poles from comparison poles: number of jumpers (short wires connecting energized equipment), number of primary conductors, presence of grounding, and presence of unforested unpaved areas as the dominant nearby land cover. When tested against a sample of poles not used to build the model, our model distributed poles relatively normally across electrocution‐risk values and identified the average risk as higher for electrocution poles relative to comparison poles. Our model can be used to reduce avian electrocutions through proactive identification and targeting of high‐risk poles for retrofitting.

This is a synthesis of the papers presented at the meeting of the AFPF (French Grassland Society), with an emphasis on the new utilizations that are appearing, and it invites to contemplate new prospects for the grassland areas and the forage species. The new utilizations are described and analysed, with a view of defining what adaptations can be applied to these swards (choice of species, tilling practices, scope and level of management, etc.), and also in order to analyse the possible competitions and synergies and to see how to apply the existing know-hows to other ends than those linked to forage. Among the new utilizations are the following : 1 degrees the ecological regulation, because of the various eco-systemic roles played by grasslands thanks to their multi-functionality (pollution control, preservation of the bio-diversity, carbon storage, etc.); 2 degrees the production of resources of agricultural origin and of energy (but the forage species have certain disadvantages); and 3 degrees the greening of certain environments and the quality of the landscapes.

L'agriculture et l'élevage sont aujourd'hui interpellés pour prendre en compte de nouvelles fonctions au service d’un développement durable. Cette synthèse des interventions présentées lors des Journées AFPF souligne les nouveaux usages qui se profilent et invite à considérer surfaces prairiales et espèces fourragères avec d'autres perspectives. Les nouveaux usages des espèces fourragères sont rappelés et analysés dans l'optique de voir quelles adaptations envisager pour ces couverts (espèces à choisir, pratiques de culture, cadre et niveau de gestion…) mais aussi dans l'optique d'analyser les concurrences et les synergies possibles, et de voir comment les savoir-faire existants peuvent être valorisés pour des fins non fourragères… Ces usages émergents comprennent notamment : i) la régulation écologique, car, par leur multifonctionnalité, les prairies assurent divers services écosystémiques (maîtrise des pollutions, protection du sol et de la biodiversité, stockage de carbone…) ; ii) la production d'agroressources et d'énergie, mais les espèces fourragères présentent des handicaps ; et iii) la végétalisation de certains milieux et la qualité des paysages.";"Huyghe, Christian";"";"";"AGRIS";"2010-12-31";"fr";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=LV2016020107";"http://prodinra.inra.fr/ft/E8116050-CF80-4540-94DF-3DEE6B4DC76C";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2012209761";"Land Quality and International Agricultural Productivity: A Distance Function Approach";"";"Agricultural productivity measurement has been of great interest in recent years. Although analysts have long recognized that land quality plays an important role in agricultural productivity, land quality has been difficult to quantify and include in productivity models due to d ata limitations. Poor land quality, in the form of desertification, erosion, and poor soil quality, as well as climate and precipitation may limit growth in productivity over time. A Malmquist productivity index is proposed that decomposes productivity into efficiency change, technical change and land quality components and accounts for inter-country differences in land quality. The index is then applied to a 109-country data set covering 1980 to 2003. Many countries with lower productivity growth are limited by their resource endowment, and thus require policies and technology that reflect the needs of those environments.";"Malcolm, Scott A.

As part of the overall measurement strategy, a network of 13 flux 'super sites' (Level-3) has been established, covering European forest, arable, grassland and wetland sites, with the objective of quantifying the N budget at a high spatial resolution and temporal frequency for 4.5 years, and to estimate greenhouse gas budgets (N₂O, CH₄ and CO₂). These sites are supported by a network of low-cost flux measurements (Level-2, 9 sites) and a network to infer reactive N fluxes at 58 sites (Level-1), for comparison with carbon (C) flux measurements. Measurements at the Level-3 sites include high resolution N₂O, NO (also CH₄, CO₂) fluxes, wet and dry N deposition, leaching of N and C and N transformations in plant, litter and soil. Results for the first 11 months (1.8.2006 to 30.6.2007) suggest that the grasslands are the largest source of N₂O, that forests are the largest source of NO and sink of CH₄ and that N deposition rates influence NO and N₂O fluxes in non-agricultural ecosystems. The NO and N₂O emission ratio is influenced by soil type and precipitation. First budgets of reactive N entering and leaving the ecosystem and of net greenhouse gas exchange are outlined. Further information on rates of denitrification to N₂ and biological N₂ fixation is required to complete the N budgets for some sites. The quantitative roles played by CO₂, N₂O and CH₄ in defining net greenhouse gas exchange differ widely between ecosystems depending on the interactions of climate, soil type, land use and management.";"Skiba, U.

Considering the ability of remote sensing technology in watershed monitoring and impact assessment, a study was carried out to investigate the Impact Assessment of Karnataka Watershed Development Project (DANIDA) in Koralahallihalla Sub watershed in Sindagi taluk of Bijapur district in Northern Karnataka using satellite data of two periods i.e., IRS 1 C, LISS-III data of 30 December, 1997 (pre-treatment) and IRS P6, LISS-III data of 17 December, 2004 (post-treatment). The land use/land cover map was derived from the supervised classification. The results revealed that there has been no major shift in cropping patterns over a period of 7 years (1997–2004). However, rabi cropped area has decreased drastically (187 ha), which might be due to the continuous droughts that occurred during the implementation period. On the other hand, kharif and double cropped area have increased marginally (103 ha and 96 ha, respectively). Increase in double cropped area showed that there was increase in irrigated land, which were earlier being used as rainfed and wastelands turned in to cultivated lands as seen in scrub lands and rabi cropped areas of the sub watershed. Wastelands in the sub-watershed has decreased marginally (36 ha). The vegetation vigour of the sub-watershed has been derived from the NDVI maps of both the periods. These NDVI maps indicate that there was a significant change in biomass status of the sub watershed. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (319 ha and 77 ha, respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing technology was 2 times cheaper than the conventional methods. Thus, the repetitive coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the land resources and evaluate the land cover changes through comparison of images for the watershed at different periods.";"Shanwad, U.

There are three major parts to this paper.  The first part probes the underlying assumptions of public investment analysis.  It is noted that non-Pareto optimal welfare changes occur whether or not abandonment takes place.  The decision of whether or not to subsidize branch lines is based on the decision-makers' evaluation of certain important consequences, expressed in terms of criterion variables.  It is argued that analyses should provide information regarding criterion variables to which decision-makers can assign values in the ultimate abandonment decision.

The second part presents a conceptual approach within which two criterion variables -national income and employment impacts-can be isolated.   National income impacts are composed of changes in the amount of resources devoted to transport cost and changes in output.  Employment impacts are examined in the dimensions of occupational groups and geographical areas.

The last part applies the conceptual approach by estimating and displaying national income and employment impacts for four connecting branch lines in Michigan.

Social acceptance is the key prerequisite for successful land consolidation. How should the sequence of land consolidation measures be planned in a rural area whose inhabitants have not expressed their opinions about the project? Are the existing criteria, which are applied to evaluate land consolidation measures mostly in agricultural regions, sufficient? Scientists and practitioners have been developing criteria that should be taken into account in the process of planning land consolidation measures. This article analyzes the criteria for planning land consolidation measures in Poland. Most of them are based on economic parameters, such as farm fragmentation, average land plot area, average farm area, shape of farm fields, proportion of plot sides. A criterion that is disregarded in the planning process is the local community’s attitude to the undertaking. This article attempts to define additional criteria for planning land consolidation measures based on the local community’s attitude to the project. The study was carried out in the Lublin Region, which is characterized by the highest number of land consolidation schemes in Poland. Attempts were made to describe social activity levels in the region’s rural municipalities. The selection of variables characterizing the local community was a key stage of the study. Variables that were indirectly indicative of social activity were included in the analysis: voter turnout in elections, municipal councilors’ level of education, number of non-governmental organizations, and number of local action groups.";"Dudzinska, M., University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (Poland)

Currently, a pilot project is being implemented in the Macarena region, in the department of Meta (southeast of Bogotá), where coca crops and illicit activities were the norm just a few years ago. The Colombian State, partially financed by the United States governments and European countries, consolidates its presence in this region with the different instances and programs of the state apparatus to recover territorial control and combat the production of illicit drugs. But even more important is that this new approach in the fight against illegal drugs is based on a regional economic development plan, to avoid that peasants become involved in the first stages of cocaine production and trafficking process.

To correct for potential self-selectivity bias a household-level switching regression framework is implemented to estimate separate stochastic production frontiers for the two groups of households under analysis. The main results indicate that a systematic difference exists between the two studied groups. Specifically, households with higher levels of investments in soil conservation show higher average TE than those with a lower level of investments. Constrains in the rural land and credit markets appear to be the reason behind these differences. Our estimations indicate that for farms with lower levels of investments in soil conservation access to credit is a significant factor explaining the sources of inefficiency. Conversely, households with higher levels of investments in soil conservation present the highest partial output elasticity for land, the highest levels of TE and the smallest farms. This result could suggest the presence of a market failure in the land market which is denying access to land to the more efficient producers.";"Solis, Daniel

Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of SOM and the driving forces responsible for spatial and temporal changes is important to assess regional soil quality and carbon sequestration potential and, particularly, to establish better practices for land use and management. We evaluated the spatio‐temporal change in SOM content from 1979–1982 to 2006 and its driving forces in Jiangsu Province, East China, using geostatistics. The results showed that mean SOM content increased from 16.60 ± 8.50 to 18.31 ± 8.32 g/kg over a 26‐yr period. The maps of SOM generated by ordinary kriging represented the increasing trend from north to south across the province in the two periods. The level of SOM in 1979–1982 affected the pattern of change: the SOM increasing in areas initially with a small content while decreasing in areas having a large content. The map of SOM change showed that the rate of increase decreased from north to south within the province. Increased fertilizer application promoted crop production with more residual biomass being retained in the soil, which resulted in increased SOM content. Land use changes to paddy, upland or forest improved SOM content, whereas abandoning land reduced SOM content.";"Zhao, M.‐S.

Agricultural land market can be described by agricultural land resources, a form of possession of land, soil quality, lease payments, and agricultural land prices. Agricultural land market in Poland is in a constant stage of development. However, it is difficult to determine the size of agricultural real estate because it does not lead to transaction summary records of the transfer of agricultural land.

A set of class proportion images, which are to be treated as soft classification results, were created from a high spatial resolution (25 m) land cover dataset. For this purpose, the land cover dataset was aggregated both thematically (into two, four or eight land cover classes) and spatially (into proportion images with pixel sizes of 75, 150 and 300 m). This resulted in nine different combinations that were considered here as study cases. Several FFBPNNs were trained using these proportion images and the original land cover dataset (which was used as a target). Subsequently, the best networks were used to reconstruct high spatial resolution land cover maps of two heterogeneous areas in the south of The Netherlands. The overall accuracies obtained revealed that the networks were influenced by the spatial frequency, shape and size of the different land cover types. Moreover, it was revealed that most of the errors were on the class boundaries where highly mixed pixels are to be expected. The accuracies spanned a wide range of values depending on the complexity of the cases. Although it was not possible to exhaustively explore all network architectures, the results demonstrate the potential of the FFBPNN for subpixel mapping.";"Nigussie, Demeke

"AGRIS:US201500008272";"Fire and carbon management in a diversified rangelands economy: research, policy and implementation challenges for northern Australia";"";"Burning of savanna is a globally important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Australia, burning of savanna contributes between 2% and 4% annually of the nation’s reportable emissions. Complete removal of this source of emissions is unrealistic because fire is a ubiquitous natural process and important land-management tool. In the rangelands of northern Australia, fire is used to manage habitat for conservation, control woodland thickening, manipulate pastures for grazing and is an essential component of indigenous cultural and land-management practice. There has been a concerted attempt in recent times to move away from complete fire suppression and its consequence: frequent, extensive and high intensity wildfires occurring late in the dry season. In fire-adapted vegetation types, prescribed early dry season fires help reduce the incidence of late season wildfires and consequently the amount of GHG emissions produced. The emergence of a carbon economy affords a potential opportunity for land managers to diversify their livelihoods by adopting fire-management practices that reduce GHG emissions and increase carbon sequestration. However, in order to realise benefits from this emerging economy, there is a need to identify and address a range of barriers affecting community participation. The papers in this Special Issue document current scientific knowledge, policy issues and pathways to participation, with particular reference to Australia’s savanna rangelands. This introductory paper outlines how northern Australia has both the opportunity and requirement to develop a diversified rangelands economy to realise multiple conservation, economic and emissions outcomes.";"Walsh, Dionne

The research started by identifying 50 different statements based on review of the empirical literature and information obtained from stakeholders and experts. Of these statements, 30 items were selected and ultimately only 12 consistent and reliable statements were retained for inclusion in a five point Likert type scale. The 12 statements’ scale was administered on 335 randomly selected sample farmers to measure their attitude towards complete ownership of farmland. The result shows that about 85% and 9% of the respondents were favoring and disfavoring complete ownership of farmland, respectively. Only 6% of the sample respondents were undecided in terms of their preference for the complete ownership of farmland. This detailed study together with strict follow-up of data collection from the sample respondents has been extremely useful in developing a relatively consistent tool to measure farmers’ attitude. Therefore, the 12- item five point Likert scale can be applicable in similar situations of Ethiopia in particular, and in developing countries in general.";"Semie, Negussie

Results showed that the mean soil erosion potential of the watershed was increased slightly from 12.11 t ha ⁻ ¹ year ⁻ ¹ in the year 1989 to 13.21 t ha ⁻ ¹ year ⁻ ¹ in the year 2004. Spatial analysis revealed that the disappearance of forest patches from relatively flat areas, increased in wasteland in steep slope, and intensification of cultivation practice in relatively more erosion-prone soil were the main factors contributing toward the increased soil erosion potential of the watershed during the study period. Results indicated that transition of other land use land cover (LUC) categories to cropland was the most detrimental to watershed in terms of soil loss while forest acted as the most effective barrier to soil loss. A p value of 0.5503 obtained for two-tailed paired t test between the mean erosion potential of microwatersheds in 1989 and 2004 also indicated towards a moderate change in soil erosion potential of the watershed over the studied period.

The low adoption rate is most likely due to difficulties in management but also limited information on the profitability and risk of NT.  Most rice producers are knowledgeable on NT costs savings but consider it less profitable due to yield reductions offsetting costs savings.  This study evaluates production costs, crop yields, and economic risk of both NT and CT in five rice-based cropping systems (continuous rice, rice-soybean, rice-corn, rice-wheat, and rice-wheat-soybean-wheat).  Yields, crop prices, and key input prices are simulated to create net return distributions.  Stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) is used to evaluate profitability and risk efficiency.  Results indicate that a risk-neutral and risk-averse producer in either NT or CT would prefer a rice-soybean rotation.  NT would be preferred over CT in the rice-soybean rotation across all risk preferences.  Overall, risk-neutral producers would prefer NT in four of five cropping systems while risk-averse producers would prefer NT in three of five cropping systems.";"Hignight, Jeffrey A.

This article focuses on theenvironmental impacts of biofuel cropping systems and calculates net greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions using life cycle analysis. The impacts of corn and switchgrass croppingfor ethanol production were calculated for three states in the US (Iowa, Illinois, andIndiana) assuming three previous land use scenarios: Conservation Reserve Program(CRP) land, pasture land, and land already used for cropping. Although the results weredifferent for the 3 states considered, the impacts of previous land use and croppingsystem were more important than location. Conversion of CRP lands to corn ethanolproduction would result in little net GHG savings compared to burning fossil fuel, greatlyincrease NO3 leaching, and constrain other benefits of CRP land such as wildlife habitat.Conversion of pasture and crop land to corn ethanol cropping show GHG benefits,reductions in leaching for previously cropped systems, and increases in leaching for landspreviously in pasture. Converting CRP land to switchgrass cropping would lessen the rateat which these soils store SOC, increase N2O emissions, and have little impact on NO3leaching. Converting pasture and crop land to switchgrass cropping would increase SOCstorage, decrease N2O emissions, and decrease NO3 leaching. We conclude that currentland management (cropping system, tillage intensity, and fertilizer application), as well asprevious land use, must both be considered to quantify the environmental impacts ofbiofuel cropping systems.";"Del Grosso, Stephen J.

To capture both the vulnerability and risks that farmers are involuntarily taking in farming, irrigation deficits applied in cash crops cultivation in an irrigation system in the south of India are calculated. Results show that landowners’ exposure to lower returns from land, due to irrigation deficits, increases towards the tail of the irrigation system as water availability is insufficient to satisfy the crops physiological needs. In spite of its simplicity, irrigation deficit is a useful indicator of the benefits that irrigation systems can bring to farmers, as well as of the environmental uncertainty in which they operate. The indicator investigates vulnerability linked to an income generating activity, not to the lack of an asset, as commonly used in livelihoods analysis.

We obtained 1354 GPS locations from 20 BCMAs and 4040 GPS locations from 54 WRMAs we tracked. These birds were dependent on forest remnants and rarely moved through open habitats. This was more likely for WRMAs, which were slightly more tolerant of forest fragmentation. BCMAs preferred the local Las Cruces Forest Reserve and riparian corridors to smaller (<10 ha) and more isolated forest fragments. Radio tracking showed that both species used small forest fragments less than expected based on the birds’ sites of capture. In general, age ratios were immature-biased and sex ratios were female-biased, especially in riparian corridors, which enabled movements across the highly deforested landscape. Average daily nest survival rate was 92.2 % for BCMA nests and 97.1 % for WRMA nests. Both species used riparian corridors 3–5 times more than expected based on land cover, utilizing these corridors for food, water, breeding, and for moving across a highly deforested landscape. Although most movements of both species were 100 m or less, some birds moved more than 600 m between observations, sometimes in only 15 min. These manakins are abundant in the forest understory and are capable of dispersing seeds more than 600 m, helping the regeneration of native vegetation. Tropical countryside riparian corridors provide critical habitat and connectivity for these common seed-dispersing forest understory birds in a fragmented landscape.";"Şekercioğlu, Çağan H.

"AGRIS:US201500196568";"Mapping of regional soil salinities in Xinjiang and strategies for amelioration and management";"";"Information on the spatial distribution of soil salinity can be used as guidance in avoiding the continued degradation of land and water resources by better informing policy makers. However, most regional soil-salinity maps are produced through a conventional direct-linking method derived from historic observations. Such maps lack spatial details and are limited in describing the evolution of soil salinization in particular instances. To overcome these limitations, we employed a method that included an integrative hierarchical-sampling strategy (IHSS) and the Soil Land Inference Model (SoLIM) to map soil salinity over a regional area. A fuzzy c-means (FCM) classifier is performed to generate three measures, comprising representative grade, representative area, and representative level (membership). IHSS employs these three measures to ascertain how many representative samples are appropriate. Through this synergetic assessment, representative samples are obtained and their soil-salinity values are measured. These samples are input to SoLIM, which is constructed based on fuzzy logic, to calculate the soil-forming environmental similarities between representative samples and other locations. Finally, a detailed soil-salinity map is produced through an averaging function that is linearly weighted, which is used to integrate the soil salinity value and soil similarity. This case study, in the Uyghur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang of China, demonstrates that the employed method can produce soil salinity map at a higher level of spatial detail and accuracy. Twenty-three representative points are determined. The results show that 1) the prediction is appropriate in Kuqa Oasis (R²= 0.70, RPD = 1.55, RMSE = 12.86) and Keriya Oasis (R²= 0.75, RPD = 1.66, RMSE = 10.92), that in Fubei Oasis (R²= 0.77, RPD = 2.01, RMSE = 6.32) perform little better than in those two oases, according to the evaluation criterion. 2) Based on all validation samples from three oases, accuracy estimation show the employed method (R²= 0.74, RPD = 1.67, RMSE = 11.18) performed better than the multiple linear regression model (R²= 0.60, RPD = 1.47, RMSE = 14.45). 3) The statistical result show that approximately half (48.07%) of the study area has changed to salt-affected soil, mainly distributed in downstream of oases, around lakes, on both sides of rivers and more serious in the southern than the northern Xinjiang. To deal with this issue, a couple of strategies involving soil-salinity monitoring, water management, and plant diversification are proposed, to reduce soil salinization. Finally, this study concludes that the employed method can serve as an alternative model for soil-salinity mapping on a large scale.";"Wang, Fei

Such a data set collected regularly through time could inform and focus field monitoring efforts, and help prioritize restoration and mitigation efforts. Unfortunately, few data sets exist that are bi-nationally consistent in time, classification method, or resolution. To this end, we integrated land cover data across both the Canadian (Ontario Provincial Land Cover data) and US portions (National Land Cover Data) of the Lake Superior basin for two time steps (approximately 1992 and 2001) roughly one decade apart. After harmonizing landcover classes across the two datasets we compared the explicit amount and relative amount (total hectares and proportion of each area as percents) for each of the common land cover classes that occurred across the two time steps for the entire Lake Superior basin, for the U.S. portion of the Lake Superior basin only, and for the Canadian portion of the Lake Superior basin only. We also compared land cover change for the entire basin within a 1 km and a 10 km buffer of the Great Lakes shoreline. We then summarized and compared these land cover types for each time period across a common set of watersheds derived from elevation data (Hollenhorst et al., 2007) for the entire Lake Superior basin. This allowed us to identify and quantify the types of change occurring generally across the entire basin, more specifically across both the U.S. and Canadian portions of the basin, and more explicitly for near coastal areas and watersheds across the entire basin. Noteworthy changes were detected across the basin, particularly an increase in mixed forest types and a corresponding decrease in coniferous forest types.";"Hollenhorst, T. P.

"AGRIS:US201400150781";"integrated approach to assessing multiple stressors for coastal Lake Superior";"";"Biological indicators can be used both to estimate ecological condition and to suggest plausible causes of ecosystem degradation across the U.S. Great Lakes coastal region. Here we use data on breeding bird, diatom, fish, invertebrate, and wetland plant communities to develop robust indicators of ecological condition of the U.S. Lake Superior coastal zone. Sites were selected as part of a larger, stratified random design for the entire U.S. Great Lakes coastal region, covering gradients of anthropogenic stress defined by over 200 stressor variables (e.g. agriculture, altered land cover, human populations, and point source pollution). A total of 89 locations in Lake Superior were sampled between 2001 and 2004 including 31 sites for stable isotope analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates, 62 sites for birds, 35 for diatoms, 32 for fish and macroinvertebrates, and 26 for wetland vegetation. A relationship between watershed disturbance metrics and ¹⁵N levels in coastal macroinvertebrates confirmed that watershed-based stressor gradients are expressed across Lake Superior's coastal ecosystems, increasing confidence in ascribing causes of biological responses to some landscape activities. Several landscape metrics in particular—agriculture, urbanization, human population density, and road density—strongly influenced the responses of indicator species assemblages. Conditions were generally good in Lake Superior, but in some areas watershed stressors produced degraded conditions that were similar to those in the southern and eastern U.S. Great Lakes. The following indicators were developed based on biotic responses to stress in Lake Superior in the context of all the Great Lakes: (1) an index of ecological condition for breeding bird communities, (2) diatom-based nutrient and solids indicators, (3) fish and macroinvertebrate indicators for coastal wetlands, and (4) a non-metric multidimensional scaling for wetland plants corresponding to a cumulative stress index. These biotic measures serve as useful indicators of the ecological condition of the Lake Superior coast; collectively, they provide a baseline assessment of selected biological conditions for the U.S. Lake Superior coastal region and prescribe a means to detect change over time.";"Niemi, Gerald J.

This study explores whether the size of the watershed in which coastal wetlands are embedded (a measure of strength of connection to the terrestrial landscape) influences their background condition and response to anthropogenic landuse. Water quality, substrate, vegetation structure, and composition of zoobenthos, turtles, crayfish, and fish were characterized in 32 Lake Superior coastal wetlands in the summers of 2000–2001, and related to watershed size categories via ANOVA and to watershed development (percent agricultural and urban landuse) via linear regression. Lake Superior coastal wetlands had relatively low levels of watershed development – apparently not enough to significantly alter fish composition. However, watershed development was associated with significant changes in substrate, turbidity, plant structure, and zoobenthos, and in most cases these effects were stronger in wetlands having big rather than small watersheds. An alternate classification contrasting exposure to versus protection from river influences was not effective at resolving responses to watershed development. Watershed size had little effect on background conditions in minimally disturbed wetlands, although turtles were more abundant in large-watershed wetlands. The role of watershed size in mediating responses to landuse merits further study, but our findings suggest that receiving inflows from bigger watersheds affects coastal wetlands primarily by amplifying transmission of disturbance rather than via direct impacts of flow.";"Trebitz, Anett S.

"AGRIS:LV2013000295";"Development of immovable property tax in Latvia";"";"Immovable property tax is one of the national taxes the administration of which is subjected to continuous changes. Frequent amendments to the law “On Immovable Property Tax” (1997) also evidence the mentioned changes. The procedure for tax calculation, tax base, and tax rates has been considerably changed in the course of time. The research provides a discussion on the changes in tax formation, development, and administration in Latvia to understand better the essence of immovable property tax. The research aim was to analyse the development of immovable property tax and the course of reforms for the period of 1998–2012. The research also studies the expected changes in the application of immovable property tax from the year 2013. It is envisaged to transfer the rights to local governments to determine the immovable property tax rates in their administrative territories within the range of 0.2–3% from 2013. The research concludes that frequent reforms of immovable property tax have promoted the development of a new, stable, and predictable methodology for the future application of immovable property tax in Latvia. The analysis of revenues from immovable property tax for the period of 2006–2011 is based on the annually growing significance of immovable property tax. The research suggests that immovable property tax is the only tax the revenues of which have increased within the period of 2009–2011 and the largest revenues from immovable property tax are collected in Riga City municipality comprising 53% of the total revenues from immovable property tax collected in Latvia.";"Stucere, S., Riga City Council (Latvia).

"AGRIS:LV2013000290";"Description of land fragmentation in Latvia and its prevention opportunities";"";"Already during the Land Reform, land properties of several land parcels were formed in the rural areas. Another factor that benefits to the fragmentation of farm properties is development of land market because buying or renting land for farm size building, it is not always possible to find adjacent land plot. Consequently, the land fragmentation not only makes land management difficult, but also increases the transport costs. With this rural land tenure system, competitive and efficient agricultural production cannot be discussed, so a large part of rural areas remains untreated. It was found that there is a strong correlation between the area of land parcels and their management – the smaller the area of a land parcel by the agricultural land, the greater the chance that it would not be managed, and vice versa, the greater the area, the more it is cultivated, that is, managed. Land consolidation is performed as the farm land use optimization activities in other countries. Land consolidation can be one of the efficient means for rural development, it can encourage formation of competitive agricultural production structure, giving farmers the opportunity to create holdings with a small number, but bigger size and better-shaped land plots. Thus, more income and opportunities to expand types of farming are created.";"Platonova, D., Latvia Univ. of Agriculture, Jelgava (Latvia). Dept. of Land Management and Geodesy

Multi-temporal Landsat images of the Horquin core area were used to generate a time series of land use covering about a 30-year period, 1975–2003. We show that the physical environment in Horquin deteriorated between 1975 and 2000, although this situation was more controlled after 2000. The main driving forces of land use and land cover change (LUCC) appear not to be population growth and agricultural expansion but policy-relevant issues, including market distortions, unwise farming–pastoral management, and institutional uncertainty.

We based our review on government documents, semi-structured interviews with participants involved in this land-use planning process, and our involvement with the issue from 1990 through 2002. Conservation biology had a major influence on the outcome of the land-use planning process for this moraine. The landform was identified as an area of value by the environmental movement within the context of a number of ongoing government studies that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Conservation biologists and planners in government, the environmental movement, and the private sector carried out work related to conservation biology, including inventories and the development and application of criteria for the delineation of core areas and conservation corridors. Once the political timing was favorable (2001-2002), decision makers linked the science of conservation biology to planning policies and law in Ontario. The Oak Ridges Moraine land-use planning process was precedent setting in Canada, and possibly internationally. To our knowledge this is the first time long, wide conservation corridors on private lands were regulated through land-use-planning legislation and led to restrictions on urban development and aggregate resource extraction.";"WHITELAW, GRAHAM S.

Whilst such interventions are often pursued for political goals and in the interests of empowerment, there is often a mismatch between these goals and the actual outcomes achieved. Within this context, this study investigates the impacts of agrarian reform in Del Rosario, a former coconut hacienda in the Philippines. This is done in an attempt to explore whether agrarian reform has facilitated the creation of sustainable livelihoods among its beneficiaries, in particular, and in their agrarian reform community, in general. The impacts of reform are examined in relation to four themes – economic, social, demographic and environmental. Overall, the study concludes that agrarian reform has not brought about sustainable livelihoods in the former coconut hacienda. People's livelihoods, especially those derived from copra farming, remain at a subsistence level. At most, at an economic level agrarian reform has brought about improved access to land among its beneficiaries. Nevertheless, it has empowered the farmers by giving them greater freedom and has increased their sense of well-being, as well as enabling them to improve their families’ life prospects and strengthen social capital.";"Vista, Brandon M.

"AGRIS:US201500217276";"Land use scenario development as a tool for watershed management within the Rio Mannu Basin";"";"The Rio Mannu River Basin (Sardinia, Italy) is undergoing a process of agricultural intensification. Like many Mediterranean areas, this basin is characterized by water shortages and diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. Hence the objective of this study was to develop possible land use and land management scenarios that could constitute an alternative to the current watershed management. Several land use and land management scenarios were formulated and analyzed with local stakeholders, and two were selected and simulated as realistic in consideration of the socio-economical aspects of the study area. Scenario 1 involves agricultural practices that include a reduction in fertilizer use to meet the Water Framework Directive requirements for “good” status of water bodies. Scenario 2 introduces rapeseed cultivation, replacing durum wheat in a small area, to investigate the impact of biofuel plant cultivation on water quality. Each option was assessed by considering the effects on water quality, crop yields and economic benefits. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to simulate hydrological processes and evaluate current and future nutrient loads. This model requires adequate streamflow data for calibration and validation. However, as is the case for many Mediterranean basins, insufficient data were available. Therefore, a methodology was developed and tested to calibrate hydrological processes based on the transposition of a parameter set from a gauged catchment located in the same region. This study suggests that a sound use of fertilizers could substantially reduce the amount of nutrients flowing into surface waters, although the effects of such a policy on crop yield and farm income would be negative in some cases. Moreover, the results clearly predict that the replacement of durum wheat with rapeseed (a biofuel crop), could offer a margin of profit, but would have a negative impact on water quality due to increased nutrient losses. Consequently, this option is unsuitable for this area. Furthermore, it can be inferred from these results that the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources may have a negative impact on the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive. Clearly, this process needs to be regulated, taking into account environmental and socio-economical aspects.";"De Girolamo, A.M.

"AGRIS:US201301832875";"Community participatory landscape classification and biodiversity assessment and monitoring of grazing lands in northern Kenya";"";"In this study, we asked the Ariaal herders of northern Kenya to answer “why, what and how” they classified landscape, and assessed and monitored the biodiversity of 10 km2 of grazing land. To answer the “why question” the herders classified grazing resources into 39 landscape patches grouped into six landscape types and classified soil as ‘warm’, ‘intermediate’ or ‘cold’ for the purpose of land use. For the “what question” the herders used soil conditions and vegetation characteristics to assess biodiversity. Plant species were described as ‘increasers’, ‘decreasers’ or ‘stable’. The decreaser species were mostly grasses and forbs preferred for cattle and sheep grazing and the increasers were mostly woody species preferred by goats. The herders evaluated biodiversity in terms of key forage species and used absence or presence of the preferred species from individual landscapes for monitoring change in biodiversity. For the “how question” the herders used anthropogenic indicators concerned with livestock management for assessing landscape potential and suitability for grazing. The anthropogenic indicators were related to soils and biodiversity. The herders used plant species grazing preferences to determine the links between livestock production and biodiversity. By addressing these three questions, the study shows the value of incorporating the indigenous knowledge of herders into classification of landscape and assessment and monitoring of biodiversity in the grazing lands. We conclude that herder knowledge of biodiversity is related to the use as opposed to exclusive conservation practices. This type of knowledge is extremely valuable to conservation agencies for establishing a baseline for monitoring changes in biodiversity in the future.";"Roba, Hassan G.

"AGRIS:US201500163316";"Remote sensing based ecosystem state assessment in the Sandveld Region, South Africa";"";"We present a remote sensing based approach for assessing ecosystem state or intactness to inform land use management and conservation planning. Using segmented multispectral medium resolution satellite imagery, parameters related to the image objects’ spectral brightness and heterogeneity, and compactness are used to derive a scoring system of 0 to 10 for the ecosystem intactness, with 0 being completely degraded and 10 being pristine. Linked to the remote sensing approach we suggest a field validation approach that focuses on 10 ecosystem-relevant visually assessed parameters which, when combined, produce a score out of 10 as well. The approach was tested in the South African Sandveld region using a SPOT 5 image from 2009 and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image from 2011. Field assessments took place in 2011. Both image data sets returned consistent results suggesting an inter-sensor transferability of the approach. Inconsistencies between satellite and field scores occurred mainly on sites where crops were currently being grown and on fields where various stages of succession were underway, following abandonment. Masking out of those sites which are of little interest from an ecosystem state perspective would improve overall accuracies. For regions with vegetation types that differ significantly in cover and structure, a stratified approach is suggested to optimise the results per vegetation type. Outputs suggest that the approach with its standardised and robust results and its repeatability provides a suitable tool for long term monitoring of large regions with a degree of detail sufficiently high to allow for fine scale planning.";"Lück-Vogel, Melanie

"AGRIS:US201500163312";"integration of crop rotation and tillage practices in the assessment of ecosystem services provision at the regional scale";"";"The provision of ecosystem services at the landscape level can be significantly influenced by land management practices. Within an agriculturally dominated case study area in Saxony, Germany, a more detailed land use classification, which includes differentiated information on agricultural management practices, was utilized within the raster-based planning support tool GISCAME. “Management” refers to typical, regional crop rotations and soil tillage practices. The focus of this research was based on an indicator-based approach to assess ecosystem services and the development of land use change (LUC) and land management change (LMC) scenarios. The EuroMaps Land Cover data set was specifically developed for the case study and included remote sensing information for the general land use classification and terrestrial mapping information. Furthermore, statistical data on detailed regional agricultural land management were included. The raster-based planning support tool GISCAME was then used to simulate scenarios and visualize results. The LUC and LMC scenarios showed that the more detailed land use classification provided better output for the prioritization of planning alternatives. Further it enabled a refined assessment of the provisioning services (i) food and fodder provision, (ii) biomass provision, the regulation services, (iii) soil erosion protection, (iv) drought risk regulation, (v) flood regulation, (vi) returns from land-based production (i.e. the market value of biomass provision), and (vii) ecological integrity. The results of this study support the view that the application of improved management measures, such as conservation tillage, can significantly enhance the provision of ecosystem services (e.g. soil erosion protection and drought risk regulation) at the landscape level. The study also indicates that a combination of strategic LUC, such as afforestation and LMC, might be an effective way to enhance regulating services with acceptable trade-offs regarding provisioning services. Our approach presents a refined foundation for ecosystem services assessment, which is designed to better support regional planning and the provision of information to non-experts in the participatory processes. For transfer into other regions, standardized land use and land management classification will have to be defined.";"Koschke, Lars

The main research question focuses on the causes of regionally persistent structures. An empirical Markov chain model is defined for the West German agricultural sector. Thereby it is possible to explain the probabilities of farm growth, decline or exit in terms of the current and former regional farm size structure. Further, the impact of variables describing the regional farm structure, thereby indicating market power of the large, the potential of high competition for land within a region and possibly highrents of the status quo in combination with sunk costs, is quantified. The resultsconfirm the relevance of strategic interaction as a crucial determinant of regionally different structural change and persistent regional differences in the farm size structure over time.";"Huettel, Silke

Relative abundance of Canada Warblers decreased over time on our West Virginia study area (Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest) and within the Appalachian Bird Conservation Region. Initially, relative abundance was greater closer to roads, but as timber harvests became more common, relative abundance became positively associated with amount of light partial harvests at the local scale. Nest survival was 45.6±18.3% during 1996–1998 and 24.9±14.6% during 2007–2009, but did not differ (P=0.38) between these periods. Areas around nests in 2007–2009 (n=17) had less intermediate canopy cover and fewer residual trees but more green cover, woody debris, and pole trees than areas around nests in 1996–1998 (n=10). Successful nests had more low cover, less vertical diversity, more woody debris, more saplings, and greater edge density than failed nests. We found a positive association between relative abundance and all three types of timber harvests and an improvement in habitat through understory development and retention of residual trees. Our research finds preliminary support for use of timber harvests, particularly light partial harvests, as a management tool for Canada Warblers in the southern portion of their range with the need for extended research using treatments and controls to confirm successful management.";"Becker, Douglas A.

"AGRIS:US201300836536";"Threshold changes in vegetation along a grazing gradient in Mongolian rangelands";"";"1. The concept of threshold has become important in ecology, but the nature of potential threshold responses of vegetation to grazing in rangeland ecosystems remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify ecological thresholds in vegetation changes along a grazing gradient and to examine whether threshold changes were expressed similarly at a variety of ecological sites. 2. To accomplish this, we surveyed the vegetation along grazing gradients at 10 ecological sites, each located at different landscape positions in Mongolia's central and southern rangelands. Evidence for a threshold in changes in floristic composition along the grazing gradient was examined by comparing linear models of the data with nonlinear models fitted using an exponential curve, an inverse curve, a piecewise regression and a sigmoid logistic curve. 3. Three nonlinear models (piecewise, exponential and sigmoid) provided a much better fit to the data than the linear models, highlighting the presence of a discontinuity in vegetation changes along the grazing gradient. The shapes of the best-fit models and their fit to the data were generally similar across sites, indicating that the changes in floristic composition were relatively constant below a threshold level of grazing, after which the curve changed sharply. 4. Except for two sites, the best-fit models had relatively narrow bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI), especially around threshold points or zones where the rate of change accelerated, emphasizing that our results were robust and conclusive. 5. Synthesis. Our study provided strong evidence for the existence of ecological thresholds in vegetation change along a grazing gradient across all ecological sites. This suggests that vegetation responses to grazing in the study areas are essentially nonlinear. The recognition that real threshold changes exist in real grazing gradients will help land managers to prevent the occurrence of undesirable states and promote the occurrence of desirable states, and will therefore permit a major step forward in the sustainable management of rangeland ecosystems.";"Sasaki, Takehiro

Recent work in campo sujo indicates that rates of canopy conductance (gc) were directly and indirectly affected by a variety of meteorological variables, which limited our understanding of how seasonal variation in meteorology affected rates of gc. Thus, our overall objective here is to determine how individual meteorological variables affect seasonal variations in gc. Estimates of gc were derived using the inverted PenmanâMonteith equation from hourly eddy-covariance measurements of evapotranspiration made between March 2011 and December 2013. We employed the so-called Jarvis-type model to estimate gc, which allows us to specify the functional role of each variable on gc, to evaluate how variations in meteorology affect rates of Cerrado gc. The model was parameterized using eddy covariance data from 2012 and tested with data collected in 2011 and 2013. Using orthogonal regression and the Willmott index of agreement, we found that the model estimates compared well to those derived from eddy covariance, especially in 2011. Sensitivity analyses revealed that gc was sensitive to warming and drying, particularly during the dry season when drought stress from low soil moisture availability was already limiting gc. Warming and drying in response to climate change is expected to increase dry season duration, and dry season intensification may already be occurring in central and southern Mato Grosso. Given the high degree of surface-atmosphere coupling for this ecosystem, and the fact that gc is an important link between canopy-scale C and water cycling, our data suggest that dry season intensification may further limit CO2 and H2O vapor exchange during the dry season.";"Rodrigues, Thiago R.

"AGRIS:US201301958086";"Lessons from success and/or failure of irrigation development";"";"World population is increasing, particularly in the developing countries. Groundwater reserves are being depleted; lands are being degraded. The required increase in food production must come principally from new supplies of water for irrigated lands. If irrigated lands fail to produce the required food, increased destruction of resources and degradation of the environment from increasing slash and burn agriculture is anticipated. Various countries and international agencies have recognized the possibility of future food shortage. This paper presents case studies and includes technical and scientific considerations. In Greece, important considerations were land consolidation, and the incentives provided encouraged private initiative. The construction of large dams facilitated reforestation. In Haiti, flooding and erosion resulting from slash and burn agriculture, and land fragmentation were serious problems. Land redistribution and failure of maintenance resulted in the rapid deterioration and failure of the once prosperous colonial irrigation systems. Agrarian reform and/or the establishment of cooperatives with government landownership produced a rapid decline in irrigated production in various countries. In Honduras, little use has been made of 20 cooperatives financed by the government of Japan and the FAO. Various countries and international agencies have financed resource inventories and project studies and have provided funds for development. However, World Bank experience indicates that favorable laws and policies frequently have more influence on development than the availability of financial assistance. Strength in the rule of law, a free market economy, local and user participation in planning and management, and encouragement of private enterprise are frequently more important than the amount of money available from loans. Some successful training courses are described.

"AGRIS:DJ2012052950";"Comparison of Different Irrigation Methods Based on the Parametric Evaluation Approach in North Molasani Plain, Iran";"";"The main objective of this research is to compare two  different irrigation methods according to parametric evaluation system  in an area of 15831 ha in the North Molasani region`s soil located in  Khuzestan province, Southwest Iran. Soil properties of the study area  including texture, depth, electrical conductivity, drainage, carbonate  content and slope were derived from a semi-detailed soil study regarding  North Molasani plain in a scale of 1/20000. After analyzing and evaluating  soil properties, suitability maps were generated for both methods by means  of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). The results  showed that 163 ha of the studied area were highly suitable for Surface  Irrigation methods. Whereas 2288 ha of the study area was highly suitable  for drip irrigation methods. Also, it was found that some series coded  2, 3 and 5 covering an area of 7582 ha, were not suitable to be used for  surface irrigation systems and two series coded 3 and 5 with an area of  1381 ha were classified not suitable for drip irrigation systems. Moreover,  the results indicate that by applying drip irrigation instead of surface  irrigation methods, suitability classes of 8732 ha (55.16%) of North Molasani  plain`s land will improved. Ultimately, drip irrigation system was suggested  as the best method to be applied to the said study area. The main limiting  factors in using both surface and drip irrigation methods in this area  were soil carbonate and drainage.";"M. Albaji

"AGRIS:US201600021757";"Source populations and roads affect American black bear recolonization";"";"Understanding species distributions and population responses to environmental parameters is important for addressing landscape-level species conservation. We assessed American black bear (Ursus americanus) resource selection based on spatial distribution of a recolonizing population in Mississippi, USA. Given the philopatric behavior of female bears and the risk-disturbance hypothesis, we predicted that bears recolonizing Mississippi would occupy areas close to their source population but avoid areas near roads and with greater human population density. Using location data from radio-collared black bears, landscape metrics, and spatial autoregressive modeling, we estimated annual population-level space use. Our results confirm that black bears recolonizing Mississippi occupy habitats proximate to source populations and avoid areas near roads as probability of bear use was greater in areas closer to source breeding populations and areas farther from roads. Land cover type, elevation, and human density did not influence black bear occurrence at the spatial resolution examined. The lack of avoidance to areas inhabited by humans was likely a consequence of overall low human density, legal protection afforded this species, and that proximity to source population likely has a greater effect on recolonization than avoidance of humans.";"Simek, Stephanie L.

Major improvements of OPTINC compared to a typical immune network-based classification model (aiNet) include (1) preservation of the best antibodies of each land cover class from the antibody population suppression, which ensures that each land cover class is represented by at least one antibody; (2) mutation rates being self-adaptive according to the model performance between training generations, which improves the model convergence; and (3) incorporation of both Euclidean distance and spectral angle mapping distance to measure affinity between two feature vectors using a genetic algorithm-based optimization, which helps the model to better discriminate LULC classes with similar characteristics. OPTINC was evaluated using two sites with different remote sensing data: a residential area in Denver, CO with high-spatial resolution QuickBird image and LiDAR data, and a suburban area in Monticello, UT with HyMap hyperspectral imagery. A decision tree, a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation neural network, and aiNet were also tested for comparison. Classification accuracy, local homogeneity of classified images, and model sensitivity to training sample size were examined. OPTINC outperformed the other models with higher accuracy and more spatially cohesive land cover classes with limited salt-and-pepper noise. OPTINC was relatively less sensitive to training sample size than the neural network, followed by the decision tree.";"Gong, Binglei

Earth observation data sets are an important source of information that allow for systematic monitoring of the entire biome. Landsat imagery, provided free of charge by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) enable consistent and timely forest cover updates. However, irregular image acquisition within parts of the boreal biome coupled with an absence of atmospherically corrected data hamper regional-scale monitoring efforts using Landsat imagery. A method of boreal forest cover and change mapping using Landsat imagery has been developed and tested within European Russia between circa year 2000 and 2005. The approach employs a multi-year compositing methodology adapted for incomplete annual data availability, within-region variation in growing season length and frequent cloud cover. Relative radiometric normalization and cloud/shadow data screening algorithms were employed to create seamless image composites with remaining cloud/shadow contamination of less than 0.5% of the total composite area. Supervised classification tree algorithms were applied to the time-sequential image composites to characterize forest cover and gross forest loss over the study period. Forest cover results when compared to independently-derived samples of Landsat data have high agreement (overall accuracy of 89%, Kappa of 0.78), and conform with official forest cover statistics of the Russian government. Gross forest cover loss regional-scale mapping results are comparable with individual Landsat image pair change detection (overall accuracy of 98%, Kappa of 0.71). The gross forest cover loss within European Russia 2000–2005 is estimated to be 2210 thousand hectares, and constitutes a 1.5% reduction of year 2000 forest cover. At the regional scale, the highest proportional forest cover loss is estimated for the most populated regions (Leningradskaya and Moskovskaya Oblast). Our results highlight the forest cover depletion around large industrial cities as the hotspot of forest cover change in European Russia.";"Potapov, Peter

"AGRIS:US201500179430";"Retrieval of growing stock volume in boreal forest using hyper-temporal series of Envisat ASAR ScanSAR backscatter measurements";"";"Methods for the estimation of forest growing stock volume (GSV) are a major topic of investigation in the remote sensing community. The boreal zone contains almost 30% of global forest by area but measurements of forest resources are often outdated. Although past and current spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter data are not optimal for forest-related studies, a multi-temporal combination of individual GSV estimates can improve the retrieval as compared to the single-image case. This feature has been included in a novel GSV retrieval approach, hereafter referred to as the BIOMASAR algorithm. One innovative aspect of the algorithm is its independence from in situ measurements for model training. Model parameter estimates are obtained from central tendency statistics of the backscatter measurements for unvegetated and dense forest areas, which can be selected by means of a continuous tree canopy cover product, such as the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. In this paper, the performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using hyper-temporal series of C-band Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) images acquired in ScanSAR mode at 100m and 1km pixel size. To assess the robustness of the retrieval approach, study areas in Central Siberia (Russia), Sweden and Québec (Canada) have been considered. The algorithm validation activities demonstrated that the automatic approach implemented in the BIOMASAR algorithm performed similarly to traditional approaches based on in situ data. The retrieved GSV showed no saturation up to 300m³/ha, which represented almost the entire range of GSV at the study areas. The relative root mean square error (RMSE) was between 34.2% and 48.1% at 1km pixel size. Larger errors were obtained at 100m because of local errors in the reference datasets. Averaging GSV estimates over neighboring pixels improved the retrieval statistics substantially. For an aggregation factor of 10×10pixels, the relative RMSE was below 25%, regardless of the original resolution of the SAR data.";"Santoro, Maurizio

"AGRIS:US201500053286";"Quantifying Rhizosphere Respiration for Two Cool-Season Perennial Forages";"";"Understanding the regulation of ecosystem CO2 flux from forage production systems requires knowledge of component fluxes, including photosynthetic uptake and respiratory loss. Experimental separation of soil respiration into heterotrophic and rhizosphere respiration has been difficult, complicating efforts to quantify management and environmental effects on grazing land C sequestration. This study takes advantage of differences in the natural abundance of 13C between C3 and C4 plant species to separate microbial respiration of C4–derived soil organic matter from root respiration by C3 forage species. Respiratory flux and C isotope data were collected in May, July, and September 2008 and 2009 from plots containing either orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) or white clover (Trifolium repens L.). The site had been a big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman) field for about 30 yr before grass and clover establishment. Thus, the soil organic C had a strong C4 signature. At each sampling period, respiration measurements were made at the midpoint of the regrowth cycle, 2 wk following mowing. Rhizosphere respiration accounted for about 50% of soil respiration in July and September but only 40% in May. Rhizosphere respiration under orchardgrass averaged 50% of total soil respiration compared with 43% under white clover. Accurate quantification of the components of ecosystem respiration will aid in the development of realistic models to simulate ecosystem C flux.";"Skinner, R.

We review the herpetological literature dealing with Namibian species over the past fifty years, and provide up-to-date amphibian and reptile accounts using a widely accepted taxonomy and nomenclature. We critically discuss species accounts, draw attention to the historical development of species inventories for the country, and indicate species endemism for Namibia and the Namib Desert. In Namibia, the lizard families Gekkonidae, Lacertidae, and Scincidae have undergone adaptive radiations and are species-rich. This also applies to the snake family Psammophiidae. Areas of herpetological research that have received most attention are systematics (with its disciplines faunistics (area inventories), taxonomy, and phylogeny), ecology, and physiology. The former is indicative of early stages of herpetological research such as area inventories and the subsequent analyzes of the collections. The latter two were largely enabled by (1) species highly adapted to life in the hyper-arid Namib Desert, and (2) by the accessibility of these species in the Namib Desert through the infrastructure provided by the Gobabeb Research and Training Center. The majority of the eco-physiological research has focused on three highly psammophilus, diurnal lizard species; Meroles anchietae, M. cuneirostris, and Gerrhosaurus skoogi, whilst diverse geckos form the basis of eco-morphological studies. The concentration of research localities around cities and the Gobabeb Research and Training Center is characteristic for opportunistic research. Geographic centers of herpetological research have been the central Namib Desert (i.e. Gobabeb), and areas around Swakopmund and Windhoek. Extensive parts of Namibia remain barely touched. Herpetological publication frequency has been approximately the same since its beginning in the early 1800's until the 1970's. The period between 1986 and 2003 experienced a remarkable increase of publication activity that has slightly subsided around 2004 and picked up again in recent years. Recent conservation related studies investigate the impact of overgrazing with land degradation and water related issues such as canals and hydroelectric dam projects on herpetological communities. In the near future the impact of mining, especially Uranium mining in the Namib Desert, and the effects of climate change with the predicted drying and warming will demand increased attention. Advances in biotechnology with ever-increasing amounts of data and decreasing cost have and will progressively enable advances in traditional disciplines like taxonomy, phylogeny, and systematics. Additionally, these technologies will increasingly empower the newer disciplines of molecular ecology and conservation biology in Namibia. Annotated, updated species checklists highlight Namibian and Namib diversity and endemicity, and also direct researchers to the numerous taxonomic problems that still confound full understanding of the region's herpetofauna.";"Herrmann, H.-W.

Three decades after the term farmers' rights was first coined, there now exists a broad consensus that this new category of rights is historically grounded and imperative in the current context of the expansion of intellectual property rights (IPRs) over plant varieties. However, the issue of their realization has proven so thorny that even researchers and activists who are sympathetic to farmers' rights now express growing skepticism regarding their usefulness. In this article, I explore this debate through a case study of India's unique Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights (PPV&FR) Act. Based on an analysis of advances and setbacks in implementing the PPV&FR Act and a discussion of other relevant pieces of legislation, I argue that the politics of biodiversity and IPRs in India in recent years has been characteristic of the cunning state, and that this has seriously compromised the meaningful implementation of farmers' rights.";"Peschard, Karine";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"right of access;farmers";"";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"IND";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001820";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2014.937338";"";"";"";"1085-1108"

Food sovereignty narratives identify neoliberal state policies and global capital as the source of the food insecurity, and seek new rights for producers and consumers. However, the nature of territorial state power and the juridical structures of the (neo)liberal state may mute the more radical aims of food sovereignty. An engagement with literature on liberal sovereignty illustrates the primacy of the neoliberal market to the exercise of liberal sovereignty by the modern nation-state. The rights of the state to govern trade, often in the interests of capital, and the rights of trade and commerce often trump the citizen's right to food. Reading political theory against the practice of food sovereignty offers insight into solutions for food sovereignty that work within, against and in between the powers of the sovereign liberal state. These include reframing property rights as use rights, engaging in non-commodified food exchanges and practicing civil disobedience to usher in reforms without compromising on essential elements of the food sovereignty agenda.";"Trauger, Amy";"";"Routledge";"AGRIS";"2014-12-31";"en";"food security;property rights";"Land & Food Security";"Land Policy & Legislation;Access to Land & Tenure Security";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600001821";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2014.937339";"";"";"";"1131-1152"

"AGRIS:US201500186174";"Investigating syndromes of agricultural land degradation through past trajectories and future scenarios";"";"In the last decades, due to climate changes, soil deterioration and land use/land cover (LULC) changes, land degradation (LD) has become one of the most important issues at the global, regional and local scale. In concrete terms, LD determines a reduction in the productivity of a territory and in its capacity of providing ecosystem goods and services. “Syndromes” of LD can be assessed in the past, and scenarios, conversely, can be developed for the future, as information baselines for sustainable land management strategies and interventions. LULC information is essential for identifying change trajectories and associated LD processes, and for deriving prediction rules. Methodological issues and results of studies led within the framework of the research project AGROSCENARI (Adaptation scenarios of Italian agriculture to climate change) are discussed in this paper, analysing the case of the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy. Two key trajectories are investigated in detail: artificialization on the one hand, and scrubland and forestland expansion on the other. The first trajectory is associated with LD especially in terms of physical loss of farming land and soil sealing. The second trajectory is related to abandonment of agricultural land, and linked to LD processes such as soil erosion and hydrological instability, and to wildfires. The identification of such spatially explicit LD syndromes, which can also be projected on the basis of future scenarios, allows proposing and evaluating focussed measures of sustainable land management.";"Ceccarelli, Tomaso

These patterns are of particular concern to resource managers in regions where native plant communities are not well adapted to fire. We used an information-theoretic and mixed-model approach to quantify the importance of multiple environmental variables in predicting, separately, the probabilities of occurrence of all fires and the occurrence large (>20 ha) fires in five management units administered by the National Park Service in the Mojave Desert Network and based on fire ignition data obtained for the period 1992–2011. Fire occurrence was strongly associated with areas close to roads, high maximum NDVI values in the year preceding ignition, the desert montane ecological zone, and high topographic roughness. Large fire probability was strongly associated with lightning-caused ignition events, high maximum NDVI values in the spring preceding ignition, high topographic roughness, the middle-elevation shrubland ecological zone, and areas further from roads. Our probabilistic models and maps can be used to explore patterns of fire occurrence based upon variability in NDVI values and to assess the vulnerability of Mojave Desert protected areas to undesirable fire events.";"Hegeman, Ericka E.

For the period 1979–2008, the impact of LULCC is shown as a reduction in SSR in most stations in EC, whereas SSR in the reanalysis data has increased at nearly every location. The competition of the dimming effect of LULCC with the brightening effect in the reanalysis results in an observed dipole pattern of SSR with slightly decreasing (increasing) trends in most stations north (south) of the Yangtze River and statistically significant decreasing trends in central EC. In terms of EC area mean, this competition has resulted in a slightly dimming trend in the observed SSR during 1979–2008, although a transition from an apparent dimming to a general leveling off near 1990 is identified. For the period 1990–2008, LULCC has significantly reduced SSR in central EC and southern China. This dimming effect of LULCC competes with the apparent brightening effect in the reanalysis to result in the general leveling off in the observed SSR in terms of EC area mean and a sandwich spatial pattern in the observed SSR in EC where parts of central EC show significant dimming. The impact of LULCC on the changes in SSR may be through both biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes.";"Qian, Cheng";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2016-12-31";"en";"land cover;land use";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"CHN";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201600126606";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-014-1334-5";"";"";"";"131-139"

The spatial patterns of the components of surface energy balance (i.e., net radiation (R ₙ), latent heat (LH), sensible heat (SH), and albedo (α)) and climate (i.e., canopy temperature (T c), diurnal temperature range (DTR)), as well as the roles of land cover type in variations of energy balance and climate, were investigated. The results showed that there were general similar trends in R ₙ, LH, SH, and α in the LUCC process. The spatial patterns of T c and DTR also showed consistent relationships with LUCC processes. Leaf area index (LAI) and canopy conductance (g c) were found to be the key factors in controlling the spatial patterns of the components of surface energy balance and T c. Using linear correlation method, the gaps of the components of surface energy balance were well-explained by the differences of LAI and g c, and R ₙ had a better correlation with T c and DTR, in the process of LUCC. The surface energy partitioning of R ₙ into LH and SH could not only dampen or strengthen the temperature difference, but also change the relative size of albedo-based R ₙ when the albedo gap was small, between land cover types.";"Liu, Fengshan

"AGRIS:US201301511523";"Measurement and analysis of small-scale convective storm rainfall variability";"";"For large-scale catchment hydrology, the crucial importance of a good estimate of spatial rainfall variability is generally admitted. However, the assumption of uniform rainfall is still applied for small areas, whether they are studied as individual catchments or represent an elementary area in a distributed model. To investigate the validity of this assumption, an experiment was conducted in a small catchment (4.4 ha) in the semiarid USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. Measurements were made with recording and non-recording raingages as well as vectopluviometers for a range of events during the 1990 monsoon season (July-September). Geostatistical analysis of the data indicated the presence of first-order drift with corresponding rainfall gradients ranging from 0.28 to 2.48 mm per 100 m with an average of 1.2 mm per 100 m. These gradients represent a 4-14% variation of the mean rainfall depth over a 100 m distance. Given these observations, the assumption of spatial rainfall uniformity in this and similar convective environments at the small watershed scale of 5 ha appears to be invalid.";"Goodrich, D.C.

"AGRIS:US201400169142";"Bandwidth determination for kernel density analysis of wildfire events at forest sub-district scale";"";"Forest fire is regarded as one of the most significant factors leading to land degradation. While evaluating fire hazard or producing fire risk zone maps, quantitative analyses using historic fire data is often required, and during all these modeling and multi-criteria analysis processes, the fire event itself is taken as the dependent variable. However, there are two main problematic issues in analyzing historic fire data. The first difficulty arises from the fact that it is in point format, whereas a continuous surface is frequently needed for statistically analyzing the relationship of fire events with other factors, such as anthropogenic, topographic and climatic conditions. Another, and probably the most bothersome challenge is to overcome inaccuracy inherent in historic fire data in point format, since the exact coordinates of ignition points are mostly unknown. In this study, kernel density mapping, a widely used method for converting discrete point data into a continuous raster surface, was used to map the historic fire data in Mumcular Forest Sub-district in Muğla, Turkey. The historic fire data was transferred onto the digital forest stand map of the study area, where the exact locations of ignition points are unknown; however, the exact number of ignition points in each compartment of the forest stand map is known. Different random distributions of ignition points were produced, and for each random distribution, kernel density maps were produced by applying two distinct kernel functions with several smoothing parameter options. The obtained maps were compared through correlation analysis in order to illustrate the effect of randomness, choice of kernel function and smoothing parameter. The proposed method gives a range of values rather than a single bandwidth value; however, it provides a more reliable way than comparing the maps with different bandwidths subjectively by eye.";"Kuter, Semih

"AGRIS:US201500211959";"index of human alteration of lake shore morphology";"";"Morphological degradation constitutes one of the most severe threats to the ecological integrity of lakes. The development of biotic assessment methods for human lake shore alterations using littoral macroinvertebrates requires quantification of the degree of degradation by a stressor index and is complicated through simultaneous physical pressures that alter natural habitat structure. The Lake Habitat Survey (LHS) method and macroinvertebrate sampling were used to produce a pan‐European dataset of morphological lake shore degradation and macroinvertebrate densities covering 51 lakes in seven countries and across four geographical regions – northern, western, southern and central Europe. Lake Habitat Survey parameters that differed significantly among three categories of morphological pressure were combined to develop the stressor index components ‘Number of habitats', ‘Habitat diversity', ‘Total percentage volume inhabited by macrophytes', ‘Sum of macrophyte types', ‘Sum of vegetation cover types', ‘Sum of coarse woody debris/roots/overhanging vegetation', ‘Pressure index' (number of human disturbance sources) and ‘Natural/artificial dominant land cover type'. Stressor index components were tested for cross‐correlations and for differences among pressure levels. The final composition of the stressor index was optimized for the four studied geographical regions in Europe. The resulting stressor index correlated more strongly with macroinvertebrate metrics than simpler site‐specific LHS parameters or the HabQA index developed previously in one lake in north‐western Europe. The stressor index developed provides deeper insight into the morphological pressures that affect littoral invertebrate communities. The results also support the use of LHS to quantify morphological stressors at sampling site level, which can ease developing other multimetric bioassessment methods. The stressor index offers the possibility for wide and regional specific application to assess hydromorphological pressures on lakes to assist conservation planning and management and further global efforts to develop and test biotic assessment methods for lakes.

An automatic approach integrating iterative training sample selection (ITSS) and a Markov Random Field (MRF) model is proposed in this study to overcome the land-cover update problem when no previous remote-sensing data corresponding to the land-cover data are available. A case study in the Beijing region indicates that ITSS can effectively select reliable training samples based on historical land-cover data and that ITSS with MRF can achieve satisfactory land-cover update results (overall classification accuracy: 83.1%). The MRF model can effectively reduce salt-and-pepper noise and improve overall accuracy by approximately 6%. The proposed approach is completely unsupervised and has no strict requirements for newly acquired remote-sensing data for land-cover updating.";"Jia, Kun

In this paper, we present a robust conceptualization of values, encompassing general life values, broad-based environmental orientations, and specific yard priorities, while comparatively examining how these influence residents' land-management practices. Coupling a social survey with observational field data in Phoenix, Arizona, we address how 1) diverse values affect residents' multifaceted landscaping practices, 2) yard structure impacts water and chemical applications, and 3) land management varies across distinctive geographic contexts. Overall, values were not strongly related to land management decisions. Of those that were significant, most were related to groundcover and herbicide use. Yet diverse environmental values influenced landscaping practices in varying and complex ways. In addition, the historic and socioeconomic setting of neighborhoods affect the extent of lawns and related management inputs, while heightened use of pesticides in rock-based, drought-tolerant yards challenges the notion of these lawn alternatives as an environmentally friendly and low maintenance choice.";"Larson, Kelli L.

"AGRIS:US201400056558";"Land-use transition for bioenergy and climate stabilization: model comparison of drivers, impacts and interactions with other land use based mitigation options";"";"In this article, we evaluate and compare results from three integrated assessment models (GCAM, IMAGE, and ReMIND/MAgPIE) regarding the drivers and impacts of bioenergy production on the global land system. The considered model frameworks employ linked energy, economy, climate and land use modules. By the help of these linkages the direct competition of bioenergy with other energy technology options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, based on economic costs and GHG emissions from bioenergy production, has been taken into account. Our results indicate that dedicated bioenergy crops and biomass residues form a potentially important and cost-effective input into the energy system. At the same time, however, the results differ strongly in terms of deployment rates, feedstock composition and land-use and greenhouse gas implications. The current paper adds to earlier work by specific looking into model differences with respect to the land-use component that could contribute to the noted differences in results, including land cover allocation, land use constraints, energy crop yields, and non-bioenergy land mitigation options modeled. In scenarios without climate change mitigation, bioenergy cropland represents 10–18� % of total cropland by 2100 across the different models, and boosts cropland expansion at the expense of carbon richer ecosystems. Therefore, associated emissions from land-use change and agricultural intensification as a result of bio-energy use range from 14 and 113 Gt CO2-eq cumulatively through 2100. Under climate policy, bioenergy cropland increases to 24–36� % of total cropland by 2100.";"Popp, Alexander

"AGRIS:US201400046712";"influence of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of a rare bird species that commonly faces environmental fluctuations";"";"Habitat loss and fragmentation is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. Rare species are generally thought to be more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than common ones as small populations become even smaller. We did a population genetic study on a rare bird, the Worthen's sparrow Spizella wortheni which is endemic to semi‐arid and arid regions of northeast Mexico. Its population numbers suffer greatly from the transformation of grassland into farmland that leads to a patchy distribution with locally small population sizes. Our data show that its genetic diversity is nevertheless high, few to no differentiation between study localities was found, and gene flow was high. Although we can not exclude that is too early to see an impact on the genetic level, we think that these results might be explained by the species’ biology: like many other birds living in arid areas, the Worthen's sparrow has a nomadic life style; depending on local conditions individuals flexibly move between areas. This behavior could enhance their ability to find suitable habitat patches in a fragmented landscape. Our results imply that nomadic behavior, which is an adaptation to high temporal variability in environmental conditions, may make species more resilient to spatial variability caused by habitat fragmentation. This insight contributes to identifying common factors such as nomadism that predict a species’ sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.";"Canales‐Delgadillo, Julio Cesar

Nonetheless, the Mekong River Basin is changing rapidly due to accelerating water infrastructure development (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, and water supply) and climate change, bringing considerable modifications to the flood pulse of the Tonle Sap Lake in the foreseeable future. This paper presents research conducted to determine how the historical flooding regime, together with human action, influenced landscape patterns of habitats in the Tonle Sap Lake, and how these habitats might shift as a result of hydrological changes. Maps of water depth, annual flood duration, and flood frequency were created for recent historical hydrological conditions and for simulated future scenarios of water infrastructure development and climate change. Relationships were then established between the historical flood maps and land cover, and these were subsequently applied to assess potential changes to habitat cover in future decades. Five habitat groups were clearly distinguishable based on flood regime, physiognomic patterns, and human activity: (1) Open water, flooded for 12 months in an average hydrological year; (2) Gallery forest, with flood duration of 9 months annually; (3) Seasonally flooded habitats, flooded 5–8 months and dominated by shrublands and grasslands; (4) transitional habitats, flooded 1–5 months and dominated by abandoned agricultural fields, receding rice/floating rice, and lowland grasslands; and (5) Rainfed habitats, flooded up to 1 month and consisting mainly of wet season rice fields and village crops. It was found that water infrastructure development could increase the area of open water (+18 to +21%) and the area of rainfed habitats (+10 to +14%), while reducing the area covered with seasonally flooded habitats (−13 to −22%) and gallery forest (−75 to −83%). Habitat cover shifts as a result of climate change include a net increase of open water (2–21%), as well as a reduction of rainfed habitats by 2–5% and seasonally flooded habitats by 5–11%. Findings from this study will help guide on-going and future conservation and restoration efforts throughout this unique and critical ecosystem.";"Arias, Mauricio E.

This paper considers the agistment market in the northern Australian rangelands using the 'market failure framework'. This form of economic analysis identifies failings in a market, thus, provides a rigorous basis for designing interventions intended to improve market performance. Drawing on interviews with pastoralists from the Dalrymple Shire in Queensland we conclude that, although agistment is widely used, there are several failings in the existing market which are likely to result in overall agistment activity being far less than optimal. The market failure analysis indicates that key issues relate to the lack of a common marketplace, asymmetric information on the characteristics of the other party in an agreement, and a lack of mutual expectations at the outset. Innovations with the potential to overcome these failings, while minimising the transaction costs involved in entering an agistment agreement, are discussed.";"Reeson, A.F.

In this paper, we draw from our collective research and development experience with mobile pastoralists and discuss how non-governmental organisations have used ordinances and bureaucratic procedures to protect pastoral resources, in particular transhumance corridors that connect seasonal grazing lands in the far north region. We argue that the mobile pastoral system is best understood as an open system and explain what the implications are for the protection of pastoral resources. We argue that delimiting and protecting transhumance corridors is not the panacea, and we conclude with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.";"Moritz, Mark

Although these LSGS may provide harbor for a good part of European nature values, their continuity is facing contrasting threats of intensification and abandonment. These areas, however, may be characterized by particular grazing structures and social dynamics of change that should be unveiled prior to attempts to devise rural development strategies or to adapt policy frameworks in general. To wit, stakeholder interactions and legal and institutional processes are described and analyzed for the cereal-sheep system of Castile-La Mancha (CLM) in the central Iberian plain. Farmers and pastoralists still share the use of the land, but their roles and interests have changed over time, and particularly in the last 50 years. Arable farming, mainly cereal cropping, has followed an intensification path, partially tempered by the environmental constraints of the Castilian plain. Extensive pastoralism is still a secondary option of land use; in the main, sheep farmers depend on, and look to, the management practices of arable farmers. A mixed cereal and sheep operation may deliver environmental and economic benefits, but successful implementation of this strategy is only possible when the system serves the needs of both types of stakeholders. Paradoxically, the main drivers of change in the countryside overall are arrayed against this sensible and traditional agricultural system. We argue that the recent legal and institutional frameworks do not favor social cohesion and that policy-support schemes of the European Union (EU) have been, and continue to be, devised without taking into account the particular structures and social dynamic of the farming system.";"Caballero, Rafael";"";"Springer";"AGRIS";"2009-12-31";"en";"grazing";"Rangelands, Drylands & Pastoralism";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"ESP";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201301656113";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-008-9157-6";"";"";"";"219-231"

In this paper the costs of the two basic co-existence measures buffer strips and discard widths were investigated for the Spanish region Aragon. Furthermore for two Bavarian regions the expenses for buffer strips were analysed. We calculated the costs for each measure considering distances of 20 m, 50 m and 100 m, GM maize adoption rates of 30% and 50% as well as several economic assumptions. The results show an independency of costs from the GM adoption rate. There are however differences in costs with regard to various distances and price differences between GM and non-GM maize.

The Portuguese case study";"";"Portugal has voluntarily committed to reporting the CO2 emissions and removals resulting from grassland management under Kyoto Protocol Article 3.4. This commitment, together with the fact that a significant proportion of grasslands in Portugal are of low productivity and are located in the regions with higher risk of desertification, brought the context and motivation to promote the expansion of permanent sown biodiverse rich in legumes. These pastures are an innovation from the Biodiversity Engineering that promotes the increase of the soil organic matter and consequent carbon sequestration. Nowadays, this type of pasture represents more than 85 000 ha in Portugal, from which a significant percentage has been supported by the Portuguese Carbon Fund as a way of refunding farmers for the provision of an environmental service. Recently, the Portuguese Carbon Fund has also demonstrated interest in remunerating the farmers willing to control shrub encroachment at pastures through the use of non-invasive techniques that promote soil carbon sequestration. Regarding the biodiverse pastures, a 10 years model of the soil organic matter dynamic shows a carbon sequestration of about 6.5 t CO2.ha-1.yr-1. In the case of the change of practice for shrub control, results from a preliminary model are promising in what concerns the prediction of carbon sequestration.";"T., Valada

"AGRIS:US2012204187";"NEW CONSERVATION INITIATIVES IN THE 2002 FARM BILL";"";"The role of agri-environmental programs has taken on increased importance in the current Farm Bill debate with an eighty percent increase in Title II funding.  However, little empirical evidence exists on the tradeoffs between economic costs and environmental benefits of new agri-environmental programs to assist policymakers in their designs.  This paper illustrates some of the budgetary and environmental issues inherent in these initiatives.  Several policy options are explored using an environmental simulation model and an economic spatial-equilibrium model for U.S. agriculture.  Results indicate abatement levels of nitrogen and pesticides are higher under performance-based policies and those for wind erosion and soil productivity are higher under practice-based policies.  Abatement of phosphorus discharge, soil erosion and carbon sequestration remains relatively constant regardless of policy type.  A national performance-based conservation policy funded at the $1 billion level has the potential to improve the environmental performance of U.S. farmers by as much as ten percent.";"Johansson, Robert C.

This term covers both the content of patents and the confidential expertise, usually related to methodology and referred to as “Trade Secrets”. This review will explain the concepts behind patent protection, and will discuss the wide-ranging scope of existing patents that cover novel genotypes of plants as well as all aspects of transgenic technology, from selectable markers and novel promoters to methods of gene introduction. Although few of these patents have any significant commercial value there are a small number of key patents that may restrict the “freedom to operate” of any company seeking to exploit the methods in the production of transgenic varieties. Over the last twenty years, these restrictions have forced extensive cross-licensing between ag-biotech companies and have been one of the driving forces behind the consolidation of these companies. Although such issues may have limited relevance in the horticultural sector, and are often considered to be of little interest to the academic scientist working in the public sector, they are of great importance in any debate about the role of “public-good breeding” and of the relationship between the public and private sectors.";"Dunwell, J.M.";"";"International Society for Horticultural Science";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400115898";"http://www.actahort.org/";"";"";"";"125-138"

We evaluated the influence of several driving forces on forest cover and structure, including socioeconomic (urban and rural population and rural income) and climatic (mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature) variables. We acquired all time series Landsat images of a study site from 1972 to 2009. The images were classified to produce a land cover map of each year. We calculated landscape and patch metrics and identified independent sets of metrics to describe forest change. The most influential driving force for forest loss was urban population and climatic variables to some extent. These challenges should be addressed at broader scales than those associated with the livelihoods and traditional management of local communities. Rural population had a significant association with landscape structure which should be considered in designing restoration projects.";"Henareh Khalyani, Azad

Four techniques were selected for assessment from approximately 30 novel techniques: rights of first refusal; term conservation easements; land preservation tontines; and agricultural conservation pension.  Rights of first refusal was the most favored, although respondents thought effective implementation would need targeting of land and a dedicated funding source.  Agricultural conservation pension was also viewed favorably, although considered administratively difficult to implement.  Tontines were perceived to be an interesting concept, but confusing, difficult to implement, and ill-defined.  Term easements were viewed unfavorably because they did not preserve land permanently.";"Duke, Joshua M.

The experiment had five treatments that included non-conserved land (control), a 9-year old soil bund stabilized with tree lucerne, a 9-year old soil bund stabilized with vetiver grass, a 9-year old sole soil bund, and a 6-year old soil bund stabilized with tree lucerne. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean values for the treatments were separated using the Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results of the experiment indicated that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), bulk density, infiltration rate, bund height, and inter-terrace slope are significantly (p?0.05) affected by soil conservation measures. The non-conserved fields had significantly lower OC, total N, and infiltration rate; whereas higher bulk density as compared to the conserved fields with different conservation measures. However, no significant differences in bulk density were observed among the conservation methods. The field treated with 9-year old soil bund stabilized with tree lucerne or sole soil bund had significantly higher OC content than all other treatments. Fields having 6-year old soil bunds had lower OC and total N when compared to fields having 9-year old soil bunds irrespective of their method of stabilization. Fields with soil bunds stabilized with vetiver grass had the highest bund height and the lowest inter-terrace slope than fields with the remaining conservation measures. Barley grain and straw yields were significantly (P<0.05) greater in both the soil accumulation and loss zones of the conserved fields than the non-conserved (control) ones. In the accumulation zone, fields with the 9-year old soil bund stabilized with tree lucerne and those with the 9-year old sole soil bund gave higher grain yields (1878.5 kg ha-1 and 1712.5 kg ha-1, respectively) than fields having 9-year old soil bund stabilized with vetiver grass (1187 kg ha-1) and 6-year old soil bund stabilized with tree lucerne (1284.25 kg ha-1).

"AGRIS:US201500162864";"Microbial enzyme stoichiometry and nutrient limitation in US streams and rivers";"";"We analyzed water and sediment chemistry, catchment land cover, and microbial dehydrogenase (DHA) and extracellular enzymes activities (EEA) related to microbial C, N, P, and S acquisition in more than 2100 1st–10th order streams. The streams and their catchments represented gradients in water and sediment chemistry (C, N, P, S) and land cover (% forest, % wetland, % row crop agriculture) against which to compare biofilm and sediment DHA and EEA, and to estimate the extent of nutrient limitation in US streams and rivers. Water chemistry was significantly correlated with catchment land cover. Biofilm and sediment DHA and EEA were inversely correlated with water and sediment chemistry, and positively correlated with % forest. Canonical correlation analysis described two environmental gradients to which biofilm and sediment DHA and EEA were significantly correlated. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed a significant causal relationship between catchment land cover, chemistry, and biofilm and sediment EEA and DHA. Biofilm and sediment EEA was dominated by phenol oxidase and peroxidase, enzymes related to the degradation of recalcitrant C. However, the hydrolytic enzymes (those which hydrolyze glycoside, peptide, and ester bonds to release C, N, P, S) were better correlated with the chemical variables. This was reflected in the relative apportionment of enzyme activity toward C, N, P, and S acquisition. We compared molar stoichiometry of C, N, and P in water and sediment with biofilm and sediment ratios of GLYC:PEPT:PHOS to gauge how each measure of nutrient limitation compares with the others. Overall, water chemistry suggested many biofilms were P-limited and this was corroborated by allocation of microbial phosphatase activity. Sediments were found to be predominantly C and N-limited, and this was reflected in sediment EEA. We used these measures of nutrient limitation to assess the extent of N or P-limitation in streams and rivers of the conterminous United States and for nine ecoregions of interest to the US EPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA). Enzymatic stoichiometry provides a biological perspective on the influence of catchment scale anthropogenic disturbances resulting in an imbalance of nutrients being transported from those catchments. Enzyme activities represent the interface between microbial demands for, and environmental supplies of, C, N, and P, effectively linking ecological stoichiometric theory with the concept of threshold elemental ratios. The relative activities of the functional classes of extracellular enzymes provide both a measure of nutrient availability and ecosystem metabolism that may be used to assess large-scale phenomena such as regional impacts of climate change or anthropogenic disturbances.";"Hill, Brian H.

To provide context for natural resource and land conservation programs and policies, we quantify recent and long-term changes in population and housing, rural development rates, and land-use transitions involving forests for the eastern and western regions. Relative to the West, the East has a more evenly distributed population and has experienced greater population increases, rates of land development, and forestland conversion.

In their natural state these are generally waterlogged areas that may be regularly inundated for prolonged periods. Almost 4 million ha of these tidal lowlands have been reclaimed, partly by spontaneous settlers and partly by the government. While the reclaimed areas mainly consist of clay and especially the government schemes have a rational layout, they generally have a good potential for agricultural development, with a rice crop in the wet season and a second rice crop, or a dry food crop, in the dry season.For successful tidal lowland management there is, however, a need for an integrated approach, based on effective water management in combination with adequate farming systems technology and post-harvest activities. In order to investigate and promote such an integrated approach the programme Land and Water Management Tidal Lowlands (LWMTL) was implemented in the period 2004-06 in three pilot areas in the Musi delta, South Sumatra. It turned out that high yields of field dry husked rice (gabah) up to 8 t ha⁻¹ could be obtained. The paper gives an overview of the programme and the main results.

"AGRIS:US201600020584";"Land demand for ethanol production";"";"Several key indicators of the sustainability of biofuels are related to the land used to produce the feedstock. Most of the agronomic costs and energy use (fertilizers, herbicides, soil preparation, and harvesting) are more related to the cropped area than to the feedstock quantity produced; this is also the case of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO₂ and N₂O) and land use change (LUC) impacts, both direct (dLUC) and indirect (iLUC), socio-economic impacts (land tenure, land prices and traditional crop displacement), impacts on biodiversity and on the environment (soil, water and air). Today, biofuels use only a little more than 2% of the world arable land but if their use to displace fossil fuels increases, as indicated by some low carbon scenarios, the land demand for the production of feedstocks could become a constraint to the expansion. It is quite apparent that the biofuel yields, present and future, should be one of the main characteristics to be evaluated in the initial screening process. This work uses the cases of corn and sugarcane ethanol to draw some comparisons on the use of these biofuels to meet the targets of some of the International Energy Agency (IEA) biofuel use scenarios in terms of land demand and also will use some of the most important study results concerning the GHG emission reduction potential, including LUC and iLUC impacts, when meeting the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) of the European Union (EU) and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) of the USA. Some technology improvements will be considered including the integration of first and second generation technologies in the same site processing corn or sugarcane for ethanol. The results of the simulations indicated that the land demands for the 2030 projected ethanol production in the two alternatives seems not to give reasons for concern on a global scale, but are large enough to produce significant local impacts. The GHG abatement potential is strongly dependent on the biofuel alternative considered.";"Leal, Manoel Regis L.V.

Despite the popularity of the term in both business and government circles, limited attention has been paid to measuring and reporting eco-efficiency to government policy makers. Aggregate measures of eco-efficiency are needed, to complement existing measures and to help highlight important patterns in eco-efficiency data.This paper aims to develop aggregate measures of eco-efficiency for use by policy makers. Specifically, this paper provides a unique analysis by applying principal components analysis (PCA) to eco-efficiency indicators in New Zealand.This study reveals that New Zealand's overall eco-efficiency improved for two out of the five aggregate measures over the period 1994/95 to 1997/98. The worsening of the other aggregate measures reflects, among other things, the relatively poor performance of the primary production and related processing sectors. These results show PCA is an effective approach for aggregating eco-efficiency indicators and assisting decision makers by reducing redundancy in an eco-efficiency indicators matrix.";"Jollands, Nigel

In this study, we investigated this general statement for regulating and supporting services via an assessment of ecosystem functions: climate regulation via carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, water cycle and soil erosion regulation via water infiltration in soil, and support for primary production via soil chemical quality and water storage. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of land-cover composition and structure significantly alter ES metrics at two different scales. We surveyed 54 farms in two Amazonian regions of Brazil and Colombia and assessed land-cover composition and structure from remote sensing data (farm scale) from 1990 to 2007. Simple and well-established methods were used to characterize soil and vegetation from five points in each farm (plot scale). Most ES metrics were significantly correlated with land-use (plot scale) and land-cover (farm scale) classifications; however, spatial variability in inherent soil properties, alone or in interaction with land-use or land-cover changes, contributed greatly to variability in ES metrics. Carbon stock in above-ground plant biomass and water infiltration rate decreased from forest to pasture land covers, whereas soil chemical quality and plant-available water storage capacity increased. Land-cover classifications based on structure metrics explained significantly less ES metric variation than those based on composition metrics. Land-cover composition dynamics explained 45� % (P� <� 0.001) of ES metric variance, 15� % by itself and 30� % in interaction with inherent soil properties. This study describes how ES evolve with landscape changes, specifying the contribution of spatial variability in the physical environment and highlighting trade-offs and synergies among ES.";"Grimaldi, Michel

This study analyzes spatial and temporal changes in land use and forest cover patterns in a typical mountain forest area in Rize Forest Enterprise of the Northeastern part of Turkey. The area is investigated by evaluated the temporal changes of spatial structure of forest conditions through spatial analysis of forest cover type maps from 1984 and 2007 using GIS and FRAGSTATS[trade mark sign]. The quantative evidences presented here showed that there were drastic changes in the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use/forest cover. As an overall change between 1984 and 2007, there was a net decrease of 2.30% in total forested areas. On one hand, productive forest areas decreased 12,506 ha, on the other hand, degraded forest areas increased 14,805 ha. In examining the changes of crown closure and development stages of forest ecosystem during the study period, the forest stand area with medium crown closures increased. Regenerated area increased while the other development stages were left to grow to mature development stages in the period. These results regarding to crown closure and development stage showed that forest quality has increased but total forest areas decreased. This is partially due to out-migration of rural population in Rize and Çayeli towns. In terms of spatial configuration, analysis of the metrics revealed that landscape structure in Study area had changed substantially over the 23-year study period, resulting in fragmentation of the landscape as indicated by the large patch numbers and the smaller mean patch sizes due to heavy timber subtraction, illegal cutting, and uncontrolled stand treatments.";"Günlü, Alkan

The most important parameter affecting area designated as forest is the minimum crown cover which can be set between 10 and 30%. The choice will have implications for the amount of land available in a country for afforestation and reforestation activities within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM-AR). In this paper, we present an analysis of the regional differences in land availability for CDM-AR projects. We then examine how the choice of a high or low threshold value for crown cover will affect the area available for CDM activities and how the limitations imposed by this element of the definition compares to other factors that are likely to limit CDM activities. Results represent a global analysis that included all countries not included in Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol, and examined the effect on land availability of a range of crown cover thresholds ranging from 10-30%. Of the 140 Non-Annex One countries, 107 countries were found to have a potential for CDM-AR projects. Asia had the largest amount of combined area suitable for CDM-AR at the 10% crown cover threshold level. However, at 30%, South America had the greatest amount of land available, and a large change in available land area, which increased by almost five times compared to what was available at the 10% threshold. The area available in Africa increased by a factor of 5.5. Central America showed the largest increase, to almost 10 times more at the 30% threshold. By contrast, within Asia, the area increase was comparatively less, but still the area nearly doubled. Globally, a low threshold of 10% crown cover excluded almost 2/3 of the land identified that was eligible at 30%, over 5 million km². The spatial analyses showed not only the effects of the choice of the crown cover criterion, but also where the land was available for CDM activities within each country at different thresholds. Protected areas account for 10-20% of the CDM-AR eligible area in most countries.";"Zomer, Robert J.

Which factors determine small‐scale plant species richness of small linear grassland elements in a Japanese agricultural landscape? LOCATION: Shiga Prefecture, Japan. METHODS: Aerial photos from 1963, 1985, 1995 and 2008 were used to investigate landscape changes and to measure landscape structures within a typical agricultural landscape (~25 km²). Plant diversity was investigated in ten paddy levees and ten road verges in each of four traditional (barely any land cover alterations after 1963) and five modern (almost completely changed after 1985) sites. α‐diversity (mean number of species per plot) and γ‐diversity (total number of species) for all species, specialist and invasive species, respectively, were analysed in relation to site history types and landscape structures. Plot species richness was analysed in relation to site history type, patch age and width, proximity to forest and litter removal. RESULTS: In total, 204 plant species were found, 55 species unique to traditional sites and 13 unique to modern sites. α‐ and γ‐diversity of paddy levees and road verges was significantly higher in traditional sites. Number of specialist species on paddy levees and number of invasive species in road verges was also higher in traditional sites. Age was the strongest predictor of plot species richness on levees; older levees supported higher species richness than younger ones. Litter removal was the strongest predictor (positive effect) of plot species richness in road verges. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the colonization credit of new levees in modern sites is decreasing quite rapidly as species quickly establish, approaching almost the same richness values as in traditional sites. However, long continuity of traditional management is still one of the most important contributors to plant diversity and crucial for many species. But small grassland elements can still be of great significance for preserving and enhancing plant diversity in otherwise depleted landscapes, as long as they are managed and connected throughout the landscape.";"Jakobsson, Simon

The paper posits that this is due to the neglect of: (1) market opportunity as driving force for lowland use; and (2) the wider context within which lowlands are used as important modifier. The paper applies a regression-based decomposition framework to analyze the factors driving and modifying lowland use in West Africa. It uses community-level data from 1014 geo-referenced lowland units around four urban centers along an agro-ecological gradient in Cote d'Ivoire and Mali. Tobit models are used to explain the extent of lowland non-use (seasonal fallow), its diversity (in terms of rice and other crop cultivation) and its land use intensity (double cropping). Results highlight that proximity to urban markets is positively associated with the extent, diversity and intensity of lowland use. Lowland use is also associated with the agro-ecological gradient, lowland development and migrants. A common thread linking these variables is that they modify resource scarcity and therefore lowland use incentives. Market access is therefore a necessary but not sufficient condition for the intensification and diversification of lowland use.";"Erenstein, Olaf";"";"AgEcon Search";"AGRIS";"2006-12-31";"en";"";"";"";"011;MLI";"Conference Papers & Reports";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2016202434";"http://purl.umn.edu/25288";"";"";"";""
"AGRIS:US2016206996";"How Well Can Markets for Development Rights Work? Evaluating a Farmland Preservation Program";"";"Transferable development rights (TDRs) can be used as a local planning tool to preserve land for particular uses. TDRs separate ownership of the right to develop land from ownership of the land itself, creating a market in which the development rights can be bought and sold. Landowners who sell TDRs permanently preserve their land in an undeveloped state; those TDRs are then used to increase the density of development elsewhere. In this paper, we evaluate a TDR program for preserving farmland in Calvert County, Maryland. We evaluate the performance of the TDR market over the 23-year life of the program by looking at the number of transactions and TDRs sold and the level and dispersion of prices over time. We also look closely at the influence of the county government as a participant in the market. We locate the properties that have been preserved in the county as well as the subdivisions that have used TDRs to increase the density of development. We find that the program is achieving Calvert's farmland preservation goals and the TDR market appears to have operated efficiently, at least since 1993 when the county increased its role in the TDR market. At that time, the county began purchasing a small number of development rights each year at a fixed and known price and also began publishing a newsletter providing information about the program. These actions stabilized prices and appear to have bolstered participants' faith in the longevity of the program. Most of the agricultural properties preserved in the program are in areas less profitable for development. The demand for TDRs to increase density is greatest in subdivisions in the northern part of the county, closer to the major urban cities, and interestingly, in relatively rural areas with low-density zoning. There appears to be little demand for TDRs and the associated higher density in town centers or areas zoned with residential zoning.";"McConnell, Virginia D.

The model developed takes a system-oriented view of forest management, embracing both social and biophysical factors affecting deforestation. Social factors examined are socio-economic variables or elements that influence behaviour and decision-making choices at the household level. Biophysical factors are four sub-components that are considered major land uses namely, the paddy field component, rattan plantations, coffee plantations and forest stands. The model was applied in a case study located in Pasir District of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The site covers an area that includes a protected forest and a privately allocated timber license concession. Three village communities are examined in the case study. The SD model developed was applied to the case study focusing on three management policies or scenarios, which are based on access rights to the forest resources within the study area. Specifically, the property arrangements examined in each scenario are: Policy 1 – status quo (i.e. continue present property rights arrangements); Policy 2 – local communities manage the forest exclusively; and Policy 3 – collaborative management involving both local communities and a private company. Results from the model show that the third policy is the most viable option, and also lead to a win–win solution.";"Purnomo, Herry

The discrepancy between supply and demand of water resources is a key issue. In 2000–2006, the mean annual discharge of the Yellow River entering the delta was 13.2 billion m³, a reduction of 18.6 billion m³ compared with the 1980s, and 9 billion m³ less than in the 1990s. The water requirements of various sectors are increasing. Large amounts of water essential to maintain the health of the delta ecosystem have been diverted for other users. The lower river channel is shrinking and the threat of flooding is becoming severe. Moreover, water pollution is increasing to a serious level; the river mouth ecosystem is subject to degradation. Due to overall decreased flow into the delta, and almost no flow into the delta for much of the year except in wet periods, biodiversity is threatened and there has been degradation of the ecological environment. In view of the water scarcity and variation in water supply, particularly in the context of climate change, measures need to be taken to realise sustainable water use in the Yellow River Delta region. In view of the lack of a complete index system for sustainable utilisation of regional water resources in China, this paper examines the major countermeasures for sustainable water use in the region. A rational adjustment mechanism for water prices is needed. Adjustment of agricultural infrastructure and water saving need to be directed by water prices, and thus the reasonable exploitation of groundwater must also be directed by water prices. Participation of the public is to be encouraged, with the development of a water user association that will become involved in formulating water rights, water allocation and water prices. Decision-making, management and supervision of this association will be done in a democratic way to promote the social management of water saving.";"Zhang, Jianfeng

The ASTER GDEM covers land surfaces between 83° N and 83° S at a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second (approximately 30 m at the equator). As an improvement over Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) coverage, the ASTER GDEM will be a very useful product for many applications, such as relief analysis, hydrological studies, and radar interferometry. In this article, its absolute vertical accuracy in China was assessed at five study sites using ground control points (GCPs) from high-accuracy GPS benchmarks and also using a DEM-to-DEM comparison with the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) SRTM DEM Version 4.1. It is demonstrated that the vertical accuracy of ASTER GDEM is 26 m (root mean square error (RMSE)) against GPS-GCPs, while for the SRTM DEM it is 23 m. Furthermore, height differences in the GDEM-SRTM comparison appear to be overestimated in the areas with a south or southwest aspect in the five study areas. To a certain extent, the error can be attributed to variations in heights due to land-cover effects and undefined inland waterbodies. But the ASTER GDEM needs further error-mitigating improvements to meet the expected accuracy specification. However, as for its unprecedented detail, it is believed that the ASTER GDEM offers a major alternative in accessibility to high-quality elevation data.";"Li, Peng

The different FP types were allocated and described. Ravine and beam-type forest land are not used in agriculture. The age of FP on them ranges from 30-65 years. Scots pine and common birch mainly grow as I quality class (QC), English oak - like II QC. Ravine and beam-type forest plantations bond banks and protect the land from the water erosion. Oak stands are mainly of III-II, and linden ones - II, rarely I QC. Field protective forest plantations are on arable lands. English oaks of an average age being 50-60 years grow as II QC, and the common spruce of 25-35 years grow as II-I QC. Roadside forest plantations are presented by English oak, common spruce, drooping birch, predominantly of II-I QC, and poplar stand. There are a lot of oak and linden stands of the average age of 60-90 years in FP on the hillsides and watersheds, the QC varies from III to I.. 85-90 years old oakeries were found in coastal forest plantations, II-I QC. Bank-protection, soil protection Scots pine and Siberian larch forests grow as I-Ia QC. Scots pines are mainly 40-85 years old, with a relative density of 0.6-0.8. It is recommended to create FP of Scots pine, Siberian larch, and small-leaved linden trees in settlements. The healthy trees prevail in oak stands. After the summer drought of 2010, there is a massive shrinkage of birch and protection FP, where the number of dead birch trees reaches 25-30%. The number of dead spruce trees in protection plantations reaches 8-14%. Measures of soil protection from wind and water erosion and microclimate improvement provide for the creation of FP in the form of forest belts and small arrays, placed on the territory of the land-utilization, based on topography and soil conditions of the area.

Биогеоценологические исследования состояния и биологического разнообразия защитных лесных насаждений (ЛН) восточных районов Предволжья проводятся с 2010 г. Выделены и описаны разные типы ЛН. Приовражные и прибалочные лесные земли не используются в сельском хозяйстве. Возраст имеющихся на них ЛН составляет 30-65 лет. Культуры сосны обыкновенной, березы бородавчатой произрастают преимущественно по I классу бонитета (КБ), дуба черешчатого - по II КБ. Овражно-балочные ЛН выполняют функцию скрепления берегов и защищают земли от водной эрозии. Дубовые древостои имеют III-II, липовые - II, реже I КБ. Полезащитные лесные полосы находятся на пахотных землях. Культуры дуба черешчатого средним возрастом 50-60 лет произрастают по II КБ, а ели европейской 25-35-летнего возраста - по II-I КБ. Придорожные лесные полосы представлены культурами дуба черешчатого, ели европейской, березы повислой, преимущественно II-I КБ, и тополевником разнотравным. В ЛН на склонах холмов и водоразделов преобладают дубовые и липовые экосистемы возрастом 60-90 лет, КБ варьирует от III до I. В прибрежных лесных насаждениях выявлены дубняки 85-90-летнего возраста, II-I КБ. Водоохранные, почвозащитные леса из сосны обыкновенной и лиственницы сибирской произрастают по I-Iа КБ. Культуры сосны - 40-85 летнего возраста с относительной полнотой 0,6-0,8. В населенных пунктах рекомендуется создавать ЛН сосны обыкновенной, лиственницы сибирской, липы мелколистной. В обследованных дубовых насаждениях превалируют здоровые деревья. После засухи лета 2010 г. наблюдается массовое усыхание березняков в защитных ЛН, где количество сухостойных деревьев березы достигает 25-30%. Доля сухостоя в ельниках полезащитных полос достигает 8-14%. Мероприятия по защите почвы от ветровой и водной эрозии и улучшению микроклимата предусматривают создание системы ЛН в виде лесных полос и небольших массивов, размещенных по территории землепользования с учетом рельефа и почвенных условий местности.";"Sabirov, A.T.

This review considers two groups of species that do not have strict protection but are recognised within âdevelopment controlâ (the process that regulates the planning of land use and new buildings), namely Annex II species of the Habitats Directive (HD) and Species of Principal Importance identified under UK legislation and policy. A critical point often forgotten by the HD's detractors is that Annex II is not only a list of species that require protection but also a list of species that represent criteria for the designation of protected sites. It is not feasible for all threatened species to be protected due to administrative and legal ramifications, so the subset of species listed need to have wider merit as umbrella species. The selection of widespread species on Annex II results in the creation of a better network of Special Areas of Conservation than if geographically localised or endemic species are used, and benefits a suite of rare and scarce species beyond those named in Annex II. Species of Principal Importance enable recognition of invertebrates in the UK planning system even though many of them are not directly threatened with national loss. Given the intense scrutiny to which nature conservation legislation is exposed, it is important for critics to understand the function of legislation and its application in the sociopolitical arena.";"Hopkins, Graham W.

"AGRIS:US201400076593";"Influence of island geography, age and landscape on species composition in different animal groups";"";"Aim To study the importance of ecological and geographical factors in explaining arthropod species composition on islands. Location The Aeolian Islands, a volcanic archipelago in the central Mediterranean, near Sicily. Methods The influence of island area, age, distance to the mainland, distance to the nearest island and land cover categories on species composition of arthropod groups was analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The use of multiple animal groups in the same archipelago allowed the development of two complementary approaches based on CCA - a ‘taxon-focused' approach and an ‘island-focused' approach - to elucidate, respectively, how different taxa respond to the same environmental factors, and which factors are mainly responsible for the composition of the faunas in different locations. Results Island area was an important factor in explaining species composition in Chilopoda, Orthoptera and Tenebrionidae. Distance to the mainland was important mainly for Carabidae. Distance to the closest island was important for many groups. By contrast, island age exerted a significant influence only on the species composition of Orthoptera. Various groups were influenced by a combination of broad-leaved forest and natural grassland. Main conclusions The example of the arthropods of the Aeolian Islands indicates that the influence of a given island characteristic on species composition varies among groups, although measures of inter-island isolation were typically more important for taxa than isolation from the mainland source. This suggests that colonization of islands may occur mostly by stepping-stone dispersal.";"Fattorini, Simone";"";"Wiley-Blackwell";"AGRIS";"2011-12-31";"en";"land cover";"";"Land Use, Management & Investment";"";"Journal Articles & Books";"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201400076593";"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02486.x";"";"";"";"1318-1329"

Landcare involves thousands of Australians working together in locally based groups, tackling problems of common concern. Government and community are now looking to 'scale up' the Landcare idea to a regional level. State and territory governments have moved to create regional (often watershed-based) frameworks for land management planning and resource conservation, in accordance with the concept of integrated watershed management. Growing out of the success of community involvement in Landcare, many of these approaches involve the community. However scaling up of the Landcare idea introduces problems of both time and space. There have been a number of problems experienced in the implementation of Landcare and integrated watershed management. These problems include the equitable delineation of membership on decision-making bodies; the raising of sufficient funds for program implementation; and the coordination of a diversity of governmental layers, planning processes and management programs.

"AGRIS:US201400171633";"Conflict resolution through collaboration: Preconditions and limitations in forest and nature conservation controversies";"";"Increasing competition over the world's forest resources will likely aggravate conflict, though conflict should not be seen as bad per se. As the challenge is to develop institutions and practices capable of handling conflict constructively, various collaborative approaches involving disputing actors are evolving worldwide. In Sweden, most such approaches pertain to protected areas and few involve commercial forestry. The reasons for the rise of different approaches to collaboration in protected areas and commercially managed forest lands are explored through a comparison of two conflicts embedded in different management regimes. The study suggests that actor interdependence is critical to how collaboration evolves. Interdependence is in turn affected by the institutions, discourses, and economic context in which the process is embedded. When contextual factors are unfavourable, power relations too unequal, and interdependencies between dominant and subordinated actors weak, the prospects for collaboration are slim. In an enabling context, in contrast, mobilization may alter power relations and interdependencies, making collaboration possible. This study suggests that the low occurrence of collaborative land use planning in many parts of Sweden may be related to the presence of strong economic land use interests, un-successful mobilization of weaker parties, and absence of enabling institutional and discursive factors.";"Zachrisson, Anna
